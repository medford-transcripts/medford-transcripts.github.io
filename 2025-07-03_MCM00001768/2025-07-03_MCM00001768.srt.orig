1
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:01,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds good.

2
00:00:01,371 --> 00:00:01,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

3
00:00:02,552 --> 00:00:03,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome, everybody.

4
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all so much for being here.

5
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:08,833
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we have some folks outside in the hallway as well.

6
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, everybody, for coming out in person and on Zoom.

7
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:20,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight is a Q&A on the corridors zoning proposal.

8
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:27,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Before I introduce Alicia and Emily, I just want to quickly place this in the context of where this occurs in the citywide

9
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:31,001
[SPEAKER_18]: zoning overhaul that we have been pursuing for more than a year now.

10
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:43,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Earlier in this process, we workshopped, reviewed, held public hearings on, and have ordained several zoning proposals already, including phase one updates.

11
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:49,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Mystic Avenue Corridor District, Salem Street Corridor District, and Green Score.

12
00:00:49,034 --> 00:01:00,180
[SPEAKER_18]: The other corridor's proposal, which we'll be talking about tonight, is one of several zoning proposals that are currently working their way through the proposal and discussion pipeline.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:10,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Other current proposals include West Medford Square, Medford Square, residential zoning, and a proposal for Tufts Institutional Zoning.

14
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:25,526
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to be clear the purpose of tonight is to present on and get your feedback and questions and concerns on the other corridors proposal so the focus of tonight will not be on the other proposals that I just mentioned we're going to be focusing on the corridors proposal

15
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:34,755
[SPEAKER_18]: as advertised, because at this point in the process, this corridor's proposal is still being workshopped by the Planning and Permanent Committee.

16
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:44,345
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a really valuable and important time for us to be getting your feedback on it and to be hearing your questions and your concerns while it is still in development.

17
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:46,487
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you again for being here.

18
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,249
[SPEAKER_18]: We're looking forward to hearing your questions and comments.

19
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,831
[SPEAKER_18]: With that, I forgot to introduce myself.

20
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:54,093
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Kit Collins, Vice President of the City Council.

21
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:59,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm the Chair of the Planning and Permanent Committee, which is the committee in which all of our zoning proposals originate.

22
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:16,412
[SPEAKER_18]: And with me up here is Director Hunt of the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Department, and Emily Innes of Innes Associates, which is a zoning consultant that has been working with the City Council and the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office

23
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:21,315
[SPEAKER_18]: for quite a long time now on all of these zoning proposals and on other projects in the city.

24
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Before that, I'll pass it off to Alicia.

25
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that Councillor Collins covered basically everything, and Emily will be presenting the zoning.

27
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:41,609
[SPEAKER_09]: But just for those who aren't aware, the City of Medford has an Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

28
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:46,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we are an office of 10, and we do professional planning,

29
00:02:47,018 --> 00:03:02,443
[SPEAKER_09]: housing work, we manage the Community Development Block Grant, the Community Preservation Act money, we have economic development staff, we have climate staff, we do open space plans and environmental planning, and we staff a lot of boards and commissions.

30
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:08,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So several of us are professional planners, and so we are advising on this project.

31
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:12,947
[SPEAKER_09]: We also, by law, are technical advisors to the Community Development Board.

32
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:29,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the legal process to adopt zoning in Medford, as in Massachusetts, is that if a zoning proposal goes to the City Council, they then must refer it to the Community Development Board, which in some cities is called the Planning Board, for their professional opinions.

33
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,434
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Planning Board has opinions.

34
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,399
[SPEAKER_09]: and then they make recommendations to the city council on that zoning.

35
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,860
[SPEAKER_09]: And they do that through a public hearing process.

36
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:43,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So this topic has not yet entered the CD board.

37
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:50,644
[SPEAKER_09]: We're presenting, we're getting feedback from you before it is a formal proposal and before the public hearing process starts.

38
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:57,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now we have other proposals that are in the public hearing process that have opened public hearings right now.

39
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:05,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And then those recommendations go to the city council and the city council votes on the zoning for the city of Medford.

40
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:10,713
[SPEAKER_09]: In order to do this project, it's a very large project around rezoning in the city.

41
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:14,535
[SPEAKER_09]: We have engaged a planning and zoning consultants.

42
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:18,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is Emily Innes of Innes Associates and she and her team are here.

43
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:23,560
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did want to mention is those of you in the room have noticed but so people on zoom are aware

44
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,084
[SPEAKER_09]: We have staff both from my office and Emily's office in the hallway with big maps.

45
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:41,573
[SPEAKER_09]: If you find that you really want to talk one-on-one with somebody or go into depth or talk about a very specific parcel pointing to a map, then we encourage you to go out there and talk to them.

46
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:43,374
[SPEAKER_09]: They're collecting this information.

47
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:44,515
[SPEAKER_09]: They have sticky notes.

48
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,756
[SPEAKER_09]: They can write stuff down.

49
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,097
[SPEAKER_09]: You can write stuff down.

50
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,578
[SPEAKER_09]: and collect that information for us.

51
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,261
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're at home and you're like, gee, I wish I could do that, you can come over here.

52
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:59,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Tufts has kindly provided parking, that information is on the city event.

53
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,693
[SPEAKER_09]: events calendar, if you want to come over and talk to the staff in the hallway.

54
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:10,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And then here in the room, Emily is going to do a presentation this evening, and then we're going to do Q&A.

55
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:16,062
[SPEAKER_09]: We have both the questions from people in the audience and then on Zoom.

56
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:19,545
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have turned on the Q&A function on Zoom.

57
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:24,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So people on Zoom could enter comments, opinions, or questions.

58
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:35,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to sort of say, I agree with that opinion on Zoom, you can upvote it, and then we can just see that multiple people have checked that question or that comment.

59
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:45,015
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we'll try and go back and forth, as you've often seen in public hearings or the city council, where we go back and forth between the in-person and the online questions.

60
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:48,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think with that, I'm gonna turn it over to Emily, and Emily's gonna present from the podium.

61
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,775
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my cue to stand up and come over here.

62
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:55,277
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you all hear me through this mic?

63
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:55,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.

64
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

65
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me get rid of the camera control.

66
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me share the content.

67
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:02,604
[SPEAKER_19]: And it works.

68
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:03,265
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.

69
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:06,548
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you all for being here tonight.

70
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:10,372
[SPEAKER_19]: And that includes the people who are in the room now and the people who are online.

71
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:12,575
[SPEAKER_19]: We really appreciate you being here.

72
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:18,698
[SPEAKER_19]: I am going to quickly actually walk through the, we've just done the introductions.

73
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:30,945
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to walk through the process timeline and where we are to date, the opportunities for public comments, a little bit of setting the context of the analysis that we've done to date and some of the other work.

74
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:34,428
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we're really focusing, as I said, on the other corridors.

75
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:41,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we're doing this geography by geography, it's really important that we hear the comments on the geography that we're working on today.

76
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:47,677
[SPEAKER_19]: However, for those of you in the room who passed by, there is a board.

77
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:54,722
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have comments on some of the other districts that we've been talking about, there's a board that you can put those comments on out there.

78
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:56,604
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want to lose those thoughts.

79
00:06:56,904 --> 00:07:00,887
[SPEAKER_19]: We just want to make absolutely certain that we hear about the other corridors today.

80
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:04,490
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, as Alicia said, my team is there with the big maps.

81
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,753
[SPEAKER_19]: They're also there with the interactive map to show you how to use it.

82
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,815
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be talking about that a little bit later.

83
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:23,167
[SPEAKER_19]: So the introduction, why we've done this for those of you who have been participating in other parts of the process, you're going to recognize the first set of slides, but we are aware that people are sometimes joining us for the very first time.

84
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:26,469
[SPEAKER_19]: So we want to make sure that they're starting from the same base.

85
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:36,797
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are doing, we are working with the city on this rezoning process because this comes out of the recommendations from the comprehensive plan, which was adopted in 2023.

86
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:44,766
[SPEAKER_19]: There are also zoning related recommendations in the Medford climate action and adaptation plan.

87
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:55,759
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we're taking those into account as well and trying to merge all of these goals together as we look at the zoning so this is this the comprehensive bait plan.

88
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,841
[SPEAKER_19]: is usually the basis for zoning changes.

89
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:04,326
[SPEAKER_19]: And in fact zoning changes are often the first thing that comes out of the comprehensive plan process.

90
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:12,012
[SPEAKER_19]: I will say that the city has actually been working on this longer they started a recent modification process, I think back in 2020.

91
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:17,997
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that finished about the same time the comprehensive plan did within the same couple of months,

92
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:30,840
[SPEAKER_19]: that mostly looked at technical errors, best practices, making sure that everything was up to date, whereas this is taking the recommendations of the comprehensive plan and evaluating them and moving them forward.

93
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,600
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the comprehensive plan, there was a future land use map.

94
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,021
[SPEAKER_19]: This is where the terminology squares, quarters and neighborhoods comes from.

95
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:42,442
[SPEAKER_19]: And the plan is on the city's website.

96
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:47,423
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is what when we taught what the reason we are talking about plans, quarters and squares,

97
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:50,964
[SPEAKER_19]: and neighborhoods is because it came from this map.

98
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:54,424
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's the basis for why we're here.

99
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:57,905
[SPEAKER_19]: The process for approval, Alicia already went over it.

100
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,506
[SPEAKER_19]: City council, that's the planning and permitting portion of the city council.

101
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,446
[SPEAKER_19]: We present the topic to them.

102
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:09,547
[SPEAKER_19]: We go back and forth, you know, get their feedback, go back to our office, do iterations.

103
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:14,748
[SPEAKER_19]: We have weekly calls with city staffs and representatives from the planning and permitting council.

104
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:24,772
[SPEAKER_19]: At some point planning and permittees and says look this is ready to go to CDB refers it up to City Council, City Council refers it to the Community Development Board.

105
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:29,794
[SPEAKER_19]: They hold a public hearing so some of you may have been participants in those public hearings.

106
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:38,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Once they feel that they're ready to vote on the topic they send it back to the City Council with recommendations, and the City Council has a final vote on the zoning.

107
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:49,752
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the meetings just for March, we had ended up with so many meetings I think we're on our last night was our 26 meeting with the planning and permitting Council committee.

108
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:55,259
[SPEAKER_19]: So we took some of them off because it was getting too hard to read so we've got two coming up one June 11.

109
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:04,587
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be talking about the Tufts institutional district, and we'll be talking about parking, and then June 25 is tentatively scheduled for Wellington.

110
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:15,155
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the community development board meetings that we've been doing we've got one coming up now it still says residential districts squares, but at you should have been taken out.

111
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,038
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's June 4 that's next Wednesday.

112
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,331
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's also the public meetings that we've been holding.

113
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:35,420
[SPEAKER_19]: And so since March the ones that have been here we did squares on May 8, we're here today for the other quarters, and then June 9, we're going to be talking about parking and transportation demand management.

114
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,463
[SPEAKER_19]: In this meeting, we're going to show you some recommendations just for discussion.

115
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:49,150
[SPEAKER_19]: At the parking meeting, we are not showing recommendations as such, where that's really an opening listening session.

116
00:10:49,210 --> 00:11:00,839
[SPEAKER_19]: So anybody who has concerns about parking, I think we're going to present some information to frame the discussion, but we want to start out by doing some in-depth listening about parking.

117
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,481
[SPEAKER_19]: So just to let you know what's coming up.

118
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:09,742
[SPEAKER_19]: And then because we were asked to also show it in the table with the next things, a little bit easier to read than the other one.

119
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:18,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Community Development Board next week, public meeting on the 9th, which is a Monday for parking and transportation demand management.

120
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:24,672
[SPEAKER_19]: And then June 11th for the Institutional District for Tufts.

121
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:30,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It just says that the parking meeting, the locations TBD, that will be at the Medford Public Library.

122
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:38,908
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so we have been working on a lot of different districts within the city.

123
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:42,150
[SPEAKER_19]: The mystic Avenue quarter has been approved.

124
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,854
[SPEAKER_19]: The Salem street neighborhood quarter has been approved.

125
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,956
[SPEAKER_19]: The green score has been approved.

126
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:59,947
[SPEAKER_19]: We're working on several now one is the residential districts and I recognize some faces in the audience and some names online from people who've been involved with that so welcome.

127
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:07,496
[SPEAKER_19]: We are also working on the commercial or the mixed use districts and so I mentioned Salem and Mystic Avenue.

128
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Those two corridors are outlined in black because they have been approved.

129
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:14,817
[SPEAKER_19]: We've talked about Medford Square and West Medford Square.

130
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:18,658
[SPEAKER_19]: And now we're talking about the other corridors.

131
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:21,959
[SPEAKER_19]: And so you're going to see a more in depth map on those.

132
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:27,400
[SPEAKER_19]: But when you put them together, yes, I know that's why they're printed outside.

133
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,081
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're if you're online, you're probably sitting right here.

134
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,161
[SPEAKER_19]: But the maps are printed outside.

135
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:36,242
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm going to tell you about the interactive map so you can zoom in.

136
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:37,703
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I ask you a question?

137
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:38,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

138
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:45,248
[SPEAKER_01]: This, I was supposed to have a Zoom meeting tonight for the work being done on Main Street between Stearns and Stanley.

139
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this have anything to do with that?

140
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,330
[SPEAKER_01]: How come I can't get on Zoom?

141
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,911
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of scam is this?

142
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:56,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of us on the street can't get on Zoom to get this meeting that's already started.

143
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:59,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go, I'll go out in the hallway and see.

144
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:02,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we turn the lights down?

145
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:04,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a way of doing that?

146
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:11,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, we will get the lights turned down.

147
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:14,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that better?

148
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:16,419
[SPEAKER_06]: A little more.

149
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:24,665
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit more?

150
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:33,392
[SPEAKER_19]: There we go.

151
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,053
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that better?

152
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:34,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, great.

153
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:36,255
[SPEAKER_19]: In that case, let me just,

154
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:39,878
[SPEAKER_19]: pop back so you can see.

155
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:41,919
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was the residential district.

156
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Now you can see it a little bit more clearly.

157
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,461
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the commercial framework.

158
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:54,144
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, we have these printed outside and we also have the interactive map outside so people can learn how to use it.

159
00:13:54,164 --> 00:13:56,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that you can utilize online?

160
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these things online?

161
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:58,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, they are.

162
00:13:58,485 --> 00:13:59,046
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

163
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:02,527
[SPEAKER_19]: So the city has a website specific for this project.

164
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:05,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything we do is posted to that website.

165
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:11,795
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a thing that we could get if we could get that actual website if you go on the city, it's very confusing.

166
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:17,762
[SPEAKER_19]: So when Alicia comes back, we usually put those in the chat of every meeting, so it'll be there.

167
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:22,607
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also about to give you the link to the interactive map that's coming up.

168
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:23,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

169
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,568
[SPEAKER_19]: You're very welcome.

170
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:40,571
[SPEAKER_19]: So then when you put those areas together, this is one of the things we've been hearing from people is because up until now, we've been working in isolation in these areas, it's been hard to understand the relationship.

171
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:48,193
[SPEAKER_19]: So we now have a map that shows what we've done, what we're talking about, what we've been talking about, and what we're talking about now.

172
00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:54,136
[SPEAKER_19]: But what I'm going to do for you in a minute is I'm going to break down the corridors so we can zoom into those.

173
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:58,258
[SPEAKER_19]: First, however, I'm going to tell you about the interactive map.

174
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:05,743
[SPEAKER_19]: So we were getting a lot of questions about, you know, how does this affect my parcel or my property?

175
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,804
[SPEAKER_19]: What district am I in now?

176
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,345
[SPEAKER_19]: What district will I be in?

177
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:11,186
[SPEAKER_19]: What does that mean?

178
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:18,208
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've created an online interactive map where you can go in and zoom into specific properties.

179
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,269
[SPEAKER_19]: You can put layers on, you can put filters on.

180
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Jimmy is actually, for those of you who are in the room, Jimmy is outside in the hall.

181
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:31,113
[SPEAKER_19]: He has his laptop up and he is happy to show everybody how to use it.

182
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:36,335
[SPEAKER_19]: For those of you who have not used interactive maps before, sometimes it's not as intuitive.

183
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:41,942
[SPEAKER_19]: There are also instructions on the page but it's sometimes it's nice to have somebody do it for you.

184
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:48,189
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the link and this is the QR code to get to that interactive map.

185
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:55,258
[SPEAKER_19]: That link is also on the city's website but what we've tried to do is put the layers and the filters on

186
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:59,239
[SPEAKER_19]: that answer some of the questions that we've heard by providing data.

187
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,859
[SPEAKER_19]: It's continually being updated.

188
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,901
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you ask for something, a question today, and we know that we can put the data up there, then we will modify that.

189
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:20,382
[SPEAKER_19]: And in the opening page, it will say when it was last updated, but know that it is being updated in response to these public conversations.

190
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:24,923
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's worth checking back every now and then to see what else has been added.

191
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:32,352
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that, I'm going to start with the other quarters and I can put the QR code back up at the end of the presentation.

192
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:41,521
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking at Boston Ave, Main Street, Broadway, Harvard Street, High Street in Medford West, and Boston Avenue in Medford West.

193
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:49,254
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the current zoning map, barring the changes that were just made for mystic and Salem.

194
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:52,696
[SPEAKER_19]: These were the districts that existed when we first started.

195
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:58,340
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the map of the quarters that we're looking at the current zoning.

196
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:08,249
[SPEAKER_19]: and I can zoom in so we can see them a little bit more clearly and again they're all printed out there and they will all be on the website if they're not there now.

197
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:20,781
[SPEAKER_19]: So the existing zoning districts along the corridor are the C-1 which is the commercial one, apartment one, industrial, office two, general residential and a little bit of single family one.

198
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:32,710
[SPEAKER_19]: The commercial one, so your existing zoning allows or governs your height and other dimensional standards by use.

199
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,792
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's a little bit different from what we've been talking about.

200
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:40,676
[SPEAKER_19]: So right now in commercial one, a residential building can be six stories by right.

201
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:43,578
[SPEAKER_19]: By right means that you can get a building permit to do it.

202
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:49,222
[SPEAKER_19]: You go to the building inspector and you say, I'm allowed to do this by right and you,

203
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:51,664
[SPEAKER_19]: provide the application.

204
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:54,206
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you need all the requirements, you're allowed to do it.

205
00:17:54,846 --> 00:18:00,030
[SPEAKER_19]: So residential building by right six commercial building by right six stories.

206
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:08,517
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there's a category called other permitted structures, which is 15 stories by right, four stories or six commercial.

207
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:14,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Four stories for the commercial, six for the residential, and then other permitted structures by right.

208
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:19,351
[SPEAKER_19]: And how you know whether or not something is permitted is by going to what's called the table of uses.

209
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:25,658
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't have it on here because frankly in a presentation like that it would be unreadable but it is in your zoning ordinance.

210
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:42,871
[SPEAKER_19]: apartment one, so that's the orange color the darker orange color that you're seeing their commercial is a light pink apartment one allows three stories by right for residential building commercial building is not allowed so there's no height restriction because it's not actually allowed.

211
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:49,356
[SPEAKER_19]: industrial is the gray you've got a very little bit of gray sort of down towards the Broadway area.

212
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:57,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Other permitted structures so they don't they don't separate out residential commercial it's just other permitted structures, two stories by right.

213
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Office two is that bright pink.

214
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:04,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Other permitted structures are six stories by right.

215
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:10,417
[SPEAKER_19]: General residential is a single unit dwelling, a two unit dwelling or an ADU.

216
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:16,761
[SPEAKER_19]: An ADU is an accessory dwelling unit and state law changed fairly recently on those.

217
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:20,424
[SPEAKER_19]: So that has been another topic that we've discussed earlier.

218
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:23,826
[SPEAKER_19]: in this process, and we'll be discussing again.

219
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:28,370
[SPEAKER_19]: It hasn't yet gone to the Community Development Board, so we haven't discussed it with them.

220
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:35,395
[SPEAKER_19]: General residential, that's the sort of lighter orange or lighter yellow, depending on how you read colors.

221
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:39,157
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a single unit dwelling, a two unit, and an ADU.

222
00:19:39,218 --> 00:19:39,978
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I mentioned that.

223
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:42,540
[SPEAKER_19]: And then single family one is the lightest yellow.

224
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,103
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a single unit dwelling or an accessory dwelling unit.

225
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:47,824
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what you have now.

226
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:54,128
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is looking at the other quarters in the context of the full map.

227
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:59,032
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're going to see that we're looking at five different districts here.

228
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,414
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm going to zoom in so you can see them.

229
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:04,936
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have three mixed use districts.

230
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:07,778
[SPEAKER_19]: We have an institutional district for Tufts University.

231
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:10,480
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to be talking about that later in June.

232
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:14,243
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't yet come up with any sort of ideas for it.

233
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:17,886
[SPEAKER_19]: But we know that we had a public meeting about it already.

234
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:28,898
[SPEAKER_19]: We've talked to Tufts a little bit about it already we need to come through and come up with some recommendations, but we know roughly where the boundaries are going to be so we've put it on here.

235
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:38,309
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have urban residential to so our discussion today for the other quarters are the three mixed use districts and the urban residential to.

236
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:52,587
[SPEAKER_19]: So mixed use one be it says small to mid scale for stories by right so with that building permit, and one by incentives zoning so incentives zoning is the ability for a developer to come in and say,

237
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,883
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like an extra story up to the limit that's allowed in that district.

238
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:02,967
[SPEAKER_19]: And in exchange, I'm going to do something from this menu of incentives.

239
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:10,251
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have, if you've looked at the Mystic Avenue, or if you looked at the Salem, we have a menu of incentives.

240
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,653
[SPEAKER_19]: It starts with different levels of affordable housing.

241
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:15,535
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also other public benefits in there.

242
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:26,219
[SPEAKER_19]: And so the idea is in exchange for affordable housing or in exchange for other public benefits or a mix of those, the developer would get an extra story in 1B.

243
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,681
[SPEAKER_19]: Mixed-use 2A and 2B, they differ by story level.

244
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:37,203
[SPEAKER_19]: So mixed-use 2A is five stories by right, two incentive zoning stories.

245
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Mixed-use 2B is two stories by right,

246
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:44,889
[SPEAKER_19]: two incentive zone stories.

247
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:54,374
[SPEAKER_19]: And then urban residential two is the same as the urban residential two that any of you have been following the neighborhood and urban residential districts.

248
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:55,734
[SPEAKER_19]: They haven't made any changes.

249
00:21:56,175 --> 00:22:04,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Townhouse, three unit dwelling, multiplex, which is four to six units on one lot, multiple unit dwelling, which is over six units.

250
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,120
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a three story maximum.

251
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:08,281
[SPEAKER_19]: We have,

252
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:15,886
[SPEAKER_19]: discussed in-house, but have not yet discussed with the Community Development Board because of the last meeting that we had.

253
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:21,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Possibly adding a one-story incentive zone, but that's for the neighborhood discussion.

254
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,273
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just showing you today what Urban Residential 2 looks like.

255
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:31,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Then an accessory dwelling unit, but only for one, two, or three-unit dwellings.

256
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:40,970
[SPEAKER_19]: So urban residential 2 is really part of that discussion about the neighborhood districts, but we wanted to show you the places and hear where that fits within the corridors.

257
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:48,904
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the things that we've been hearing in these meetings is how does this work?

258
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,964
[SPEAKER_19]: How does this look on the street?

259
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:55,806
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we're doing is we're doing street sections and building sections.

260
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:59,047
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of our clients likes to talk about it.

261
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:04,909
[SPEAKER_19]: The section is basically you've baked a nice cake of the district and you're slicing it in half.

262
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:06,931
[SPEAKER_19]: And now you can see all of the layers.

263
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:11,656
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what we're showing you is the layers of the cake on both sides of the street.

264
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:15,440
[SPEAKER_19]: So the top for each of the ones I'm about to show you are the existing.

265
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,282
[SPEAKER_19]: The bottom is the proposed.

266
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:21,787
[SPEAKER_19]: And what we're doing is we're cutting along that red line from left to right.

267
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:27,253
[SPEAKER_19]: So the left side of the buildings in the diagram is the left side of the line.

268
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:55,118
[SPEAKER_19]: the right side of the buildings goes to the right side of the diagram and you can kind of see that with the existing you see that existing three and a half story building, then there's a parking lot you can follow that on the red line, then there's another one story building, then there's the street section you can see it with the cars, and then you see a three story building and you see the parking behind the building so if you kind of follow that top line along the red line, you can you can see how they relate to each other and it's the same

269
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:58,500
[SPEAKER_19]: structure for each of the images that I'm going to show you.

270
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,702
[SPEAKER_19]: So on the proposed, we're following the same thing.

271
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:09,007
[SPEAKER_19]: If you see those buildings on that sort of grayish-brown color, if we were going to be fancy interior design, we'd probably call it grige.

272
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:13,730
[SPEAKER_19]: The gray, the grige color is the existing buildings.

273
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:21,936
[SPEAKER_19]: When you see the yellow and the red, or in some cases white, that is what we're showing as could happen

274
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:24,990
[SPEAKER_19]: under the new zoning in terms of height.

275
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:30,115
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, for those of you who can see clearly, looks like it's on there.

276
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:31,196
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little bit light.

277
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:38,502
[SPEAKER_19]: In the proposed, you'll also see a diagonal line with a very, very light gray shade on it.

278
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:40,023
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a shadow study.

279
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:49,812
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things that we're doing is looking at how the new buildings would affect the existing buildings in terms of sunlight hitting the building and with the shadow

280
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,103
[SPEAKER_19]: fall on the existing building.

281
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,224
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's part of these.

282
00:24:53,964 --> 00:25:00,228
[SPEAKER_19]: Those of you who have seen other of these presentations, we've shown this before, but again, I wanted to explain the mechanism.

283
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:05,731
[SPEAKER_19]: So in this case, what you're seeing is that new building, red means commercial.

284
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:13,176
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're seeing ground floor commercial, and you're seeing the yellow buildings above, the yellow floors above are residential.

285
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:19,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Then on the building on the right, that now on the existing, it's only three stories.

286
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:25,045
[SPEAKER_19]: On the proposed, it's three stories, but it's got two outlined white stories on there.

287
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:28,628
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be the incentive zoning that would be allowed.

288
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:34,052
[SPEAKER_19]: In this case, three stories as a right, it has that option for an incentive on top of it.

289
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:38,956
[SPEAKER_19]: Then gray, we're going to see some buildings that have gray stories and then that is parking.

290
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:44,382
[SPEAKER_19]: So this gives you a sense of how something might be built in one of the areas.

291
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:48,186
[SPEAKER_19]: In this case, this is along Main Street on that corner.

292
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,890
[SPEAKER_19]: So here's another zoning section.

293
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:55,635
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got Tufts Park, Main Street, and then you've got two one-story buildings.

294
00:25:56,696 --> 00:26:00,339
[SPEAKER_19]: in the proposed, this is one of the higher residential.

295
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:07,503
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure why we don't put the which one it is on here, but you can tell by the number of stories, it's probably mixed to beat.

296
00:26:08,424 --> 00:26:10,686
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can see commercial on the ground floor.

297
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:15,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Next to that to the right of the commercial, you can see underground parking.

298
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:21,593
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you can see the levels of residential and the possible incentive above that.

299
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:32,705
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things to remember, because in every community I work in, people are very concerned about height as they should be and about development volume as they should be.

300
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:34,788
[SPEAKER_19]: We're showing height here.

301
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:39,313
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the questions that we've heard in the neighborhood zoning discussion is

302
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:44,356
[SPEAKER_19]: if you have a lot size of X, what can you fit on it?

303
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:55,480
[SPEAKER_19]: So our team back in the office is actually working on another round of analyses that would show you which building types could fit on which lot sizes.

304
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:06,424
[SPEAKER_19]: So here we've been focused on height because we've been hearing a lot of concern about height and we want to show that, but we also want to show in this next iteration of diagrams and drawings

305
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:25,588
[SPEAKER_19]: setbacks which affect it, open space requirements or green score requirements, depending on which district we're talking about, pervious surface requirements, parking requirements, all of those affect what we call the ground plane or the footprint of a lot.

306
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:30,949
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you think of this, don't want to walk too far away from the mic, if you think of this as being a parcel,

307
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:39,813
[SPEAKER_19]: What happens is if I have setbacks, I offset from each side, I come in a few inches from each side of my parcel here.

308
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:46,617
[SPEAKER_19]: That gives me another rectangle because I've got a front setback, I've got side setbacks, I've got a rear setback.

309
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:52,199
[SPEAKER_19]: That gives me what we call the building footprint or the building envelope rather.

310
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,762
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where you can put your building, your parking, your required green space, etc.

311
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:05,507
[SPEAKER_19]: surface parking, building footprint, some of the other requirements we've talked about.

312
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,678
[SPEAKER_19]: all serve to shorten the amount of space that's available.

313
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:15,019
[SPEAKER_19]: So those dimensions, in addition to height, govern what can happen on the site.

314
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:19,759
[SPEAKER_19]: So even though we're only showing height, I want to make sure you understand that there are other requirements.

315
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:28,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Main Street at Harvard Street, so again, we're seeing the existing here, and the proposed, and the proposed with the incentive zoning.

316
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:34,622
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, they only get the incentive zoning if they've shown that they can meet the incentive requirements

317
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:38,143
[SPEAKER_19]: and all of the other dimensional requirements on the lot.

318
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Harvard Street zoning section.

319
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:48,968
[SPEAKER_19]: So here you see the ability to use parking to connect two buildings.

320
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:58,692
[SPEAKER_19]: In some of the other zoning analyses we've shown, that space in between the two buildings can be amenity space for the residents in the building.

321
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:03,054
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, you might not be able to see now the light line.

322
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,695
[SPEAKER_19]: It might be a little bit clearer online.

323
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:13,322
[SPEAKER_19]: but certainly when you look at these online you'll be able to see the shadow is not going all the way across the street to the building on the other side of the street.

324
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:17,386
[SPEAKER_19]: The street width very much governs the character of the area.

325
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:24,152
[SPEAKER_19]: And then here, Boston Avenue, you can see this section with the train tracks down in the middle there.

326
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:28,923
[SPEAKER_19]: You can see an example in this proposed of tucking parking underneath the building.

327
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:34,745
[SPEAKER_19]: So you've got the retail on Boston Avenue and on the backside of the building next to the train track.

328
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:38,026
[SPEAKER_19]: We have parking and some of that parking is under the building.

329
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:40,207
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, showing you options.

330
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:46,349
[SPEAKER_19]: And here's one on Boston Avenue, where you can see the parking has a green deck on top.

331
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,813
[SPEAKER_19]: So providing some, not just stormwater management, but a green area for residents.

332
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:56,716
[SPEAKER_19]: On the other side of Boston Ave, again, you can see parking tucked underneath.

333
00:29:57,816 --> 00:30:00,778
[SPEAKER_19]: And then finally, we wanted to call this out.

334
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:05,300
[SPEAKER_19]: So some of the development standards that we put into the zoning.

335
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:09,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Development standards are other things that a developer is required to meet.

336
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:13,065
[SPEAKER_19]: We typically tie those to things like stormwater management,

337
00:30:13,885 --> 00:30:24,528
[SPEAKER_19]: access for pedestrians, bicyclists, vehicles, the circulation within the site, how the building relates to the site, all of those are written out.

338
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:31,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Not all of them can be easily diagrammed, but one of the things we heard talking in Salem Street and also in the squares,

339
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:39,495
[SPEAKER_19]: is, again, making sure that new buildings were not going to adversely affect existing buildings.

340
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:47,881
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see here, one of the requirements we've put in for consideration is this idea of an abutting residential district.

341
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:49,662
[SPEAKER_19]: was passed in Salem.

342
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:56,389
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been looking at how we include it with some of the others.

343
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:07,880
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things we want to do is this incentive zoning that adds the extra two stories is going to be contingent on whether or not it allows for the minimum amount of daylight.

344
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:12,545
[SPEAKER_19]: You can't shadow somebody's existing residential building

345
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:15,027
[SPEAKER_19]: 365 days a year.

346
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:23,994
[SPEAKER_19]: We're considering and reviewing a minimum daylight standard that if you can't meet that standard, you can't get the incentive.

347
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:25,596
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what the bottom one shows.

348
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,098
[SPEAKER_19]: You can see this 45-degree angle.

349
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:32,862
[SPEAKER_19]: We've already got one where you have to set back the building from the residential neighborhood.

350
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:36,185
[SPEAKER_19]: We're also looking at adding this minimum daylight standard.

351
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,787
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're shading that building, you can't do it.

352
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:44,910
[SPEAKER_19]: So, with that, I'm going to stop there so we can take questions.

353
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I can jump back.

354
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:49,673
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to also actually, I don't think anybody's got there.

355
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:51,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Are we going to do cameras?

356
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:53,616
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to say, I can just leave this up or I can take it off.

357
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:59,801
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can see everybody's names, whichever you all prefer, but I can certainly jump back to any of the slides again.

358
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:04,085
[SPEAKER_19]: For those of you in the room, I'm sure you're going to want to go and send some.

359
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:09,069
[SPEAKER_19]: A solid time looking at the maps and also perhaps learn how to do the interactive zoning.

360
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:19,698
[SPEAKER_19]: You are welcome to move in and out if you want to go ask a very specific question now, and then come back in to listen to the Q and a, you're totally welcome to if you want to wait to the end.

361
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,260
[SPEAKER_19]: You're also welcome to turn it over to you to monitor.

362
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,022
[SPEAKER_19]: I will stop my share.

363
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:26,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

364
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:28,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for the presentation, Emily.

365
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:30,858
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to switch into the Q&A portion.

366
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:37,582
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to quickly remind myself with Kevin, is it ideal for sound purposes for people to speak into the microphone or can they?

367
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:39,163
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, great.

368
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,346
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's ideal for folks who want to give questions in this room to speak into the microphone.

369
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:45,808
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you need a microphone carried to you, happy to do that.

370
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:52,693
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to be monitoring the Zoom so that we can be alternating between in-person questions and questions from people who raise their hands on Zoom.

371
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:55,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Zoom participants hear if you don't speak to the microphone.

372
00:32:56,045 --> 00:33:01,689
[SPEAKER_18]: The Zoom participants will not be able to hear if we don't speak into the microphone and it will be easier for folks in the room to hear as well.

373
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,671
[SPEAKER_18]: So I saw a question back there, sir.

374
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:07,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

375
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:16,339
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Paul Morgan.

376
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:17,439
[SPEAKER_16]: I live on Brewster Road.

377
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,542
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed on these diagrams all the shadows were 45 degrees.

378
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:28,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, shadows range a lot during the day and during the seasons.

379
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:33,141
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you say somebody can't have a shadow in their building, what are the limits?

380
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,704
[SPEAKER_16]: What time of day does that include?

381
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:39,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And what time of year does that include?

382
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:42,562
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's a great question.

383
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:49,168
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have seen different zoning ordinances, different zoning bylaws handle it differently.

384
00:33:49,949 --> 00:34:06,504
[SPEAKER_19]: What we have been looking at for this one, and we're looking forward to feedback on it, is establishing a minimum number of hours per day that the building must have sunlight on it, rather than specifying specific meridian heights or angles.

385
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:16,589
[SPEAKER_19]: just because we don't want to make the calculations so confusing that people don't understand them, but we're open to other suggestions and how that could be done.

386
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:21,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so what time of year would that minimum number apply for?

387
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:22,992
[SPEAKER_19]: Anytime of year.

388
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:24,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Anytime of year.

389
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:28,595
[SPEAKER_19]: So December 20th would be the worst.

390
00:34:28,695 --> 00:34:29,896
[SPEAKER_16]: It would have to be there.

391
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:32,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Now also, you just said shining on the building.

392
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:35,279
[SPEAKER_16]: That doesn't do anything for the yards.

393
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:40,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so excellent point, and I should have done that.

394
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:47,879
[SPEAKER_19]: We were looking in these and trying to give a simplified visual graphic rather than showing every single angle.

395
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:54,042
[SPEAKER_19]: We were looking at the front yard and the face of the building and obviously the windows, light shining through the windows.

396
00:34:54,402 --> 00:35:00,585
[SPEAKER_19]: We weren't looking at the backyards because the existing building itself would already shade the backyard.

397
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:11,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that would all depend on which face where the which way the house faced a North facing house would have a nice sunny backyard.

398
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Understood.

399
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:16,933
[SPEAKER_19]: We were focusing on buildings across the street or next to each other.

400
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,554
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, there is a whole bunch of additional analysis that we could do.

401
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:25,657
[SPEAKER_19]: But your point about looking at the yards as well as the building that is well taken.

402
00:35:25,717 --> 00:35:26,957
[SPEAKER_19]: We will add that to our list.

403
00:35:26,997 --> 00:35:30,539
[SPEAKER_16]: You could be affected by a building that's pretty far away in the middle of winter.

404
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:31,559
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

405
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

406
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, thank you.

407
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:34,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for bringing that up.

408
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:36,502
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate the additional clarification.

409
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:39,964
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

410
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:50,570
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Emily, we have a question online around what are the colors on the map?

411
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:56,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And she specifically said, she was asking about the yellow and the green, specifically, she mentioned the map, or they, sorry.

412
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:03,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that they mentioned a wife, Brooke Parkway, Boston have hillside.

413
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,067
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so presumably they're on the.

414
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:20,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, and if you if you wanted to raise your hand up, if you want, I can unmute you to you can clarify your question, but just share just to make sure that we're in the right place.

415
00:36:21,363 --> 00:36:27,365
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm going to unmute the person asking the question so that they can clarify make sure.

416
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:27,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Now.

417
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,547
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, there you go.

418
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,588
[SPEAKER_09]: MK Reisch, you're unmuted.

419
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:45,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you speaking?

420
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're not hearing you in the room.

421
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:48,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to look at our tech support in the room.

422
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:57,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you try again?

423
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:59,680
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not hearing you here in the room.

424
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:05,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, tech support's coming over in case the problem's on our end.

425
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:11,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this map doesn't have yellow and green.

426
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:20,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this map doesn't have yellow and green, so we're trying to... You know what, they may be looking at the faded green.

427
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Which road did you say it was?

428
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:26,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Albright Parkway, Boston Ave, and Hillside.

429
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:28,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is the faded green and yellow.

430
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,237
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're looking at the residential areas.

431
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:31,658
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

432
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:35,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me jump back to the residential areas just so that they can see it more clearly.

433
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,662
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's going to be urban residential one.

434
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:45,996
[SPEAKER_19]: You can see the green here, it's teal when it's brought up, it's green, a little bit greener when it's faded away.

435
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:50,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're still unmuted if you want to try and ask again, but we're not hearing you.

436
00:37:53,313 --> 00:38:09,392
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess you're going to have to type at us and we're trying to just to the to what we what we think the question is and I hope the person is able to unmute in case we're misinterpreting.

437
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:16,617
[SPEAKER_18]: the other kind of muted pastel colors on that map that Emily just brought up.

438
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:35,625
[SPEAKER_18]: We wanted to place the current proposal that we're talking about today in the context of the other zoning that's been proposed, so those others colors, light yellow, light green, are just meant to say these are the sub-districts that are being proposed, in those cases not yet ordained or finalized.

439
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:44,976
[SPEAKER_18]: for the areas surrounding the corridor proposals, just so people have a sense of what is proposed to butt up against what for that context.

440
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:49,402
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope I'm speaking correctly to what MK was asking about.

441
00:38:52,245 --> 00:39:02,633
[SPEAKER_18]: In case folks missed this earlier, all of the images that we looked at tonight are available on the city's zoning website, which is medfordma.org slash zoning.

442
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:14,403
[SPEAKER_18]: If you scroll down to public documents for any given proposal, we'll have links to slide decks and maps for each of those proposals, including a link to the presentation images that were shared tonight.

443
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:16,144
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure we'll have those up by tomorrow.

444
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:27,986
[SPEAKER_09]: If there are other people who want to raise their hands, I was messaged another question from the online, but I don't want to cut people off.

445
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:30,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we take one from the room and then we'll do one from online?

446
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:38,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it moved.

447
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:46,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi there, I'm Deja Valdini, 37 Winter Street and 319 Boston Ave.

448
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a couple questions.

449
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:54,556
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one being, I myself have been contacted by some residents, some people even in this room.

450
00:39:55,317 --> 00:40:02,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And although there's been so many meetings and a lot of work done on the part of y'all, a lot of us are still learning and it's still a lot of information.

451
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:19,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible, and I know the timeline is kind of pertaining to other meetings, is it possible and not to stall it or slow it down, but to really focus on some of the commercial neighborhoods in those areas, really nail it, get it done.

452
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: see how the housing looks, because I'm super pro-housing as well, see how the housing looks in the square on Mystic Ave, and then move it into the residence to make sure the city can support that, the building department can support that, so that we really know what we're doing.

453
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:37,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a couple questions if that's okay, but that would be the first one.

454
00:40:37,998 --> 00:40:41,701
[SPEAKER_04]: The second one also, where I'm on 319 Boston Ave,

455
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:57,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Tufts owns properties along Boston Ave, and I know that this is not a Tufts meeting, but I think it's really important to include them because with that proposal on Boston Ave, where I am, there's Hillside Hardware, Danish, that whole building is also Tufts.

456
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:01,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So has the city had direct contact with Tufts with this planning?

457
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:04,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know what Tufts' longtime vision is?

458
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:06,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And are we collaborating?

459
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:08,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can pause for a second.

460
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't I, why don't I answer that second one first.

461
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:15,612
[SPEAKER_09]: So first of all, some of the Tufts representatives are actually here in the room tonight.

462
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:23,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have, we had both a direct meeting with, we invited direct Tufts of Butters to a meeting to talk about what they were interested in.

463
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:27,157
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we had a meeting with some Tufts staff to hear what they had to say.

464
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:30,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also met with the planning staff from Somerville

465
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:34,999
[SPEAKER_09]: to hear their reflections on their Tufts institutional zoning.

466
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And so one thing I think is not readily obvious to everybody.

467
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:46,404
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea of a Tufts institutional zone and we don't have it up at the moment, but there was a dark blue area.

468
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:51,966
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the area that we are right now proposing in this map on this screen.

469
00:41:51,986 --> 00:41:52,706
[SPEAKER_09]: It's purple.

470
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:54,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I think online it looks a little more blue.

471
00:41:54,908 --> 00:42:00,337
[SPEAKER_09]: would be zoned specifically with what we will think of as campus zoning, right?

472
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:01,479
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be

473
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,921
[SPEAKER_09]: appropriate for a campus.

474
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:07,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It would not be appropriate for a neighborhood or a commercial district.

475
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:14,427
[SPEAKER_09]: If Tufts owns buildings outside of that area, they are subject to whatever zoning they are in.

476
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:24,592
[SPEAKER_09]: So if Tufts owns a building as they do on George Street, which is a residential neighborhood, it will be subject to the same zoning as every other building on George Street.

477
00:42:25,032 --> 00:42:46,146
[SPEAKER_09]: the danish pastry house building would be subject in fact to the topic of tonight's conversation the commercial zoning on um boston ave um so i just want to make sure that that's clear just because tufts owns it doesn't mean it would be subject to special zoning it would only be if it was within those borders it would be um

478
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:48,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, we're collaborating.

479
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:49,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking with them.

480
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:50,469
[SPEAKER_09]: What are their interests?

481
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:51,389
[SPEAKER_09]: What are their needs?

482
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:53,831
[SPEAKER_09]: What does the community want?

483
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And so our intention was to hear each of those groups separately.

484
00:42:58,114 --> 00:43:00,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Emily has heard all of that.

485
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:03,398
[SPEAKER_09]: She and her team are sort of synthesizing that.

486
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:10,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And the idea is that they would come back with a presentation and show it to the Planning and Permitting Committee of the City Council.

487
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:18,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the same time, the public and tops for people to then comment on and to to then reflect on altogether.

488
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:21,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to follow up to that too.

489
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:29,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Just specifically to that, so where my building is, which would be perfect, it's nine units for mixed use totally.

490
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:36,288
[SPEAKER_04]: But with that said, if that were, it's a private business that owns it, like we just rent.

491
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:45,751
[SPEAKER_04]: If that does get sold and Tufts does purchase it, which it's free for sale, would the Dover Amendment change potentially that zoning?

492
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:49,955
[SPEAKER_04]: because Tufts has then purchased it with the zoning reform, I guess you could say.

493
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:56,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of the Dover amendment is that it has to be used for educational purposes.

494
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:07,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they said, oh, this is an investment property and we're going to put commercial on the ground floor and rent to anybody upstairs, then Dover would not apply.

495
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:13,629
[SPEAKER_09]: If they said we are buying this because we want to use this as a Tufts, we want to put Tufts offices in.

496
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:16,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, for example, the dorm that they built, that is

497
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:27,960
[SPEAKER_09]: an institutional use with a tiny accessory use of a couple of businesses on the ground floor to kind of complement it and make it nicer for the neighborhood that some businesses along there.

498
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:30,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's how that is.

499
00:44:30,942 --> 00:44:40,972
[SPEAKER_09]: If they said, well, we're going to turn this into Tufts residential housing, and we're going to continue to rent to a business on the floor, they could make an argument for Dover.

500
00:44:41,872 --> 00:44:49,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think there is that space there and it really is around the use that they want to use it for, if that makes sense.

501
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:02,134
[SPEAKER_04]: just Tufts as a community partner.

502
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:04,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

503
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:12,405
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been working with Tufts as they have commercial spaces that we want to see them rented to local commercial businesses.

504
00:45:12,886 --> 00:45:14,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Will that be possible in something like this dorm?

505
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

506
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,032
[SPEAKER_09]: They might need to bring in a cafe.

507
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Can they bring in a local cafe or do they bring in, you know,

508
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:27,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I can think of like three different kinds of brands that college students prefer to frequent.

509
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:27,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

510
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:29,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And so how do you do that?

511
00:45:29,303 --> 00:45:31,405
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other hand, the college students love Tamper.

512
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:32,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

513
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:38,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they were buying, we would say to them, you have good you have good businesses in there.

514
00:45:38,732 --> 00:45:40,874
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like to see you keep them.

515
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:52,949
[SPEAKER_09]: You can honestly, we can't force anybody, there could be a commercial developer could build that by that building and say they want to bring Starbucks in, and we couldn't stop them.

516
00:45:53,449 --> 00:46:00,498
[SPEAKER_09]: We could say to them, we would prefer that they, they rent to the local business that's here we'd like to work with you on this, how can we support you in that.

517
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:07,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of this zoning has actually included one of the incentives that we've put in in the mixed use.

518
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:16,994
[SPEAKER_09]: So where we say you can do taller if you do incentive zoning, one of the incentives is that you give a discount to small businesses.

519
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:32,683
[SPEAKER_09]: so that if they agree to give discounted rent to small local businesses or small businesses for a number of years, they can do an extra story on their building.

520
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:36,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we're doing to insert a really good incentive.

521
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:39,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that would be a bummer.

522
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:50,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping to use that to not just get them to rent to local businesses, but to rent to local businesses at a discount to support our small businesses.

523
00:46:50,616 --> 00:46:56,621
[SPEAKER_19]: It is specific to the neighborhood, but the idea is that the incentive incentive zoning table.

524
00:46:57,301 --> 00:47:01,362
[SPEAKER_19]: is across all the districts that allow for incentive zoning.

525
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:09,705
[SPEAKER_19]: So the neighborhood residential, the urban residential, maybe urban residential too does, but the others don't.

526
00:47:10,105 --> 00:47:15,006
[SPEAKER_19]: But all of the mixed use districts that we've looked at so far, we intend to have incentive zoning.

527
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,007
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would spread that option throughout the city.

528
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So, last one and then I'll leave.

529
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:23,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're seeing here but listen, but it would just be.

530
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:30,572
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on the hillside, where the whole thing you're going, yes Tufts is there but if you're from your whole side is a really important part of that we're on a hill.

531
00:47:31,052 --> 00:47:33,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we doing for the topography?

532
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:42,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, because I know with my friends who are here with the tough storm and the shade studies, that was a big deal.

533
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:48,564
[SPEAKER_04]: But now if we're going to go all the way down Boston Ave, are we being mindful of Orchard Street, those streets as well?

534
00:47:49,044 --> 00:47:49,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And what would that look like?

535
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:55,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I did notice that the buildings that were on the train track side were also getting fully developed.

536
00:47:55,649 --> 00:47:57,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we being mindful of that as well?

537
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:07,257
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, so if you get another plug for the interactive map, there's 2 layers on the interactive map that I think what 3 actually that I think would talk specifically to what you're asking.

538
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:10,920
[SPEAKER_19]: We put the publicly owned and privately owned streets.

539
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,402
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a layer on there.

540
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,383
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see that.

541
00:48:13,943 --> 00:48:20,830
[SPEAKER_19]: We also put the LIDAR, which is a way of measuring slope.

542
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,052
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can actually see the slope.

543
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:28,196
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also have a calculation of the percentage slope by parcel in there.

544
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:31,640
[SPEAKER_19]: So you get to see an impact of what the topography is doing.

545
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,062
[SPEAKER_19]: We have been looking very closely at those.

546
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:38,706
[SPEAKER_19]: I should add, because I think your question is bringing up something else that I wanted to say is,

547
00:48:39,747 --> 00:48:45,130
[SPEAKER_19]: The reason we're here at a public meeting is that none of these boundaries are fixed.

548
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,111
[SPEAKER_19]: We're gathering into it.

549
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:56,135
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the great things is if you can stop by the maps on the way out, if you have time, understanding where you think, oh, maybe this isn't right.

550
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:57,896
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe this would be better over here.

551
00:48:58,656 --> 00:49:05,000
[SPEAKER_19]: being able to draw on the map with my team would be critically important, because that's just the sort of information we're looking for.

552
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:08,523
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for bringing all of those up, really appreciate it.

553
00:49:08,743 --> 00:49:14,827
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll say Kit has an answer for your first question, which I'm going to let her do.

554
00:49:16,548 --> 00:49:17,948
[SPEAKER_18]: share the load, which we like to do.

555
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for your thoughtful questions.

556
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:20,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for being here.

557
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:29,791
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't want to gloss over your first question to the question about the pacing of the different proposals in this process.

558
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:40,474
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been focusing very intensely on, I would actually call them not commercial districts, but mixed use districts, because as folks who have been paying attention to the process,

559
00:49:41,994 --> 00:49:44,115
[SPEAKER_18]: probably have heard from me, run over again.

560
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:58,599
[SPEAKER_18]: There are very few areas in the city where in this new zoning we are proposing for only commercial and I'm pretty sure that most of those districts that have undergone the do zoning treatment are mostly on mystic Avenue corridor district most of the other.

561
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:04,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Districts that I think probably all of us in this room would think of as commercial districts are really mixed use.

562
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:11,925
[SPEAKER_18]: We're incentivizing commercial on the first and sometimes on the second floor and residential up top.

563
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:21,169
[SPEAKER_18]: And those we've, we've studied and gone through the process and passed a number of those districts already Mystic Avenue corridor district.

564
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:31,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Salem Street corridor district has a mix of residential only and mixed use zoning currently in the process.

565
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:39,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Our proposals for Bedford square and West Medford square and I believe the CDB is going to get it's just very first introductory.

566
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:43,938
[SPEAKER_18]: discussion of those squares this coming Wednesday.

567
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:55,545
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm not mistaken, it's by no means going to be the final time that the CDB discusses those proposals, but I think it is when the proposals will be introduced to the CDB for the very first time.

568
00:50:56,446 --> 00:51:05,392
[SPEAKER_18]: All that to say, we've been looking very hard and very much focusing on these commercial and mixed use districts, which allows us the chance to talk about

569
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:17,298
[SPEAKER_18]: where do we want to nurture existing commercial in the city, where do we want to help that grow more, where do we really hope that commercial and residential will grow alongside each other?

570
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:30,505
[SPEAKER_18]: To your point about should we kind of do one thing first and then pause and then see if it's appropriate to do the second thing, I think that for myself as one participant in this process, not talking for anybody else,

571
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:50,737
[SPEAKER_18]: I think in terms of how zoning plays out on the ground, and it is true that I think none of us have a crystal ball to see how developers and private property owners will, in what specific ways will they take us up on the zoning that we pass as part of this process.

572
00:51:50,797 --> 00:51:57,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Indeed, we don't know what private property owners or developers will do with the zoning that's currently on the books in Medford.

573
00:51:59,162 --> 00:52:06,986
[SPEAKER_18]: And I say that because I think that the premise of, well, let's see if this zoning kind of does what we want it to do.

574
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:11,428
[SPEAKER_18]: And then let's look at another problem in need of a solution or their topic.

575
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:17,692
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not the premise that I'm coming at this from, because I think we'll never really get to that point where we're able to say with certainty.

576
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:18,492
[SPEAKER_18]: that.

577
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:24,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay This geography of zoning did it check the box for this goal for the city of Bedford.

578
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:26,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Overall this entire process is iterative.

579
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:28,675
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think we'll ever get to a point where we're like, Okay, we did it.

580
00:52:28,735 --> 00:52:29,095
[SPEAKER_18]: We have.

581
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:37,677
[SPEAKER_18]: We have enough small businesses and we're good on that, or we have enough of this specific type of housing, and we're good on that, and nobody's in need of that.

582
00:52:38,077 --> 00:52:38,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Because this.

583
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,537
[SPEAKER_18]: What we do is we.

584
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:41,938
[SPEAKER_18]: Through this

585
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,430
[SPEAKER_18]: ground floor and the ceiling for what could happen.

586
00:52:51,172 --> 00:52:56,857
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we have to wait and see how private property owners, what private property owners decide to do with that.

587
00:52:56,917 --> 00:53:06,327
[SPEAKER_18]: So all that to say, sorry, that was kind of a lot of words, but that is my way of saying why I think it is useful for us to try to continue doing these two things in parallel.

588
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:10,993
[SPEAKER_18]: looking at you know kind of that small minority of commercial only sub districts.

589
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:22,670
[SPEAKER_18]: At the same time as looking at our mixed use sub districts at the same time as looking at our residential only sub districts, because we know that we have different goals and wants for all these different needs of

590
00:53:27,176 --> 00:53:35,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, the goal is to be holistic, and a truly heroic number of public meetings is how we try to get to that goal.

591
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:40,547
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll look around and see if anybody else has a different answer to the question.

592
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:43,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

593
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:52,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to go back to that follow-up?

594
00:53:52,724 --> 00:53:54,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have another question online.

595
00:53:57,265 --> 00:54:02,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So sorry, the person who was trying to talk earlier isn't able to get their mic to work.

596
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:10,770
[SPEAKER_09]: But they say, the zone adjacent to Tufts Blue, northwest along Boston Ave, is shaded green.

597
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:14,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that color residential 1B?

598
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:16,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So if not, what is the zone status?

599
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:26,629
[SPEAKER_09]: And then continuing Northwest to Quincy Street, the color is beige, as is much of that residential Medford.

600
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:30,751
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're asking about the residential zoning.

601
00:54:30,831 --> 00:54:32,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And what does that indicate?

602
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:35,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you able to sort of speak to that a little bit?

603
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:39,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I'm gonna flip back to the residential zone.

604
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:45,777
[SPEAKER_19]: So for those of you who will be looking at this at home, just know that slide 10 is going to give them the information.

605
00:54:46,357 --> 00:54:55,940
[SPEAKER_19]: The reason these colors don't match the colors on the slide that they were asking about precisely is because the colors on the slide that they were asking about are the faded versions of these.

606
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,961
[SPEAKER_19]: We faded those back.

607
00:54:56,981 --> 00:55:01,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So can we put the interactive map on what you're looking at right now?

608
00:55:01,922 --> 00:55:02,623
[SPEAKER_19]: That is a good question.

609
00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:05,083
[SPEAKER_02]: To show the specifics of what we're talking about?

610
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:05,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

611
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:13,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me?

612
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:14,587
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm good.

613
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:14,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

614
00:55:16,697 --> 00:55:18,339
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go, interactive map coming on up.

615
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:21,444
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the splash pad.

616
00:55:22,626 --> 00:55:25,269
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the instructions when you first get here.

617
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,694
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to go over to the layers right now.

618
00:55:28,735 --> 00:55:32,740
[SPEAKER_19]: So just a very quick introduction, you have layers, you have the legend.

619
00:55:34,382 --> 00:55:39,785
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll take a minute to load because I'm probably using up all the Wi-Fi availability in the room.

620
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:45,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Next to the legend, you have the base map, so you can change to look at an aerial versus a street map.

621
00:55:45,908 --> 00:55:51,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you've got information here with more instructions about it.

622
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:55,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's go to the proposed zoning districts and turn those on.

623
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:59,795
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to turn the transit off because we don't actually need those.

624
00:55:59,855 --> 00:56:03,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we're going to zoom in here and now I'm going to turn to the legend.

625
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:16,585
[SPEAKER_19]: And the legends taking a while so the the these the yellow and the green are the residential districts that that map that I was showing earlier actually had the names on them.

626
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:20,198
[SPEAKER_19]: But I will show you how to look at on the interactive map.

627
00:56:20,258 --> 00:56:21,439
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's urban residential.

628
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:23,359
[SPEAKER_19]: 1 is the green neighborhood.

629
00:56:23,419 --> 00:56:32,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Residential is the neighborhood residential 3 yellow and then let me go back to the map itself.

630
00:56:32,983 --> 00:56:35,784
[SPEAKER_19]: And then let's just pick our random parcel here.

631
00:56:35,904 --> 00:56:36,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Just so you can see.

632
00:56:37,465 --> 00:56:43,811
[SPEAKER_19]: So if I click on this parcel here, what will happen if we had sufficient bandwidth?

633
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:46,413
[SPEAKER_19]: I suspect the Zoom is taking up the bandwidth.

634
00:56:46,813 --> 00:56:52,238
[SPEAKER_19]: But what would happen is on the right-hand side where you now see this block, it would come up with the information about the parcel.

635
00:56:52,799 --> 00:57:02,387
[SPEAKER_19]: And what it will say is, you know, the address with this, it will say what the existing dimensional standards of the parcel as they are now are.

636
00:57:02,915 --> 00:57:10,582
[SPEAKER_19]: It will say what the existing zoning for the parcel is, and it will say what the proposed zoning is for that parcel.

637
00:57:10,922 --> 00:57:12,884
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can look at each one individually.

638
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:16,867
[SPEAKER_19]: You can also go up here where it says find address or place.

639
00:57:16,887 --> 00:57:18,649
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't have to know where you are on that.

640
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:22,532
[SPEAKER_19]: You can search for your address or any other address that you're interested.

641
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:24,794
[SPEAKER_19]: on that map and zoom in.

642
00:57:26,675 --> 00:57:28,276
[SPEAKER_19]: So I highly recommend it.

643
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:34,080
[SPEAKER_19]: The other thing you can do is this little arrow here up at the top that leads to data filters.

644
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:44,486
[SPEAKER_19]: For those of you who really want to geesh out on the data, you can, for example, we're showing all of the zoning now.

645
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:46,988
[SPEAKER_19]: I've just switched on the neighborhood residential zoning.

646
00:57:47,308 --> 00:57:50,350
[SPEAKER_19]: So now you only see the neighborhood residential zoning.

647
00:57:51,691 --> 00:57:58,756
[SPEAKER_19]: You can look, let's see if this works, you can, we have the historic dates that things are built, I think, actually, because the residential.

648
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:10,686
[SPEAKER_19]: So, in here, I've said, tell me all of the things in neighborhood residential 1 built between 1990 and 2025 and they show up if I were to take that away, if I were to go say.

649
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:17,589
[SPEAKER_19]: tell me all of the parcels in the proposed zoning districts built between 1990 and 2025.

650
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:25,798
[SPEAKER_19]: It would show them up if I only want to see, for example, let's say historic districts, historic buildings.

651
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:28,060
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to go for

652
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,864
[SPEAKER_19]: A little over 75 years ago, those are all the buildings that were built in.

653
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:44,792
[SPEAKER_19]: If I want to see all of the private ways and these areas, I can put a map on and that shows all the parcels that are on private way.

654
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:52,578
[SPEAKER_19]: So, for all the questions that people are asking, this is a really critical tool to be able to delve into the answers to those questions.

655
00:58:53,278 --> 00:59:05,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to clear all of this but I hope for the first time I'll get it like this and I'm trying to determine exactly where that's you know showing and all of that stuff and it makes it a little bit

656
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:19,649
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to understand because then when you're looking at it this way, I'm not seeing the allocation of the zoning, the yellow, the green, and what they determine and what they mean.

657
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:23,272
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's because the legend is not loading for some reason.

658
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,635
[SPEAKER_19]: The legend is what you want.

659
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:27,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.

660
00:59:28,256 --> 00:59:33,661
[SPEAKER_19]: And the maps, the large scale maps, the legend is on the left hand side and has all of those details.

661
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:40,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw them out there, but it's like, it's different when you're kind of looking at it and poking around trying to determine things.

662
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole different animal.

663
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:42,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

664
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:50,907
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other problem is that the colors of the PDFs render slightly differently from the colors of the ArcGIS, which render depending on which computer monitor you have.

665
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:53,128
[SPEAKER_19]: So, so the legend is what you need.

666
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:56,409
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know it was working earlier today, so I think it's just the bandwidth.

667
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:59,210
[SPEAKER_19]: because it's trying to pull up all of those.

668
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:04,912
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, let me just see if I can put up a smaller amount of legends.

669
01:00:05,092 --> 01:00:06,452
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the approved ones.

670
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:07,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Will it pop up?

671
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,114
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't think we have enough bandwidth, so apologies for that.

672
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the Boston Ave section, where exactly are we go?

673
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can see certain sections of that, but how far down does it go?

674
01:00:18,977 --> 01:00:22,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know we split into some of them at a certain point on Boston Ave.

675
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I was asking Paula outside.

676
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:29,987
[SPEAKER_19]: I was looking at the maps, and I'm like, you know, some of these parcels don't have colors on them.

677
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:32,308
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm assuming that's Summerville.

678
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,429
[SPEAKER_19]: She said, yes, yes.

679
01:00:33,729 --> 01:00:35,310
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's an easy way of knowing.

680
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:37,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's that cut out there.

681
01:00:37,811 --> 01:00:40,232
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one of the reasons that this map is interactive.

682
01:00:40,292 --> 01:00:44,395
[SPEAKER_19]: It's quite useful, because you could actually zoom in and out and see where the other communities are.

683
01:00:44,795 --> 01:00:46,016
[SPEAKER_19]: Makes it a little bit easier.

684
01:00:46,036 --> 01:00:48,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have any other questions online?

685
01:00:48,837 --> 01:00:49,237
[SPEAKER_19]: We do.

686
01:00:49,257 --> 01:00:49,498
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, great.

687
01:00:51,217 --> 01:00:52,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, put my mic on.

688
01:00:57,183 --> 01:01:10,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So the other question, Gil Gabay at 48 Allmont Street, I completely support the new rezoning project and the ambitious of the ideas the city council has been undertaking.

689
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:21,331
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is about how our bike lanes and pedestrian safety plan for around newly zoned commercial or large residential lots.

690
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:33,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And so one, we'll start to get into that is that zoning does not talk about things like streets and bike lanes, et cetera.

691
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a completely separate way that those are controlled.

692
01:01:38,086 --> 01:01:40,627
[SPEAKER_09]: But the city is a director of traffic and transportation.

693
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:44,948
[SPEAKER_09]: He was literally in my office today coordinating with me.

694
01:01:45,048 --> 01:01:47,449
[SPEAKER_09]: He's actually looking at some stuff on Salem Street.

695
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:49,070
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a very funny interaction.

696
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:56,432
[SPEAKER_09]: because he asked me about when the Salem Street zoning was passed because he's looking at some stuff treatments on Salem Street.

697
01:01:56,912 --> 01:02:00,133
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I sent him the zoning that was passed.

698
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:02,133
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, no, no, I want to see the meeting.

699
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:13,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the video because I want to see the comments that people made about traffic at that meeting to inform what I'm doing and what I'm proposing and the public meeting that I'm setting up.

700
01:02:13,616 --> 01:02:19,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is to say that we are working in tangent, and I might say in parallel.

701
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:22,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're working on things.

702
01:02:22,563 --> 01:02:24,164
[SPEAKER_09]: He's also looking at stuff.

703
01:02:24,504 --> 01:02:30,169
[SPEAKER_09]: He's aware that these meanings, some of them are contentious, and he is trying to get the input from those.

704
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:32,670
[SPEAKER_09]: to help inform some of what he is doing.

705
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:36,253
[SPEAKER_09]: He said to me, I'm looking at more bike lanes on Salem Street.

706
01:02:36,313 --> 01:02:38,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I said people might be upset about that.

707
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:39,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

708
01:02:39,135 --> 01:02:40,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other people might love it.

709
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:45,199
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, I'm going to go watch the video and see what people what they were literally saying.

710
01:02:46,098 --> 01:02:54,566
[SPEAKER_09]: He's planning to do a public meeting about Salem Street and additional bike lanes and what changes they could do on there.

711
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:58,990
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a couple of side streets there that he's looking at treatments.

712
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:04,415
[SPEAKER_09]: He's looking at stuff right now on Main Street close to Medford Square.

713
01:03:05,255 --> 01:03:12,039
[SPEAKER_09]: So the main street coming out of Medford Square is the area that this MassDOT just had a big meeting on.

714
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:16,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of that is going to be at Traffic Commission in the next month or two.

715
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:19,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he's sort of going back and forth.

716
01:03:19,643 --> 01:03:23,545
[SPEAKER_09]: He's also looking at some stuff in Medford Square around bike lanes.

717
01:03:24,226 --> 01:03:26,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all the things he actually mentioned to me today.

718
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:30,369
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking at the lower part of Fulton Street.

719
01:03:30,529 --> 01:03:37,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I think actually, sorry, I had to leave traffic commission early this month in order to go to a city council meeting.

720
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:45,817
[SPEAKER_09]: But I believe that we adopted a bike lane on the lower part of Fulton Street by Gillis Park.

721
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:52,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're actively looking at these things and where does it make sense to add them and how do we add them?

722
01:03:52,620 --> 01:04:02,266
[SPEAKER_09]: to protect the pedestrians and the bicyclists, but it is city staff separate from this zoning effort.

723
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:10,731
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also, I sat yesterday, we've done an RFP for the lots in Medford Square to do some new ground floor commercial.

724
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:16,635
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're looking at is a grocery store and a coffee shop with residential above it and a parking garage.

725
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:23,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And I met with that developer with the mayor yesterday to talk about, do we want to look at realignment of some of the roads?

726
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:25,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to look at the directions?

727
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:27,584
[SPEAKER_09]: He said to me, do you have traffic counts?

728
01:04:27,665 --> 01:04:30,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, you need to talk to our director of traffic and transportation.

729
01:04:31,188 --> 01:04:32,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've already been introduced.

730
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:36,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So these things are all sort of going on at the same time.

731
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:41,743
[SPEAKER_09]: That is to say that there is no mechanism.

732
01:04:42,263 --> 01:04:51,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Zoning talks about the parcels and the pedestrian and bike lanes are for the most part on the public ways or on the streets.

733
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And the one exception to that is what we were doing over on Mystic Ave.

734
01:04:56,202 --> 01:05:04,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did on Salem Street where we said, we want the sidewalks to be wide enough for the people and the traffic.

735
01:05:04,928 --> 01:05:15,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And if your sidewalk is not wide enough, then your building setback has to be further set back and you have to use some of your private property for sidewalks.

736
01:05:15,756 --> 01:05:19,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if you wanna go into any more detail on that, but that's,

737
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:33,094
[SPEAKER_09]: It's we absolutely we, we worked it we workshopped it on mystic gab and we're including it everywhere we're including it, we're including it in all of the mixed use districts and I think that at one point there was a little confusion.

738
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:38,801
[SPEAKER_19]: People assuming that we were taking the public right of way to make the increased sidewalk.

739
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:40,463
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, it's actually the public.

740
01:05:41,114 --> 01:05:42,316
[SPEAKER_19]: it's a private property.

741
01:05:42,376 --> 01:05:56,256
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you already have the existing sidewalk, say the existing sidewalk is six feet wide, that's a public sidewalk, and you're putting in a new building and we want a 12 foot wide sidewalk, just to make the math in my hands a little bit easier here.

742
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:06,435
[SPEAKER_19]: So here's the property line, you, the property owner of your, the new mixed use building, will have to add a six foot sidewalk and then set your building back from that.

743
01:06:06,555 --> 01:06:11,698
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're not doing public land, but the idea is to make it more walkable, more comfortable.

744
01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:15,180
[SPEAKER_19]: We noticed that certain areas of Medford have quite narrow sidewalks.

745
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:16,161
[SPEAKER_19]: And so.

746
01:06:16,201 --> 01:06:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Air rights over that sidewalk?

747
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:27,814
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the building has to go up after that sidewalk.

748
01:06:27,854 --> 01:06:29,234
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't build over the sidewalk.

749
01:06:29,254 --> 01:06:30,094
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't build over the sidewalk.

750
01:06:30,114 --> 01:06:31,134
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't build over the sidewalk.

751
01:06:31,194 --> 01:06:32,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent question, though.

752
01:06:33,015 --> 01:06:36,235
[SPEAKER_19]: So other questions here?

753
01:06:36,315 --> 01:06:37,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Come up to the mic, please.

754
01:06:37,515 --> 01:06:41,236
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we've been doing some chatting, but I'm worried about the people online not being able to hear.

755
01:06:41,836 --> 01:06:45,737
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, Alisha, maybe let us know after this one if there's another question.

756
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:48,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

757
01:06:49,158 --> 01:06:49,758
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm with SOS33.

758
01:06:51,858 --> 01:06:59,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question, if you could pull up the... I'm so short.

759
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Which map would you like?

760
01:07:01,864 --> 01:07:05,847
[SPEAKER_07]: This one, this is the one.

761
01:07:05,907 --> 01:07:10,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to focus on an area that I can pick out on the map, which is where I live.

762
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:14,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we're looking at High Street, that is going down to the river there.

763
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

764
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:20,301
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to make sure I heard this correctly.

765
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:35,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Like at the base level, this zoning that we're doing is correcting or modifying some sort of crazy zoning that exists right now, which is like, you could put a 15 story building here if you wanted to.

766
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:40,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And so at like the very baby step is that's now let's get rid of that.

767
01:07:40,815 --> 01:07:41,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

768
01:07:41,756 --> 01:07:43,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking so that's great.

769
01:07:46,712 --> 01:07:49,956
[SPEAKER_19]: No one's going to go to the mat on that one.

770
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:56,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we're looking at the blue or green or whatever color that is, teal.

771
01:07:56,683 --> 01:07:57,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, teal.

772
01:08:01,127 --> 01:08:06,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, those are already sort of a mishmash of businesses in there.

773
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:14,413
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a pizza shop, a liquor store, dry cleaner, smoke shop, bodega.

774
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:16,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're already there.

775
01:08:16,554 --> 01:08:18,495
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sort of codifying that they can be there.

776
01:08:18,955 --> 01:08:21,917
[SPEAKER_07]: But then also, the teal means that

777
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:30,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easier for other businesses to come in there should they want to without having to get by right without having to get some sort of special distance station to do it.

778
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:42,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on top, almost all of those buildings do have residential on top already so it's not actually a huge change from what is there now, but they could potentially go a little bit taller.

779
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:46,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm understanding that right, on the teal?

780
01:08:46,534 --> 01:08:48,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Super important question.

781
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:52,515
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm actually going to shift to the other map because the legends are outlining here.

782
01:08:52,535 --> 01:08:53,996
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not very helpful to us.

783
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:56,496
[SPEAKER_19]: But let me jump to this so we can see them.

784
01:08:57,477 --> 01:09:00,738
[SPEAKER_19]: So that red is actually the urban residential two.

785
01:09:01,498 --> 01:09:03,058
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's residential only.

786
01:09:03,758 --> 01:09:06,199
[SPEAKER_19]: That teal color would have been our mixed-use 2A.

787
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:09,580
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's five stories by right to incentive zoning.

788
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:13,881
[SPEAKER_19]: But that does bring up a couple of important points that you brought up.

789
01:09:13,981 --> 01:09:14,981
[SPEAKER_19]: One is the uses.

790
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:21,463
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe Paula has a printed document out, but use tables on presentations are really annoying.

791
01:09:21,483 --> 01:09:25,224
[SPEAKER_19]: But for those of you in the room, I believe we have a current draft of the uses.

792
01:09:25,324 --> 01:09:25,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a look.

793
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:29,986
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been talking about what the buildings look like and how they fit, but we haven't talked about the uses.

794
01:09:30,706 --> 01:09:35,168
[SPEAKER_19]: You bring up 2 points in kind of your 1st statement, and I think they're really important.

795
01:09:35,348 --> 01:09:51,655
[SPEAKER_19]: 1 of the things that we did when we looked at this, and the maps are online is that last June, we did a workshop with the planning and permitting committee, and we did maps of all of the existing conditions, including the existing non conformities.

796
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:57,936
[SPEAKER_19]: And those are the buildings that are the parcels that don't meet the current dimensional standards.

797
01:09:58,357 --> 01:10:02,998
[SPEAKER_19]: And so one of our first steps was where can we reduce the nonconformities?

798
01:10:03,398 --> 01:10:06,779
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's point number one is that was kind of a base understanding.

799
01:10:07,179 --> 01:10:15,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Point number two is the idea of allowing it making it easier for businesses to come into these next uses areas.

800
01:10:16,301 --> 01:10:24,908
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where the use table comes in and what we've talked about, I talked about by right earlier where you just get a building permit if you meet the conditions.

801
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:27,230
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's 2 other review levels.

802
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:32,234
[SPEAKER_19]: 1 is site plan review and site plan review is a by right use.

803
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:37,699
[SPEAKER_19]: but we want the ability as a city to put conditions on that by right use.

804
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,382
[SPEAKER_19]: So it goes to the CD board.

805
01:10:40,482 --> 01:10:45,106
[SPEAKER_19]: In some cases, we might have an administrative site plan review.

806
01:10:45,186 --> 01:10:47,168
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to talk about that a little bit more.

807
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:52,554
[SPEAKER_19]: But the idea is we want the use, but we think there are some things that we want to talk about.

808
01:10:53,154 --> 01:10:56,537
[SPEAKER_19]: The CD board can't deny the use, but it can put conditions on them.

809
01:10:56,877 --> 01:11:00,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Then the final thing, and it's the hardest thing to get, is a special permit.

810
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Special permit goes to the CD board in most cases.

811
01:11:05,444 --> 01:11:07,206
[SPEAKER_19]: And it requires public hearing.

812
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,148
[SPEAKER_19]: And the CD board can approve it.

813
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:11,589
[SPEAKER_19]: They can approve it with commissions.

814
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:15,372
[SPEAKER_19]: Or a special permit, the CD board can deny it.

815
01:11:15,432 --> 01:11:18,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, they have to be very careful about how they deny it.

816
01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:19,596
[SPEAKER_19]: They have to have good reasons for it.

817
01:11:20,016 --> 01:11:22,118
[SPEAKER_19]: But a special permit, they do allow that.

818
01:11:22,518 --> 01:11:32,802
[SPEAKER_19]: So as we think about uses, we want to think about, is this a desired use that we want to make it easier for somebody to do because the community wants this use?

819
01:11:32,882 --> 01:11:34,143
[SPEAKER_19]: So that becomes a byright.

820
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this something where the community wants it?

821
01:11:36,604 --> 01:11:40,525
[SPEAKER_19]: We think it's a good idea, but we want some conditions.

822
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,526
[SPEAKER_19]: That becomes site plan review.

823
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:51,590
[SPEAKER_19]: And if this is something that we think is important but needs that added step, or we're not sure if we want it or not,

824
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:56,308
[SPEAKER_19]: then that's a special permit or we don't want it under easy conditions necessarily.

825
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:57,969
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a special product.

826
01:11:58,429 --> 01:12:02,651
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what we're thinking about when we think of how we structure the use table.

827
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:09,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems like I can only speak for my I don't know the rest of the city well enough, but it seems like

828
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:17,837
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been very intentional in that this zoning is actually codifying what's really already there by businesses.

829
01:12:17,857 --> 01:12:27,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're looking, though, I can pick out those businesses up high street and down Boston ave to what Brooke.

830
01:12:27,669 --> 01:12:27,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

831
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:29,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see in the teal.

832
01:12:30,418 --> 01:12:32,600
[SPEAKER_07]: those are where actually where businesses are now.

833
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:40,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we're talking about a corridor, we're not really adding a ton more sort of mixed use.

834
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,308
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just making sure that what's there can continue to be there.

835
01:12:43,368 --> 01:12:46,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And if things change in and out, it's not a hassle.

836
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:53,916
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is the second question is the red sort of like across the street or adjacent, which is the urban residential too.

837
01:12:54,476 --> 01:12:54,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So

838
01:12:55,909 --> 01:13:12,936
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're thinking about how to apply urban residential versus residential or neighborhood, if for whatever reason, perhaps the neighbors are like, could you please make this urban residential one?

839
01:13:12,996 --> 01:13:15,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you do NR3?

840
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:17,178
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not going to impact

841
01:13:18,802 --> 01:13:20,883
[SPEAKER_07]: the teal, right?

842
01:13:20,923 --> 01:13:23,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things can change, can flex.

843
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:28,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like we can only have teal if we have this much density across the street kind of thing.

844
01:13:29,266 --> 01:13:30,806
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not a color by numbers.

845
01:13:30,826 --> 01:13:33,347
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to put the pink next to the yellow.

846
01:13:33,427 --> 01:13:34,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, right.

847
01:13:34,267 --> 01:13:36,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Which as I say, that sounds pretty garish.

848
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no.

849
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:47,012
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the things that we've been talking about as a consultant, we've been talking about with city staff and planning and permitting and to the city board is,

850
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:49,453
[SPEAKER_19]: We are doing this geographically.

851
01:13:50,074 --> 01:13:51,174
[SPEAKER_19]: There was another option.

852
01:13:51,194 --> 01:14:01,421
[SPEAKER_19]: There was an option where we could have come and done the whole thing and walked up to you with a potentially multi-hundred page document and said, here it is, read it and tell us if you like it.

853
01:14:01,922 --> 01:14:09,047
[SPEAKER_19]: We collectively, all of us thought that that was not a good idea because it would be even more confusing.

854
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,481
[SPEAKER_19]: The geography, zoning and geography is confusing enough as it is.

855
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:27,806
[SPEAKER_19]: So we know as we look at all of these and start to put these together that at the very end of this process, we're going to need to do a clean up and we're going to say, oh, gosh, that that parcel never got zones for anything.

856
01:14:27,826 --> 01:14:30,067
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking at the boundaries now, just to make sure or.

857
01:14:31,287 --> 01:15:00,693
[SPEAKER_19]: after we get all this maybe this district should be something else and so as you look at this it's not like there should be massive changes once it's approved but know that we are going to come back and just did we get it right right did we did we do we were just necessarily changing for in this instance let's say across the street from guiles or giles however you say it isn't right now or we're suggesting urban residential too but perhaps

858
01:15:01,313 --> 01:15:04,114
[SPEAKER_07]: the neighborhood is like no we would prefer it not.

859
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:06,876
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't impact the teal.

860
01:15:06,896 --> 01:15:21,062
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't impact the teal absolutely and that's one of the reasons we suggest that people who have been interested in this go online and look because we also have the existing land uses on one of the layers so people can see what's there now.

861
01:15:21,422 --> 01:15:23,103
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the base maps is an aerial

862
01:15:23,617 --> 01:15:36,358
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you can see what's there now common to most of our New England community communities had significant build out significant construction prior to the introduction of zoning.

863
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:36,618
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

864
01:15:37,984 --> 01:15:44,549
[SPEAKER_19]: we can look and say, hey, this is zone X, single family two, for example.

865
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:45,530
[SPEAKER_19]: But you know what?

866
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:49,173
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a lot of two and three families and apartments in here.

867
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:50,814
[SPEAKER_19]: What does that mean?

868
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:52,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Should that be something else?

869
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:54,416
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's been a lot of our back and forth.

870
01:15:54,757 --> 01:15:56,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Same is true for the commercial.

871
01:15:56,438 --> 01:16:02,583
[SPEAKER_19]: And you mentioned, OK, maybe those buildings that are existing now are one story.

872
01:16:02,623 --> 01:16:03,984
[SPEAKER_19]: They could go a little bit higher.

873
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:06,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, absolutely.

874
01:16:06,345 --> 01:16:18,128
[SPEAKER_19]: It is important to remember that there's consideration for anybody who owns a property of the cost of development, which is high now, but may not always be high, right?

875
01:16:18,568 --> 01:16:25,169
[SPEAKER_19]: And so when we think about zoning, we're thinking about a 20 to 30 year cycle, not in the next year cycle.

876
01:16:25,329 --> 01:16:27,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just my last statement is I really thought it was

877
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:53,469
[SPEAKER_07]: so helpful when you did your little here's the table in here when you step in and when you step in even more because it is so confusing when you just think about your lot size and you're like oh this is my lot size but there are so many little add-ons that actually really impact and then very quickly you begin to see actually no this size building couldn't go here for all of these reasons

878
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:57,311
[SPEAKER_07]: By lots, you just have to start at the, I just really thought that was really helpful.

879
01:16:57,371 --> 01:17:07,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's where it gets so difficult to envision and really understand, because there are so many different things that just slowly chip away at what can actually be built there.

880
01:17:07,816 --> 01:17:09,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's hard to remember that.

881
01:17:09,357 --> 01:17:13,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't know how you put that in a presentation, but that was very helpful.

882
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:13,939
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

883
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:15,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

884
01:17:15,259 --> 01:17:17,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, our designers, you know, we

885
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:22,624
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a balance of giving too much information and not enough information.

886
01:17:22,664 --> 01:17:27,708
[SPEAKER_19]: So our designers are currently working on images that better explain my table analogy.

887
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:29,349
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're hoping to have those for you soon.

888
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:36,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you are not the only person who has mentioned kind of how difficult it is to remember all of the components that go in.

889
01:17:36,254 --> 01:17:39,176
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking forward to having that for the community soon.

890
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Alicia, did you have anything on the line?

891
01:17:46,721 --> 01:17:47,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

892
01:17:49,003 --> 01:17:56,909
[SPEAKER_09]: So people online are welcome to raise their hands if they want to speak.

893
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:02,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so I can quickly answer this one.

894
01:18:02,293 --> 01:18:07,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta camera asks, I'm zooming into my neighborhood on the map, but I see the walk in court is listed as you are too.

895
01:18:07,897 --> 01:18:08,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this make sense?

896
01:18:08,937 --> 01:18:09,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Should it be something else?

897
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:20,433
[SPEAKER_09]: So to be clear, Walkling Court is a Medford Housing Authority property that was recently done what we call a planned development district.

898
01:18:20,874 --> 01:18:32,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is where a property owner can propose, we want to do something specific that we think would be appropriate for the city, and we need different zoning for it.

899
01:18:33,104 --> 01:18:37,307
[SPEAKER_09]: and this is the project we want to build, and this is the zoning we think will work.

900
01:18:37,727 --> 01:18:46,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would go through the same kind of process as we're doing this, where it goes to City Council, the Community Development Board, and then back to City Council.

901
01:18:47,474 --> 01:18:59,303
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the Housing Authority actually did that for Walkling Court, because Walkling Court, they are in the process of redeveloping to just do more modern, expanded public housing there.

902
01:19:00,205 --> 01:19:03,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they have what's a PDD, a planned development district.

903
01:19:03,828 --> 01:19:07,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an overlay that goes on that property.

904
01:19:07,711 --> 01:19:11,293
[SPEAKER_09]: When you have an overlay like that, you still need to have underlying zoning.

905
01:19:11,634 --> 01:19:20,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So urban residential two seem to make the most sense because they're about to build a bunch of apartment buildings and townhouses on their property.

906
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:23,703
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all been approved by the

907
01:19:24,888 --> 01:19:31,112
[SPEAKER_09]: City Council and the Community Development Board, but we needed to put something there.

908
01:19:31,512 --> 01:19:36,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And so at this point, we've put Urban Residential 2 as that area.

909
01:19:36,515 --> 01:19:41,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would allow apartment buildings in that location as the base zoning.

910
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,560
[SPEAKER_09]: She said, how many stories would that be?

911
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will tell you,

912
01:19:48,121 --> 01:19:57,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So while, right, so the whole point is it doesn't actually matter because they have this other zoning that they came, they went through the whole process.

913
01:19:57,607 --> 01:20:01,109
[SPEAKER_09]: This would not overwrite the overlay that's been approved for them.

914
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:12,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So their overlay would still be maintained at that location as long as they build that project that they proposed within a timely manner, which is two years.

915
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:16,378
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to pull building permits within two years of getting permission.

916
01:20:16,955 --> 01:20:20,938
[SPEAKER_09]: then they can build that project that has already been approved.

917
01:20:21,339 --> 01:20:24,862
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is just sort of, because you can't leave it blank.

918
01:20:24,962 --> 01:20:28,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was supposed to be a much taller building.

919
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:29,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would that be?

920
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:42,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is it's not, when you look at what the actual description of that is, that's not what it says.

921
01:20:42,917 --> 01:20:44,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It says up to how many stories.

922
01:20:44,954 --> 01:20:51,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You are two says up to three storey possible fourth incentive.

923
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:57,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's not what's being proposed right walkling port court and what my point is it's not being proposed.

924
01:20:57,818 --> 01:21:06,081
[SPEAKER_09]: It was proposed, it was approved, and they're getting the building permits, and they're doing I believe six story buildings with four story.

925
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:11,063
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's approved separately from this zoning process.

926
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:14,624
[SPEAKER_17]: It kind of would be confusing for somebody that doesn't know that.

927
01:21:17,684 --> 01:21:21,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so we should include the overlay in some of our maps.

928
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:26,326
[SPEAKER_19]: Does everybody know the difference between a base district and an overlay?

929
01:21:26,366 --> 01:21:28,547
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if you don't, this could be a very confusing

930
01:21:29,358 --> 01:21:30,159
[SPEAKER_19]: conversation.

931
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:30,539
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

932
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,885
[SPEAKER_19]: So a base, everybody who owns property is zoned for something.

933
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:37,526
[SPEAKER_19]: That is your base district.

934
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:39,488
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the table, sits right here.

935
01:21:40,389 --> 01:21:44,193
[SPEAKER_19]: An overlay district sits on top of that base district.

936
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:46,195
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called an overlay district.

937
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:51,701
[SPEAKER_19]: And what an overlay district does is it gives a property owner a different set of options.

938
01:21:52,361 --> 01:21:58,824
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you are a property owner and you have a base district, you can develop under that base district.

939
01:21:59,845 --> 01:22:05,107
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have an overlay district on top of it, you can choose to do the overlay district instead.

940
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:07,769
[SPEAKER_19]: The critical point is you can't pick and choose.

941
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:10,150
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can't say, oh, you know what?

942
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:16,053
[SPEAKER_19]: I really like the height in the overlay district, but I like the setbacks in the base district a lot better.

943
01:22:16,773 --> 01:22:22,635
[SPEAKER_19]: Once you choose the district you're going to develop under, that's the district you're stuck with.

944
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:24,516
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to follow the rules of that district.

945
01:22:24,936 --> 01:22:35,601
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why they could do a different building height and different types of buildings from the base district, but everyone always has to have a base district.

946
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:41,564
[SPEAKER_19]: One question should be is you are to the appropriate base district for that site.

947
01:22:42,185 --> 01:22:48,929
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's not but that you are to is currently our sort of highest level of residential only district.

948
01:22:49,349 --> 01:22:57,455
[SPEAKER_19]: If we were going to change that we would then have to something that match the height that they're doing under the overlay, we'd have to change it to a commercial district and

949
01:22:58,095 --> 01:23:00,776
[SPEAKER_19]: I suspect that's probably not the desired results.

950
01:23:00,936 --> 01:23:10,580
[SPEAKER_19]: So sometime, frequently an overlay is used as an incentive that allows something different from the base district and that's where the options come in.

951
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,821
[SPEAKER_17]: I think adding what that overlay is there.

952
01:23:14,941 --> 01:23:18,763
[SPEAKER_19]: We can put the district down.

953
01:23:19,303 --> 01:23:22,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is this this and I know they're putting in six stories.

954
01:23:22,418 --> 01:23:26,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, counselor bears asked us to do it on Monday, we just didn't have a chance to do it before this.

955
01:23:26,561 --> 01:23:27,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, Tuesday I forgot it.

956
01:23:28,122 --> 01:23:30,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Monday was a holiday wasn't that a long week.

957
01:23:31,624 --> 01:23:36,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, to do it on Tuesday at our check in we haven't had a chance to do it but we will thank you for that.

958
01:23:36,227 --> 01:23:43,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Alicia anybody we're talking about as well for the.

959
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, absolutely.

960
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:44,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

961
01:23:47,566 --> 01:23:51,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Kit is going to go to a question.

962
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,676
[SPEAKER_09]: We should go back to the audience and then we'll go back to the online.

963
01:23:57,936 --> 01:23:59,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

964
01:24:03,981 --> 01:24:10,988
[SPEAKER_11]: So just a general question about development to the extent that this is promoting more stuff.

965
01:24:12,834 --> 01:24:18,059
[SPEAKER_11]: What considerations have been made with respect to greenery, trees, et cetera?

966
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:30,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And two, from an infrastructure standpoint, is electric, water, and sewer up to all of this without some major reconstruction?

967
01:24:31,791 --> 01:24:33,591
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll be happy to answer the greenery.

968
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:45,295
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a great question for these district, except actually part of your urban residential too, this would apply to the multiple unit dwelling and for the other, the mixed use.

969
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:53,477
[SPEAKER_19]: A green score, what's called a green score, it was passed earlier by city council that would apply to all of these districts.

970
01:24:54,037 --> 01:24:58,018
[SPEAKER_19]: And a green score requires that the developer meet

971
01:24:59,419 --> 01:25:05,184
[SPEAKER_19]: basically a menu of requirements and what they do is of that menu has to do with stormwater management.

972
01:25:05,505 --> 01:25:07,346
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to do with tree plantings.

973
01:25:07,747 --> 01:25:13,032
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to do with the depth of soil because a lot of people plant trees without enough soil and they die.

974
01:25:13,392 --> 01:25:14,353
[SPEAKER_19]: So the depth of soil.

975
01:25:14,853 --> 01:25:25,880
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a point system, and the developer identifies the things that they're doing, they multiply it by the point system, they add it up, and it has to hit a certain number.

976
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:41,970
[SPEAKER_19]: The key to that is that there's a flexibility in how they hit that number, but that number is what produces the elements that manage stormwater, reduce heat island effect, provide trees and greenery for the area.

977
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:47,192
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also some strategies for green and blue or green or blue roofs in there.

978
01:25:47,552 --> 01:25:49,352
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's a key to look at.

979
01:25:49,852 --> 01:25:55,014
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have it up on this computer, but we could probably pull it up outside if you want to see it.

980
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:56,494
[SPEAKER_19]: It's certainly on the website.

981
01:25:57,355 --> 01:26:07,618
[SPEAKER_19]: And then in terms of infrastructure, so this and some other questions that we often get for zoning is one of those that's really frustrating for people in a zoning process.

982
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:10,660
[SPEAKER_19]: because zoning does not speak to infrastructure.

983
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:17,826
[SPEAKER_19]: So I as a zoning consultant get to turn that back over to the city for discussion.

984
01:26:17,966 --> 01:26:28,835
[SPEAKER_19]: But in general, what happens and this is where that site plan review, and special permit process becomes so important, because that's generally where those questions are asked is,

985
01:26:29,315 --> 01:26:36,520
[SPEAKER_19]: When a specific development comes in, they have to show what capacity they're drawing on.

986
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:44,045
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there is the city staff reviews the site plan review application or the special permit application.

987
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:48,027
[SPEAKER_19]: And then that's where that conversation about capacity happens.

988
01:26:48,407 --> 01:26:50,869
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't usually talk about it at the zoning stage.

989
01:26:51,349 --> 01:27:01,294
[SPEAKER_19]: because it would be very difficult to figure out what the needs would be over the next 20 or 30 years trying to factor in potential individual discussions.

990
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:05,176
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very appropriate at the review level.

991
01:27:05,196 --> 01:27:07,537
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

992
01:27:08,115 --> 01:27:08,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Emily.

993
01:27:08,695 --> 01:27:25,380
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think that's a very concise summary of what impact in mitigation studies we do, when, for what reason, especially when it comes to those larger developments that have, of course, more of an impact on our shared services and infrastructure than

994
01:27:28,007 --> 01:27:33,772
[SPEAKER_18]: probably any purely residential building except for, you know, the largest of multiplexes.

995
01:27:35,473 --> 01:27:39,817
[SPEAKER_18]: The largest developments will go through that review process, site plan review.

996
01:27:40,558 --> 01:27:48,404
[SPEAKER_18]: They will be subject to that greater scrutiny and in a lot of cases, you know, this public process of negotiation with the community over what is

997
01:27:50,207 --> 01:27:57,257
[SPEAKER_18]: What ought the community to get back when a large development, large enough to trigger this special review process comes in?

998
01:27:57,277 --> 01:28:03,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe there's also thresholds at which linkage and impact fees for certain shared

999
01:28:04,167 --> 01:28:04,447
development.

1000
01:28:04,887 --> 01:28:07,088
[SPEAKER_18]: It sorry for certain shared resources come into play.

1001
01:28:07,588 --> 01:28:16,731
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, smaller developments like a lot of your 1, 2 and 3 unit residential buildings are not subject to these kind of linkage fees, but larger developments.

1002
01:28:17,612 --> 01:28:22,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Um by statute do already pay into shared funds for things like police and fire.

1003
01:28:23,534 --> 01:28:26,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Water infrastructure, road infrastructure and all larger

1004
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I'll just add that.

1005
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:44,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So something to mention is that our other department heads, like I mentioned, traffic, like our DPW commissioner often watches these meetings in the evening at home as well.

1006
01:28:45,491 --> 01:28:49,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I happen to notice that he was watching this one, but we talk about these things.

1007
01:28:50,115 --> 01:28:51,536
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they have had.

1008
01:28:52,016 --> 01:28:58,479
[SPEAKER_09]: under this administration, our DPW commissioner has had assessments done of roads and sidewalks.

1009
01:28:58,519 --> 01:29:00,980
[SPEAKER_09]: So he has a list and what the statuses are.

1010
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:04,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's done that and looked, they're doing that in the water and sewer.

1011
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,022
[SPEAKER_09]: They know where the water pressure isn't as good.

1012
01:29:07,682 --> 01:29:16,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are various thresholds, they look at projects they can do to increase water pressure, to look at sewer if there are issues with capacity.

1013
01:29:16,845 --> 01:29:20,726
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're watching that and monitoring that all the time throughout the whole city.

1014
01:29:20,746 --> 01:29:23,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And water and sewer is its own enterprise.

1015
01:29:24,308 --> 01:29:29,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they have an enterprise capital fund and periodically they get bonds.

1016
01:29:29,269 --> 01:29:31,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen them ask for bonds, although I didn't pay

1017
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:43,604
[SPEAKER_09]: very close attention to which project this was this year so that they can continually increase sewer capacity, for example, but they're also always looking at the other things.

1018
01:29:44,697 --> 01:29:56,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, when we have the really big projects like we're doing the parcels in Medford Square, I explicitly said if this was a private developer, we would have them comment on the thing.

1019
01:29:56,987 --> 01:30:01,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And often they'll ask private developers, we need you to put in these connectors.

1020
01:30:01,611 --> 01:30:02,671
[SPEAKER_09]: We need you to add a loop.

1021
01:30:02,972 --> 01:30:04,653
[SPEAKER_09]: The water isn't good enough over here.

1022
01:30:04,713 --> 01:30:08,196
[SPEAKER_09]: We need you as part of this project to do this increased capacity line.

1023
01:30:08,656 --> 01:30:14,202
[SPEAKER_09]: and then the developers understand they have to do it or we literally can't provide the services to the building.

1024
01:30:14,662 --> 01:30:24,493
[SPEAKER_09]: For the one in Medford Square, they said we have the capacity for water and sewer in Medford Square, we're not concerned, you can keep going, you're not going to have to put that one on the developer this time.

1025
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:32,860
[SPEAKER_09]: but those are things that we look at with actual substantial, with concrete projects, as opposed to just what if.

1026
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:40,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And a little bit of that is there are things, there are sources of funding the city gets that are population dependent.

1027
01:30:40,866 --> 01:30:44,349
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, people say, well, you're gonna make, the schools are gonna be overcrowded.

1028
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:46,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, schools get funding per student.

1029
01:30:47,231 --> 01:30:49,053
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the number of students goes up, there is,

1030
01:30:49,713 --> 01:31:02,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm chapter something funding I'm going to get roads and sewers can view 70 is schools nine chapter 90 is roads and that money goes up when there are more students when schools get so.

1031
01:31:04,495 --> 01:31:09,538
[SPEAKER_09]: You can either build a new school because your old school is so decrepit that you have to have one.

1032
01:31:09,598 --> 01:31:12,780
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the card we're playing on Medford High, frankly.

1033
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:18,244
[SPEAKER_09]: The other is your schools are overcrowded and now you need more schools.

1034
01:31:18,344 --> 01:31:22,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the other reason that the state will give you money to help build new schools.

1035
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:30,912
[SPEAKER_09]: They will not give you money because you think someday they will be overcrowded or you're projecting the population will be too high.

1036
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:37,056
[SPEAKER_09]: They will only do it once it becomes too high or you're hitting that threshold.

1037
01:31:37,437 --> 01:31:43,661
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's part of the, it's the balance that we pay and how we fund things, at least in Massachusetts.

1038
01:31:44,862 --> 01:31:46,784
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we want to move on?

1039
01:31:46,804 --> 01:31:48,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say Boston Ave's been decimated.

1040
01:31:48,865 --> 01:31:52,027
[SPEAKER_02]: They cut out all the trees when they put in the green line.

1041
01:31:52,728 --> 01:31:53,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing has been replaced.

1042
01:31:54,338 --> 01:31:54,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1043
01:31:54,758 --> 01:31:56,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be taken care of.

1044
01:31:57,219 --> 01:31:57,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It never was.

1045
01:31:57,919 --> 01:31:58,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So Boston.

1046
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:04,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of the trees that were grown there were in the Boston that were in the the railroad right of way.

1047
01:32:05,242 --> 01:32:09,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And they the MBTA has put their foot down that they can't have them there.

1048
01:32:09,363 --> 01:32:11,724
[SPEAKER_09]: They're afraid of branches dropping on the lines.

1049
01:32:13,265 --> 01:32:17,506
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been working with Tufts with this new dorm to take advantage of that.

1050
01:32:17,586 --> 01:32:19,507
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the things that was approved

1051
01:32:20,027 --> 01:32:26,968
[SPEAKER_09]: is that the, so the other thing is the Catch-22 is that you can't put tall trees under power lines.

1052
01:32:27,468 --> 01:32:34,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the railroad side, the MBTA won't let us put big leafy trees with big branches because they're afraid of the train tracks.

1053
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:37,230
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have the power lines on the other side of the street.

1054
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:45,832
[SPEAKER_09]: So we actually, well, we, Tufts with the city together got National Grid to agree to move the power lines to the railroad side.

1055
01:32:46,252 --> 01:32:52,185
[SPEAKER_09]: So that we could put big leafy trees well they'll start smaller, but they will grow to be big leafy trees on.

1056
01:32:52,822 --> 01:32:55,083
[SPEAKER_09]: the dorm side of the street.

1057
01:32:55,703 --> 01:33:03,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have, we're working on some agreements to put some more evergreens and stuff on the- You can put those kind of tall bushes and stuff.

1058
01:33:03,566 --> 01:33:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1059
01:33:04,087 --> 01:33:18,252
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been working on the, between the T and Tufts and the city to get to some agreement on some evergreen type things that can go along the railroad side of it as part of this Tufts construction.

1060
01:33:18,272 --> 01:33:22,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have any sense of what the timeline is for that.

1061
01:33:22,874 --> 01:33:26,795
[SPEAKER_09]: but I think that we've gotten the agreement for those at this point.

1062
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:29,675
[SPEAKER_02]: How much money do we get from Tufts when we do all of this stuff?

1063
01:33:30,816 --> 01:33:34,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not, so you're asking about the money we get from Tufts.

1064
01:33:34,957 --> 01:33:36,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are two different things.

1065
01:33:36,237 --> 01:33:39,037
[SPEAKER_09]: One is our pilot payments, which is negotiated from the mayor.

1066
01:33:39,337 --> 01:33:41,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannot speak to that off the top of my head.

1067
01:33:41,818 --> 01:33:44,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that is just not information that I just have.

1068
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:51,600
[SPEAKER_09]: But then as we do individual projects, then we ask for sort of mitigation payments and mitigation work.

1069
01:33:52,021 --> 01:34:00,507
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the things that Tufts has agreed to for the dorm is to do a full study of Boston Ave, a complete street study.

1070
01:34:01,062 --> 01:34:02,503
[SPEAKER_09]: What should the traffic look like?

1071
01:34:02,543 --> 01:34:03,684
[SPEAKER_09]: What should the lanes look like?

1072
01:34:03,744 --> 01:34:06,546
[SPEAKER_09]: What should the bike lanes, what should the sidewalks look like?

1073
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:13,690
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's going to be some amount of sidewalk rebuilding that's above and beyond immediately what's in front of the dorm.

1074
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:22,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I know that they have an agreement that they worked out with Medford's engineering department that I think I was sent earlier in the week and I have not frankly been able to look at yet.

1075
01:34:23,016 --> 01:34:26,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that stuff accessible to me to go look that stuff up?

1076
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:39,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that off the top of my head is about that, because I'd like you know to me that's transparency, right, and some of it is, frankly, that area, we have a communications department in the city of two.

1077
01:34:41,255 --> 01:34:56,809
[SPEAKER_09]: We for the toughs for the zoning page, counselor Collins has been working very hard with our communication staff that she just feeds them all the information they just they just update whatever she tells them to put on that page, because it's not enough bandwidth for them to pay attention.

1078
01:34:57,209 --> 01:35:03,795
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of this is all of us just remembering to always send them all the stuff that we need all the time.

1079
01:35:04,576 --> 01:35:05,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, we're fallible.

1080
01:35:06,317 --> 01:35:09,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't, we haven't figured out how to get all of this up all the time.

1081
01:35:09,499 --> 01:35:10,919
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have the bandwidth to do it.

1082
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's really the answer to it.

1083
01:35:14,882 --> 01:35:15,482
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying.

1084
01:35:17,783 --> 01:35:19,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, we're just like kind of regular folk.

1085
01:35:20,124 --> 01:35:20,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1086
01:35:20,645 --> 01:35:26,528
[SPEAKER_09]: TOPS has a lot of information online as well for the community and about the new dorm.

1087
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,450
[SPEAKER_09]: And that information might be available on their page.

1088
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:33,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it doesn't really tell you all that kind of stuff.

1089
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious about how much Tufts is paying in because I'm looking at the large amount like on Boston Ave that Tufts owns, right?

1090
01:35:41,974 --> 01:35:45,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about that whole section and the impact it has.

1091
01:35:45,795 --> 01:35:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I want to make sure we're getting enough bang for the buck.

1092
01:35:51,931 --> 01:35:53,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, we need to keep.

1093
01:35:53,312 --> 01:36:01,176
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just want to say, I think this is, I think we're happy to answer some of these questions just to introduce yourself.

1094
01:36:01,276 --> 01:36:01,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1095
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:31,195
[SPEAKER_10]: 14 capen street medford tufts university um to answer the question of where this information is available the community development board did make a decision on site plan review there's a document there's about 25 pages that shows all the community benefits that are associated with the project those include a 1 million dollar neighborhood improvement fund

1096
01:36:33,476 --> 01:36:56,275
[SPEAKER_10]: $500,000 contribution to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, as Alicia was talking about, $500,000 for a planning study, new sidewalks, new trees, new bike lanes on both sides of Boston Avenue, a blue bike station on Boston Avenue, a free shuttle bus from the Medford campus to Medford Square, new crosswalks, a dedicated ride share zone.

1097
01:36:56,295 --> 01:36:58,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's also-

1098
01:36:59,377 --> 01:37:00,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody remembers Jim.

1099
01:37:01,337 --> 01:37:01,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1100
01:37:02,218 --> 01:37:15,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and I don't know the technical knowledge about this but I'll just say it, an infiltration and inflow mitigation project so basically a public works project that the city engineer asked us to do.

1101
01:37:18,021 --> 01:37:19,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, did you say that information is available.

1102
01:37:20,778 --> 01:37:31,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you go to the Community Development Board's website, they should have the past decisions and all those items were conditioned as part of that approval.

1103
01:37:31,782 --> 01:37:36,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I will note when you go on there, it says that the Neighborhood Improvement Fund was $500,000.

1104
01:37:37,344 --> 01:37:40,365
[SPEAKER_10]: After meeting with neighbors, we actually increased it to a million dollars.

1105
01:37:40,765 --> 01:37:46,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the one thing that's different from what I said on there, but that should all be publicly accessible.

1106
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:49,610
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an honor.

1107
01:37:49,850 --> 01:38:13,532
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the question is really helpful in illuminating that this is crucial context that the community wants as we especially as we go forward and talk about the toughest institutional zone which is a little distinct about from the proposal that we're shown tonight so I'm going to make sure that the communications department works to have that information that Rocco just discussed the updated version linked on our zoning websites that when folks are thinking about Boston out thinking about the institutional zone and the corridors

1108
01:38:14,413 --> 01:38:15,855
[SPEAKER_18]: That's in the right place for them to find them.

1109
01:38:15,915 --> 01:38:16,977
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for bringing that up.

1110
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:20,723
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had a hand up on zoom for a while.

1111
01:38:20,743 --> 01:38:22,926
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to go to them.

1112
01:38:22,947 --> 01:38:25,531
[SPEAKER_18]: Yuko I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1113
01:38:29,437 --> 01:38:31,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Yuko Okabe.

1114
01:38:32,419 --> 01:38:40,867
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, my address is 55 Winchester Street, so I am very close to kind of that Somerville-Medford border.

1115
01:38:41,787 --> 01:38:48,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to say up front that I'm very much in favor of this new zoning and just the opportunity to build more housing.

1116
01:38:49,073 --> 01:38:59,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also interested in how you'll work with the city of Somerville to kind of align the Medford and Somerville zoning rules for that split parcel along Broadway.

1117
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:12,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, like, in what ways do you think or have you seen that more housing will help local businesses succeed and grow in the corridor we're talking about tonight, whether it be like along

1118
01:39:14,631 --> 01:39:21,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Broadway or Boston Ave, where I'm closest to, or even Main Street or other corridors that have businesses.

1119
01:39:26,863 --> 01:39:27,663
[SPEAKER_09]: The Broadway corridor?

1120
01:39:28,904 --> 01:39:31,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm trying to answer too many questions at once.

1121
01:39:33,638 --> 01:39:36,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so there was a study done.

1122
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:39,201
[SPEAKER_09]: So, actually for the Broadway corridor.

1123
01:39:40,142 --> 01:39:55,510
[SPEAKER_09]: The city of Somerville identified this as a problem, and I don't know if everybody realizes this but there are a number of parcels along that area that are half in Medford and half in Somerville, and that makes it really hard to develop the parcels.

1124
01:39:56,630 --> 01:40:05,555
[SPEAKER_09]: So a couple of years ago, Somerville got a grant to do a joint project between Medford and Somerville to look at those parcels.

1125
01:40:06,095 --> 01:40:14,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So Somerville has, I'm just going to say it, they have seven times the staffing in their planning office as Medford does.

1126
01:40:14,499 --> 01:40:21,363
[SPEAKER_09]: For the 10 staff in my office, there are 70 in there, including their own communications division within planning.

1127
01:40:21,783 --> 01:40:22,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1128
01:40:23,145 --> 01:40:36,059
[SPEAKER_09]: So they managed the project and the consultants, but we did come out with a Broadway corridor study, which I have provided to Emily, there was a whole number of public meetings in that area around the Broadway corridor.

1129
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and they came out with recommendations.

1130
01:40:39,903 --> 01:40:47,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And so at this time we are taking those recommendations and implementing them with the heights and stuff that you see on our side of the street.

1131
01:40:48,289 --> 01:40:52,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is our hope that Somerville, because this was their project, will be

1132
01:40:53,393 --> 01:41:01,342
[SPEAKER_09]: doing the same on their side of the street or on their sides of the parcels in some cases so that we can have matching zoning.

1133
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:10,692
[SPEAKER_09]: The difficulty down there is though that the process is different and at this time they are continuing to require that all buildings

1134
01:41:11,192 --> 01:41:21,997
[SPEAKER_09]: even if there's just a few feet of building on the Somerville side of the border, go through a full Somerville process in addition to any Medford process that there might be.

1135
01:41:22,817 --> 01:41:29,360
[SPEAKER_09]: So our hope is that if a building is small enough and it meets the zoning, they can just build it, at least on the Medford side,

1136
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and whether or not they need to then have public meetings, etcetera on them.

1137
01:41:34,842 --> 01:41:40,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Somerville does require several more public meetings for every building they build than Medford does.

1138
01:41:41,245 --> 01:41:45,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we have had a few buildings kind of get caught in this back and forth.

1139
01:41:46,127 --> 01:41:51,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we have also been talking about and they did agree to this idea that if

1140
01:41:52,170 --> 01:42:06,435
[SPEAKER_09]: a building was going through both processes that our staff would make an effort to talk to each other and if necessary show up at each other's planning board meetings in order to prevent the board's

1141
01:42:07,637 --> 01:42:19,523
[SPEAKER_09]: giving them requirements that were in conflict with each other and not having us rely on a developer saying, but Somerville said I had to do this, because we don't want them playing mom against dad.

1142
01:42:20,363 --> 01:42:26,706
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like mom and dad to talk to each other and make sure that, in fact, if Somerville is requiring X,

1143
01:42:28,367 --> 01:42:37,439
[SPEAKER_09]: that it's Somerville that is telling us that because we can be accommodating and we can try and work with them to to be able to develop some nice buildings along there.

1144
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:44,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was a very long way of saying we're really working with them on this so and I have their numbers and they answer my calls so.

1145
01:42:47,242 --> 01:42:47,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1146
01:42:47,822 --> 01:42:48,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Alicia.

1147
01:42:48,703 --> 01:43:04,933
[SPEAKER_18]: And just to the second part of that question around how we're kind of, are we thinking about how increasing, I think the question was, are we thinking about how increasing housing close to mixed use districts and commercial districts, how those two things go together?

1148
01:43:05,353 --> 01:43:12,418
[SPEAKER_18]: That's very much been a theme of our discussions of putting together the zoning, putting those proposals together.

1149
01:43:12,658 --> 01:43:13,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, getting late in the evening.

1150
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:28,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And that pertains to certainly much, much more of the zoning than just the specific areas we've been talking about tonight, but thinking very intentionally about what is the right

1151
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:50,385
[SPEAKER_18]: level of residential intensity to place near what is the right level of commercial intensity, both so that people in their residential areas have access to the amenities that they want that are useful to them in the ways that they want, some things that is appropriate to drive to, some things people want to be able to walk to, and also making sure that

1152
01:43:51,025 --> 01:44:07,452
[SPEAKER_18]: at the same time as we were trying to incentivize and encourage more businesses and small businesses to come into Medford, to stay where they are, to grow in new places, that there is the base of people that will be there to welcome them and support them and patronize them so that they can really take root and stay there.

1153
01:44:08,332 --> 01:44:12,334
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's just a little bit of the thinking about that intersection.

1154
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:25,088
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just add to that, if you don't mind, there's a lot of research about the impact of having housing close to downtown, close to commercial areas, and the impact that they have on local businesses.

1155
01:44:25,108 --> 01:44:29,093
[SPEAKER_19]: If we find that something that people are interested in, we can certainly pull some

1156
01:44:29,862 --> 01:44:33,904
[SPEAKER_19]: examples and case studies and provide them for people to look at.

1157
01:44:34,164 --> 01:44:35,665
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's a lot of research out there.

1158
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:42,708
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one of the things that happened when downtown's hollowed out and there weren't people living there, is there wasn't the audience, there weren't the customers there.

1159
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:47,009
[SPEAKER_19]: But as Kit said, it's trying to get the balance right.

1160
01:44:47,149 --> 01:44:53,132
[SPEAKER_19]: That is important, is what is right where, and that throughout this process has been an ongoing conversation.

1161
01:44:54,949 --> 01:44:55,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1162
01:44:55,309 --> 01:44:58,970
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go back to the podium and then back to Zoom.

1163
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:00,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to you first.

1164
01:45:00,911 --> 01:45:01,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1165
01:45:03,671 --> 01:45:05,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Pauline Fiorello, Warren Street in Medford.

1166
01:45:06,272 --> 01:45:08,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Lifelong resident of Medford.

1167
01:45:08,033 --> 01:45:10,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been very proud of the history of Medford.

1168
01:45:11,634 --> 01:45:15,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm concerned about with the new development

1169
01:45:16,178 --> 01:45:17,619
[SPEAKER_05]: how those things are gonna look.

1170
01:45:17,739 --> 01:45:21,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And I probably know the answer to this question, I'm gonna ask it anyway.

1171
01:45:21,803 --> 01:45:38,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I'm on Salem Street, there's a building in West Medford right now going in, I know it's not complete, but I would hate to see the historic flavor somewhat of the city be replaced by big boxy, non appealing looking buildings.

1172
01:45:39,616 --> 01:45:48,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any influence to the development of new buildings going in and what those are going to look like?

1173
01:45:48,987 --> 01:45:54,654
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that is an excellent question.

1174
01:45:54,714 --> 01:45:59,579
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a couple of things in the way that we're looking at the zoning that

1175
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:06,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Reflect what's going on in history and that's 1 of the reasons I showed you that you can see on the interactive map when things were built.

1176
01:46:07,065 --> 01:46:14,489
[SPEAKER_19]: So, on the residential side, we're looking at historic conversions to make it easier for people to put more units in the building.

1177
01:46:14,529 --> 01:46:16,511
[SPEAKER_19]: So to be less likely to tear it down.

1178
01:46:17,652 --> 01:46:18,512
[SPEAKER_19]: really important.

1179
01:46:19,173 --> 01:46:22,575
[SPEAKER_19]: On the commercial, the mixed-use side, there's a couple of areas.

1180
01:46:22,595 --> 01:46:24,997
[SPEAKER_19]: I can think of one in particular, Medford Square.

1181
01:46:25,057 --> 01:46:35,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, we're not talking about that today, but it's a good example, is somebody challenged why we had put this lower, you know, Medford Square, we want more height.

1182
01:46:35,464 --> 01:46:37,766
[SPEAKER_19]: Why did you put just an MX1 in there?

1183
01:46:38,246 --> 01:46:43,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the reason is the buildings on that side, the ones that back up to the river, the buildings are historic.

1184
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:48,935
[SPEAKER_19]: There's not enough land there anyway to redevelop with parking on the site.

1185
01:46:49,456 --> 01:46:54,440
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't want to create an incentive for those buildings to be redeveloped.

1186
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,902
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something that we can look at, right?

1187
01:46:57,022 --> 01:47:01,566
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you preserve your existing building stock, historic building stock?

1188
01:47:02,395 --> 01:47:09,464
[SPEAKER_19]: that's part of the culture, the history, the development patterns, the character, the feel of Medford.

1189
01:47:09,504 --> 01:47:11,466
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we want to do that.

1190
01:47:11,486 --> 01:47:17,114
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of new buildings, in terms of infill development, there's a couple of different things that we can look at.

1191
01:47:17,334 --> 01:47:20,157
[SPEAKER_19]: One is development standards, which I've mentioned before.

1192
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:24,383
[SPEAKER_19]: that can be used in both site plan review and the special permit.

1193
01:47:24,764 --> 01:47:35,259
[SPEAKER_19]: We can put some components of architectural design in there, and then how to think about putting in good infill that's responsive and reflective of the context.

1194
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,361
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have to be careful sometimes.

1195
01:47:37,461 --> 01:47:39,162
[SPEAKER_19]: The context isn't what you would want it.

1196
01:47:39,182 --> 01:47:47,006
[SPEAKER_19]: I can remember one community that I was in where we were yattering on about this, and they said, we don't actually like our current buildings.

1197
01:47:47,066 --> 01:47:48,867
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you please give us something else?

1198
01:47:49,288 --> 01:47:53,510
[SPEAKER_19]: But in a community like yours where you like the buildings, we want to look at the development standards.

1199
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:55,972
[SPEAKER_19]: The other way to do it is design guidelines.

1200
01:47:56,092 --> 01:47:59,914
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are ways of, there are different levels of design guidelines.

1201
01:48:00,454 --> 01:48:03,616
[SPEAKER_19]: I always say, if you want to make something mandatory, it should be in the zoning.

1202
01:48:04,033 --> 01:48:11,378
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to be very careful when you talk about design guidelines in the zoning in some situations, but that's one way of doing it.

1203
01:48:11,759 --> 01:48:16,782
[SPEAKER_19]: The other is to have a supplementary set of advisory design guidelines.

1204
01:48:17,122 --> 01:48:19,604
[SPEAKER_19]: You can really get in more into styles there.

1205
01:48:20,365 --> 01:48:27,650
[SPEAKER_19]: Most developers I have met would much rather have a set of advisory design guidelines and say,

1206
01:48:28,393 --> 01:48:37,217
[SPEAKER_19]: that's what the community wants, I'm going to come in with that, rather than come in and kind of guess at what the community wants to see.

1207
01:48:37,637 --> 01:48:40,178
[SPEAKER_19]: So it can be a powerful discussion tool.

1208
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:50,483
[SPEAKER_19]: I like both development standards and design guidelines, if they're well done, because it allows the community development board, the developer, and the public to be

1209
01:48:50,883 --> 01:48:53,544
[SPEAKER_19]: all on the same page about what's being discussed.

1210
01:48:53,864 --> 01:48:55,604
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's certainly a way of doing it.

1211
01:48:55,664 --> 01:48:59,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Now there's a third option, which is a local historic district.

1212
01:48:59,565 --> 01:49:08,446
[SPEAKER_19]: So if your building is on the national register, or you're in a national register district or state register district, you don't actually have any protections.

1213
01:49:08,746 --> 01:49:17,308
[SPEAKER_19]: You have the ability to apply for historic tax credits if you're renovating an income producing process, property rather.

1214
01:49:17,688 --> 01:49:19,069
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to follow certain standards.

1215
01:49:19,229 --> 01:49:25,531
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a whole complex matter, but the buildings aren't actually in a local historic district.

1216
01:49:25,831 --> 01:49:30,473
[SPEAKER_19]: There is a little bit more protection and there's also more teeth in terms of design guidelines.

1217
01:49:30,926 --> 01:49:36,952
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a whole process to go through that to get a local historic district and get the historic design guidelines.

1218
01:49:37,352 --> 01:49:41,816
[SPEAKER_19]: That is outside zoning in terms of it's not a zoning thing.

1219
01:49:41,896 --> 01:49:46,060
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't zone you a local historic district, but they can work together.

1220
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,862
[SPEAKER_19]: So that might be something to consider.

1221
01:49:52,678 --> 01:49:52,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1222
01:49:53,018 --> 01:49:59,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

1223
01:49:59,541 --> 01:50:01,722
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't mind, we'll go back to Zoom and then to you.

1224
01:50:01,742 --> 01:50:04,804
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Rich, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

1225
01:50:06,916 --> 01:50:07,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1226
01:50:07,216 --> 01:50:08,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

1227
01:50:08,677 --> 01:50:10,398
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question.

1228
01:50:10,758 --> 01:50:19,402
[SPEAKER_15]: My area in South Medford is proposed to change from general residential to urban residential one.

1229
01:50:19,422 --> 01:50:26,005
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering how many units can be hosted?

1230
01:50:26,045 --> 01:50:35,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any change in the number of residential units that can be hosted on a property that is to be zoned as urban residential one?

1231
01:50:42,438 --> 01:50:45,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Rich, please correct me if I'm reciting your question wrong.

1232
01:50:45,739 --> 01:51:03,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you were asking about when you're it sounds like in your neighborhood in particular, you're saying that your area is proposed to change to you are one you're asking is there any way that the maximum number of units that could be constructed in you are one could that be changed?

1233
01:51:05,264 --> 01:51:07,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, could it be changed?

1234
01:51:07,865 --> 01:51:09,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Or is it being changed?

1235
01:51:10,889 --> 01:51:14,152
[SPEAKER_19]: In other words, is he asking whether or not his area is being changed?

1236
01:51:14,373 --> 01:51:15,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Rich, you can probably hear me.

1237
01:51:15,694 --> 01:51:25,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you asking whether or not your area is, the number of units in your area is being changed, or if we can change the proposed recommendation for UR1?

1238
01:51:26,607 --> 01:51:34,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, right now I'm seeing on the proposed map, our GIS map that it's changing to urban residential one.

1239
01:51:34,812 --> 01:51:35,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1240
01:51:37,353 --> 01:51:42,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now my property is a three unit, three family property.

1241
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:47,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering, can the number of units be expanded?

1242
01:51:49,761 --> 01:51:52,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so thank you for clarifying that.

1243
01:51:53,525 --> 01:52:00,772
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not really talking about the residential districts now, but because this is a very quick question, I can I can answer that.

1244
01:52:01,292 --> 01:52:04,656
[SPEAKER_19]: So, urban residential 1 allows a 2 unit dwelling.

1245
01:52:05,196 --> 01:52:19,809
[SPEAKER_19]: It allows historic conversion, a townhouse, a three-unit dwelling, a multiplex, which is a four to six units, and then it allows an accessory dwelling unit for the one, two, or the three-unit dwellings only.

1246
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:23,713
[SPEAKER_19]: So the maximum that district would allow is a six unit.

1247
01:52:24,795 --> 01:52:25,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Six unit.

1248
01:52:25,816 --> 01:52:26,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1249
01:52:27,156 --> 01:52:27,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1250
01:52:27,376 --> 01:52:28,617
[SPEAKER_18]: That's under the current proposal.

1251
01:52:28,657 --> 01:52:30,458
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to clarify proposal.

1252
01:52:30,478 --> 01:52:31,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that hasn't been passed.

1253
01:52:31,699 --> 01:52:33,079
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just the current proposal.

1254
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:33,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1255
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,260
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1256
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:40,823
[SPEAKER_15]: The map is also saying a three story maximum height for the proposed.

1257
01:52:40,843 --> 01:52:42,484
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it is currently.

1258
01:52:43,045 --> 01:52:44,245
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that is correct.

1259
01:52:44,465 --> 01:52:46,526
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposed is a three story maximum.

1260
01:52:47,387 --> 01:52:47,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1261
01:52:49,672 --> 01:52:54,438
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I guess that's all my questions.

1262
01:52:54,538 --> 01:52:59,183
[SPEAKER_15]: It just looks like be able to add more units on the same floors.

1263
01:53:00,365 --> 01:53:03,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so you're thinking of doing a conversion?

1264
01:53:06,467 --> 01:53:14,572
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you want to reach out to the planning staff, when Alicia comes back, we can put the email address in the chat.

1265
01:53:14,933 --> 01:53:21,157
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have more specific questions, we'll be happy to answer that about your specific property.

1266
01:53:21,597 --> 01:53:21,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1267
01:53:21,937 --> 01:53:24,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So Alicia Hunt is the person to talk to?

1268
01:53:24,819 --> 01:53:25,159
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1269
01:53:25,319 --> 01:53:26,300
[SPEAKER_19]: I will reach out to her.

1270
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:27,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1271
01:53:27,961 --> 01:53:28,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1272
01:53:28,421 --> 01:53:29,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

1273
01:53:29,569 --> 01:53:29,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1274
01:53:30,030 --> 01:53:47,029
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will say for folks who have public comment, questions, concerns, suggestions that they want to make about the proposed residential district zoning, the next public meeting on that topic is this coming Wednesday, June 4, there's going to be a continuation

1275
01:53:49,051 --> 01:53:51,233
[SPEAKER_18]: of the public hearing in the Community Development Board.

1276
01:53:51,753 --> 01:53:53,054
[SPEAKER_18]: That is a Zoom only meeting.

1277
01:53:53,074 --> 01:53:58,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Folks are always welcome and encouraged to attend, and you can also send written comment.

1278
01:53:59,559 --> 01:54:04,163
[SPEAKER_18]: It's best to send that in by Monday so that board members have a chance to read it.

1279
01:54:04,243 --> 01:54:07,225
[SPEAKER_18]: So all are welcome to participate in that process as well.

1280
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:14,711
[SPEAKER_18]: The residential district zoning is still in the proposal stage, and that is the next public meeting on it.

1281
01:54:16,822 --> 01:54:18,003
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we'll go back to the podium.

1282
01:54:18,224 --> 01:54:18,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1283
01:54:21,928 --> 01:54:29,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street, pretty close to Boston.

1284
01:54:32,504 --> 01:54:38,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I was curious if we could maybe go back to the, excuse me, the proposed zoning map.

1285
01:54:39,848 --> 01:54:57,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering about the plan for Boston Ave between Winthrop and I guess the Parkway, but you know, the kind of piece of Somerville that sort of intrudes into Medford.

1286
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:01,020
[SPEAKER_14]: But what,

1287
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:07,503
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess, what's the sort of proposal for either side of the street there?

1288
01:55:07,523 --> 01:55:15,269
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like the southern side of Boston Ave is maybe not.

1289
01:55:18,771 --> 01:55:23,294
[SPEAKER_14]: So like, I guess on the other side of that, just south of the river.

1290
01:55:23,314 --> 01:55:29,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so like, right, just yeah, so like, just a little further north of where the cursor is there.

1291
01:55:29,379 --> 01:55:29,679
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the,

1292
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:34,087
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that plan to be?

1293
01:55:34,367 --> 01:55:37,789
[SPEAKER_14]: And could you talk about why?

1294
01:55:37,809 --> 01:55:46,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm generally pretty excited about this process, just kind of curious what the thinking is with that.

1295
01:55:46,755 --> 01:55:47,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1296
01:55:47,355 --> 01:55:50,918
[SPEAKER_19]: So the purple here is 2B, mixed-use 2B.

1297
01:55:51,418 --> 01:55:53,479
[SPEAKER_19]: The red is urban residential 2.

1298
01:55:53,999 --> 01:55:56,541
[SPEAKER_19]: The bright blue is mixed-use 2A.

1299
01:55:56,921 --> 01:55:58,983
[SPEAKER_19]: This lighter blue is mixed-use 1B.

1300
01:56:00,113 --> 01:56:06,838
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the faded back green and yellow are the residential only so once you are two and once you are one.

1301
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:11,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'd have to back up just double check.

1302
01:56:14,244 --> 01:56:15,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1303
01:56:16,208 --> 01:56:20,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it sort of strikes me that, like, 1 side of the street is like, very tall.

1304
01:56:20,172 --> 01:56:25,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other side is not is, I guess, what's the thinking?

1305
01:56:25,897 --> 01:56:29,561
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, obviously you see the, the, the, the green and the a lot here.

1306
01:56:29,581 --> 01:56:31,543
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are residential only district.

1307
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:31,723
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

1308
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:37,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, this goes back to the comment previous speaker made of that.

1309
01:56:37,845 --> 01:56:43,689
[SPEAKER_19]: I absolutely we're very much looking at what's on the ground now and enhancing that.

1310
01:56:43,869 --> 01:56:50,733
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, when we looked at the curtains only here, I don't have a zoom.

1311
01:56:50,773 --> 01:56:52,675
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess if you have a zoom in, um.

1312
01:56:53,560 --> 01:57:03,671
[SPEAKER_19]: So you know, we're looking here, here's existing zoning, you've got office, you've got general residential, you've got apartment one, and you've got commercial in this area.

1313
01:57:03,691 --> 01:57:11,860
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking at those pieces, the pieces in white above and below, those are existing residential districts.

1314
01:57:12,636 --> 01:57:17,760
[SPEAKER_19]: single family one and single family two, and a little bit of apartment two down here.

1315
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:24,105
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we're trying to do with the corridors is we're looking at the corridors, of course, we want to be generally mixed use.

1316
01:57:24,526 --> 01:57:30,370
[SPEAKER_19]: But that doesn't mean that every single property in a corridor is zoned for mixed use.

1317
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:36,395
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the things you're seeing here in the proposed zoning, sorry for making you all dizzy here,

1318
01:57:36,935 --> 01:57:43,104
[SPEAKER_19]: is that you do have this urban residential too, which is residential only along the quarter.

1319
01:57:43,144 --> 01:57:46,088
[SPEAKER_19]: That's because you've got an existing residential only there.

1320
01:57:46,469 --> 01:57:53,098
[SPEAKER_19]: So, when we think of a quarter with the search of land, a quarter basically takes you from one place to the other price.

1321
01:57:53,671 --> 01:58:00,436
[SPEAKER_19]: As we're looking at the stretch of land, we recognize in most quarters, identity of the border changes as you move through it.

1322
01:58:00,936 --> 01:58:10,023
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what we're trying to do is tackle up those changes, looking at what's there now, zoning to reduce the number of non-conformities.

1323
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:29,395
[SPEAKER_19]: and then focusing the mixed-use portion where it makes the most sense, given what's existing now, given the relationship of those areas to the adjacent areas, and then looking at the change in the use and the identity of the corridors and all that's generally

1324
01:58:31,848 --> 01:58:39,593
[SPEAKER_19]: For looking at specific parcels and zooming in, I would talk with Paul and Jimmy outside if you've got very specific questions.

1325
01:58:39,853 --> 01:58:40,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1326
01:58:40,294 --> 01:58:40,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1327
01:58:40,734 --> 01:58:46,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think generally, I'd support more density in the area.

1328
01:58:46,738 --> 01:58:56,825
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be great to sort of see the sort of, just frankly, like the commercial opportunities, different places to go in the area.

1329
01:58:57,545 --> 01:59:01,068
[SPEAKER_14]: A little more expansive,

1330
01:59:01,768 --> 01:59:20,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it also seems like a lot of the, uh, the residential, uh, and, you know, I'm not to, not to get too in the weeds, but it seems like a lot of the residential, uh, portions, uh, or residential buildings there currently are kind of like, uh, apartment the, uh, yeah.

1331
01:59:20,894 --> 01:59:22,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but I can talk to someone in the hall about that.

1332
01:59:23,155 --> 01:59:28,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I'll just know by the way, I zoomed into this one so you could get a better sense of the parcel sizes.

1333
01:59:29,091 --> 01:59:30,111
[SPEAKER_19]: for the different uses.

1334
01:59:30,171 --> 01:59:37,234
[SPEAKER_19]: So here's your UR2 and the parcel size, and here's where we get into the higher level mixed use.

1335
01:59:37,774 --> 01:59:41,015
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see the parcel sizes have changed, the uses have changed.

1336
01:59:41,836 --> 01:59:56,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, this area where we've got a mixed one, you've got sort of different conditions existing on the ground, but you might be able to get the basement even with the... There you go, different conditions existing on the ground.

1337
01:59:57,107 --> 01:59:59,269
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking at the adjacencies of this parcel.

1338
01:59:59,289 --> 02:00:06,316
[SPEAKER_19]: So I mentioned earlier when we were talking about a little bit about the Oh, actually, I didn't mention this conversation.

1339
02:00:06,637 --> 02:00:07,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I've had too many today.

1340
02:00:08,258 --> 02:00:15,466
[SPEAKER_19]: When we look at where the higher level, the higher density uses are, we look at how they step down into the neighborhoods.

1341
02:00:15,953 --> 02:00:25,959
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see here that this mixed-use 1B is acting as a buffer to the higher density blue here before you get to the neighborhoods.

1342
02:00:26,079 --> 02:00:28,240
[SPEAKER_19]: On the other side, you have the rail line as the buffer.

1343
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:39,647
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking at what we call adjacencies of uses and the densities so that we can step down and kind of feather any building height that's high here is feathered that back down into the neighborhoods.

1344
02:00:44,171 --> 02:00:50,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah, I mean, I'll talk to someone in the hall a little more, because I have some questions about that.

1345
02:00:52,355 --> 02:01:07,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but generally, like, just want to express my, you know, enthusiasm for having like a bit more density, and frankly, like, specifically, like, sort of more stuff to do with it's like, you know, within walking distance of me, so.

1346
02:01:07,483 --> 02:01:07,723
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1347
02:01:08,103 --> 02:01:09,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you, appreciate it.

1348
02:01:09,364 --> 02:01:10,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you, thank you very much.

1349
02:01:11,845 --> 02:01:12,546
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the question.

1350
02:01:12,586 --> 02:01:18,010
[SPEAKER_18]: I would also say to that point, this is a marketed as a Q&A.

1351
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:21,053
[SPEAKER_18]: This is also a excellent point in the process.

1352
02:01:21,113 --> 02:01:27,959
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, all points in the process are excellent points in the process to participate, but we are very eager to hear your suggestions on anything from.

1353
02:01:31,421 --> 02:01:36,465
[SPEAKER_18]: why should be X to I have a suggestion about the boundaries of this corridor.

1354
02:01:36,485 --> 02:01:38,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Why does it go here and not here?

1355
02:01:38,527 --> 02:01:42,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Comments like that suggestions are very valuable and welcomed at this stage.

1356
02:01:44,832 --> 02:01:46,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I also get concerned about the parking.

1357
02:01:47,594 --> 02:01:52,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that that's a bonus extension when we're talking about development, but it's a reality, unfortunately.

1358
02:01:54,052 --> 02:01:59,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the way that bus routes are in Bedford right now, and they're far few and far between.

1359
02:02:00,075 --> 02:02:03,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something so simplistic so I am concerned about that.

1360
02:02:04,397 --> 02:02:15,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on June 9, we'll be talking about parking on June 9, that would be great to delve into that part of the parking where were you talking about this area you're talking about the whole parking in general.

1361
02:02:19,225 --> 02:02:21,507
[SPEAKER_19]: That is a listening session on June 9th.

1362
02:02:21,527 --> 02:02:24,649
[SPEAKER_19]: So we really want to hear what people think about the library.

1363
02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:26,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's the one of the library, right?

1364
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:28,293
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I believe so.

1365
02:02:28,313 --> 02:02:28,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1366
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:31,275
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1367
02:02:31,535 --> 02:02:36,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other questions in the room?

1368
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:41,263
[SPEAKER_19]: I do want to make sure that those of you who are interested have time to.

1369
02:02:42,444 --> 02:02:46,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, feel free to to step out and talk to them.

1370
02:02:46,347 --> 02:02:46,808
[SPEAKER_08]: They're bored.

1371
02:02:49,124 --> 02:02:51,706
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we all the fun in here, did you tell them that?

1372
02:02:51,746 --> 02:02:56,409
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, William Navarro, Magood Square.

1373
02:02:58,070 --> 02:03:06,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Given lots of people commute further from the city to get home than they'd like to, I'm very glad to see this process is gonna make space for new houses and apartments.

1374
02:03:08,177 --> 02:03:13,040
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really a big problem in our day, just how far people have to move from the city.

1375
02:03:17,484 --> 02:03:30,666
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if I could hear a little bit about how making existing non-conforming single-story commercial, how that could potentially allow apartments to go on top of those buildings.

1376
02:03:30,906 --> 02:03:31,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1377
02:03:36,265 --> 02:03:42,568
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad you mentioned that because I think somebody else earlier talked about the change to existing buildings.

1378
02:03:42,688 --> 02:03:48,270
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, you have quite a few single story commercial buildings.

1379
02:03:48,970 --> 02:03:59,835
[SPEAKER_19]: The question becomes, and this is outside zoning, this is more on building code, are those buildings already structurally capable of adding an additional floor?

1380
02:04:00,615 --> 02:04:04,119
[SPEAKER_19]: So, if yes, that's a relatively easy process.

1381
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:09,185
[SPEAKER_19]: If no, those buildings would have to be redeveloped and there are different ways of doing that.

1382
02:04:09,626 --> 02:04:14,191
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's something where it's a nice facade, the facade could be saved and everything could be built behind it.

1383
02:04:15,510 --> 02:04:21,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of them, the facade of the building are not worth saving, but that structural capacity would be important.

1384
02:04:21,475 --> 02:04:38,330
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, zoning can say, you can do this, you can add that height, but it's going to be building code, cost of construction, property owner desire, developer desire, that's going to actually influence whether or not something gets built.

1385
02:04:38,810 --> 02:04:51,262
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why I talk about it being a 20 to 30 year look forward for zoning because some things could happen more quickly, and other things are going to require a change in one or sometimes even more business cycles.

1386
02:04:51,563 --> 02:04:58,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas today, if they wanted to add housing, they'd have to not only tear down the building, but they couldn't even bring the business back with the housing.

1387
02:04:58,447 --> 02:05:00,048
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is a good point.

1388
02:05:00,108 --> 02:05:04,850
[SPEAKER_19]: In some areas that are zoned commercial only, they wouldn't necessarily be able to have the housing use.

1389
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:09,032
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's no incentive to do anything with that building.

1390
02:05:09,372 --> 02:05:16,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what you're saying, we have a number, we have a lot of businesses in areas where businesses aren't technically allowed by zoning.

1391
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:21,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is actually a more complicated, like how would they be allowed to do that?

1392
02:05:21,357 --> 02:05:23,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Would they be allowed to tear down and build back?

1393
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,403
[SPEAKER_09]: People think I'm deceptive when I say it's complicated, but it is, right?

1394
02:05:28,443 --> 02:05:33,607
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd have to go get a finding from the Zoning Board of Appeals, whether or not they'd be allowed to do that.

1395
02:05:34,227 --> 02:05:35,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends.

1396
02:05:35,228 --> 02:05:37,870
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on how the neighborhood feels, right?

1397
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:39,551
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on a lot of things.

1398
02:05:40,712 --> 02:05:44,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of developers like certainty.

1399
02:05:44,535 --> 02:05:47,178
[SPEAKER_09]: people like certainty when they're going to build something.

1400
02:05:48,299 --> 02:05:54,625
[SPEAKER_09]: So, part of this is to figure out what we want to allow and then give them some level of certainty of that.

1401
02:05:56,827 --> 02:05:58,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And then say what we don't want to allow, right?

1402
02:05:59,009 --> 02:05:59,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1403
02:06:00,378 --> 02:06:07,479
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll be right now when somebody comes in and says, I really wanna do ground floor commercial and residential above.

1404
02:06:07,939 --> 02:06:12,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's in a place like there's literally there was a zoning board appeals hearing tonight.

1405
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:17,001
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one of those blocks that has commercial on the ground floor on main street.

1406
02:06:17,681 --> 02:06:29,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a developer wants to come in, reconstruct the building, put some parking underneath and behind the building, put I think it was nine apartments on top.

1407
02:06:30,203 --> 02:06:35,185
[SPEAKER_09]: and put back ground floor commercial, not allowed by zoning.

1408
02:06:35,665 --> 02:06:38,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But why not, right?

1409
02:06:38,386 --> 02:06:42,688
[SPEAKER_09]: It would just be making it a nicer, newer building with some residential above it.

1410
02:06:43,388 --> 02:06:46,490
[SPEAKER_09]: So it actually did receive a variance tonight at the zoning board.

1411
02:06:46,990 --> 02:06:52,072
[SPEAKER_09]: A very similar proposal on that same location was denied five or six years ago.

1412
02:06:53,296 --> 02:07:03,840
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that the zoning board took into account the fact that people are saying we would like to see ground floor commercial with apartments above them, especially in locations that already have ground floor commercial.

1413
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:10,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I think a lot of business owners will say that they like to have people who live near their businesses who can walk to them.

1414
02:07:11,522 --> 02:07:18,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to speak for all business owners, but it does help the business model when the neighbors come and frequent the business.

1415
02:07:19,028 --> 02:07:21,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to start to wrap this up.

1416
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:22,891
[SPEAKER_09]: There've been a lot of questions.

1417
02:07:23,011 --> 02:07:23,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It is 8.50.

1418
02:07:23,331 --> 02:07:26,294
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been here a long time.

1419
02:07:28,315 --> 02:07:30,357
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't want you to think you can't ever talk to us.

1420
02:07:30,377 --> 02:07:31,858
[SPEAKER_09]: The staff are still out there.

1421
02:07:33,379 --> 02:07:35,641
[SPEAKER_09]: And like we said, there are upcoming meetings as well.

1422
02:07:35,901 --> 02:07:37,062
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can always send email.

1423
02:07:38,504 --> 02:07:39,626
[SPEAKER_09]: to the city councillors.

1424
02:07:39,706 --> 02:07:43,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Their email information is on the web, seems to be pretty easy to find.

1425
02:07:44,315 --> 02:07:55,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And to address comments to the Community Development Board, you would send mail to OCD, so it's the letters, office, community development, OCD, at medford-ma.gov.

1426
02:07:57,438 --> 02:07:58,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1427
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:00,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you again, all of you, for being here.

1428
02:08:00,524 --> 02:08:02,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Really enjoyed your comments and thoughts.

1429
02:08:02,528 --> 02:08:02,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
