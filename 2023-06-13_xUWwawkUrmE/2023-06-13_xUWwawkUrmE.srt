00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:46,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you able to, Stacey and Mayor, Director O'Connor, are you able to hear Dr. Cushing with that microphone?

112
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I think she shook her head, yes.

113
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:50,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear us now?

00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:51,764

118
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:13,148
[SPEAKER_16]: We did the Communities to Care Survey in the fall of 2021.

119
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,572
[SPEAKER_16]: I really wanna applaud the Department of Health

120
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:24,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we made it a priority within the med for public schools to ensure that this survey was translated.

121
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:34,075
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Department of Health committed $6,000 to have it sent out and professionally translated.

122
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:46,487
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was a tremendous help for all of our students to make sure that every single student had access to this survey, at least when it comes to language translation as well.

123
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,830
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll hand the microphone over to Penny.

124
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:51,246
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

125
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,867
[SPEAKER_20]: I do apologize.

126
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:55,949
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm at the end of a laryngitis situation.

127
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:57,390
[SPEAKER_20]: So bear with me.

128
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,393
[SPEAKER_20]: But so this communities care survey has been conducted every two years since 2005.

129
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:08,416
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've been doing this for a very long time monitoring our progress.

130
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:12,718
[SPEAKER_20]: And because of this, because of the data being collected in fall of 2021.

131
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,701
[SPEAKER_20]: and we are about to go around into our next round of data collection.

132
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:27,867
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to remind everyone that this is a temperature-taking conversation and for us to really be keen on what we want to see for the next round.

133
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:34,791
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do apologize about the delay of seeing the results, but I think that it was a funky year anyway.

134
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:35,651
[SPEAKER_20]: It was December 2021.

135
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:42,915
[SPEAKER_20]: folks had just come back into schools and life was changed so drastically for so many.

136
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:47,196
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's really sort of a baseline, this data.

137
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:53,419
[SPEAKER_20]: And I have a lot of data that compares the year before to see if we were worse or better off the year before.

138
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:58,321
[SPEAKER_20]: But what you'll see is in some cases, we're much better off in this last taking.

139
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,702
[SPEAKER_20]: And in some cases, just a little bit of a difference.

140
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:02,103
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to make sure that

141
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:04,807
[SPEAKER_20]: I do have a lot to show you.

142
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:06,247
[SPEAKER_20]: I will speak quickly.

143
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:11,670
[SPEAKER_20]: But obviously, you know, flag me if you want me to slow down or stop to talk about something.

144
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:25,876
[SPEAKER_20]: But it is the belief of our office in the health department that it's everyone's collective responsibility in the city of Medford to protect our young people against drugs, tobacco, vaping, alcohol, nicotine, the whole bit, right?

145
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:32,538
[SPEAKER_20]: So we really want to recruit everyone in to understanding we are all a part of this solution.

146
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:36,360
[SPEAKER_20]: It is not the school committees to make this change.

147
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,101
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the whole community to make this change.

148
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:48,625
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we think about this, we think about our individuals, self, thank you, our individuals, the individuals and their peers, that is a whole set of things that'll happen.

149
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:53,587
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to keep that in mind about how can we create interventions that are healthy and helpful.

150
00:15:54,227 --> 00:16:01,652
[SPEAKER_20]: And then thinking about the same for our families, how do we support our families when our youth go home to those families?

151
00:16:01,672 --> 00:16:06,395
[SPEAKER_20]: That's their main point of care and contact and education.

152
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:13,780
[SPEAKER_20]: So we wanna think about that as we're going forward in the city of Medford, that we're caring for the whole family, not just for the child.

153
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:22,866
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have really taken concerted effort over the last four years at the Medford Health Department to rework the way in which we are doing everything we're doing

154
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:35,672
[SPEAKER_20]: where we have a social worker on staff, we have a recovery coach position, we have outreach workers now that are community liaisons with multiple languages that they are able to go and access different communities.

155
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:43,615
[SPEAKER_20]: The tail end what I'm saying, but it's at a time that if a family

156
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:50,351
[SPEAKER_20]: away from falling deeper into whatever that might be.

157
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:53,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Stress is a main driver for substance use.

158
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:57,500
[SPEAKER_20]: So as you can see, this is my wheel.

159
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,106
[SPEAKER_20]: I like to keep my mind always thinking about this, that we're going to circle the problem in multiple ways.

160
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,309
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you go to the next slide.

161
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,356
[SPEAKER_20]: So what are we really trying to do?

162
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:13,957
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to identify trends and understand the current risk and protective factors and high risk behaviors.

163
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:25,821
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are a list of these risk and protective factors and what these risk factors might contribute to our substance use, misuse, teen pregnancy, delinquency, and violence.

164
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:33,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so, and with young people,

165
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,770
[SPEAKER_03]: There is always a chance, excuse me, sorry, Mayor.

166
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:45,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin, can we ask Mr. McLaughlin if he can get this monitor working on this side.

167
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:49,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. McLaughlin, just once, so take a pause.

168
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:52,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Technical issue.

169
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you could direct us, Penny, we have, I know you gave us a folder, so is there

170
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,818
[SPEAKER_09]: a copy of the slideshow in our packets as well.

171
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:06,184
[SPEAKER_20]: I do apologize because I was working on it till the end and I did my printer stopped working.

172
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:11,032
[SPEAKER_20]: That said, No, there's a you gave us a ton of information.

173
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:11,612
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's fine.

174
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:12,093
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

175
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I just didn't know if we could follow along.

176
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:23,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so the the point of prevention is to delay use right we know that alcohol is legal we know that nicotine and cannabis is also legal.

177
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:32,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, so we want to delay first he's doing all brains to develop before they get to the point of introducing addictive substances into their brain.

178
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:37,197
[SPEAKER_20]: So 90% of addictions start in the teenage years.

179
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,919
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's what we're trying to do here.

180
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:45,523
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first administration, the survey is 2005 every two years, sixth through 12th grade.

181
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,725
[SPEAKER_20]: As I said, we administer this in December, 2021.

182
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:52,989
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the first time we administered an online survey.

183
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:55,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Usually it was paper copy with a scantron.

184
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,053
[SPEAKER_20]: We tried to cut down on some of the administrative tasks with that.

185
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,256
[SPEAKER_20]: We started the survey and

186
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:13,121
[SPEAKER_20]: Nick Tucci, our wonderful principal at the McGlynn School, he pointed out that there was some students who couldn't access this survey because of language.

187
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:20,125
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we stopped, and we pulled back, and I sent this out to be translated in four languages.

188
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:30,810
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I stopped, and I had another translation company verify that that was correct, because these are nuanced questions, and they have to be correct in their translation.

189
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:40,080
[SPEAKER_20]: I think these numbers that you're seeing in terms of who completed the surveys, these are low.

190
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:42,822
[SPEAKER_20]: And we wanna fix that for the next round.

191
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:46,704
[SPEAKER_20]: It does affect the data when there's not enough students taking the test.

192
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:49,606
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't a sample survey kind of survey.

193
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:52,328
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a population health survey.

194
00:19:52,348 --> 00:20:03,695
[SPEAKER_20]: So we wanna make sure that we get a better turnout the next year, but also reminding everyone, we had a lot of students that were hybrid, maybe a little bit, maybe students who weren't coming back to school, a lot of things that were going on for our community.

195
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:18,625
[SPEAKER_20]: So the validity of the survey, what our evaluator does is they look at the survey and they eliminate any surveys where a student exaggerates drugs or antisocial behavior, drug use or antisocial behavior.

196
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:25,030
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's overly exaggerated consistently, we see something's wrong with the survey and we go ahead and push it to the side.

197
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,673
[SPEAKER_20]: We eliminate surveys where students report use of a fictitious drug.

198
00:20:29,873 --> 00:20:31,955
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not gonna tell you what that is, because we don't wanna ruin the survey, right?

199
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:44,861
[SPEAKER_20]: And then finally, anything that's not logically consistent if you said, I drank 40 times in the last month and then you said another question that you never drank, that wouldn't work so we're going to eliminate those as well.

200
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:51,885
[SPEAKER_20]: As we're going through the survey, I want you to think about these, these four terms lifetime uses.

201
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:01,435
[SPEAKER_10]: month, also called current use in some places or cases.

202
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:12,061
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is the measure that is most critical, because anybody might do something once, but may not be affecting them as a longer term issue.

203
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:13,761
[SPEAKER_20]: So we want to track the 30 day.

204
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:20,905
[SPEAKER_20]: And of course, binge drinking behavior is a report of use of five or more drinks in one sitting within the last two weeks.

205
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,007
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's for everyone, just chill.

206
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:24,687
[SPEAKER_20]: So keep that in mind, folks.

207
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:27,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Binge drinking is often misconstrued

208
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:30,604
[SPEAKER_20]: for most people.

209
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:41,212
[SPEAKER_20]: Perception of harm measures attitude and perceptions related to substance use based on how much the person thinks the risk of harm to themselves physically or other ways.

210
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:47,698
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is a really critical concept, which we'll get into in a few minutes.

211
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:52,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so this serve this here is your sixth through eighth grade.

212
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,579
[SPEAKER_20]: These numbers are out of 100% scale.

213
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:09,231
[SPEAKER_20]: We did this on purpose I did these slides I have to give thanks to birth brought Bert Rothenbach who is been our evaluator for so many years and then from the Tufts interdisciplinary evaluation research team, they helped us put all this stuff together.

214
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:14,214
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was important to them for us to show 100% is all the kids.

215
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:17,936
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a very small amount of young people that are using substances in our community.

216
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:20,357
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's what we want to keep in our mind.

217
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:23,479
[SPEAKER_20]: There are substances that are not being showed on this chart.

218
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:34,845
[SPEAKER_20]: And the reason why is because they were in a lower, they had a less than 1%, less than 3% that is showing across all the years that we've taken this survey.

219
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,025
[SPEAKER_20]: So we eliminated those.

220
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:38,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are prescription tranquilizers.

221
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:40,732
[SPEAKER_20]: heroin and stimulant use.

222
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:50,124
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you can see too, with our prescription pain relievers, we started out with higher numbers and now we have such low numbers.

223
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:54,466
[SPEAKER_20]: We could eliminate, but I don't think it's, I think we should still keep this as a top of our mind.

224
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,007
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is the eighth grade, sixth through eighth grade.

225
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,448
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the high school trends over time.

226
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:11,753
[SPEAKER_20]: So as a whole, I think all of us working together over my career of 15 years, I think we're doing a pretty darn good job in this community, helping to support our kids and our families.

227
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:16,241
[SPEAKER_20]: So the next slide is about alcohol use.

228
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,309
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the, yeah.

229
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:24,490
[SPEAKER_20]: So here I have a snapshot of trends across different years.

230
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:30,073
[SPEAKER_20]: So the middle school, you'll see the lifetime use and the 30-day use.

231
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:31,674
[SPEAKER_20]: These are pretty significant.

232
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:38,599
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, young people were isolated at home for a good part of time.

233
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:43,181
[SPEAKER_20]: And so this may be just because of safety of home.

234
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,742
[SPEAKER_20]: It may be other factors.

235
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:48,064
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be just, again, that we're doing a good job getting the message across.

236
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:52,867
[SPEAKER_20]: But I just wanna show these comparison.

237
00:23:53,488 --> 00:23:56,169
[SPEAKER_20]: This next slide you'll see is by grade.

238
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,613
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, the last one here is the state, is the national average.

239
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,915
[SPEAKER_20]: And we are lower than the national average on all these numbers.

240
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:11,418
[SPEAKER_20]: And as young people grow, there's a more likelihood of taking riskier behaviors.

241
00:24:11,838 --> 00:24:13,739
[SPEAKER_20]: But at the same time, these numbers are still pretty low.

242
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:19,464
[SPEAKER_20]: So I point this to this slide.

243
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:21,846
[SPEAKER_20]: This is 30 days.

244
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,210
[SPEAKER_20]: In the last 30 days, did you drive in a car with someone who had been drinking alcohol?

245
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:34,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you might wonder why a sixth grader would say that well because parents drink and your kids notice when you're driving, and you've been drinking.

246
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:48,346
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we want to point this out that this is something that young people do know about as a matter of fact we did a much larger assessment of seven communities, and in focus groups you've said it's very hypocritical.

247
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:52,488
[SPEAKER_20]: that I see parents and adults drinking, and then we're told we're not going.

248
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:54,649
[SPEAKER_20]: So why is it safe for them and it's not safe for us.

249
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:59,992
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's so youth are really getting to this concept of like, wait a minute, something's not right here.

250
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:05,255
[SPEAKER_20]: So moving on to nicotine.

251
00:25:07,802 --> 00:25:10,245
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are very concerned about vaping.

252
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:12,487
[SPEAKER_20]: I think everybody says that.

253
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,449
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is what we're seeing.

254
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,090
[SPEAKER_20]: We're seeing lower rates of vaping.

255
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,294
[SPEAKER_20]: And we believe that has something to do with access.

256
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:24,379
[SPEAKER_20]: So these products have become 21 plus.

257
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:28,943
[SPEAKER_20]: They have removed flavored products on our markets in this area.

258
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,485
[SPEAKER_20]: You can still get them in New Hampshire.

259
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:31,666
[SPEAKER_20]: You can still travel to get.

260
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:35,171
[SPEAKER_20]: can still find things on the internet, but access is important.

261
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:37,973
[SPEAKER_20]: If we can limit access, we can limit use to a degree.

262
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:44,638
[SPEAKER_20]: And then this is by grade and age.

263
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:48,001
[SPEAKER_20]: So as you can see, there's a little bit of a blip here.

264
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:50,463
[SPEAKER_20]: Our 10th graders are showing

265
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:58,004
[SPEAKER_20]: higher use than other grades on both the 30 day use and the lifetime use.

266
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,025
[SPEAKER_20]: So these 10th graders will be seniors next year.

267
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:02,745
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see how this survey goes with them.

268
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:08,187
[SPEAKER_20]: But the 11th and the 12th graders in this survey, they have graduated or they have been gone.

269
00:26:08,227 --> 00:26:12,428
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're not gonna pay attention to those particular age groups.

270
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:18,607
[SPEAKER_20]: And then because it's such an issue, we wanna look at chronic use as well.

271
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:28,234
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you've had six or more occasions that you used of your vaped nicotine in the last 30 days, this is what it looks like.

272
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,997
[SPEAKER_20]: The chronic users are qualified again by the six.

273
00:26:31,477 --> 00:26:43,586
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you really look at this 10th grade at 40 plus occasions, that's daily use, that sounds to me like addiction,

274
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:49,410
[SPEAKER_20]: And then with those interventions, we need to think about vaping cessation.

275
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, there are not as many vaping cessation programs as there are tobacco cessation programs.

276
00:26:54,953 --> 00:27:01,816
[SPEAKER_20]: So we may, you know, have to think about what are we going to do and how are we going to look at the research and how are we going to build programming

277
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,457
[SPEAKER_20]: that makes sense to Medford.

278
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:06,759
[SPEAKER_20]: We do have resources beyond Medford.

279
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,540
[SPEAKER_20]: We are a part of a regional collaborative.

280
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:16,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, she stepped out for a second, but Sophie Greenbaum is our regional coordinator with Medford, Malden, Melrose Stoneham, Wakefield and Reading.

281
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:29,595
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to really encourage you all to be looking out for those emails from the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition, because a lot of our work, we have a good amount of money coming into this community, into those seven communities to support the work that we're doing on the local level.

282
00:27:29,975 --> 00:27:37,358
[SPEAKER_20]: and to bring those seven communities together to really think about as a team, how can we in this region make a whole culture change?

283
00:27:38,318 --> 00:27:38,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

284
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,540
[SPEAKER_20]: So moving on to marijuana.

285
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,501
[SPEAKER_20]: So the survey calls it marijuana.

286
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:47,522
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that the right thing to do would be calling it cannabis going forward.

287
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:53,144
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, the survey calls it marijuana, so I'm sticking with the naming convention of the survey.

288
00:27:56,098 --> 00:28:06,646
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're looking at this and we're seeing that lifetime and 30-day use, both middle school and high school, that we're faring better than we did the year before, or the previous administrations of the survey.

289
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:14,332
[SPEAKER_20]: And that, yeah, we're just gonna keep monitoring this information.

290
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:18,014
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the same here for the by grade.

291
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:19,896
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll keep monitoring it.

292
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:23,859
[SPEAKER_20]: And we are lower than the national 12th grade average there.

293
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:31,839
[SPEAKER_20]: So the last piece, well, not the last piece on this, but this piece is that we really, are they vaping nicotine?

294
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they vaping marijuana or cannabis products, right?

295
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:37,807
[SPEAKER_20]: And some of the key, I apologize, but I have to.

296
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:55,964
[SPEAKER_20]: To my role I think is that, that the the vaping materials that are being sold into centuries they're being monitored they're being carefully checked by the state of Massachusetts, there's a level of monitoring that, but there's still illicit

297
00:28:56,484 --> 00:29:00,168
[SPEAKER_20]: vaping products that have cannabis in them that are, and they are dangerous.

298
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:04,051
[SPEAKER_20]: And you may remember back a couple of years ago, there was some lung issues that were going on.

299
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,073
[SPEAKER_20]: So we really want to talk to our young people.

300
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:10,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Vaping is, you are putting oil into your lungs over and over and over again.

301
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:12,559
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very damaging to your lungs.

302
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,425
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll keep on watching this and we'll keep on thinking of our education that we're going to do with that.

303
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:25,574
[SPEAKER_20]: So this slide here is just to remind you that perceptions mean a lot.

304
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:32,960
[SPEAKER_20]: While we know what facts might be, perceptions mean so much because it becomes reality for individuals.

305
00:29:33,442 --> 00:29:41,788
[SPEAKER_20]: So it is our jobs to dispel these perceptions, to really change it from, this is the truth, right?

306
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:44,029
[SPEAKER_20]: And get them to understand the reality and the truth.

307
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,672
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why we pay attention to these perceptions of harm.

308
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:53,216
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the next slide, I have, this is my concern, I think is important to point out.

309
00:29:53,736 --> 00:29:56,980
[SPEAKER_20]: So perception of harm as it relates to marijuana use.

310
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:06,952
[SPEAKER_20]: When you look at all of the people who reported lifetime use, we have 37.8% of those users ever have used it.

311
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,194
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's no risk.

312
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:09,015
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a problem.

313
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:16,017
[SPEAKER_20]: And same thing with all of our substances.

314
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:29,644
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I have this data that shows you know we can show it 30 different ways, but I really want to point out that it is important that we are both thinking about preventing substance use.

315
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:34,207
[SPEAKER_20]: But also understanding when people use substances, how do we help them.

316
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:39,511
[SPEAKER_20]: And some of the ways that we need to help people is to get them to be contemplating about their behavior change.

317
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:42,954
[SPEAKER_20]: If they feel there is no risk, what is the point of contemplating change.

318
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,897
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to keep that in mind as we are moving forward in this world.

319
00:30:48,098 --> 00:31:01,933
[SPEAKER_20]: It is not abstinence only, because that's not what we're saying we're talking about people who are active substance users with active active opioid users, we're talking about harm reduction, how do we keep you healthy, while you're making your own journey into change.

320
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:05,998
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have to also be considering that for young people who are using substances as well.

321
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:10,654
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the next slide is to show the chronic use again.

322
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:22,522
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, these numbers are very small, but just something to keep an eye on is that those folks who are chronically using, they need a different set of interventions than those in the universal population to prevent.

323
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:26,227
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

324
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,449
[SPEAKER_20]: And then driving while in a car.

325
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:42,681
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, again, these, these 12th graders in this survey have been gone for a year now, but this is a lot of, um, a lot to say about 15.5% that are moving around in vehicles while someone's under the influence of marijuana.

326
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:44,983
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to keep pointing that out.

327
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:47,886
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's be safe in our, in our world.

328
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,166
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

329
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so we're moving on to mental health-related issues.

330
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:55,802
[SPEAKER_20]: So the city of Medford, we use the Communities Care Survey.

331
00:31:55,822 --> 00:31:58,324
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been using this for, again, 15 years.

332
00:31:58,804 --> 00:32:01,966
[SPEAKER_20]: This survey asks depressive symptom measures.

333
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:05,188
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the precursors to major depression.

334
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:06,148
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of research.

335
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:16,714
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some research, actually, I don't wanna overstate it, but there is research that specifically takes this survey and it measures it against other depressive symptom measures that we use in our doctor's offices.

336
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:21,918
[SPEAKER_20]: and it's absolutely comparable and it does correlate with long-term mental health issues.

337
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,261
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why we keep track of that.

338
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:28,344
[SPEAKER_20]: When we're talking about mental health issues in our young people right now, we're not just talking about depression, right?

339
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:29,805
[SPEAKER_20]: We're talking about anxiety.

340
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,488
[SPEAKER_20]: This survey doesn't ask anxiety questions.

341
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:37,092
[SPEAKER_20]: As a matter of fact, I don't know that there is a set of anxiety questions for young people yet.

342
00:32:37,272 --> 00:32:38,233
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to look into that

343
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:40,972
[SPEAKER_20]: and keep that at the forefront of my mind here.

344
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:49,634
[SPEAKER_20]: But what we're seeing is these numbers look pretty, you know, sometimes I think that life is not worth it.

345
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:52,695
[SPEAKER_20]: 49% of young people said that's definitely not true, right?

346
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:54,675
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is the middle school grades.

347
00:32:55,196 --> 00:33:02,878
[SPEAKER_20]: So as you go through all of these measures and you think about it, I've coupled these together, the definitely true and the mostly true to say these folks might,

348
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:16,027
[SPEAKER_20]: We might really want to think about what we're going to do about this right, so I just want to show, though, the next slide in that, but what we're seeing is there's not much of a difference from pre pandemic to now.

349
00:33:17,308 --> 00:33:27,015
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we saw was this was happening before the pandemic and it's been exacerbated by the pandemic so.

350
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:35,400
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to really continue to think as a whole, how are we going to support our young people in their mental health?

351
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,303
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have some information about that as we get further down.

352
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:42,325
[SPEAKER_20]: And then this is the high school.

353
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:49,590
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the next slide shows the overtime.

354
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:58,248
[SPEAKER_20]: And we do have a bump up here on one of the questions, but it's not so significant.

355
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:02,072
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the researchers did a lot of significance testing as well.

356
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:10,722
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, but in the past year, have you felt depressed or sad most days, even if you feel okay sometimes?

357
00:34:11,107 --> 00:34:14,670
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's actually a middle of the ground question, I think.

358
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:19,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Not as extreme as sometimes I think life is not worth it at all.

359
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:22,678
[SPEAKER_20]: So of course, more students are going to report this question.

360
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,882
[SPEAKER_20]: So bullying experiences.

361
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Very few students experience any bullying of any type.

362
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:39,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Very few students experienced bullying of any type and said that it was a whole lot, right?

363
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:42,007
[SPEAKER_20]: But many students didn't experience bullying.

364
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:48,051
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's also important to note the question doesn't ask specifically about being in school or about school-based bullying.

365
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:49,592
[SPEAKER_20]: It just says bullying in general.

366
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:55,795
[SPEAKER_20]: So this could be online, this could be in the playground, this could be at home in the neighborhood, so on and so forth.

367
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,136
[SPEAKER_20]: So just keeping that in mind.

368
00:34:57,776 --> 00:34:59,177
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, what are their perceptions?

369
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:03,880
[SPEAKER_20]: And what are we talking about when we're talking about bullying?

370
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,861
[SPEAKER_20]: What do they think bullying means to them, right?

371
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:09,363
[SPEAKER_20]: And how do we examine that a little bit more?

372
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:16,646
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to skim through this just to say not much of a change going into high school.

373
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:21,408
[SPEAKER_20]: And of course, and as we're seeing in both grade sets, that verbal bullying is higher.

374
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:25,344
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a little easier to do, right?

375
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:28,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Because words happen quick and they are mean.

376
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,667
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I wanna continue to monitor this.

377
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:41,530
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanna think about solutions or think about opportunities for us to continue to enhance programming and so on in our school system.

378
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:46,092
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, the data shows that it's not, it's gone down actually in the high school.

379
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:47,713
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, go ahead.

380
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:48,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau.

381
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:50,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Penny.

382
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,183
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm on the bullying stuff, how does that compare to the national averages.

383
00:35:56,064 --> 00:35:56,424
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

384
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I guess if I did, I don't have it in front of me.

385
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I can find out and I will be useful.

386
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,930
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

387
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, definitely.

388
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:05,732
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also just want to say to.

389
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:12,570
[SPEAKER_20]: That, again, I apologize if I'm so skimming over this it is a lot of content.

390
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:16,374
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, I think that, how do we compare to the national average.

391
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:27,966
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want to give the for for cast here is that my peers are seeing these numbers jump drastically in the administration of this spring serve youth at risk survey right.

392
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,290
[SPEAKER_20]: So they saw a lot of numbers go up in a multitude of communities that surround us.

393
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,613
[SPEAKER_20]: We will see these numbers go up across the board.

394
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:44,481
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think it's important to note that we've worked really hard over the last number of years to continue to look at our programming.

395
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:51,867
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm just so proud sometimes to hear of the things that you're looking at and thinking about and the language that you're using around supportive communities.

396
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,550
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to give you all a shout out on that too as well.

397
00:36:57,671 --> 00:36:58,832
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is a list of questions.

398
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:00,253
[SPEAKER_20]: I am not going to read this out to you.

399
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:06,296
[SPEAKER_20]: And anyone who is watching this presentation who wants this information, you can definitely contact me.

400
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:09,238
[SPEAKER_20]: That's pbruce at medford-ma.gov.

401
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:10,739
[SPEAKER_20]: I will send you all these results.

402
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,842
[SPEAKER_20]: But the idea, though, that adults being supportive

403
00:37:15,522 --> 00:37:16,764
[SPEAKER_20]: is really important, right?

404
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:21,690
[SPEAKER_20]: That young people have someone that they can turn to if they don't feel like they have anyone else.

405
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,255
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we want to think about what are they, what do they perceive?

406
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,837
[SPEAKER_20]: How are they reaching out?

407
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:35,126
[SPEAKER_20]: And in some cases, right, where the question might go, I can talk to an adult at school about personal problem or something important.

408
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:39,767
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, in some cases, maybe they've been told not to talk to someone at school.

409
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:45,129
[SPEAKER_20]: So how is the school looking to their community partners to be that other resource?

410
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:55,433
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we get more community-led, youth-driven activities so that it's a balance and it doesn't have to all be on the onus of school teachers, school professionals?

411
00:37:56,173 --> 00:38:01,535
[SPEAKER_20]: But that said, I would like to sit down with some young people and ask them in a deeper level, what do you think this question means?

412
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:05,136
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can understand what their perceptions are around this question as well.

413
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:11,050
[SPEAKER_20]: And then this is the measure against the previous year.

414
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:19,497
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will just show the next slide just to point it out as well for the high school.

415
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,205
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I'd like to think about how we can set up measures to continue to grow and to build this opportunity.

416
00:38:29,645 --> 00:38:35,830
[SPEAKER_20]: So the next set of data is on opportunities for pro-social involvement.

417
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:56,514
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is really the philosophy of the prevention field that positive youth development and that empowerment, right, is a really critical skill build for a young person to make decisions for themselves, by themselves, that are thoughtful and helpful to themselves.

418
00:38:57,074 --> 00:39:06,378
[SPEAKER_20]: So we want to find ways to get youth more involved in decision-making, even at the middle school level, even at the elementary school level, is figuring out how exactly

419
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:26,228
[SPEAKER_20]: can you include youth to make a decision and I've had conversations we've had trainings for our club club leaders and our school coaches here in Medford and, and I've, and we had a whole activity on this and and someone said you know they put them on a line where, how much do you think a young person can make a decision about going to the

420
00:39:26,528 --> 00:39:29,650
[SPEAKER_20]: a trip to New York, and there were a lot of people who were like, none, they can make no decision.

421
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:39,194
[SPEAKER_20]: And some people were like, no, I think they can make, young people can make decisions, you just need to figure out how to carve out decisions that make sense and have boundaries, explain boundaries.

422
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:49,419
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just am putting this slide up so that we can continue to remind ourselves that we need to recruit young people into solutions, and not enact solutions on them as the only response.

423
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:57,927
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the next slide, right, again, shows the high school, and then the next slide's gonna show rewards.

424
00:39:58,227 --> 00:40:00,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Rewards are important because you need a feedback loop.

425
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:02,069
[SPEAKER_20]: We all need a feedback loop.

426
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:03,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Am I doing a good job?

427
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:08,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Should I keep reinforcing this good job that I'm doing, or should I give up?

428
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:19,336
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's really important that we reflect back to young people, that we talk to parents, and that we're communicating with those families so the family can reinforce those behaviors and those positive things.

429
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:23,639
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just cruise through to the next set of slides.

430
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:26,422
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm going to skip over that one.

431
00:40:26,762 --> 00:40:34,769
[SPEAKER_20]: So then, this was one that Peter really pulled, wanted us to pull in and it was almost like he was forecasting the future.

432
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:41,693
[SPEAKER_20]: Because our surgeon general has now come out with a report to discuss social media and the effects on young people.

433
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:42,573
[SPEAKER_20]: So how much.

434
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:47,295
[SPEAKER_20]: So these measures are all based on four hours or more in these activities.

435
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:49,777
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is for middle school.

436
00:40:50,137 --> 00:40:51,457
[SPEAKER_20]: The next one is for high school.

437
00:40:55,586 --> 00:41:12,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And just if you're not aware, but it was about two to three weeks ago, the Surgeon General came out and it's widely believed in the Surgeon General references that if you're engaging in social media over three and a half hours a day, you're significantly more likely to have anxiety or depressive behaviors.

438
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:21,287
[SPEAKER_16]: And so this is interesting because if you talk to school leaders, we kind of could have told you this, and it's really important

439
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:46,967
[SPEAKER_16]: that schools and the community understand the deleterious effects that cell phones and social media devices can have on our youth and how critical it is that families, in my perspective in all the years of doing this, think of something like the pledge until eighth, which is wait until eighth grade to give your child a device, or that you're significantly restricting their access to these social media platforms

440
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:53,112
[SPEAKER_16]: that cause our kids significant harm as is now being recognized.

441
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,894
[SPEAKER_16]: So we wanted to really start getting this data.

442
00:41:55,934 --> 00:42:04,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember this is back in the fall of 2021 and wanted to really start looking at what our kids are doing in their device time.

443
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham, can I just ask a quick question?

444
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:11,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you flip back to the middle school page?

445
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

446
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:22,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I was surprised to see the percentages higher in the middle school population than the high school population.

447
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:26,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that typical in communities or are we an outlier there?

448
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:29,999
[SPEAKER_20]: So I've never seen this question measured against other communities.

449
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,962
[SPEAKER_20]: So that would be important to know, but I can go.

450
00:42:33,022 --> 00:42:40,209
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that these question sets coming from Burp Rothenbach, he has used this in Florida and other states.

451
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:45,032
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can come back to him and ask him to give us a sort of sense of where we fare on that.

452
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:49,675
[SPEAKER_20]: But also note that in these two data sets, that they shift.

453
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:53,918
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's actually by the most, the highest percentage.

454
00:42:54,258 --> 00:42:58,601
[SPEAKER_20]: So the surfing the internet and the using social media flip middle school to high school.

455
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:02,523
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to make sure that that was visually aware.

456
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:03,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Did I answer your question?

457
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:04,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you.

458
00:43:08,749 --> 00:43:13,572
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, and then just keeping an eye on activities that young people are are involved in.

459
00:43:13,972 --> 00:43:29,322
[SPEAKER_20]: This is so cool to 53% of these middle school students said they had school clubs to attend to, you know that in the middle school we're showing in 2000 and I think 11 I came up here there was nothing for middle school kids, and you know,

460
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:37,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Paul DeLeva and the other principals at the time, they jumped in to actually put clubs together at the middle school level.

461
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:41,286
[SPEAKER_20]: And we saw drastic changes in our data, just not one simple act.

462
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:48,890
[SPEAKER_20]: So I really wanna encourage that we keep thinking about activities that are engaging, maybe that are decided by young people, which they do anyway.

463
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,751
[SPEAKER_20]: I know you guys all do that at the school system.

464
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:57,314
[SPEAKER_20]: But also we in the community level are gonna start drawing a network together.

465
00:43:57,654 --> 00:44:10,820
[SPEAKER_20]: We really want to see people who work with young people outside of school time interfacing, sharing ideas, collaborating, and they themselves not feeling isolated in coming up with what's next and what's going on.

466
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,481
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will have an event on June 22.

467
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:19,364
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a luncheon for anyone who works with youth and we're going to start creating that resource sharing opportunity.

468
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:25,086
[SPEAKER_20]: but then in the high school, we see that, you know, jobs come up to play, right?

469
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:29,868
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of kids, a lot of young people are not only working for themselves, they're working for their family.

470
00:44:30,328 --> 00:44:37,613
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we also need to be inclusive in thinking about job training, job opportunities in the community.

471
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:45,537
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of different creative ways that we can look at this and I'll be tapping on the mayor's door about my ideas soon.

472
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,538
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah.

473
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:51,375
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so what are we doing?

474
00:44:52,935 --> 00:44:54,116
[SPEAKER_20]: This is all the stuff that we got going.

475
00:44:54,136 --> 00:44:59,219
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we, again, we have laws that we've put in place, state laws and local regulations.

476
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,001
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a youth mental health first aid programming that's starting to roll out.

477
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:07,063
[SPEAKER_20]: We are rolling that out in a multilingual outreach.

478
00:45:07,343 --> 00:45:09,804
[SPEAKER_20]: So it is not widely being published as of yet.

479
00:45:09,864 --> 00:45:13,146
[SPEAKER_20]: We are going to be hosting courses coming up that'll be more wide to the community.

480
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:17,388
[SPEAKER_20]: But right now we're recruiting folks from our Arabic speaking, Haitian Creole speaking,

481
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:23,890
[SPEAKER_20]: and Spanish speaking and Brazilian Portuguese speaking communities to come and to start participating in that.

482
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:38,655
[SPEAKER_20]: We're also working on a multilingual campaign to recruit people to get help for behavioral health on the level, the city of establish a promote prevent support Behavioral Health Commission, and we are working through an assessment right now.

483
00:45:44,184 --> 00:45:47,125
[SPEAKER_10]: and to pull resources into this community around that.

484
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:52,148
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's for the whole community, not just for young people, but it's about mental health.

485
00:45:52,588 --> 00:46:08,575
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have our, again, I just mentioned that youth worker event, we are working on reviving our compliance checks, again, limiting access, compliance checks to cannabis facilities are being done at the state level, not at the local level, but we'll be looking at that as well.

486
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:11,517
[SPEAKER_20]: How can we continue to reinforce and support that

487
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:17,699
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, diversion, they're very, very, very strict when you go to these cannabis dispensaries.

488
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:20,459
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the diversion after the fact that I'm concerned about.

489
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,600
[SPEAKER_20]: We have training for our police.

490
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:30,262
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are always working with our police department, we are always helping them update training and what's going on.

491
00:46:30,882 --> 00:46:34,883
[SPEAKER_20]: I just spoke about our community liaison team, our multilingual team that does outreach.

492
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:51,172
[SPEAKER_20]: And we do against our social worker does a lot of support for low resource families, Medford connects is an initiative started in the city of Medford here to bring all of our departments together, and the school department.

493
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:55,235
[SPEAKER_20]: is shifting into that support into that realm.

494
00:46:55,536 --> 00:47:03,663
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know, we have a software that we've hired, purchased called Unitas, that any nonprofit can pull into and provide services.

495
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:08,568
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can go in and I can click off five different company services to get one person out.

496
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:16,996
[SPEAKER_20]: That is an incredible service that we are looking to expand, really encourage anyone who's listening to think about that or

497
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:33,555
[SPEAKER_20]: To ask us questions about that we'll think it's as good as our network though that's important part parent education so where we just worked with my family network, think about how they're recruiting out to different groups into families and what are their programming and how do they want to get it out in this.

498
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:36,451
[SPEAKER_20]: Century and how are we helping them streamline their work.

499
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:38,713
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been an excellent opportunity.

500
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:49,965
[SPEAKER_20]: And then again, we have the library, the rec department, the Council on Aging, a multitude of departments are having access to five community language connectors.

501
00:47:50,306 --> 00:47:55,011
[SPEAKER_20]: They'll be working on behalf of those departments doing outreach, just like we have our community liaisons.

502
00:47:55,444 --> 00:48:05,847
[SPEAKER_20]: and the health department, they all have these connectors to go out and to do the recruitment engagement to different activities in our city, specifically the library, a resource.

503
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,767
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, our library is incredible.

504
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:09,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Good to the library folks.

505
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:12,868
[SPEAKER_20]: And then our regional work, we have our seven communities.

506
00:48:12,908 --> 00:48:16,229
[SPEAKER_20]: We just went around and discussed all of the data that we learned.

507
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,011
[SPEAKER_20]: We are working on a strategic plan at a regional level and we will be starting

508
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:35,044
[SPEAKER_20]: networking groups within school systems as well and we'll be thinking about how to do that and we're hoping that the school system will also support the initiatives that we're trying to roll out through that grant.

509
00:48:35,984 --> 00:48:45,067
[SPEAKER_20]: And the next slide, I am not going to speak to this only and to say that I think one of the most critical learning moments that I've had in my career

510
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:55,001
[SPEAKER_20]: was when I just learned, what is it, five, six years ago about multi-tiered systems of support, which the schools know about, right?

511
00:48:55,422 --> 00:48:56,503
[SPEAKER_20]: But that is prevention.

512
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:59,845
[SPEAKER_20]: Your tier one is everybody gets this, right?

513
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:01,406
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's health promotion.

514
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody gets health promotion.

515
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:05,730
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody gets good messages and opportunities.

516
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,072
[SPEAKER_20]: And tier two is that intervention space.

517
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:09,433
[SPEAKER_20]: People are starting to show risk.

518
00:49:09,873 --> 00:49:14,196
[SPEAKER_20]: and how do we specifically focus programs that help us intervene at that risk level?

519
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:18,058
[SPEAKER_20]: And then in our tier three, how do we help people who need help?

520
00:49:18,858 --> 00:49:20,379
[SPEAKER_20]: And what are the programs that look like there?

521
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:34,407
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you can see, you have a plethora of things going on in each of those levels, but I implore everyone to think about what else we should be doing and what is the most effective time, both efficient and effective, what are we doing, right?

522
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:35,888
[SPEAKER_20]: And how can we continue to improve?

523
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:48,998
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not starting anything in the city of Medford right we aren't starting a product prevention initiatives were sustaining and we're enhancing and we're becoming innovative and the state knows it.

524
00:49:50,578 --> 00:49:53,361
[SPEAKER_20]: multiple departments in the state look to Medford as innovators.

525
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:56,104
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to make sure that we keep doing that because it's fun.

526
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:11,319
[SPEAKER_20]: So short term goals for our community care survey, continued work within our promote, prevent, support Behavioral Health Commission, Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition is that acronym, that's the strategic planning we're talking about.

527
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:13,781
[SPEAKER_20]: We have opioid settlement funds that are coming

528
00:50:14,522 --> 00:50:21,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, they are here, we have some that are here, but we have a process we have to walk through, working with the community, getting feedback from the community.

529
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:33,447
[SPEAKER_20]: I have assessments going on, and we're gonna be pulling all that data together, bringing it to the Behavioral Health Commission to discuss the breakdown of what do we wanna do with this money and how we wanna relegate different projects.

530
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:41,569
[SPEAKER_20]: We wanna do more education for parents, especially for parents who have families nine and over, because we know Marie Cassidy

531
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:46,697
[SPEAKER_20]: is a gold star example of parent education for zero to eight.

532
00:50:47,816 --> 00:50:53,257
[SPEAKER_20]: And we wanna continue creating those networks for youth in different ways to do that.

533
00:50:53,277 --> 00:50:54,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'm trying to hurry up.

534
00:50:54,597 --> 00:50:57,558
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a comprehensive 30 improvements that are coming to the school.

535
00:50:57,978 --> 00:51:02,699
[SPEAKER_20]: We're looking at environmental sensors in the bathroom for monitoring vaping.

536
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:16,902
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wanna say that the heat cap process that I know Rachel is gonna get up here and talk about, we believe in my office that that's a model and we're gonna be asking all of our regional partners to look at doing that as well in their own communities.

537
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:25,126
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, innovation, bringing it to the forefront, keeping process is a part of progress.

538
00:51:25,906 --> 00:51:27,707
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for allowing me to present.

539
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Penny.

540
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:38,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sure.

541
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:39,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham, then Member McLaughlin.

542
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:41,514
[SPEAKER_13]: My question will be pretty quick.

543
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:43,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, it's just a comment.

544
00:51:43,195 --> 00:51:44,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we make sure that

545
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:50,508
[SPEAKER_13]: when we hire a new communications director, that he or she receives this presentation.

546
00:51:50,528 --> 00:52:03,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought there were some really interesting points on some of the slides about the school to home connection or lack of, and I think that's important information for our communications director to have.

547
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:07,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, yes, absolutely.

548
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent and member McLaughlin.

549
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:20,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I just was going to ask when you showed the three tiers of support because I know we have director O'Connor and director showman, I didn't know.

550
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:23,115
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know that that was your second to last slide.

551
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:33,079
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was going to ask if Stacey showman wanted to just say something regarding that particular slide, Dr. Cushing if you could show that one but I don't know.

552
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:37,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember, so if your question was about that or is it okay for.

553
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:41,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

554
00:52:43,562 --> 00:52:44,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

555
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:45,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for this information.

556
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:45,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot.

557
00:52:46,446 --> 00:52:55,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's a lot of work and I especially like the comparison data and I didn't realize I was a data nerd until I went to grad school and now I'm a total data nerd.

558
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:56,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love it.

559
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:57,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

560
00:52:58,582 --> 00:53:13,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am really excited about the possibilities as you talk about how you folks are looking at how to improve, you know, what to do next, how to involve community folks interested in the community liaisons and how those have been sort of determined.

561
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:15,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one question.

562
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you want me to do question by question or?

563
00:53:17,286 --> 00:53:19,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, yeah.

564
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:27,428
[SPEAKER_20]: So the community liaisons, in terms of determined, like what populations we're reaching out to,

565
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:37,487
[SPEAKER_03]: for both what populations are reaching out to and how did you find how did you determine who the community liaison is, and and or do they have training as well.

566
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:47,710
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have been fortunate enough to be going through this really incredible work with the Office of Environmental Affairs around climate change.

567
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:52,571
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're very interested in equity and really interested in thinking about that.

568
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:56,492
[SPEAKER_20]: And what it really is is about a sense of belonging in your community.

569
00:53:56,952 --> 00:53:57,752
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how you're going to be

570
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:02,841
[SPEAKER_20]: through COVID.

571
00:54:03,302 --> 00:54:12,347
[SPEAKER_20]: So we listened to our community, we did an assessment, and then we determined that we really needed to have community champions.

572
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:15,009
[SPEAKER_20]: So we hired five community liaisons.

573
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:24,755
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the time, 2020, when we started this initiative, it was really based on the census of the schools and the work that we've been doing with the school system of the top four languages.

574
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:30,679
[SPEAKER_20]: So the community liaisons were the Arabic-speaking, Spanish-speaking, Haitian Creole,

575
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:37,673
[SPEAKER_20]: speaking and Brazilian Portuguese speaking, but also a representative of the English speaking BIPOC community.

576
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:47,181
[SPEAKER_20]: So we spent a year and a half working with that team to really start up a Haitian task force, an Arabic task force, and Arabic speaking task force.

577
00:54:47,241 --> 00:54:48,242
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we worked with them.

578
00:54:48,503 --> 00:54:52,126
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the other folks, they were really just trying to get some traction and get some

579
00:54:52,540 --> 00:55:03,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Figuring out what's going on, what do people need and with that model we we just were elated by it, they were elated by it, and it was such rich feedback that we were getting that I believe that we.

580
00:55:04,363 --> 00:55:09,045
[SPEAKER_20]: We actually doubled down and we asked the mayor to help us get these positions through ARPA.

581
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,706
[SPEAKER_20]: We also asked the same funder to give us positions as well.

582
00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:15,147
[SPEAKER_20]: And both of them gave us those opportunities.

583
00:55:15,227 --> 00:55:22,850
[SPEAKER_20]: So with our ARPA funds, we were able to really dig in deeper and to really think about this position as a community health worker for the city of Medford.

584
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:30,073
[SPEAKER_20]: So now of our five community liaisons, three are trained community health workers, two are on their way.

585
00:55:30,554 --> 00:55:32,854
[SPEAKER_20]: We have just signed up to become a

586
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:38,371
[SPEAKER_20]: a mass health application organization.

587
00:55:38,511 --> 00:55:41,994
[SPEAKER_20]: So every one of them is getting certified, including our social workers.

588
00:55:42,474 --> 00:55:46,597
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're going to be working with the Metro Family Network and other parts within the community.

589
00:55:47,116 --> 00:55:49,578
[SPEAKER_20]: to then have them be application advisors.

590
00:55:49,598 --> 00:55:56,364
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now, one of our community liaisons, if you didn't notice, I got our lid up, because I am so obsessed with the work that they're doing.

591
00:55:56,384 --> 00:55:57,265
[SPEAKER_20]: They're so incredible.

592
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:01,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Maralea, she came to us as a Councilor.

593
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:09,235
[SPEAKER_20]: So she's already gotten, I think, like 10 to 15 individuals who speak Brazilian Portuguese Mass Health in the last two months.

594
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:11,396
[SPEAKER_20]: And she's been with us for about four months.

595
00:56:11,797 --> 00:56:14,459
[SPEAKER_20]: So she's a go-getter.

596
00:56:16,149 --> 00:56:16,669
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's that.

597
00:56:16,729 --> 00:56:23,172
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we are also working on a kiosk from the Department of Transitional Assistance to be located at the library.

598
00:56:23,753 --> 00:56:35,098
[SPEAKER_20]: And really, all of this is centered around the idea of a resiliency hub, that you have a trusted place within this community that you'll arrive to, and there'll be people there who can talk to you and speak with you and communicate with you.

599
00:56:35,398 --> 00:56:39,860
[SPEAKER_20]: So one thing that we are not doing is we are not setting ourselves up for things we cannot cash in on.

600
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:46,169
[SPEAKER_20]: So we don't tell people we're going to do this in another language when we don't have the resources to translate that language.

601
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:49,291
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just want to add one more point to this because I know I'm taking a long time.

602
00:56:49,652 --> 00:56:53,194
[SPEAKER_20]: But then with the other request we had, we did get that.

603
00:56:53,254 --> 00:56:54,655
[SPEAKER_20]: That's our Redbird connectors.

604
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:57,317
[SPEAKER_20]: And so this is a massive project for another day.

605
00:56:57,377 --> 00:56:58,278
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll tell you all about it.

606
00:56:58,678 --> 00:57:04,402
[SPEAKER_20]: But we have five language access folks that we actually went ahead and we hired.

607
00:57:06,014 --> 00:57:07,594
[SPEAKER_20]: It's actually more languages.

608
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:15,996
[SPEAKER_20]: We had an Asian language access connector, and she is able to speak three Asian languages, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese.

609
00:57:16,196 --> 00:57:22,018
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've expanded our reach there, and that's definitely a necessary population that we have to start doing.

610
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:24,338
[SPEAKER_20]: We're seeing the populations rise here and there.

611
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:31,100
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, we just have a lights out team on both ends, and we have a few more positions to fill.

612
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:33,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

613
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,551
[SPEAKER_09]: That's super.

614
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to answer that as well.

615
00:57:38,394 --> 00:57:51,044
[SPEAKER_09]: We do do the full application process so everything gets posted on the city website and on better teams, so that everybody has access to apply for these positions and we do try to take obviously Medford residents it's working out well.

616
00:57:52,119 --> 00:58:03,563
[SPEAKER_03]: that thank you that is super interesting information to me and I think one you know something that the that the city should really be celebrating it's great to know I think we've talked about.

617
00:58:04,062 --> 00:58:06,804
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing family engagement at the school levels.

618
00:58:06,944 --> 00:58:13,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, really the cultural broker model is a really important model and something I'm doing in my own work during the day.

619
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:17,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually becoming a certified application Councilor.

620
00:58:17,551 --> 00:58:18,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

621
00:58:18,172 --> 00:58:19,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So I totally understand that process.

622
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's super important.

623
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:28,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and especially with the redetermination right now, as you know, and do a lot of work with DPH, Maternal and Child Health Bureau.

624
00:58:29,434 --> 00:58:34,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so with that, I work a lot with the Division of Children, Youth, and Special Healthcare Needs.

625
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:44,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is one of the populations that I really wanted to ask you about here, especially in terms of when we're talking cultural brokers, we're talking that that's a culture in itself as well.

626
00:58:44,757 --> 00:58:56,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And so where and how are we reaching that community, particular around, you know, there's lots of issues of public health that are intersecting for families and children with youth and children

627
00:58:57,725 --> 00:58:59,747
[SPEAKER_03]: with youth with special healthcare needs.

628
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:08,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't sort of see that as a subgroup, and I'm really eager to move that forward as I'm sure you know as well, and happy to help any way I can, but I'd like to know what you guys are doing in that realm.

629
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:15,498
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, so first of all, I appreciate your offer for help because I think it's really important that we always come in as a team to make this through.

630
00:59:15,939 --> 00:59:27,047
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now, what we're doing is we have a brand new public health nurse, and we are working on trying to figure out by drawing in the three local hospitals

631
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:33,778
[SPEAKER_20]: to start a committee and start thinking about health care, chronic health, other health issues.

632
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:40,442
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're like moving and trying to grow into expanding what we're doing and how we're doing it.

633
00:59:41,102 --> 00:59:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

634
00:59:41,282 --> 00:59:43,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I'm asking that in the DEI realm as well.

635
00:59:43,764 --> 00:59:53,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So not just about, you know, chronic health care needs, but really about, you know, the connect program and other things that you were talking about, specifically some of the parent ed and some of the things that you're talking about with MFN.

636
00:59:54,386 --> 01:00:02,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are all things that I think are really important to target that community, just as we are with language access and culture access and other communities.

637
01:00:02,528 --> 01:00:11,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, happy to move that forward, but just want to put that out there and put that out there publicly, because I think all too often it's a community that gets dropped off and there's lots of intersectionality.

638
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:17,892
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people who speak other languages that also have disabilities, of course, and that just complicates issues even more.

639
01:00:18,357 --> 01:00:23,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I feel like I'm always clanging this bell and it does get a little tiresome, I'm sure.

640
01:00:23,379 --> 01:00:29,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It does for me, certainly, but I think it's something that's really important and I wanna make sure that we're moving that forward.

641
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So love everything that's happening here and I'm eager to talk more.

642
01:00:32,603 --> 01:00:34,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I definitely wanna talk to you more.

643
01:00:34,124 --> 01:00:39,186
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also just wanna give something to Sophie Antoine, who was our health inspector.

644
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:43,728
[SPEAKER_20]: She's moved into the health equity coordinator role and leading that team and she is,

645
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,271
[SPEAKER_20]: she is at the top of her game.

646
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:49,573
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I'm sure she's going to listen and be like, I got five ideas.

647
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:50,994
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be in touch.

648
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:55,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

649
01:00:56,997 --> 01:01:05,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Um from the chair, if I may, I just want to thank you, Penny and Doctor Cushing for working with Penny as well as Stacey Shulman who I know is on the call.

650
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:11,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Um collaboration is is going to only benefit not only our youth but the entire city.

651
01:01:11,866 --> 01:01:14,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I hope that we do

652
01:01:14,878 --> 01:01:24,722
[SPEAKER_09]: get another presentation right when the 2023 survey is completed and the data is analyzed so that we can have a better understanding of where we're at.

653
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:36,886
[SPEAKER_09]: But the work that you and the team and under our health director, Marianne O'Connor, who's also on the call, have done, we're making progress and we need to make more, obviously more progress, because we all know what our children are going through.

654
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:38,167
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

655
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the schools have a seat at the table at the behavioral health meetings.

656
01:01:42,495 --> 01:01:48,982
[SPEAKER_09]: That was set up about a year ago and it's it's moving along so anything I can do as mayor and I know the school committee probably feels the same way.

657
01:01:49,343 --> 01:01:55,350
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to continue this work and make sure that everybody collaborates and works together, just for the benefit of our students.

658
01:01:58,783 --> 01:01:59,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

659
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:00,163
[SPEAKER_17]: I have two questions.

660
01:02:00,844 --> 01:02:04,204
[SPEAKER_17]: The first question is, I just, just a clarification.

661
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:07,605
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, your work is for the city of Medford.

662
01:02:08,085 --> 01:02:12,766
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you also work with non Medford public school students, correct?

663
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:13,907
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

664
01:02:14,187 --> 01:02:14,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, good.

665
01:02:14,827 --> 01:02:16,187
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make that clear.

666
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:22,709
[SPEAKER_17]: The survey data though is just a public schools, because you don't really have access to survey.

667
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:33,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so, so we've we've spent many a year trying to look at this at the regional level of how to continue to work with our charter parochial and our private schools.

668
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:37,460
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a little bit harder to get in there and to do that.

669
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:42,242
[SPEAKER_20]: But it is definitely a part of our want and I meet our need.

670
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:45,583
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's really important right this is a whole community effort.

671
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:53,165
[SPEAKER_20]: And the ease of access we get because of the collaboration with the school system is fantastic.

672
01:02:53,586 --> 01:03:03,448
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think as a whole, the school community and the health department, maybe we can continue to think about how we recruit in those other schools that are serving Medford residents.

673
01:03:03,788 --> 01:03:04,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

674
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:07,429
[SPEAKER_17]: And then my second question is actually for Ms.

675
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:13,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Schulman about how does this actually look in the public schools?

676
01:03:16,747 --> 01:03:20,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, so I'm happy to answer your question which part specifically.

677
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:25,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't know if I can answer that question.

678
01:03:26,294 --> 01:03:27,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Just ask me a question.

679
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:31,598
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the survey look, how do the services look, how does

680
01:03:33,203 --> 01:03:56,656
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you give an overview of just what are the services, the schools are currently providing for our students to, especially with all of this data, what is available for students that may have difficulty with vaping or alcohol or depressive symptoms, just so that the community can have an idea of what it is we are currently doing.

681
01:03:58,957 --> 01:04:10,384
[SPEAKER_18]: whether you use the tiered, the multi-tiered system of support, or you just kind of see some of the key areas that the district, how the district is supporting students?

682
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:18,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So all students have programming related to substances through their health and wellness classes at middle school and high school.

683
01:04:18,128 --> 01:04:24,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let Director Perry talk about that, as well as additional screening for substances through SBIRT.

684
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:28,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we provide focused tiered support

685
01:04:29,218 --> 01:04:30,639
[SPEAKER_05]: related to that survey.

686
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:37,922
[SPEAKER_05]: We also support students through social emotional learning strategies within the classroom, within counseling sessions, group sessions.

687
01:04:37,982 --> 01:04:44,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So the tiered model that I showed shows a variety of supports for tier one students, meaning all students have access to those.

688
01:04:45,386 --> 01:04:49,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And then tier two is more of a group support once we've identified a need.

689
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:52,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And tier three is more of those individual focused.

690
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,931
[SPEAKER_05]: So specifically at the high school, we refer out

691
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,213
[SPEAKER_05]: our students to an I Decide program, which is a collaboration with MGH.

692
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:05,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are specifically for students who might come to an assistant principal or a Councilor and have identified a need for substance use.

693
01:05:06,979 --> 01:05:08,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a really brief overall.

694
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,342
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of supports that we offer in the schools right now.

695
01:05:11,462 --> 01:05:16,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we're continuing to collaborate with community providers and always strive to do better.

696
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:21,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

697
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:24,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

698
01:05:24,301 --> 01:05:29,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Maryann as well.

699
01:05:29,905 --> 01:05:37,589
[SPEAKER_09]: We have report on NWEA MAP end of year testing in literacy and math for school year 2022-2023.

700
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:38,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

701
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Suzanne Galusi, assistant superintendent.

702
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:00,173
[SPEAKER_09]: evening.

703
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss Miss Lucy and team.

704
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:06,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

705
01:06:07,356 --> 01:06:07,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

706
01:06:10,537 --> 01:06:10,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

707
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:16,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

708
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

709
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:22,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Green light to chill on the microphone.

710
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's on.

711
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:29,370
[SPEAKER_18]: You should be fine.

712
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,990
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just go.

713
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:32,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

714
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:33,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

715
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:34,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good evening.

716
01:06:35,071 --> 01:06:38,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to just introduce the team.

717
01:06:38,752 --> 01:06:43,793
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all here to present on the map assessment reports for this current school year.

718
01:06:44,553 --> 01:06:49,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And to get us started, I'm going to introduce Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli.

719
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:53,362
[SPEAKER_21]: evening everyone.

720
01:06:53,702 --> 01:06:58,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Dr. Cushing, do we have the presentation that can be put up?

721
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:00,349
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be great.

722
01:07:01,229 --> 01:07:03,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so this was a team effort.

723
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:07,155
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to just tell you that we didn't have a lot of time to turn this around.

724
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:10,238
[SPEAKER_21]: The MAP scores closed last week.

725
01:07:10,298 --> 01:07:11,980
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe it was Wednesday of last week.

726
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,344
[SPEAKER_21]: The scores were available for us to analyze beginning Thursday night and then

727
01:07:16,884 --> 01:07:22,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Friday into the weekend, and today we were involved in analyzing these scores.

728
01:07:23,725 --> 01:07:27,206
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to go over the agenda, so if you can just go to the next slide.

729
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:34,067
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we're going to cover tonight, just some map growth reminders about the general setup of the test.

730
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:43,829
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go over the Metropolitan Public Schools 22-23 growth data in mathematics, in reading, in science, technology, and engineering.

731
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:46,670
[SPEAKER_21]: So for the departments, we have Ms.

732
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:55,052
[SPEAKER_21]: Faiza Khan for math, we have Dr. Nicole Chiesa for reading, and Mr. Rocco Sieri for the science, technology, and engineering.

733
01:07:55,592 --> 01:08:03,594
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna go over the data cycles that in some respects we have done already, but we also have some future goals.

734
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:08,635
[SPEAKER_21]: So the projected data goals and the district-wide data cycles will be covered by Ms.

735
01:08:09,195 --> 01:08:10,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Suzanne Galusi.

736
01:08:10,715 --> 01:08:12,956
[SPEAKER_21]: And then lastly, available to the committee

737
01:08:13,576 --> 01:08:21,238
[SPEAKER_21]: and anyone else who wants to see it, are lists of data, school-based map growth data specifically.

738
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:27,639
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to give you just some reminders, so reflecting back to the fall when we did a full presentation.

739
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:29,700
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, we went over MAP growth.

740
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,742
[SPEAKER_21]: If you remember, MAP stands for measured academic progress.

741
01:08:34,982 --> 01:08:44,986
[SPEAKER_21]: So these tests that are given three times a year in the fall, winter, and spring are measures of what students know, regardless of their age or their grade level.

742
01:08:45,606 --> 01:08:47,687
[SPEAKER_21]: and it measures their growth over time.

743
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:49,328
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's a significant part of this.

744
01:08:49,748 --> 01:08:53,490
[SPEAKER_21]: Where is the growth and where specifically is it?

745
01:08:54,511 --> 01:08:56,271
[SPEAKER_21]: And how much did they grow?

746
01:08:57,052 --> 01:08:59,453
[SPEAKER_21]: It's important to understand that the test is adaptive.

747
01:08:59,813 --> 01:09:03,875
[SPEAKER_21]: So that means that the question complexity is determined by right or wrong answers.

748
01:09:04,376 --> 01:09:08,418
[SPEAKER_21]: The student is taking the test and they answer a question correctly.

749
01:09:08,758 --> 01:09:12,840
[SPEAKER_21]: The next question is more difficult and it progresses in that way.

750
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:21,855
[SPEAKER_21]: It's important to know that this is only one data point that helps to inform decisions regarding instructional practices and student support.

751
01:09:22,355 --> 01:09:24,015
[SPEAKER_21]: So a little bit later in the presentation, Ms.

752
01:09:24,596 --> 01:09:26,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Galussi is gonna go over data triangulation.

753
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:31,059
[SPEAKER_21]: So keeping in mind, it's only one measure, an important formative assessment measure.

754
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:40,943
[SPEAKER_21]: The scores are based on RIT scores, which is a statistical formula that equates the scores in even intervals.

755
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:59,108
[SPEAKER_21]: And this test assesses achievement, so there is a way to get achievement information, growth, as we said, and through their linking studies that NWEA map has created, it can predict success on state assessments and college readiness.

756
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:08,711
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so at this point, we're gonna delve into the subject-specific data, and I will turn it over to Ms.

757
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:09,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Faisal Khan for mathematics.

758
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:12,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Cadelli.

759
01:10:16,598 --> 01:10:17,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

760
01:10:17,378 --> 01:10:30,861
[SPEAKER_12]: So the graph that you see here shows you the projected growth versus the growth that happened here in Medford Public Schools in the classrooms.

761
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:44,703
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the progression on this chart, starting from pre-K all the way to 10th, although the test is from kindergarten through 10th grade, so that's what you see.

762
01:10:45,423 --> 01:10:53,751
[SPEAKER_12]: on the chart, you see that we are missing the mark on grade five and grade six.

763
01:10:54,312 --> 01:11:06,623
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as the subsequent slides, we'll probably talk more about that missing the mark and where we are meeting the mark and where we are exceeding the expectations.

764
01:11:07,992 --> 01:11:12,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide is, there you go.

765
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:17,399
[SPEAKER_12]: So there it's laid out, grade K through grade 10.

766
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:28,127
[SPEAKER_12]: We did, we met the 40% growth mark in all these grades, but in grade one,

767
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:38,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Students demonstrated the most significant growth, as, as you can see, and on in grade five, though we were not able to meet the 40%.

768
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:42,157
[SPEAKER_12]: We were only able to get to 35% so we missed it by about 5% the growth target.

769
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:52,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide is, this is a more detailed slide.

770
01:11:53,056 --> 01:11:59,582
[SPEAKER_12]: You see the same numbers in the right most column that you just saw on the slide before.

771
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:13,975
[SPEAKER_12]: What we can see is that K through four grades have exceeded the national spring mean rate, district spring mean rate in grades K through four.

772
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:21,580
[SPEAKER_12]: On this slide, we see more growth than we see nationally.

773
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,003
[SPEAKER_12]: In grade five, we see that we came very close.

774
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,383
[SPEAKER_12]: We were 217.7, and the national was 218.75.

775
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:33,407
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do see that 35% that I pointed to in the earlier slide, as in we missed the mark of 40% growth.

776
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:48,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide is six through 10, that's our secondary grades.

777
01:12:49,151 --> 01:13:02,614
[SPEAKER_12]: And we see that in grade six and seven, we are also trailing a little behind in our spring mean rate as compared to the national rate.

778
01:13:03,115 --> 01:13:08,676
[SPEAKER_12]: But then we are on par in grade eight and become very, very close.

779
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:15,279
[SPEAKER_12]: in grade nine, then we miss it again, but being very close in our grade 10.

780
01:13:16,379 --> 01:13:21,822
[SPEAKER_12]: That pretty much summarizes how we did in math, grades K through 10.

781
01:13:22,622 --> 01:13:27,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will pass it to Dr. Chiesa now.

782
01:13:27,924 --> 01:13:28,505
[SPEAKER_12]: So here we go.

783
01:13:30,245 --> 01:13:30,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

784
01:13:36,568 --> 01:13:37,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

785
01:13:38,089 --> 01:13:38,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me okay?

786
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

787
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:48,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to English language arts when we look at the next slide, which is the diamond and the bar graph.

788
01:13:50,694 --> 01:13:51,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

789
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:55,717
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that some grades have met or exceeded their growth.

790
01:13:56,518 --> 01:13:59,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Some grades have not met or exceeded their growth.

791
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:00,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have fallen behind.

792
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:07,464
[SPEAKER_00]: The percentage of students who did hit the target will be on the next page as we move on.

793
01:14:07,644 --> 01:14:09,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Cushing, thank you.

794
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:14,248
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is we see that in K1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, we have 40,

795
01:14:19,821 --> 01:14:27,594
[SPEAKER_00]: percent or higher 43% or higher hitting achieving growth of hitting above that mark.

796
01:14:27,855 --> 01:14:31,862
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grade one whereas the committee knows we've done quite a lot of work.

797
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:44,729
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grade one demonstrating the most significant reading growth with 71% of the district's first graders meeting or exceeding their specific growth target.

798
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see grade six, nine, and 10, they fall below the 40%.

799
01:14:48,972 --> 01:14:51,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade six had a 30% meeting the target, 37% grade nine, 30% grade 10.

800
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:11,874
[SPEAKER_00]: On the next slide, you're going to have more detailed information comparing how did we do in the fall with our mean RIT compared to the spring compared to the national overall.

801
01:15:12,014 --> 01:15:24,236
[SPEAKER_00]: And that national spring RIT, just to be clear, that is a number that is determined by map growth, and it's done over a course of several years.

802
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:26,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So that national spring RIT is actually a 2020,

803
01:15:28,297 --> 01:15:40,251
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the latest they have for their national spring writ prior to coven so I just feel like it's important to mention that when I spoke with them, they are they are not releasing a new writ next year.

804
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:45,597
[SPEAKER_00]: They are looking to release a new writ hopefully in two years, just so you know, for comparison sake.

805
01:15:46,566 --> 01:15:49,969
[SPEAKER_00]: As you look through this slide, you will see a few things.

806
01:15:50,630 --> 01:16:04,823
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see that overall elementary had a strong percentage of district students meeting growth and that they did exceed that national spring rate and they had growth each year.

807
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:19,174
[SPEAKER_00]: The last slide for me, and it says reading at the top, because I think it's important to note that this is assessing reading, the reading strand of ELA.

808
01:16:19,434 --> 01:16:21,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a writing test.

809
01:16:21,716 --> 01:16:22,917
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pure reading.

810
01:16:22,957 --> 01:16:26,580
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the speaking and listening or writing, just the reading.

811
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that the secondary level

812
01:16:28,962 --> 01:16:30,162
[SPEAKER_00]: we did have some struggles.

813
01:16:30,402 --> 01:16:38,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So grade seven and eight, the percentage of district students did meet growth at a 46 and 44%, respectively.

814
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:45,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade six, nine, and 10, they struggled in terms of meeting their growth at 31, 37, and 30.

815
01:16:46,506 --> 01:16:51,868
[SPEAKER_00]: A few things that we now need to do with the data, which I know Ms.

816
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:57,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Galussi and Dr. Riccadeli will get into, we need to look at when this test was given.

817
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,918
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of thinking about test stamina, I think it's secondary.

818
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:04,740
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely some significant needs here.

819
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:11,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need to look at how our literacy interventionists are being used at the middle school.

820
01:17:11,805 --> 01:17:19,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will, they'll take this data and this will be one of the components for the students that they are servicing as well, since they are explicitly reading.

821
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:25,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the committee knows, English has several other strands to work with as well.

822
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:29,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now going to turn it over to Mr. Cieri.

823
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:35,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.

824
01:17:38,139 --> 01:17:47,427
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that the report perhaps mirror subject to subject so that there's a bit of ease of understanding what you're looking at.

825
01:17:49,380 --> 01:18:01,123
[SPEAKER_01]: The bar graph records the writ growth, and the diamond is the projected grade level growth.

826
01:18:01,703 --> 01:18:05,003
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that at grade four and five, kids are very close.

827
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:10,905
[SPEAKER_01]: At grades three and six, they're a bit off the mark compared to growth.

828
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:16,586
[SPEAKER_01]: They did grow, but not as much as we might anticipate.

829
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:21,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not give tests in grades K1 and 2 for science.

830
01:18:22,347 --> 01:18:30,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And at grades 8, 9, and 10, we give the test twice, but it's given in the fall and in the winter.

831
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:38,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next slide, you'll see the RIT scores from the fall and the winter for grades 8, 9, and 10.

832
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:44,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, in the following slide, you'll see the scores in the fall and the winter.

833
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:50,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And this chart or this table is a bit more, it's a lot of numbers.

834
01:18:51,263 --> 01:18:54,844
[SPEAKER_01]: but it repeats the same information that was shared for mathematics and reading.

835
01:18:56,384 --> 01:19:07,887
[SPEAKER_01]: The district score in the fall, you can see that growth occurs in the spring for grades three, four, five, six, and seven.

836
01:19:08,607 --> 01:19:16,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third column of data compares it to the national school mean rate for the spring.

837
01:19:17,429 --> 01:19:21,871
[SPEAKER_01]: for those grades, and then to the winter for grades 8, 9, and 10.

838
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:32,034
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to preserve that measure so you could see the exact number of weeks of instruction directly.

839
01:19:32,994 --> 01:19:38,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And even there in grades 8, 9, and 10, you still see growth overall for our students from one

840
01:19:41,004 --> 01:19:47,146
[SPEAKER_01]: from the fall to the winter, and you see it exceed the national school mean rate score.

841
01:19:47,627 --> 01:19:54,189
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we don't have any data that allows us to see the year-long trend.

842
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:59,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a reminder, that MCAS in science is given in grade eight.

843
01:20:00,432 --> 01:20:01,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's given in grade five.

844
01:20:01,852 --> 01:20:02,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It's given in grade eight.

845
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,405
[SPEAKER_01]: eat the expectations in grade nine.

846
01:20:11,845 --> 01:20:17,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't want to have a lot of interaction between the two tests at the same time for students.

847
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:32,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also wanted teachers to anticipate some of the needs of the students in the winter when that exam was given to lead up to the exam in the spring, the MCAS exam in the spring.

848
01:20:33,771 --> 01:20:43,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was said, there is some correlation, it's not an exact match, but it gives us some information about what can be possible to support the learners in class for the students.

849
01:20:46,235 --> 01:20:55,878
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I'm gonna pause my part of the presentation and we're gonna move to a more global perspective on it.

850
01:20:58,527 --> 01:20:58,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

851
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:04,848
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to just shift a little bit to talk about data and what we're doing with it.

852
01:21:05,148 --> 01:21:07,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've seen this image before.

853
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:16,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been in our slide deck when we've presented to this body about the NWEA map assessment results.

854
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:24,012
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to just pause for a second just to kind of, yes, we punctuate that this is one data set because it is.

855
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:26,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of triangulating data is taking

856
01:21:27,092 --> 01:21:29,833
[SPEAKER_07]: all the pieces of data that we have at our fingertips.

857
01:21:30,373 --> 01:21:37,055
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also wanted to say that the essence of the MAP assessment is information for the teachers.

858
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:44,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's information for the teachers that are going to give them the instructional level and capabilities of their students.

859
01:21:45,518 --> 01:22:05,101
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why when we presented in the fall and we went through all of the different reports that MAP offers for teachers to use as a means to compare to state standards and understand the standards in which the students are achieving, the standards in which the students are excelling, and the standards in which the students need a little bit more intervention.

860
01:22:06,514 --> 01:22:17,967
[SPEAKER_07]: It also helps it gives resources for teachers, so that they can group their students and provide that specific tailored support that students need it's.

861
01:22:19,426 --> 01:22:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: not necessarily the vehicle we've provided, you know, for community-wide presentations.

862
01:22:27,013 --> 01:22:31,057
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really meant to provide teachers with that information when they're working with students.

863
01:22:31,538 --> 01:22:38,784
[SPEAKER_07]: The information we've given you this evening are the pieces of that global information in relative for

864
01:22:39,525 --> 01:22:41,166
[SPEAKER_07]: how we are as a district overall?

865
01:22:41,786 --> 01:22:43,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we meeting our growth?

866
01:22:43,687 --> 01:22:50,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are those projections and how we are in comparison to the national standards?

867
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we go to the next slide, we have some goals for what we're doing with our data.

868
01:22:57,662 --> 01:23:00,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a work in progress.

869
01:23:01,402 --> 01:23:17,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, clearly, the wonderful and experienced crew that I have here with me, they've been working with data within their departments and map growth with the teachers in their departments extensively in their department level meetings.

870
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:34,378
[SPEAKER_07]: The work that we have to do as a district is making sure that we have set up systems and structures around data, and who's a part of those cycles, and making sure that teachers are using data to inform their instruction.

871
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:37,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been happening in pockets around Medford.

872
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,861
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't been structured.

873
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:44,365
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to create that system, and that's part of what we're going to be building here as we go.

874
01:23:44,785 --> 01:23:46,706
[SPEAKER_07]: And this will be for K to 12.

875
01:23:48,007 --> 01:23:58,216
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the, this is our kind of three year plan that we've just wanted to put a lot of the work that we have in this next year one reflects next year, 2324.

876
01:23:58,256 --> 01:24:07,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And so a lot of this work is ongoing, we just need to keep continuing and finalize.

877
01:24:07,985 --> 01:24:19,837
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been working, as you know, with Rebus, a lot of the training that we've been doing, and we've been working as an administrative unit on calibrating teaching and learning across the district.

878
01:24:20,337 --> 01:24:30,087
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to be finalized in the summer months when we're all together in our sessions to ensure that when we're doing instructional learning walks,

879
01:24:31,579 --> 01:24:39,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And having data cycles and data conversations, we're all aligned on the calibration of teaching and learning for the city of Medford.

880
01:24:42,834 --> 01:24:46,975
[SPEAKER_07]: That in continuation is also the professional development around that.

881
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:54,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're ensuring that that professional development continues for administrators and also includes educators for next year.

882
01:24:55,598 --> 01:25:05,521
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that we are going to be looking to do next year is bring in an online platform that can calibrate and it brings all of

883
01:25:07,165 --> 01:25:20,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Our assessments on to one platform, so it will upload and cast results map results at the elementary level and the middle school level with Dr cases intervention is the devil's any.

884
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:38,142
[SPEAKER_07]: school school wide data that we want will all be compiled on this one platform and that will be K to 12 so this way teachers will be able to manipulate right down to the standards, how those students are doing.

885
01:25:38,814 --> 01:25:42,639
[SPEAKER_07]: across the board in all of the data sets, not just one.

886
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:52,293
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to really help when we start developing data cycles with educators because they're going to have all of the information on one platform.

887
01:25:57,398 --> 01:26:12,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Building student supports around data is something that we've been doing for quite some time, but that is a continuous work in progress and by bringing in structured data cycles, we'll be able to enhance the supports that we're giving students.

888
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:22,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing is to make sure so each year all educators at every level teachers and administrators.

889
01:26:24,198 --> 01:26:36,490
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to do smart goals, so they have to set a goal for themselves for professional learning and for student learning, and so we want to ensure that we're targeting smart goals around data.

890
01:26:38,143 --> 01:26:41,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is some of the work that we're going to be doing across the board.

891
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:59,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with some of the, especially at the elementary level, with the math program this year, and which we'll talk about in a little bit, the new literacy program, we have to start looking at report card alignment, which also reflects some of the data and how students are doing.

892
01:27:00,217 --> 01:27:00,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Year two,

893
01:27:03,495 --> 01:27:08,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Common assessment rubrics beyond midterms and finals at the secondary level.

894
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:20,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably should have put something in there about the secondary level but the curriculum directors have worked with their departments to ensure that midterms and finals are are

895
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: calibrated across the district and that common assessment rubrics have been created.

896
01:27:27,253 --> 01:27:42,503
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to continue that work beyond midterms and finals so that the work that's being done within each course is aligned and looks similar targeted to the student, excuse me, targeted to the standards.

897
01:27:44,585 --> 01:27:50,147
[SPEAKER_07]: continued work on the report cards from K to five, and then fitnessing year two and into year three.

898
01:27:50,327 --> 01:28:09,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very, very lofty job, but we do need to start working on grading alignment six through 12, which is a continuation of the common assessment rubrics, but that's a real deep dive into looking at each course syllabi and how we're constructing grades at the secondary level.

899
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:14,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving to the next slide, this is just a, it's very broad.

900
01:28:15,113 --> 01:28:21,879
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something we're still building, but this speaks to the data cycles that we will be implementing next year.

901
01:28:24,181 --> 01:28:29,886
[SPEAKER_07]: At the elementary level, this is part of what HILFA literacy is going to help guide us in doing.

902
01:28:30,747 --> 01:28:35,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to also ensure that we're continuing that work and implementing that work six through 12.

903
01:28:37,233 --> 01:28:47,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already spoken about the online data tracking portal, but what this represents is that we will be having district wide formalized data cycles.

904
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:56,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Every three to five or three excuse me three to five times a year, so the three times a year the benchmark cycles that is around.

905
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,714
[SPEAKER_07]: The map growth beginning, middle and end.

906
01:29:01,094 --> 01:29:02,855
[SPEAKER_07]: That also includes dibbles data.

907
01:29:03,215 --> 01:29:06,136
[SPEAKER_07]: So any type of assessment that's given three times a year.

908
01:29:06,156 --> 01:29:15,239
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the very structured formal data cycle where we're looking at achievement and how students are doing In those meetings.

909
01:29:16,593 --> 01:29:35,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I've listed who will be part of those meetings, but it is educators, it's school leaders, it's curriculum directors, it's coaches, so that everyone is analyzing and talking about the data and also making sure we're targeting student supports based on what the data is telling us.

910
01:29:36,206 --> 01:29:45,572
[SPEAKER_07]: In between those three benchmark cycles, so in between the beginning of the year and the middle of the year, there's a progress monitoring cycle.

911
01:29:46,906 --> 01:29:51,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And likewise, in between the middle of the year and the end of the year, there's another progress monitoring cycle.

912
01:29:52,371 --> 01:29:57,396
[SPEAKER_07]: At the secondary level, around report cards, they have progress reports.

913
01:29:58,037 --> 01:30:10,669
[SPEAKER_07]: But in each department, there is department-level data that will also be utilized to ensure that students, just to check on the targeted group of students and ensure that progress is being made.

914
01:30:13,151 --> 01:30:19,734
[SPEAKER_07]: For the reading interventionists, they are using DIBLS, so the DIBLS data is progress monitored and we will have that data as well.

915
01:30:23,976 --> 01:30:24,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that was a lot.

916
01:30:26,383 --> 01:30:40,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm hoping that at this time, the appendix is for, as Dr. Riccadeli mentioned, if a community member would like, or for school committee, it's school specific data.

917
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:47,354
[SPEAKER_07]: But at this point, if you have any questions, we're more than happy to answer them and we thank you very much.

918
01:30:49,415 --> 01:30:50,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for the presentation.

919
01:30:50,856 --> 01:30:52,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate you all being here.

920
01:30:53,097 --> 01:30:53,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

921
01:30:55,526 --> 01:31:00,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you all plugged into the next gen MCAS piloting that's going on?

922
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:02,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Winchester is participating.

923
01:31:03,293 --> 01:31:16,705
[SPEAKER_13]: And we went to, Paul and I, Member Ruseau and I went to Day on the Hill, and Senator Jalen invited us to have lunch with her, and there were some students from Winchester who joined us.

924
01:31:17,578 --> 01:31:38,254
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was so fascinating to hear them talk about participating in this pilot and how much they liked the assessments that they were doing because they were useful and encouraged critical thinking and project-based, which is frankly like life instead of taking a test.

925
01:31:38,354 --> 01:31:40,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we have the whole like, it doesn't matter.

926
01:31:41,036 --> 01:31:41,777
[SPEAKER_13]: It does matter.

927
01:31:41,837 --> 01:31:43,578
[SPEAKER_13]: And you throw it away.

928
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:44,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people don't care.

929
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:45,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people do.

930
01:31:46,212 --> 01:31:56,518
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought it was really fascinating to hear these seniors talk about the impact and the value and the fact that they liked these assessments and how different it was.

931
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,619
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was just curious if we're going to try to plug into that at all.

932
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:02,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

933
01:32:03,782 --> 01:32:07,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what's interesting to me is that originally that was the intent of MCAS.

934
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:09,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.

935
01:32:11,377 --> 01:32:12,698
[SPEAKER_07]: which is what the S stands for.

936
01:32:13,018 --> 01:32:16,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was supposed to be a system and not just a test.

937
01:32:16,179 --> 01:32:18,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's a long time coming.

938
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:26,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be very interested in hearing the perspectives, but I can, through you to connect.

939
01:32:26,743 --> 01:32:26,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

940
01:32:27,063 --> 01:32:31,525
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think I have some information that Senator Jalen sent, so I will share it with you.

941
01:32:31,585 --> 01:32:32,205
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

942
01:32:32,345 --> 01:32:32,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

943
01:32:36,487 --> 01:32:36,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

944
01:32:37,851 --> 01:32:38,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

945
01:32:38,431 --> 01:32:58,537
[SPEAKER_17]: As member Graham just mentioned that when we were, we were with Senator Jalen, it was, it was really kind of shocking to have students describing their state assessments as something where they, aside from being interesting, they were actually education going on.

946
01:32:58,957 --> 01:33:05,119
[SPEAKER_17]: They were learning in the process of being assessed, which is sort of the definition of the opposite.

947
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:05,659
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like

948
01:33:06,264 --> 01:33:13,110
[SPEAKER_17]: literally every other assessment given in school, as far as I can understand, there's no learning involved.

949
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:14,010
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the opposite.

950
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,592
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, what's in there already?

951
01:33:16,913 --> 01:33:27,001
[SPEAKER_17]: So to see these students describe it, it was, I mean, I honestly had not really thought about an assessment as possibly even being like that.

952
01:33:28,262 --> 01:33:29,843
[SPEAKER_17]: So I certainly agree we should look into that.

953
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,286
[SPEAKER_17]: The other question, I did have a question though about,

954
01:33:34,465 --> 01:34:01,702
[SPEAKER_17]: When we say a percentage of students, and forgive me, I'm sure we have gone over this a few times, percentage of students is meeting the growth that could also be set up the opposite, the corollary is that certain percentage of students are not meeting their growth, but meeting your growth and not meeting your growth, like you could just barely not be meeting growth and you would be in the, not counted in this number,

955
01:34:02,773 --> 01:34:07,235
[SPEAKER_17]: But you could also be getting a 1% growth, and it's no different.

956
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:11,457
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I do worry a little bit about the focus.

957
01:34:11,477 --> 01:34:16,039
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I was so happy by that 71% in reading.

958
01:34:16,059 --> 01:34:17,059
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so happy.

959
01:34:17,079 --> 01:34:20,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I cannot wait to see what the next few years show.

960
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:26,723
[SPEAKER_17]: But for all the students that are not meeting growth, this data doesn't really

961
01:34:27,264 --> 01:34:40,014
[SPEAKER_17]: these high level things do not say anything about whether they were just under the skin of their teeth, not meeting growth, or whether they were like, you know, totally a complete wreck.

962
01:34:41,815 --> 01:34:46,979
[SPEAKER_17]: And from a school committee perspective, I feel like that's a really important thing.

963
01:34:47,019 --> 01:34:56,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure it's an important thing for you all and for teachers, obviously, and for students, but is there a different view of the data that helps us understand that?

964
01:34:58,473 --> 01:35:02,536
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, you're 100% correct, and I want to let my team chime in.

965
01:35:02,576 --> 01:35:04,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I just happened to be the last one holding the microphone.

966
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:06,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Two pieces, though, for me.

967
01:35:07,841 --> 01:35:08,701
[SPEAKER_07]: One is yes.

968
01:35:09,062 --> 01:35:21,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So that number does also reflect that there are maybe students that are already achieving above grade level standards, but they may not have met the projected growth that MAP has established for them based on there.

969
01:35:21,972 --> 01:35:26,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's also the other end, because that percentage is not just

970
01:35:27,697 --> 01:35:34,082
[SPEAKER_07]: encompassing students that are not meeting the mark, if that makes sense.

971
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it's difficult.

972
01:35:38,646 --> 01:35:48,554
[SPEAKER_07]: We showed in the fall all the different reports that teachers have their fingertips on, because again, the point of MAP is the conversation

973
01:35:49,804 --> 01:35:52,585
[SPEAKER_07]: for teachers to have within their school leaders and with families.

974
01:35:53,126 --> 01:36:03,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's that information so that they can see one of, I think one of the best reports there is the student profile report, which is interactive.

975
01:36:04,051 --> 01:36:11,094
[SPEAKER_07]: So it provides them with a color coding so they can see right away if it's a red or an orange, or if it's a green or a blue.

976
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:27,543
[SPEAKER_07]: they're able to toggle between all three subjects and they're also able to see by standard, they're able to see the skills that the students are emerging to, that they need reinforcement on or that they're ready to tackle next.

977
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:37,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the piece that the teachers have so that they can drill down and see exactly where the students are in terms of the standards.

978
01:36:38,386 --> 01:36:39,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there more that?

979
01:36:40,247 --> 01:36:48,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, just to add to that so I agree I think that probably is the most useful report which is the, the student profile report I actually have one pulled up right here.

980
01:36:51,587 --> 01:36:59,670
[SPEAKER_21]: and I can't project it, but just to reiterate, it does say where the student is, where they need to grow, where they need to develop.

981
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:05,232
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just, I think it's a great conversation piece.

982
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:06,712
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a great piece to grow from.

983
01:37:07,092 --> 01:37:20,057
[SPEAKER_21]: Not sure that it's answering your question here, but I will just reiterate again is the, you know, a student that's performing at a higher level is going to see less growth.

984
01:37:21,449 --> 01:37:23,872
[SPEAKER_21]: just by nature of where they are.

985
01:37:23,953 --> 01:37:26,356
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that needs to be taken into consideration.

986
01:37:26,816 --> 01:37:30,461
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have that number.

987
01:37:30,481 --> 01:37:35,347
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure that we have access to that number as to how many were that close.

988
01:37:35,908 --> 01:37:37,290
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think your point is well taken.

989
01:37:38,683 --> 01:37:50,487
[SPEAKER_21]: We actually had a call with map growth today, and it was a question that came up, and you really have the conversation with the representative did you want to speak a little bit because it, it gets.

990
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:04,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the only thing I'll mention is when we did have the conversation with map growth.

991
01:38:04,735 --> 01:38:17,542
[SPEAKER_00]: It did reaffirm what we've been taught in our trainings, which is the number of reports within map is significant for the teacher right for the teacher for the parent at a district level.

992
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:18,503
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very minimal.

993
01:38:18,883 --> 01:38:20,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because of exactly what

994
01:38:20,819 --> 01:38:20,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

995
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:30,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Galussi and Dr. Riccadeli just said, because it is aimed at looking at a child, not as a number, but in the content areas of where they should grow.

996
01:38:30,165 --> 01:38:35,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the teacher, whether it's math, science, or reading, needs to zone in.

997
01:38:35,129 --> 01:38:42,954
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are an overwhelming number of reports, and we have trained the teachers on it in terms of those individual student looks.

998
01:38:43,534 --> 01:38:45,656
[SPEAKER_00]: As an aggregate, there are very few.

999
01:38:45,756 --> 01:38:49,478
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we present to you, it is a little bit of a,

1000
01:38:50,953 --> 01:38:55,754
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't a lot from that aggregate that we wanna make sure we show effectively too.

1001
01:38:56,114 --> 01:38:56,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you.

1002
01:38:57,174 --> 01:39:15,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, speaking about MCAS again, it's like MCAS is like, there's a number and it's just very straightforward, frankly, to understand at all levels, but this is growth and we want everybody growing.

1003
01:39:15,338 --> 01:39:17,838
[SPEAKER_17]: So even if you're students in all AP classes,

1004
01:39:19,232 --> 01:39:22,735
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, nobody wants their kid to just be like, okay, you succeeded, you're done.

1005
01:39:22,995 --> 01:39:26,077
[SPEAKER_17]: And like, it's not a thing, you want to keep growing.

1006
01:39:26,197 --> 01:39:38,226
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is, it's a, it's a, I appreciate understanding that the, the high level reports are kind of harder to, I mean, that we have the one report really.

1007
01:39:39,047 --> 01:39:47,773
[SPEAKER_17]: And that conceptually, it's not, it's just not the same as MCAS and other things where you can just like, pick a number and say, that's the number.

1008
01:39:47,993 --> 01:39:48,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1009
01:39:48,294 --> 01:39:48,794
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that.

1010
01:39:52,637 --> 01:39:53,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1011
01:39:53,298 --> 01:40:04,420
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to move on to announcement of newly selected elementary literacy program for school year 2324 miss Suzanne Lucy assistant superintendent.

1012
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:09,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you, thank you again.

1013
01:40:11,196 --> 01:40:24,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So with me this evening, I also have Dr. Nicole Chiesa and Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli, who the three of us were kind of the chairs, the facilitators of this process, the review process.

1014
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,553
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dr. Chiesa started this process last year.

1015
01:40:27,573 --> 01:40:29,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have her start the presentation.

1016
01:40:31,226 --> 01:40:32,226
[SPEAKER_00]: So good evening again.

1017
01:40:32,246 --> 01:40:34,167
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very excited to be here.

1018
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:37,768
[SPEAKER_00]: It's after years of hard work and with all of your support as well.

1019
01:40:37,808 --> 01:40:40,228
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very excited for this announcement tonight.

1020
01:40:41,489 --> 01:40:54,052
[SPEAKER_00]: As previously reported to you a few different times over the past two years, the district has convened multiple teams of diverse stakeholders to engage in a full review of high quality instructional literacy materials.

1021
01:40:55,299 --> 01:41:09,986
[SPEAKER_00]: In total, we've had 65 teachers, 13 administrators, and 16 community members as part of this process, and they have dedicated over 2,000 hours to this entire review process.

1022
01:41:10,947 --> 01:41:14,148
[SPEAKER_00]: This also included our partnership with Hill for Literacy.

1023
01:41:15,049 --> 01:41:19,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll thank them at the end, but I want to take a moment and thank everybody for their

1024
01:41:20,618 --> 01:41:22,839
[SPEAKER_00]: their tireless work on this.

1025
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:33,803
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial review, first of all, ensured alignment with mass literacy and also considered DESE's multi-tiered system of support.

1026
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:46,928
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at ed reports, which we've talked about before, as well as curate, which is specific to Massachusetts, as we made a well-educated, as the team made a well-educated decision.

1027
01:41:50,618 --> 01:41:52,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I can do that.

1028
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do the next paragraph and then Ms.

1029
01:41:54,202 --> 01:41:54,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Glossy can do it.

1030
01:41:55,143 --> 01:42:02,070
[SPEAKER_00]: The final analysis included the use of a detailed, very detailed, evidence-based literacy review tool.

1031
01:42:03,436 --> 01:42:06,359
[SPEAKER_00]: It was developed by leading literacy researchers.

1032
01:42:06,999 --> 01:42:21,612
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the teachers as a real forefront in completing these tools and using this tool, the chosen literacy program was Houghton Mifflin Harcourt into reading.

1033
01:42:22,033 --> 01:42:24,695
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a clear front runner, clear.

1034
01:42:27,884 --> 01:42:28,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna keep going.

1035
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:33,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Inter-reading is aligned, first of all, with our foundational skills program, ECRI.

1036
01:42:34,445 --> 01:42:40,207
[SPEAKER_00]: It incorporates solid comprehension and zones in on the writing skills as well.

1037
01:42:41,147 --> 01:42:49,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really important part, and again, the tool that they used was significant, pages and pages of analysis.

1038
01:42:50,009 --> 01:42:55,090
[SPEAKER_00]: It also provided a diverse reading selection, which was critical for all readers.

1039
01:42:57,099 --> 01:43:13,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a side note, ironically, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has also, in January of this past year, purchased NWEA map growth, well, excuse me, map, which I think is very interesting and part of our previous presentation.

1040
01:43:13,753 --> 01:43:40,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So upon school committee approval, educators will immediately engage in professional development opportunities, partly because we want to make sure that our educators are well prepared, and also because as we've presented to this body before, we received a grant through the Department of Education that requires us to make sure that we have purchased the program and provide the first round of professional development by June 30th.

1041
01:43:43,792 --> 01:43:47,455
[SPEAKER_07]: The professional development for teachers and administrators.

1042
01:43:48,777 --> 01:44:01,569
[SPEAKER_07]: As part of the program will include initial implementation training 48 sessions of coaching online coaching which will be utilized during common planning time, and for in person coaching days.

1043
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:05,513
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what is going to be through the program.

1044
01:44:05,713 --> 01:44:09,796
[SPEAKER_07]: We also still have our partnership with Hill for Literacy next year as well.

1045
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:27,491
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will have more extensive training that will include training of coaches, bimonthly coaching sessions, training of administration, teachers, best practices and formalized data cycles.

1046
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:43,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of this initial training and professional development is we want to make sure that we have provided our teachers and families with everything that they need to fully implement this new program.

1047
01:44:44,441 --> 01:44:48,765
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, if you have any questions, we would love to answer them.

1048
01:44:52,908 --> 01:44:53,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

1049
01:44:54,178 --> 01:44:55,940
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanna say yay, I'm so happy.

1050
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:03,327
[SPEAKER_17]: It hurts for me to smile right now because of a dental thing, but I'm just very happy.

1051
01:45:03,347 --> 01:45:08,953
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the countless hours of work that clearly has gone into this.

1052
01:45:09,253 --> 01:45:15,099
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanna thank all the teachers that probably found this to be both

1053
01:45:16,403 --> 01:45:25,226
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure there was a little bit of a bittersweetness to it as well about understanding so much more about literacy than many of them probably did before.

1054
01:45:25,966 --> 01:45:38,330
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am very thankful for the willingness to do this hard work and just seeing that one number in the last presentation about ECRI after one year.

1055
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:52,259
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just very excited that we're on a path to 71% being a low number someday, and that we'll all be freaking out if we go down below 90 someday, you know?

1056
01:45:53,159 --> 01:45:53,660
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the goal.

1057
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:54,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, exactly.

1058
01:45:55,561 --> 01:46:02,527
[SPEAKER_17]: And to put that in perspective, like 50% was good for the last generation or two.

1059
01:46:03,788 --> 01:46:08,992
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's very exciting, and I hope we can get all four of those literacy coaches

1060
01:46:11,192 --> 01:46:11,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1061
01:46:12,674 --> 01:46:29,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that sentiment, and I know, Dr keys and Dr Kelly, thank the, the, the teachers and the community members and the administrators but I mean I, I have to echo it as well because it was a significant undertaking and an extensive amount of time.

1062
01:46:30,116 --> 01:46:41,704
[SPEAKER_07]: for the educators and the community members, the parents and guardians, as member Hays knows, put their parents, they're working, they put in a significant amount of time.

1063
01:46:42,224 --> 01:46:44,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Many came up here to get their hands on the print materials.

1064
01:46:45,546 --> 01:46:52,511
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, it was wonderful to be part of this process where so many people were involved, but it was significant work and we thank everyone.

1065
01:46:55,086 --> 01:47:00,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham, I just wanted to say thank you and I'm also really excited.

1066
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:15,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, you know, my kids are in middle school and one is about to go to high school, but I've really seen a huge transformation at the elementary level for sure in the rigor and the quality of the curriculum that we're using, which is hugely impactful.

1067
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's also happening at the middle school level.

1068
01:47:18,322 --> 01:47:23,225
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's happening at the high school level because we approved new textbooks, but I just don't get to see it firsthand yet.

1069
01:47:23,405 --> 01:47:24,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll refer it back next year.

1070
01:47:25,747 --> 01:47:40,939
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's really impressive, and it's one of those good news stories so I'm hoping that we can find some ways to highlight all the good curriculum work we're doing on the website in the coming year because I don't think our website does justice to the really high quality curricula we're using.

1071
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:43,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think our competitors.

1072
01:47:43,401 --> 01:47:47,946
[SPEAKER_13]: If you think about us in competition, they do that and they do it well and effectively.

1073
01:47:48,866 --> 01:47:54,652
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think there's lots of good work doing and being done and we need to start to tell that story.

1074
01:47:55,653 --> 01:47:58,136
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, you know, we've talked about the communications director.

1075
01:47:58,176 --> 01:47:59,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm excited for that too.

1076
01:48:00,247 --> 01:48:08,140
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last thing I'll say is we can approve curriculum, but I will make a motion to receive this port and place it on file with excitement.

1077
01:48:10,263 --> 01:48:11,866
[SPEAKER_13]: And hope I have a second.

1078
01:48:13,369 --> 01:48:13,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1079
01:48:13,965 --> 01:48:20,213
[SPEAKER_18]: motion to receive in place on by I just wanted to say thank you for.

1080
01:48:21,134 --> 01:48:32,587
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems like it's been like two and a half years I'm not sure, but it's been a very very long journey to get to where we are today but I'm really happy that, although it took a long time that

1081
01:48:33,448 --> 01:48:37,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone was able to be involved in particular the teachers who have to execute it.

1082
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:59,201
[SPEAKER_18]: And so by finally picking and it's true the data clearly showed that this was the front runner that I think that'll make it the implementation of the program, all the more easier because they realize it was clearly a front runner so thank you to all of you into our community caregivers our parents everyone was involved in this process.

1083
01:48:59,261 --> 01:48:59,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1084
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:04,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1085
01:49:04,601 --> 01:49:05,421
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1086
01:49:05,921 --> 01:49:06,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1087
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:07,121
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1088
01:49:07,762 --> 01:49:08,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1089
01:49:08,582 --> 01:49:10,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for the presentation.

1090
01:49:11,463 --> 01:49:21,725
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a report on Member Ruseau.

1091
01:49:22,025 --> 01:49:25,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she just stepped out.

1092
01:49:27,566 --> 01:49:28,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1093
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure she just maybe went to the ladies room.

1094
01:49:32,982 --> 01:49:40,927
[SPEAKER_09]: We have report on the HECAT Health Curriculum Review, Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent, and Rachel Perry, Director of Health and Physical Education.

1095
01:49:41,328 --> 01:49:41,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

1096
01:49:41,728 --> 01:49:42,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1097
01:49:42,188 --> 01:49:42,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1098
01:49:42,689 --> 01:49:43,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1099
01:49:43,169 --> 01:49:44,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for receiving us again.

1100
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:51,334
[SPEAKER_16]: So first, I just want to say thank you to all the members of the committee who met innumerable times.

1101
01:49:52,155 --> 01:49:56,318
[SPEAKER_16]: Every other week, we had a few missed meetings due to various things, but it wasn't many.

1102
01:49:56,978 --> 01:50:16,475
[SPEAKER_16]: But in the chambers, I'd like to thank Erica Reinfeld, member Rousseau, Rachel, obviously, and then online Grace Caldera and Katie Adamek really were the entire committee, it was great to recount to members of central leadership.

1103
01:50:17,015 --> 01:50:31,064
[SPEAKER_16]: The great discussions that we had the really involved and invested members of the community, and literally every meeting felt so very refreshing to have these conversations and to really advance forward, the work of the district.

1104
01:50:31,984 --> 01:50:36,227
[SPEAKER_16]: So, on the official report, or all the names listed I won't go through them all right now.

1105
01:50:37,007 --> 01:50:49,050
[SPEAKER_16]: But so the why of this was the Michigan model health curriculum has been implemented in grades K to five with SEO only social emotional learning only since 2016 and in grade six or eight since 2014.

1106
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:49,931
[SPEAKER_16]: And then nine through 12.

1107
01:50:50,031 --> 01:50:51,491
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're looking at about 10 years.

1108
01:51:00,593 --> 01:51:07,675
[SPEAKER_16]: at the longest and seven years at the closest for those younger students.

1109
01:51:08,315 --> 01:51:16,156
[SPEAKER_16]: So what Director Perry did was she took all the health units and she loaded them into Google Drive for all the members to be able to review.

1110
01:51:16,176 --> 01:51:19,477
[SPEAKER_16]: And then each unit was scored using the HeCat scoring system.

1111
01:51:19,617 --> 01:51:23,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, please remember that HeCat is a review of your current curriculum.

1112
01:51:23,738 --> 01:51:41,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So what it did was it really helped us to identify those deficiencies and I'd like to turn it over to Director Perry to really be able to speak further on the recommendations of the committee on the specific standards in specific areas and some of the work that will be ongoing out of this.

1113
01:51:43,186 --> 01:51:44,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1114
01:51:44,347 --> 01:51:45,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody.

1115
01:51:47,268 --> 01:51:49,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, thank you to everyone on the committee.

1116
01:51:49,289 --> 01:51:50,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of work.

1117
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:53,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank everybody in the background as well.

1118
01:51:54,412 --> 01:52:01,716
[SPEAKER_02]: While the curriculum, I mean, the committee was meeting, my teachers were also updating curriculum as the recommendations were coming in.

1119
01:52:01,756 --> 01:52:04,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was ongoing work that is still going on now.

1120
01:52:05,858 --> 01:52:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the recommendations,

1121
01:52:09,437 --> 01:52:15,761
[SPEAKER_02]: We recommend that we continue using the Michigan model curriculum with some changes for all units, except for the sexual health unit.

1122
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:22,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the report that you have in front of you, it breaks down into your standards.

1123
01:52:23,386 --> 01:52:33,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's eight standards for each unit, and then it breaks down each unit, and it basically lists what we're gonna add in each unit, which these things, like I said, we're working on right now.

1124
01:52:35,233 --> 01:52:55,318
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the sexual health unit, what came out of our recommendations was that the current curriculum primarily teaches abstinence and refusal, and we really want to select a new quality sexual education curriculum that includes medically accurate, developmentally appropriate content and skills, and a curriculum that's also inclusive for all of our students.

1125
01:52:57,262 --> 01:53:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Recommendation also that we work with partners in sex education to select and implement a curriculum that is best fit for Medford.

1126
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:08,246
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be an extension of work for this committee going into next year.

1127
01:53:09,206 --> 01:53:14,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great conversation today with Megara Bell from Partners in Sexual Education.

1128
01:53:15,288 --> 01:53:21,530
[SPEAKER_02]: She's worked with numerous other districts looking at what they're doing now and how they can improve their curriculum to fit

1129
01:53:22,210 --> 01:53:37,266
[SPEAKER_02]: their district that comes with creating their own curriculums using out of the box curriculums so she's done a variety of things and that's we had like I said had a great conversation today she's going to send me more information on how to move forward with that.

1130
01:53:39,576 --> 01:53:43,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Another recommendation, add health education for grades K to five.

1131
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:46,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be included in Nexus.

1132
01:53:46,442 --> 01:53:48,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's something that's definitely needed.

1133
01:53:48,123 --> 01:53:52,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank Suzanne Galussi and Stacey Shulman.

1134
01:53:52,106 --> 01:53:57,050
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a great meeting on Friday to talk about how we would do this.

1135
01:53:57,090 --> 01:54:02,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're coming up with a plan on how we would add health education lessons to the Nexus curriculum.

1136
01:54:02,814 --> 01:54:08,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll look different in each grade, but that's something that we need to kind of map out and see what it looks like.

1137
01:54:09,276 --> 01:54:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another great thing that's gonna be happening.

1138
01:54:12,497 --> 01:54:16,819
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking to update the scope and sequence of the fifth grade puberty presentation.

1139
01:54:17,539 --> 01:54:19,880
[SPEAKER_02]: We changed, thank you.

1140
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:28,763
[SPEAKER_02]: We did change the video for this year, but we are looking at more lessons on puberty and present it that way in a lesson format rather than a video format.

1141
01:54:30,404 --> 01:54:37,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing we are looking at as well is adjusting the middle school schedules that all students get equitable physical education and health education.

1142
01:54:38,388 --> 01:54:41,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we have some band and orchestra students that are not getting those.

1143
01:54:42,791 --> 01:54:48,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's something that the district is looking at for middle school and high school, looking at the schedules to make some changes.

1144
01:54:48,614 --> 01:54:53,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we could all work together and hopefully, you know, make sure that that happens.

1145
01:54:55,758 --> 01:55:02,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some surveys, I did some focus groups with students, which was a great experience for me.

1146
01:55:02,984 --> 01:55:05,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some great information from our students.

1147
01:55:06,747 --> 01:55:11,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really thought that we needed to add a sexual health unit to the senior year health classes.

1148
01:55:12,212 --> 01:55:19,578
[SPEAKER_02]: They felt relationships are very different in middle school, very different when you're a freshman than when you're a senior and going off to college.

1149
01:55:19,618 --> 01:55:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So they thought that that would be a good addition.

1150
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something we would like to add.

1151
01:55:24,702 --> 01:55:29,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that last bullet is also just the high school schedule.

1152
01:55:29,369 --> 01:55:35,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happening right now is our vocational students are only getting half the curriculum because of their shop.

1153
01:55:35,498 --> 01:55:39,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to figure out hopefully a schedule that works so that they're getting the full curriculum.

1154
01:55:42,031 --> 01:55:55,640
[SPEAKER_16]: So as director Perry mentioned, the district is actually contracted with district management group to work throughout the fall to really look at the high school scheduling and we were able to include the middle schools as well.

1155
01:55:55,660 --> 01:56:01,884
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things that we really have to do is we have to identify time and efficiencies within our scheduling to make sure

1156
01:56:02,344 --> 01:56:14,987
[SPEAKER_16]: that students are receiving these units, you'll see in the action plan, and Director Perry will touch on this, is how limited our window of opportunity is for our health curriculum.

1157
01:56:15,507 --> 01:56:22,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So looking at ways that we can really expand that is fundamentally critical for our students' health and wellness.

1158
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:25,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1159
01:56:26,915 --> 01:56:35,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at that plan, I already stated that the health teachers are working very diligently on making some of these changes already for next year on these units.

1160
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna continue working with the HECAC committee to choose an appropriate sexual health curriculum for Medford, update the scope and sequence for health education to include changes and updates where possible, what Dr. Cushing just said.

1161
01:56:50,248 --> 01:56:53,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look at the sixth to eighth grade, there's about 18 lessons they get a year.

1162
01:56:55,311 --> 01:57:06,165
[SPEAKER_02]: On nine to 11 to about 24 and 12th grades 20 lessons so there's some things you know we need to make priorities what we're going to teach, but I also want to say that we need to look at this globally as well.

1163
01:57:06,505 --> 01:57:09,269
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to look at it as a district, because there's some.

1164
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:27,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Standards that we might not be teaching in health education, it could be coming out of a wind block, it could be done in science, it could be done bring in presenters, so we need to also think out of the box that way to make sure that we can add in as many standards as we can, not just in health, but like I said globally.

1165
01:57:28,892 --> 01:57:32,916
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also looking at offering training and sexual health curriculum for all health teachers.

1166
01:57:33,116 --> 01:57:36,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that is chosen, all health teachers will be trained.

1167
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:41,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Purchasing the online Michigan model licensure for health and nexus teachers.

1168
01:57:41,684 --> 01:57:43,966
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that right now, I just need to renew it.

1169
01:57:44,366 --> 01:57:45,707
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two year licensure.

1170
01:57:46,348 --> 01:57:49,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did receive a project grant, a project here grant.

1171
01:57:50,191 --> 01:57:53,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will help with the purchase of those licenses.

1172
01:57:53,513 --> 01:57:56,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also going to bring in training with the Michigan model.

1173
01:57:57,735 --> 01:57:58,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have dual training.

1174
01:57:58,736 --> 01:58:02,558
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the sex ed training and Michigan model training as well for our teachers.

1175
01:58:03,699 --> 01:58:14,385
[SPEAKER_02]: In my last bullet there, I have a meeting with central administration about the possible schedule changes, which I guess we would get from the group coming in on what we can do for schedule changes.

1176
01:58:16,181 --> 01:58:18,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I do also want to thank, I didn't realize that Marion O'Connor was still on.

1177
01:58:18,862 --> 01:58:21,763
[SPEAKER_16]: She was also a member of the committee with Penny Bruce, who was here earlier.

1178
01:58:22,544 --> 01:58:28,226
[SPEAKER_16]: So really comprehensive and inclusive process to try to get as many voices around the table as possible.

1179
01:58:28,707 --> 01:58:28,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1180
01:58:28,967 --> 01:58:32,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you have a committee member in the audience and there's a couple others on Zoom as well.

1181
01:58:33,028 --> 01:58:35,550
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank everybody for their hard work on this.

1182
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:36,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1183
01:58:37,310 --> 01:58:38,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions, Member Hays?

1184
01:58:40,052 --> 01:58:40,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Member McLaughlin?

1185
01:58:42,572 --> 01:58:43,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, thank you for this.

1186
01:58:44,033 --> 01:58:49,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you give us an idea of what the timeline is for the sexual health education that you're?

1187
01:58:50,236 --> 01:58:50,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1188
01:58:50,656 --> 01:59:00,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way the lessons are taught for the high school level, we have freshmen and sophomores at the beginning of the year in health.

1189
01:59:01,262 --> 01:59:03,003
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the year, we have the juniors and seniors.

1190
01:59:03,563 --> 01:59:07,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So the senior curriculum, I think, can be brought in for next year.

1191
01:59:08,545 --> 01:59:11,547
[SPEAKER_02]: The freshman curriculum probably won't be pushed until the next year.

1192
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:18,013
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to make sure I want to make sure we're talking about the same thing for choosing the new sex education program.

1193
01:59:18,593 --> 01:59:31,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you're talking about you think you'll have it chosen to start next year, I think if we have a choice beginning of next year, we can make the changes in the senior curriculum and the puberty curriculum by the end of next year.

1194
01:59:31,391 --> 01:59:31,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1195
01:59:32,232 --> 01:59:33,112
[SPEAKER_02]: By second semester.

1196
01:59:33,292 --> 01:59:33,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1197
01:59:33,733 --> 01:59:39,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're looking at middle school and the freshman curriculum, we're going to have to push that to the following year, if that makes sense.

1198
01:59:40,297 --> 01:59:40,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1199
01:59:40,598 --> 01:59:42,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's offered in the year.

1200
01:59:42,179 --> 01:59:42,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1201
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:43,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1202
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:43,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1203
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:45,281
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1204
01:59:45,301 --> 01:59:46,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.

1205
01:59:47,703 --> 01:59:48,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1206
01:59:48,323 --> 01:59:50,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate the work on this.

1207
01:59:51,085 --> 01:59:53,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, maybe if you guys could take a minute and read the

1208
01:59:53,888 --> 02:00:00,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Community members that were part of it because it sounds like it was a lot of work and I know there are other people that aren't on the call, but just as a thank you to them.

1209
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:05,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of folks worked hard on it, so if you guys don't mind maybe just sharing that with the community would be great.

1210
02:00:06,691 --> 02:00:14,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, like I said, I see that there's a ton of work that's been done on this and much appreciated work and again i'm going to be that clanging bell.

1211
02:00:15,437 --> 02:00:18,178
[SPEAKER_03]: to ask how this is happening for students with disabilities.

1212
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:22,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Cushing, I know that this is something you and I talked about quite a bit during the process.

1213
02:00:22,638 --> 02:00:27,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really eager to hear what that is, particularly for our programmatic elements, right?

1214
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:42,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're talking about equity to access for health literacy and healthcare literacy for, I think it was one of the goals for the end is talking about healthcare equity, meet with the central administration about possible schedule changes to accommodate equity in health education for all students.

1215
02:00:42,582 --> 02:00:43,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know

1216
02:00:44,352 --> 02:00:46,373
[SPEAKER_03]: the Director of Pupil Services is not available tonight.

1217
02:00:46,453 --> 02:01:06,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if Stacey Shulman is still on the call or not, or if you guys wanna address, but how we are working with the programmatic units to accommodate equity in healthcare education for our students who are developmentally disabled, have different disabilities, learning needs, what have you, how are we accommodating them?

1218
02:01:06,877 --> 02:01:11,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so we are also looking at other curriculums to address those students.

1219
02:01:23,553 --> 02:01:27,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not talking about differentiating the curriculum that typical students are getting.

1220
02:01:28,015 --> 02:01:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about an entirely different curriculum.

1221
02:01:33,077 --> 02:01:35,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that would be useful conversation to have.

1222
02:01:35,998 --> 02:01:46,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I think differentiation can really happen and it's really important thing to happen so that all students are getting, you know, a version of the same curriculum if, when, if, and when possible.

1223
02:01:47,966 --> 02:01:53,110
[SPEAKER_03]: in the least restrictive environment, obviously, but that's the free and appropriate public education piece for the curriculum.

1224
02:01:53,130 --> 02:02:03,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like there's gonna be a lot of really great stuff here that I know that there's a professor, particularly at Tufts that works on this specific to healthcare curriculum and individuals with disabilities.

1225
02:02:03,776 --> 02:02:06,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just at a resource fair and was talking with that professor.

1226
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:08,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to put you guys in touch.

1227
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:17,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really important to be looking at differentiation as opposed to necessarily entirely separate and segregated

1228
02:02:17,523 --> 02:02:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: curriculum for obvious reasons.

1229
02:02:20,027 --> 02:02:22,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd love to talk more about what that looks like.

1230
02:02:23,071 --> 02:02:23,632
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

1231
02:02:23,652 --> 02:02:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like that if you could get me that information.

1232
02:02:25,795 --> 02:02:26,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1233
02:02:30,387 --> 02:02:31,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mayor.

1234
02:02:33,129 --> 02:02:56,366
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, to continue what Member McLaughlin just said, you know, when we were in the, excuse me, when we were in the sessions, we definitely, we didn't focus on the next step because we had to finish the current step, but a number of the curriculums available have differentiation for students with disabilities, students with various language and cultural differences.

1235
02:02:56,826 --> 02:02:58,748
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know when we were choosing

1236
02:02:59,929 --> 02:03:18,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it our math curriculum that it, you know, all that stuff was just automatic and part of it and it's nice to see the curriculum providers are not like adding it on it's like a baseline for some of them at least that that's, you know, they go in, knowing and planning and expecting.

1237
02:03:19,912 --> 02:03:21,252
[SPEAKER_17]: which gets you a much better product.

1238
02:03:21,292 --> 02:03:45,897
[SPEAKER_17]: So while we haven't picked a curriculum and we haven't even reviewed them, I certainly, I know that from my experience on the HECAT committee and from the other members that there's lots of us that are paying very close attention to that, because we're not interested in just getting a curriculum that just meets the, you know, some stereotypical student, because frankly, nobody's a stereotypical student.

1239
02:03:45,977 --> 02:03:47,577
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will definitely not be,

1240
02:03:48,951 --> 02:03:53,176
[SPEAKER_17]: We won't be surprised at the end by that, we will definitely be taking that into consideration.

1241
02:03:53,196 --> 02:03:57,080
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope so I know you will.

1242
02:03:58,762 --> 02:04:01,966
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing I when we were meeting.

1243
02:04:04,048 --> 02:04:05,530
[SPEAKER_17]: There was this issue of whether we.

1244
02:04:08,052 --> 02:04:17,676
[SPEAKER_17]: hire specialists in the sexual health education part, whether we train up existing people.

1245
02:04:19,056 --> 02:04:28,620
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other option, which we didn't really explore a lot, but we did talk about briefly, was that there essentially are consulting companies that

1246
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:40,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Planned Parenthood, that they have like a core of people that school districts hire to come around and do those sections of their curriculum because they are very specialized.

1247
02:04:42,523 --> 02:04:46,687
[SPEAKER_17]: And frankly, I can't fathom ever having to teach these parts of a curriculum.

1248
02:04:47,227 --> 02:04:49,470
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do hope that, you know, if

1249
02:04:50,862 --> 02:05:08,344
[SPEAKER_17]: As we start to train or as we post for positions to hire these people which I suspect are probably very few and far between that we consider this as an option because while it sounds a lot like outsourcing and I'm not a fan of outsourcing.

1250
02:05:08,925 --> 02:05:32,850
[SPEAKER_17]: This does seem like a situation where if there just are no people to do it, I'd rather us do it well, even if we're outsourcing, than to do it mediocre or worse by just trying to power through with our current staff that may not, I mean, if our staff do not want to teach this stuff, you know, we need to recognize that they were hired and they were

1251
02:05:33,342 --> 02:05:36,185
[SPEAKER_17]: teaching health curriculum, and it meant a very different thing.

1252
02:05:37,066 --> 02:05:46,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, I would like them to be able to, but the fact that something like Planned Parenthood actually has this as a thing that districts subscribe to tells me that

1253
02:05:53,769 --> 02:06:18,759
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not uncommon the district can't hire these people, or that their feature set of the kind of person that would teach this is different than a regular everyday teacher so I know I'm getting kind of far ahead of us on this, but I think it's important to note that it all likely we will need some money though that was kind of my main point here, we will need money, whether it's there there are some free curriculums whether or not they're the right ones for us.

1254
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:21,020
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have to figure out.

1255
02:06:23,402 --> 02:06:26,483
[SPEAKER_17]: even a free curriculum will require substantial professional development.

1256
02:06:27,284 --> 02:06:39,309
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I look forward to the next step because during this whole thing, we used this tool from the CDC and it was fine.

1257
02:06:40,649 --> 02:06:41,690
[SPEAKER_17]: It could have been a better tool.

1258
02:06:43,451 --> 02:06:51,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things that was most surprising for me is that we could actually just

1259
02:06:51,721 --> 02:06:53,982
[SPEAKER_17]: cancel all the rest of the education we do.

1260
02:06:54,362 --> 02:06:58,645
[SPEAKER_17]: The number of standards in health education could take up the whole school year, 12 years.

1261
02:06:59,085 --> 02:07:02,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Like we have to pick and choose the kinds of things we won't teach.

1262
02:07:02,827 --> 02:07:05,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you look through this list of things, you're like, yeah, we should teach that.

1263
02:07:05,548 --> 02:07:06,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we should teach that.

1264
02:07:06,909 --> 02:07:09,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Before you know it, the whole day is just health education.

1265
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:17,114
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's unfortunate, but we do have to say, okay, we're not gonna teach smoking stuff.

1266
02:07:18,194 --> 02:07:21,236
[SPEAKER_17]: And because when we look at the thing, not many kids are smoking anymore.

1267
02:07:22,521 --> 02:07:33,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And while we might intellectually be like we would like to teach, you know, the smoking stuff, and 20 years ago we definitely had to teach the smoking stuff, but we don't have enough hours in the day.

1268
02:07:34,334 --> 02:07:42,222
[SPEAKER_17]: So, those hard choices, this committee I thought was excellent at really like narrowing down and saying yeah,

1269
02:07:43,464 --> 02:07:45,765
[SPEAKER_17]: but there's only so many hours in a day.

1270
02:07:45,845 --> 02:07:52,588
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and I appreciate what director Perry said about, you know, some of these standards that are health education.

1271
02:07:52,648 --> 02:08:03,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when we think about math, we think of like in high school, at least there's the math class, but in elementary school, there's a lot more integration about the topics throughout the day.

1272
02:08:03,113 --> 02:08:08,576
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that some of these health standards that we do wanna teach are gonna have to land in

1273
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:15,941
[SPEAKER_17]: art and science and math and, you know, whatever other kinds of classes where they can actually happen.

1274
02:08:16,001 --> 02:08:17,862
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of them may already be happening there.

1275
02:08:17,942 --> 02:08:26,924
[SPEAKER_17]: We just have to really draw the line and then we can do the check mark that, you know, we cover the standard, not in our quote health curriculum, but we cover it.

1276
02:08:27,704 --> 02:08:29,724
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's an enormous amount of work.

1277
02:08:29,764 --> 02:08:38,966
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really appreciated your staff's work because we would come to the meetings and they would have done an enormous amount of work ahead of time to review what we currently do.

1278
02:08:39,775 --> 02:08:44,718
[SPEAKER_17]: So that we could respond and understand because if we could not have sat through our meetings where we're like.

1279
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,120
[SPEAKER_17]: So do we do this?

1280
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:50,281
[SPEAKER_17]: And then somebody goes off and finds the answer when we will be meeting for the next 20 years.

1281
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:58,923
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to thank the staff that really did all of that work, getting us ready for the meetings because it obviously was a lot of work.

1282
02:08:59,383 --> 02:08:59,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1283
02:08:59,763 --> 02:09:00,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1284
02:09:00,463 --> 02:09:02,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you make a great point too.

1285
02:09:03,304 --> 02:09:06,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to look at all options and see what is best for Medford students.

1286
02:09:06,604 --> 02:09:09,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I think us continuing this work next year is going to help us do that.

1287
02:09:09,725 --> 02:09:10,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1288
02:09:11,525 --> 02:09:13,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.

1289
02:09:13,226 --> 02:09:14,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had one more question.

1290
02:09:15,361 --> 02:09:16,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

1291
02:09:16,542 --> 02:09:16,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1292
02:09:16,942 --> 02:09:18,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you can't see my light over here.

1293
02:09:19,183 --> 02:09:27,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I was looking through the memo and was wondering if there was a timeline or schedule or anything like that that you guys have roughly laid out or not.

1294
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:37,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to reconvene in the fall and hopefully have a decision in the fall before the second semester.

1295
02:09:37,912 --> 02:09:39,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can actually start that movement.

1296
02:09:40,214 --> 02:09:43,118
[SPEAKER_02]: for the seniors and for that fifth grade puberty.

1297
02:09:43,378 --> 02:09:45,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the following year, push for the rest.

1298
02:09:45,821 --> 02:09:48,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That's... For the rest.

1299
02:09:49,085 --> 02:09:50,867
[SPEAKER_02]: For the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth grade.

1300
02:09:52,228 --> 02:09:52,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1301
02:09:52,809 --> 02:09:53,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the presentation.

1302
02:09:54,070 --> 02:09:54,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1303
02:09:55,569 --> 02:09:55,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1304
02:09:55,909 --> 02:10:01,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to thank our community members, parents, caregivers, for the tremendous expertise.

1305
02:10:01,814 --> 02:10:07,439
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank Marianne, Director of the Board of Health for being also deeply involved.

1306
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:17,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Another great collaborative partnership that led us to where we are and I look forward to hearing what the new program will be in the fall.

1307
02:10:17,828 --> 02:10:18,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1308
02:10:18,749 --> 02:10:19,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1309
02:10:20,427 --> 02:10:28,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a report on the high school survey conducted through Panorama for fiscal year 23, Dr. Peter J. Cushing, assistant superintendent.

1310
02:10:31,667 --> 02:10:32,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Good afternoon.

1311
02:10:32,928 --> 02:10:41,317
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to provide a 30,000 foot view over look of the panorama survey that we completed.

1312
02:10:42,699 --> 02:10:48,766
[SPEAKER_16]: So this was done in partnership, once again, with the Department of Health and Penny Finioli when we were really looking at the questions.

1313
02:10:49,646 --> 02:10:53,571
[SPEAKER_16]: They had used the survey a few years ago, so we actually entered that into

1314
02:10:56,590 --> 02:10:58,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Not used to have them being told to speak up.

1315
02:10:59,311 --> 02:11:03,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So we entered that survey in to the panoramas survey system.

1316
02:11:04,812 --> 02:11:09,293
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a little non traditional but I think it serves our purpose as well.

1317
02:11:09,693 --> 02:11:18,595
[SPEAKER_16]: We got 60.2% participation, which is, I'm going to be honest is curious because we designated time during English classes classes.

1318
02:11:19,335 --> 02:11:20,036
[SPEAKER_16]: on the first day.

1319
02:11:20,296 --> 02:11:24,260
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll say that I have no doubt that all of our teachers provided that time.

1320
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:32,006
[SPEAKER_16]: But it appears that about 39.8% of our students didn't use that time.

1321
02:11:32,787 --> 02:11:42,075
[SPEAKER_16]: So interestingly enough, that 60% is the exact same number of the students who completed the 2021

1322
02:11:43,977 --> 02:11:48,640
[SPEAKER_16]: survey that we discussed earlier, the community as a care survey.

1323
02:11:49,181 --> 02:11:52,363
[SPEAKER_16]: And we provide a designated time for that survey as well.

1324
02:11:53,543 --> 02:11:58,487
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's consistency in the lackluster participation.

1325
02:11:58,627 --> 02:12:00,348
[SPEAKER_16]: And I only say, normally you'd say 60%.

1326
02:12:00,668 --> 02:12:01,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, that's great.

1327
02:12:01,909 --> 02:12:04,651
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would say we hope for more and better.

1328
02:12:05,411 --> 02:12:07,472
[SPEAKER_16]: So, there were 10 areas.

1329
02:12:08,572 --> 02:12:09,812
[SPEAKER_16]: First background questions.

1330
02:12:10,412 --> 02:12:23,416
[SPEAKER_16]: For some reason, two of the questions are coding as a response in the affirmative for background questions, I just haven't had the time since we closed the survey to try to go in and fix that, but I will do that in the coming days and weeks.

1331
02:12:24,136 --> 02:12:28,217
[SPEAKER_16]: So it looked at sense of belonging school teacher student relationships.

1332
02:12:29,898 --> 02:12:43,691
[SPEAKER_16]: school climate school safety school engagement school belonging so sense of belonging is more overarching school belonging is specifically within the walls of the school cultural awareness and action diversity and inclusion valuing of school.

1333
02:12:44,912 --> 02:13:07,643
[SPEAKER_16]: And so what we really do hope to look forward to is working with the Department of Health to correlate with the communities that care survey that you had that data to rerun this and similar panorama surveys moving into next year so that we can get really good accurate data moving forward on these indicators and on the next page you have

1334
02:13:08,823 --> 02:13:16,227
[SPEAKER_16]: the responses as the results positive where we have some work to do.

1335
02:13:18,328 --> 02:13:20,849
[SPEAKER_16]: But this was just the 30,000 foot overview.

1336
02:13:20,869 --> 02:13:26,192
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to provide you all the background and demographic information so that you could have that as well.

1337
02:13:26,332 --> 02:13:37,218
[SPEAKER_16]: We expanded the background questions significantly to try to make sure that we were capturing all students and being as inclusive as possible for them.

1338
02:13:38,138 --> 02:13:38,318
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

1339
02:13:40,219 --> 02:13:41,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1340
02:13:41,179 --> 02:13:41,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays?

1341
02:13:41,719 --> 02:13:45,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, thank you for this.

1342
02:13:47,522 --> 02:14:06,729
[SPEAKER_19]: So as someone who was really looking forward to the survey, because I think that it was really crucial to get more specific data from the students, especially after, again, the two incidents that happened and the concern that we had after all of the student listening sessions, that there was a lot of

1343
02:14:07,918 --> 02:14:17,765
[SPEAKER_19]: apparently a lot of expression from students of, I don't know, for lack of a better word, dissatisfaction with school or concerns about school or not feeling safe in school.

1344
02:14:19,646 --> 02:14:29,794
[SPEAKER_19]: So my understanding from when we first heard that you were gonna do a student survey was that really the purpose was to get at those kinds of questions.

1345
02:14:31,895 --> 02:14:35,958
[SPEAKER_19]: And in looking at the questions that we ended up with six months later,

1346
02:14:36,882 --> 02:14:54,874
[SPEAKER_19]: In comparison, I did look at the actual panorama survey as created and our questions are really quite different, both in terms of structure and in some ways in terms of kind of the gist of the questions.

1347
02:14:54,934 --> 02:15:01,398
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the panorama doesn't really get into questions of alcohol use and drug use, it's really broader.

1348
02:15:02,904 --> 02:15:07,067
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm a little, I'm a little concerned about the end result of how we ended up here.

1349
02:15:08,647 --> 02:15:27,378
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I looked again, I looked through the Panorama website and they specifically talk about the fact that their survey, the structure of the questions is actually questions as opposed to statements that students agree or disagree with, that it's questions.

1350
02:15:27,518 --> 02:15:29,679
[SPEAKER_19]: And this was kind of what they said about it.

1351
02:15:29,719 --> 02:15:31,860
[SPEAKER_19]: They said numerous surveys used by educators

1352
02:15:32,358 --> 02:15:36,821
[SPEAKER_19]: unfortunately fail to adhere to these well-established survey design practices.

1353
02:15:37,321 --> 02:15:48,327
[SPEAKER_19]: For example, designing survey items as statements, particularly ones that require respondents to agree or disagree, are likely to inject additional measurement error in responses.

1354
02:15:48,927 --> 02:15:53,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Asking questions with response options that are linked to the underlying concept is the preferred practice.

1355
02:15:55,111 --> 02:16:00,654
[SPEAKER_19]: And also they talked about using too few response options, not giving a wide array

1356
02:16:01,124 --> 02:16:16,875
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm looking at the way that we designed this in the end, and I am concerned that why we chose to go so off of what panorama, since we specifically chose panorama, and it's widely used around here, from what I can tell.

1357
02:16:18,596 --> 02:16:28,443
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm hoping in the future, and I think you said this to me earlier, that we're going to stick more with the panorama format and structure for the questions, because I feel like

1358
02:16:30,253 --> 02:16:40,855
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, this doesn't necessarily fit what I understood, what we talked about, or what was said to us in the beginning about the why for this survey, what the purpose of this survey was.

1359
02:16:41,715 --> 02:16:46,136
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not, you know, I guess I'd like a little clarity of why that change happened.

1360
02:16:46,676 --> 02:16:58,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Why did we end up kind of gearing it more towards the survey questions that I, if I'm understanding right from the earlier presentation, that whole survey is going to be given again in the fall.

1361
02:16:59,164 --> 02:17:00,584
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to have that.

1362
02:17:01,125 --> 02:17:23,452
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not really clear on why we needed to do that this time and why we didn't just stick with Panorama's original survey the way it's written, which they of course have vetted and have tested out to make sure it's valid, to make sure it's reliable, and that our questions ended up kind of violating what they say really are best practices for this kind of a survey.

1363
02:17:24,474 --> 02:17:37,182
[SPEAKER_16]: So the questions that we used were provided to us by the Department of Health from a United States government Department of Education survey that was previously administered following the gun clip incident.

1364
02:17:37,642 --> 02:17:40,184
[SPEAKER_16]: And so there were significant

1365
02:17:40,724 --> 02:17:58,312
[SPEAKER_16]: question parallels between this and your right community that cares you'd survey so hopefully, where if we had gone completely just with panorama, we would not have gotten those specific questions that we would be able to correlate and better understand culture and climate, moving forward.

1366
02:17:58,832 --> 02:18:05,194
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, yes, with Panorama, we do hope to do that throughout the next year to more frequently survey our students.

1367
02:18:05,634 --> 02:18:17,878
[SPEAKER_16]: But for this instrument, it was trying to have a data tool that we will be able to correlate with other measures that have been previously deployed in the district.

1368
02:18:17,898 --> 02:18:20,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1369
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:25,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing, for the presentation.

1370
02:18:25,381 --> 02:18:26,061
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

1371
02:18:30,148 --> 02:18:35,112
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not have any presentations of the public or continued business calendar.

1372
02:18:35,192 --> 02:18:37,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry, that's the most important.

1373
02:18:38,694 --> 02:18:39,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Meetings.

1374
02:18:41,276 --> 02:18:43,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn this over to Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

1375
02:18:43,378 --> 02:18:49,262
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the draft calendar for the school year of 2022, 2020, this should actually be 2023, 2024 school committee regular meetings.

1376
02:18:54,013 --> 02:19:00,098
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so the draft schedule was shared in your folders.

1377
02:19:01,199 --> 02:19:07,304
[SPEAKER_18]: And based on some of the holidays and how some of the vacations fell.

1378
02:19:07,885 --> 02:19:09,486
[SPEAKER_18]: We had to do.

1379
02:19:09,526 --> 02:19:16,552
[SPEAKER_18]: There were a few times where we had to have like a back to back weekend because of all of the different holidays and things like that.

1380
02:19:16,812 --> 02:19:16,992
[SPEAKER_18]: So,

1381
02:19:19,634 --> 02:19:38,686
[SPEAKER_18]: this is the draft schedule, but we kind of went through it and did our best to try to space it out as much as possible and not have too many conflicts with existing holidays that are coming up in the next school year.

1382
02:19:38,766 --> 02:19:41,007
[SPEAKER_18]: So I hope that it's amenable to the committee.

1383
02:19:42,128 --> 02:19:43,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham?

1384
02:19:43,969 --> 02:19:48,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually had some suggestions for the calendar between January and March.

1385
02:19:49,933 --> 02:20:06,878
[SPEAKER_13]: um we are going to see several new members of the school committee at minimum um and so I would like to see us provide a little bit of space in the January time frame that would allow us to do training and onboarding and all kinds of um start up things for our new members.

1386
02:20:06,938 --> 02:20:18,022
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be at least two of them because my chair mates here are leaving us um but I so what I'd like to suggest is we meet on January 8th as this lists and then um

1387
02:20:19,835 --> 02:20:47,505
[SPEAKER_13]: make some changes from what is on the calendar as on this list as January 22nd to March 18th and instead we meet on January 9th, February 12th, February 26th, March 11th, and March 25th and that creates some space so nothing is two weeks in a row but it also creates some space in January that we can use to dedicate to onboarding our new members however many however many there may be.

1388
02:20:49,468 --> 02:20:49,688
[SPEAKER_13]: sure.

1389
02:20:50,168 --> 02:20:54,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Um so January 8th would remain and then January twenty-ninth.

1390
02:20:54,271 --> 02:20:55,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1391
02:20:56,433 --> 02:20:57,193
[SPEAKER_13]: January twenty-ninth.

1392
02:20:58,994 --> 02:20:59,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1393
02:20:59,355 --> 02:21:08,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Um February twelve, February twenty-six, March eleven, and March twenty-five, and then we would pick up with April schedule as listed.

1394
02:21:09,822 --> 02:21:11,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Grim, did you check all the Monday holidays?

1395
02:21:12,644 --> 02:21:12,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1396
02:21:18,183 --> 02:21:23,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So MLK is the 15th.

1397
02:21:24,108 --> 02:21:26,009
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's Sears Clear February vacation.

1398
02:21:26,029 --> 02:21:29,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think there's any March holidays that we need to navigate.

1399
02:21:29,672 --> 02:21:32,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And just name the February dates you're proposing again, sorry.

1400
02:21:32,295 --> 02:21:32,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1401
02:21:33,035 --> 02:21:34,757
[SPEAKER_13]: February 12 is the first one.

1402
02:21:34,817 --> 02:21:36,378
[SPEAKER_13]: February 26 is the second.

1403
02:21:36,823 --> 02:21:43,906
[SPEAKER_18]: So we were trying to stay away from, as my leadership team, to stay away from the Monday after February break.

1404
02:21:44,106 --> 02:21:49,689
[SPEAKER_18]: We had just felt that that was a little exhausting when it's back to back.

1405
02:21:51,629 --> 02:21:59,273
[SPEAKER_18]: The January 8th, with the 15th, so January 1st, that's the last day of break.

1406
02:21:59,313 --> 02:22:00,814
[SPEAKER_18]: School comes back on the 2nd.

1407
02:22:01,734 --> 02:22:03,315
[SPEAKER_18]: The 8th,

1408
02:22:06,656 --> 02:22:12,097
[SPEAKER_18]: would be that second Monday, the 15th is off because it's Martin Luther King, then the 22nd and the 29th.

1409
02:22:12,337 --> 02:22:13,377
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1410
02:22:13,397 --> 02:22:16,898
[SPEAKER_18]: We were trying not to have like a three-week window.

1411
02:22:16,918 --> 02:22:21,479
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's going to be necessary to onboard new members.

1412
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:28,220
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was the impetus as I looked at the calendar because there will be at least two new members to the committee.

1413
02:22:30,941 --> 02:22:31,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1414
02:22:33,081 --> 02:22:33,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1415
02:22:34,702 --> 02:22:49,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering if through the chair, if member Graham is suggesting committee of the holes on those off dates, or I'm wondering why we wouldn't be able to do committee of the whole before meetings so that people are getting practical.

1416
02:22:49,531 --> 02:23:01,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's six of one half a dozen of another, but I'm curious about, cause we haven't had discussion about this because we said we were gonna start discussion on it in September so that we could really start planning for it.

1417
02:23:01,218 --> 02:23:02,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering what the,

1418
02:23:04,261 --> 02:23:12,107
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're thinking what the what member grams thinking for that time frame on those other dates, I think, you know, for new members.

1419
02:23:14,019 --> 02:23:15,800
[SPEAKER_13]: stacking meetings back to back like this.

1420
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:16,160
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 8.30.

1421
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:17,141
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not done.

1422
02:23:17,401 --> 02:23:18,561
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been here since five.

1423
02:23:19,221 --> 02:23:20,542
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a short meeting.

1424
02:23:20,582 --> 02:23:22,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that's a lot.

1425
02:23:22,563 --> 02:23:38,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think if we could have some time to schedule some committee of the holes that are a reasonable length where people could actually learn after they've had an entire working day, presumably, of having to be on, it would be much more effective for people as they're trying to get in the mix.

1426
02:23:39,998 --> 02:23:47,444
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I always find the January meetings to be not gone with somewhat slow anyway, because we're ramping up.

1427
02:23:47,624 --> 02:24:00,515
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was my thinking was to give us some space to have capacity to do those things so that it's not like trying to jam everything one after the next.

1428
02:24:00,955 --> 02:24:01,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor.

1429
02:24:02,336 --> 02:24:03,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1430
02:24:03,629 --> 02:24:03,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1431
02:24:04,009 --> 02:24:05,410
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that makes sense too.

1432
02:24:05,470 --> 02:24:12,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thinking about, especially when you're first starting, if you're doing a committee of the whole before a whole meeting, it can be a lot as well.

1433
02:24:12,834 --> 02:24:19,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that we'll have other, I'm sure we'll have additional conversations about what onboarding will look like and what other kind of training will be involved.

1434
02:24:19,878 --> 02:24:22,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So just giving us a little bit of wiggle room right now makes sense.

1435
02:24:22,419 --> 02:24:24,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would, did you make a motion?

1436
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:28,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make a motion actually to accept those dates.

1437
02:24:29,363 --> 02:24:30,303
[SPEAKER_09]: If you haven't already.

1438
02:24:30,323 --> 02:24:33,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear from our superintendent, if you have any issues.

1439
02:24:35,710 --> 02:24:59,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I think with the new members that are going to be on boarded I was going to recommend trying to do a retreat or something in December because they will, we will know who they are by November and to actually give an opportunity for the outgoing members to be able to kind of mentor and talk to the new people that would be coming on board for January, because it's.

1440
02:25:00,544 --> 02:25:06,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it going to be January 1 or the 31st, the inaugural?

1441
02:25:06,826 --> 02:25:10,427
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be the first Monday in January that the new members will be sworn in.

1442
02:25:11,688 --> 02:25:15,909
[SPEAKER_18]: The first Monday in January is the first, but since that's a holiday, it would be the 8th?

1443
02:25:21,631 --> 02:25:27,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we usually have the inauguration on the 6th or 7th in this calendar.

1444
02:25:30,447 --> 02:25:33,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's, so I don't know, maybe it'll be the eighth.

1445
02:25:35,149 --> 02:25:36,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know for sure though.

1446
02:25:37,009 --> 02:25:37,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor?

1447
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:40,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1448
02:25:40,351 --> 02:25:40,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1449
02:25:40,831 --> 02:25:48,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that, and I appreciate the value, I think, of a retreat that has not happened in my experience.

1450
02:25:48,754 --> 02:25:58,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had some sort of day-long learning sessions, which have been really helpful, but not sort of a quote-unquote retreat or getaway, and I know the pandemic, what have you.

1451
02:25:58,157 --> 02:25:59,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate the,

1452
02:26:00,278 --> 02:26:00,798
[SPEAKER_03]: gesture.

1453
02:26:00,919 --> 02:26:12,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I also wonder, you know, especially being in June right now and just, you know, knowing the exhaustion that June brings and knowing the exhaustion that September brings.

1454
02:26:12,604 --> 02:26:18,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as a mother knowing the exhaustion that December brings, I mean, I am like, I'm sure we all are.

1455
02:26:18,647 --> 02:26:21,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I'm not a mother and a father, parents in general.

1456
02:26:22,121 --> 02:26:27,465
[SPEAKER_03]: the December month is just, I already feel like I can't squeeze anything else in there.

1457
02:26:27,905 --> 02:26:33,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate the gesture, but I'm also not sure how realistic that is when it comes right down to it.

1458
02:26:35,011 --> 02:26:50,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe we can compromise and do the January 8th and January 29th, but as the superintendent said, staff and central would rather not do the 26th, so we could do the February 5th and February 12th.

1459
02:26:55,956 --> 02:26:58,638
[SPEAKER_10]: because it would be the 29th, the 5th, the 12th.

1460
02:26:59,539 --> 02:27:03,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to create a compromise, I know.

1461
02:27:07,585 --> 02:27:11,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Kathy, Mia, what do you, a member of Crest, what do you think?

1462
02:27:11,287 --> 02:27:12,588
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just kidding.

1463
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:15,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, I mean, I- I'm kidding, you won't be here.

1464
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:24,257
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we did have another year where we had two, where Aaron DiBenedetto and Michael Ruggiero were no longer,

1465
02:27:24,921 --> 02:27:31,746
[SPEAKER_15]: members and the mayor was new to the city and we did have a training with Dorothy presser.

1466
02:27:32,441 --> 02:27:43,347
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know it was in December, and it wasn't, I mean, I don't know if it was called a retreat, but it was about a three hour training seminar for the new school committee members.

1467
02:27:43,687 --> 02:27:54,893
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was actually informational and helpful even for myself, because it was a reminder of who to contact for questions, just different things like,

1468
02:27:55,433 --> 02:28:03,294
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, going into executive session that's private, public meetings, don't share emails, you know, things like that.

1469
02:28:04,495 --> 02:28:10,516
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, she covered a wide, broad of topics, and there were two new school committee members at that meeting.

1470
02:28:11,356 --> 02:28:18,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, you know, I just, I know the two members that were leaving, and, you know, I just don't remember who was coming on, but, so we've done it before.

1471
02:28:19,317 --> 02:28:22,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Jenny and Paul, or Jen, oh, and Mel, okay, yeah.

1472
02:28:23,238 --> 02:28:25,679
[SPEAKER_15]: And the mayor was at that meeting as well.

1473
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:29,882
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I just remember, because I had to get out of work early, it's one of those things that I just remember.

1474
02:28:30,002 --> 02:28:33,524
[SPEAKER_15]: It was before Christmas, actually, because I was still doing my Christmas shopping.

1475
02:28:33,944 --> 02:28:36,045
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was like, right, it was the last week.

1476
02:28:37,246 --> 02:28:38,487
[SPEAKER_15]: School was still in session, maybe.

1477
02:28:39,007 --> 02:28:39,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it was.

1478
02:28:40,007 --> 02:28:43,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, yeah, it was school was, it was the last day of school.

1479
02:28:43,930 --> 02:28:45,911
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was a half a day, we started at noon.

1480
02:28:47,191 --> 02:28:48,712
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember Hays, then member McLaughlin.

1481
02:28:50,393 --> 02:28:51,014
[SPEAKER_19]: So the,

1482
02:28:53,106 --> 02:28:57,589
[SPEAKER_19]: The new members will also need to take the training from mask.

1483
02:28:57,989 --> 02:29:05,133
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that I, it's, I don't know how often it's offered now I know I took it in December so that you know that

1484
02:29:05,734 --> 02:29:10,577
[SPEAKER_19]: That will be something that the new school community members might also already be doing in December.

1485
02:29:10,977 --> 02:29:13,718
[SPEAKER_19]: I really like the idea, though, of the retreat.

1486
02:29:13,838 --> 02:29:15,959
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a nice way to introduce.

1487
02:29:16,299 --> 02:29:18,721
[SPEAKER_19]: I did feel thrown in at the beginning.

1488
02:29:19,781 --> 02:29:22,803
[SPEAKER_19]: So I appreciate that idea, and I think it's a great idea.

1489
02:29:22,823 --> 02:29:33,968
[SPEAKER_19]: But I just wanted to add in there that the election is November, and that at some point, hopefully, the person will do that training sometime between then and their first time in January.

1490
02:29:35,506 --> 02:29:36,927
[SPEAKER_19]: they'll already be doing that too.

1491
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:41,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin and Member Ruseau.

1492
02:29:43,117 --> 02:29:43,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1493
02:29:43,958 --> 02:30:00,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I would also say just having been thrown into the mix and having sat through a lot of school committee meetings, there was still a tremendous amount to learn, not just from the MASC orientation or present, you know, I guess you could call it an orientation, but it's also very specific to the district orientation.

1494
02:30:00,430 --> 02:30:06,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there, I don't think I know that there was, I was still finding out, I'm still finding out new things actually.

1495
02:30:08,899 --> 02:30:13,560
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was definitely still finding out new things the first year all throughout the year.

1496
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:17,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just really think being thoughtful about this is important.

1497
02:30:17,581 --> 02:30:20,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know folks are, I love the idea of a retreat too.

1498
02:30:20,201 --> 02:30:21,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.

1499
02:30:21,242 --> 02:30:23,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how realistic it is for that month.

1500
02:30:23,602 --> 02:30:32,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will add that to member Hays' point, I think we also need to have some accountability for the MASC training because I don't necessarily think that

1501
02:30:33,264 --> 02:31:01,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody does do that so maybe that's going to be part of what you know the onboarding for the subcommittee can talk about, or whatever it's going to be next September, can talk about some of what the process might look like and how there can be some assurance that you know that there's that there's people are going to the training but also maybe much like what we heard earlier tonight and presentations and just good practice maybe there'll be mentor opportunities where people can be partnered with mentors if folks want to offer that opportunity.

1502
02:31:02,537 --> 02:31:03,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

1503
02:31:03,839 --> 02:31:04,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1504
02:31:04,539 --> 02:31:10,266
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to remind this committee that for the first time ever, our new members will have a rule book.

1505
02:31:11,988 --> 02:31:15,833
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's a substantial change.

1506
02:31:18,288 --> 02:31:31,585
[SPEAKER_17]: We put an enormous amount of effort into it, but the new members when they like how do you put something on the agenda, the answer won't be you write an email explaining it, it will be look at rule number 42 or whatever it is.

1507
02:31:32,346 --> 02:31:32,526
[SPEAKER_17]: And.

1508
02:31:35,029 --> 02:31:46,237
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that'll be nice for those of us that are still here to not have to try to divulge all the knowledge that we've accumulated, but also it will, I think, will make a huge difference for new members.

1509
02:31:46,317 --> 02:31:55,824
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if I was getting elected in November, I mean, whoever gets elected in November, I'm certainly going to send them an email with a, hey, here's our rules so you can

1510
02:31:56,224 --> 02:31:59,166
[SPEAKER_17]: start reading because they are not a short, it's not a short list.

1511
02:32:00,447 --> 02:32:06,611
[SPEAKER_17]: But and most of them you don't need to really know you need to read it once and be done with it, but I think that will help a lot.

1512
02:32:07,411 --> 02:32:24,982
[SPEAKER_17]: It is true that, like the MASC training is critical and important for school committees in general, but they are not specific to Medford, which I do hope that the, you know, my intentions if I get reelected is to, you know,

1513
02:32:27,091 --> 02:32:35,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Latch myself onto the side of the new members brains and be like what do the rules not teach you that you need to know because it's.

1514
02:32:35,788 --> 02:32:41,029
[SPEAKER_17]: fresh eyes on something is impossible if you've already, I've already was already in office.

1515
02:32:42,010 --> 02:32:57,033
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm hopeful that the next time around, these rules will become whether smaller or just better, so that we can parlay that into more onboarding kinds of documents instead of just, you know, kind of dry rules.

1516
02:32:57,873 --> 02:32:59,914
[SPEAKER_17]: I also want to point out that I

1517
02:33:01,058 --> 02:33:19,651
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the ideas of retreats I really do they would have to be in the city of Medford and they are open to the public, and when I think of a retreat no offense but that's not what I think of her as a retreat, I think of us all hold up in a hotel catered, you know, hanging out at the pool after we do our sessions together, and that isn't going to happen.

1518
02:33:20,091 --> 02:33:22,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Because unless only three of us go together.

1519
02:33:23,313 --> 02:33:26,135
[SPEAKER_17]: So I, I love the idea of a retreat.

1520
02:33:26,796 --> 02:33:31,979
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't love the idea of being in a speedo in front of a public members I wanted to show up and watch this talk.

1521
02:33:33,860 --> 02:33:34,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't worry I don't have a speedo.

1522
02:33:36,222 --> 02:33:38,584
[SPEAKER_17]: My point is just like that.

1523
02:33:39,764 --> 02:33:44,248
[SPEAKER_17]: I retreat I love the idea, but I think as member credits mentioned we have had.

1524
02:33:44,268 --> 02:33:47,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we might have called them retreats frankly but

1525
02:33:48,706 --> 02:33:57,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but I think most of us might think of retreats, we don't think of Dorothy Presser in a room in the high school.

1526
02:33:57,788 --> 02:34:05,429
[SPEAKER_17]: And it makes me sad, but there's no carve out in the open meeting law for such a thing, unfortunately.

1527
02:34:06,529 --> 02:34:13,611
[SPEAKER_17]: So as for the dates, I have a slightly different opinion of the three in a row.

1528
02:34:15,839 --> 02:34:17,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Practice makes perfect.

1529
02:34:18,101 --> 02:34:23,364
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do one, and when there's multiple meetings in a row, they tend to be shorter.

1530
02:34:25,566 --> 02:34:26,927
[SPEAKER_17]: January being slower also.

1531
02:34:27,911 --> 02:34:40,979
[SPEAKER_17]: But also if they're every week I mean, we're going to have trouble filling up that agenda and making it a long night so I'm thinking that a new member, having three weeks in a row, which none of us are going to really like that.

1532
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:48,244
[SPEAKER_17]: But three weeks in a row practicing, you know, Robert tools and relatively short agendas.

1533
02:34:48,764 --> 02:34:50,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it could be beneficial.

1534
02:34:51,065 --> 02:34:54,248
[SPEAKER_17]: in a kind of perverse way, frankly.

1535
02:34:55,088 --> 02:35:01,373
[SPEAKER_17]: So that I'm not opposed to the three weeks in a row being that it's January.

1536
02:35:01,413 --> 02:35:07,598
[SPEAKER_17]: If it was this three weeks in a row right now, I would like look at you all with laser eyes, like, how dare you?

1537
02:35:07,618 --> 02:35:09,640
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't do this another week in a row.

1538
02:35:10,761 --> 02:35:12,402
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's just my opinion.

1539
02:35:12,562 --> 02:35:15,364
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do think that like immediately after vacation,

1540
02:35:17,162 --> 02:35:23,207
[SPEAKER_17]: is too much because really the superintendent's office has to kind of do it two weeks ahead of time.

1541
02:35:24,107 --> 02:35:28,471
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can be assured of a very short agenda because nothing's really ready by then.

1542
02:35:28,791 --> 02:35:30,572
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's my thoughts.

1543
02:35:31,733 --> 02:35:32,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor.

1544
02:35:32,854 --> 02:35:35,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, then maybe we can call the roll for the change.

1545
02:35:36,717 --> 02:35:42,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to amend my motion to, motion to what?

1546
02:35:44,471 --> 02:35:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a motion to withdraw.

1547
02:35:46,692 --> 02:35:47,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Withdraw, yeah, the motion.

1548
02:35:48,073 --> 02:35:49,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a motion to accept this.

1549
02:35:49,513 --> 02:35:50,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get seconded though.

1550
02:35:51,134 --> 02:35:51,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1551
02:35:51,614 --> 02:36:00,819
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion to accept the amendment to the resolution, to the resolve to change the January 22nd meeting to January 29th.

1552
02:36:00,979 --> 02:36:04,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what we've kind of settled on?

1553
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:08,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the negotiation that was proposed 20 minutes ago.

1554
02:36:08,202 --> 02:36:10,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham, are you acceptable?

1555
02:36:12,321 --> 02:36:21,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, motion to change the January 2nd meeting to January 29th by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Graham.

1556
02:36:22,384 --> 02:36:23,184
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1557
02:36:23,964 --> 02:36:24,765
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1558
02:36:25,945 --> 02:36:28,046
[SPEAKER_09]: That meeting has been officially changed.

1559
02:36:28,686 --> 02:36:33,747
[SPEAKER_13]: So can I just point out that, oh, nevermind, nevermind.

1560
02:36:34,047 --> 02:36:34,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything's fine.

1561
02:36:35,248 --> 02:36:35,568
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

1562
02:36:36,748 --> 02:36:37,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good compromise.

1563
02:36:37,789 --> 02:36:39,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the points.

1564
02:36:41,001 --> 02:37:02,013
[SPEAKER_09]: presentations there's no presentations of the public or continued business we do have an item under new business 2023-14 offered by member Hays and member McLaughlin, whereas, Massachusetts General Law 71 section 38 point of information, sorry, when some point of information that's a question there point of, I can't think right now, but it's actually a member Hays and member of my stone.

1565
02:37:03,334 --> 02:37:05,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, remember my stone.

1566
02:37:05,636 --> 02:37:05,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1567
02:37:07,023 --> 02:37:11,806
[SPEAKER_09]: School committees of cities, towns, and regional school districts shall meet at least once every other month.

1568
02:37:11,866 --> 02:37:24,936
[SPEAKER_09]: During the month, school is in session with a student advisory committee to consist of five members to be composed of students selected by the student body of the high school or high schools in each city, town, or regional school district.

1569
02:37:25,036 --> 02:37:35,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And whereas Medford policy JIB student involvement in decision-making states that Medford will adhere to this law, be resolved, Medford Public Schools Administration will create a process to implement

1570
02:37:35,930 --> 02:37:43,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Policy JIB and present this process to the school committee in October 2023 and begin implementation in November 2023.

1571
02:37:44,015 --> 02:37:50,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Member Hays, seconded by Member Mustone.

1572
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:51,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor.

1573
02:37:51,661 --> 02:37:52,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

1574
02:37:52,979 --> 02:37:53,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1575
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:56,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, this is both law and policy already.

1576
02:37:57,343 --> 02:38:10,054
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, it feels to me like we're at the point where we should perhaps included in the evaluation of the superintendent, but I also think it's important to point out that I do not believe a single district in the entire state of Massachusetts follows this law.

1577
02:38:10,635 --> 02:38:14,058
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason we discussed extensively I think it was in February.

1578
02:38:14,616 --> 02:38:16,797
[SPEAKER_17]: that we cannot pay students by law.

1579
02:38:17,997 --> 02:38:31,281
[SPEAKER_17]: So we would either have to have school committee meetings during the school day to have them be there, which most of us cannot actually do that during the school day or take them out of class, frankly.

1580
02:38:32,821 --> 02:38:35,722
[SPEAKER_17]: And then by having it at night, we can't compel them to be here.

1581
02:38:35,942 --> 02:38:43,344
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just worried about us having five additional meetings a year where we're going to all gather for an agenda that's properly posted

1582
02:38:43,971 --> 02:38:49,072
[SPEAKER_17]: to hear from our students, they may or may not show up and there's nothing we can do about it.

1583
02:38:49,392 --> 02:38:51,893
[SPEAKER_17]: But if they don't show up, we will not complied.

1584
02:38:52,473 --> 02:38:55,233
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will have to schedule another one and hope they can make it.

1585
02:38:55,914 --> 02:39:06,256
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fact that no other district does this is because while the intent of the law, there is no person who could possibly think it's a bad idea to hear from our students.

1586
02:39:06,456 --> 02:39:07,996
[SPEAKER_17]: The intent of the law is there.

1587
02:39:08,996 --> 02:39:12,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Like many laws, the intent is why they got passed.

1588
02:39:13,266 --> 02:39:18,068
[SPEAKER_17]: and then they are immediately forgotten because nobody thinks they can actually be implemented.

1589
02:39:19,288 --> 02:39:32,633
[SPEAKER_17]: And I fully support hearing from our students in perfectly structured ways that we can be predicting and all this other stuff, but I do not understand how we could possibly actually accomplish this.

1590
02:39:33,533 --> 02:39:34,714
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna vote for it.

1591
02:39:34,754 --> 02:39:35,514
[SPEAKER_17]: It's already the law.

1592
02:39:35,554 --> 02:39:37,015
[SPEAKER_17]: It's already the school committee policy.

1593
02:39:37,115 --> 02:39:37,775
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll vote for it.

1594
02:39:39,568 --> 02:39:43,371
[SPEAKER_17]: But making it happen does not seem to be something that other districts have figured out.

1595
02:39:44,091 --> 02:39:53,817
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, at a school committee conference, this was brought up by I don't remember who brought it up but there was like, we should all be doing this and everybody's like yeah we should all be doing this.

1596
02:39:55,218 --> 02:39:56,859
[SPEAKER_17]: And then everybody went on with their day.

1597
02:40:03,382 --> 02:40:08,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, the intent I agree with, I'm happy to just vote for it, but I don't see how we're going to actually accomplish this.

1598
02:40:09,366 --> 02:40:14,488
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think there is any logistical magic that can occur to make it actually happen.

1599
02:40:15,549 --> 02:40:15,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1600
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:17,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

1601
02:40:18,091 --> 02:40:27,296
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, from the chair, we can always amend maybe the language to say and begin to try to implement, but I think we can also get creative with making sure that there's at least a quorum.

1602
02:40:27,696 --> 02:40:32,559
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have the ability to operate on Zoom, so we could do a lunchtime Zoom or a

1603
02:40:33,639 --> 02:40:43,348
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, period within the school day where at least four of us can, or those that will be here after November can hop on and try to get creative with it.

1604
02:40:43,388 --> 02:40:44,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's worth a try.

1605
02:40:45,269 --> 02:40:45,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays?

1606
02:40:47,411 --> 02:40:54,457
[SPEAKER_19]: I did call, I did contact a couple of school committees about it, and I didn't bring those notes with me, but I believe it was Arlington.

1607
02:40:54,517 --> 02:41:01,183
[SPEAKER_19]: There was one that said that they did 730 meetings with their student advisory council.

1608
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:03,951
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, there were creative ways to do it.

1609
02:41:05,191 --> 02:41:05,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me?

1610
02:41:06,552 --> 02:41:06,792
[SPEAKER_10]: AM.

1611
02:41:10,393 --> 02:41:12,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Arlington does school committee meetings all over the place.

1612
02:41:12,554 --> 02:41:14,755
[SPEAKER_19]: They do 10 AM meetings on Saturday mornings.

1613
02:41:15,335 --> 02:41:18,656
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are creative ways to figure this out.

1614
02:41:18,676 --> 02:41:21,457
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm happy to take the lead on this and try to work.

1615
02:41:21,758 --> 02:41:23,858
[SPEAKER_19]: I can work with you to try to figure it out.

1616
02:41:24,459 --> 02:41:30,061
[SPEAKER_19]: The worst can happen is it doesn't work, but I think it's worth trying because we have been looking for ways to get more student involvement.

1617
02:41:31,488 --> 02:41:34,330
[SPEAKER_19]: And since this is already law and policy, we can try.

1618
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:36,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I make a motion to move the question?

1619
02:41:36,311 --> 02:41:40,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays.

1620
02:41:40,675 --> 02:41:41,255
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1621
02:41:41,275 --> 02:41:42,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1622
02:41:42,156 --> 02:41:42,736
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1623
02:41:42,776 --> 02:41:43,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1624
02:41:43,757 --> 02:41:45,038
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no reports requested.

1625
02:41:45,158 --> 02:41:46,499
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have two condolences.

1626
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:49,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Hays?

1627
02:41:49,701 --> 02:41:54,965
[SPEAKER_19]: The one thing I think we missed, I think the school committee needs to take a vote on the superintendent's evaluation, don't we?

1628
02:41:55,285 --> 02:41:56,246
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not on the agenda.

1629
02:41:56,386 --> 02:41:56,726
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't.

1630
02:42:01,499 --> 02:42:01,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor?

1631
02:42:02,199 --> 02:42:03,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's not on the agenda.

1632
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:05,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

1633
02:42:05,220 --> 02:42:09,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Just if we can make sure it's on our next, when we have a special meeting, we do need to put that on the agenda.

1634
02:42:10,222 --> 02:42:10,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1635
02:42:11,422 --> 02:42:14,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we'll look into maybe amending Wednesdays if possible.

1636
02:42:15,264 --> 02:42:17,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do have two condolences, the Medford School Committee.

1637
02:42:17,424 --> 02:42:21,326
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have to take another, we'll have to have another meeting on the budget anyway, so we can do it then.

1638
02:42:21,346 --> 02:42:23,206
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we were having that on Wednesday.

1639
02:42:24,767 --> 02:42:26,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I mean, City Council hasn't approved it.

1640
02:42:28,482 --> 02:42:35,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to ask if we could just say things one at a time through the chair so I can hear and understand what people are saying, please.

1641
02:42:35,427 --> 02:42:35,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1642
02:42:39,110 --> 02:42:39,951
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to figure that out.

1643
02:42:40,031 --> 02:42:49,358
[SPEAKER_09]: So condolences, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Paul Jacks, a former soccer coach from Medford.

1644
02:42:50,059 --> 02:42:53,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Gus A. Sasso.

1645
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:57,946
[SPEAKER_09]: junior brother-in-law of former administrative assistant Angela Sasso.

1646
02:42:58,346 --> 02:43:01,231
[SPEAKER_09]: May I just point out information or point of clarification.

1647
02:43:01,271 --> 02:43:02,173
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Jake's.

1648
02:43:02,854 --> 02:43:03,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Jake's.

1649
02:43:03,274 --> 02:43:03,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1650
02:43:04,376 --> 02:43:04,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1651
02:43:05,638 --> 02:43:07,181
[SPEAKER_09]: We may rise for a moment of silence.

1652
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:25,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have our next regular school committee meeting on September 11, 2023 in the Holden Memorial Chambers and on Zoom.

1653
02:43:26,333 --> 02:43:32,075
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have a committee of the whole meeting on this Wednesday, the 14th at 5 p.m.

1654
02:43:32,115 --> 02:43:32,515
[SPEAKER_09]: by Zoom.

1655
02:43:33,995 --> 02:43:41,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to, if I can, just say thank you to my colleagues for completing 2022-2023 school year.

1656
02:43:41,518 --> 02:43:44,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty much over.

1657
02:43:44,599 --> 02:43:47,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you guys for all your hard work and commitment.

1658
02:43:48,424 --> 02:43:49,186
[SPEAKER_03]: been a long year.

1659
02:43:49,266 --> 02:43:49,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
