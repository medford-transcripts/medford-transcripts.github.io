1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:01,972
Thank you so much for being here.

2
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:07,155
Despite the weather, this is a wonderful day for the city of Medford and its Medford Police Department.

3
00:00:07,196 --> 00:00:08,937
So thank you all for joining us.

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:15,981
Father Casey, elected officials, all of the officers here today, as well as the citizens.

5
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:20,724
This is a historic day, a day that has been long in the coming.

6
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:26,007
Welcome to the groundbreaking of the Medford Police Headquarters.

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,992
This headquarters represents a new era in policing in Medford.

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:40,153
This station is critical to 21st century policing model that our offices embody.

9
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,035
It took perseverance by many to make this happen.

10
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:47,735
Many with us today, so thank you all.

11
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:57,838
This new facility will improve readiness and morale and will compliment the dedication the members of the Medford Police Department demonstrate daily.

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:05,962
It will permit these committed men and women to come to work in a building that they are proud of each and every day.

13
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:15,706
This groundbreaking ceremony is an exciting first step in the legacy of the Medford Police Department and our service to the residents of Medford.

14
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:22,740
The state-of-the-art facility will be a beacon of safety for our community for years to come.

15
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:25,604
So thank you, thank you, thank you, all of you.

16
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:29,928
At this time, I'd like to recognize some of our elected officials that are here today.

17
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,851
From the City Council, we have President John Falco.

18
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:39,534
Vice President Brianna Lungo-Kern, Councilor Rick Carviello, and Councilor Adam Knight.

19
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:43,095
Without the assistance of the City Council, this would not have been possible.

20
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:49,477
So thank you all for the courageous votes you took to make sure that the bonding went through and that this is happening here today.

21
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:50,257
Thank you.

22
00:01:56,258 --> 00:02:02,180
We also have with us from our state delegation, State Senator Pat Jalen walked in.

23
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,384
Our senior representative, Paul Donato.

24
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,169
Representative Sean Gobley.

25
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:16,854
And representative Christine Bobber.

26
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:18,195
Thank you for joining us today.

27
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:24,635
They're also working on trying to get us a little bit of money too that can go towards this process.

28
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:27,656
So thank you for all your diligence in this regard.

29
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:31,698
Also from our school committee, we have Mia Mustone Quinn.

30
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,239
Quinn Mustone.

31
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,081
And Mr. Paul Russo.

32
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,841
Thank you very much for being here today.

33
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:48,386
At this time, I would like to recognize Father Robert Casey, the chaplain for the Medford Police Department to do an invocation.

34
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:57,380
I prayed for some this morning, but let us pray.

35
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:11,050
Oh God, the work we begin today gives us hope for the future, the future of Medford Police Department and its officers, and the future of the city of Medford and its citizens.

36
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:19,219
We all know the familiar words of the Old Testament Psalm, if God does not build a house in vain to its builder's labor.

37
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:25,569
Whenever we look to the interest of our community and serve them, we are God's coworkers.

38
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:37,480
Let us today pray for God's help, that he may bring this construction to successful completion and his protection will keep those who work on it safe from injury.

39
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:39,941
We reflect on the words of St.

40
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:49,486
Paul, according to the grace of God given to me, like a wise master builder, I laid a foundation and another is building upon it.

41
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:59,957
Each must be careful how he builds upon it, for no one can lay a foundation other than the one that is there, namely God's word and God's presence.

42
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,484
And so we pray for this building today.

43
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:08,028
All-powerful and all-merciful Father, you have created all things.

44
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:20,699
Through the gift of your eternal wisdom, grant that the undertaking we begin today on the new state-of-the-art Medford Police Headquarters may progress day by day to its successful completion.

45
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,341
Bless Mayor Burke,

46
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:33,693
and Chief of Police Buckley as they supervise the building of a new home for the police department and all those who will continue to plan and build this new headquarters.

47
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:36,834
We ask this in God's name, amen.

48
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,476
Thank you, Father Casey, for those remarks.

49
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:47,577
At this time, I would like to introduce the President of the Medford Police Superior's Union, Mr. Bono.

50
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:48,558
Please step forward.

51
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:51,659
Thank you.

52
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:54,608
I'll keep it very short.

53
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:07,437
The members of the Memphis Police Superior Officers Association are grateful for this day and they're grateful to Mayor Burke, City Council, Chief Buckley, and also Chief Sacco for bringing this project forward and getting it started.

54
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:13,182
I know that the officers, most of whom from my association, work within the confines of the building.

55
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:19,264
will appreciate the fact that they'll now be able to work in an efficient and a safe building.

56
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:25,446
Once again, I want to thank all those involved, the Mayor, the Chief, City Council, and Chief Sacco as well.

57
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:25,887
Thank you.

58
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:30,548
Thank you.

59
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:34,750
And now the President of the Memphis Patrolmen's Association, Harold McGivley, would like to say a few words.

60
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,932
Thank you.

61
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:42,293
I wrote something down so I don't get myself in trouble.

62
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,167
All right, good morning.

63
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,169
I want to start by thanking Mayor Burke.

64
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:47,989
Thank you, Mayor Burke.

65
00:05:51,671 --> 00:06:00,377
And the Memphis City Councilors, most of them are present here, for a long overdue project, the building of a new Memphis Police Headquarters.

66
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:03,119
It's been a long, sometimes difficult road.

67
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:08,616
Thank you to Chief Sacco for supporting the men and women of the Police Department throughout this process.

68
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:12,980
It's unfortunate that a forced retirement prevented him from seeing the project through.

69
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,024
He did, however, leave the keys in very capable hands.

70
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:28,135
Thank you to Chief Buckley for seeing this project through and keeping the safety and well-being of the men and women that serve under you as your top priority.

71
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:32,613
Thank you for also providing me the opportunity to speak this morning.

72
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:32,953
Thank you.

73
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:43,057
The membership of the MPPA brought the working conditions of police headquarters to the public's attention, and the support and response was truly amazing.

74
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:52,541
The MPPA membership stayed on message and remained professional at all times, and the citizens of this great city spoke loud and clear that it was time for a new police headquarters.

75
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:57,763
On behalf of the MPPA, we'd like to thank the citizens of Met for their unwavering support.

76
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:02,699
Most of my thanks, however, has to go to the members of the MPPA.

77
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm so proud to represent each and every one of them.

78
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:11,243
They've worked through and under some very difficult circumstances and conditions over the years.

79
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,284
They did so without missing a beat.

80
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:16,205
They represent the very best in law enforcement today.

81
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:19,247
We look forward to the completion of this project.

82
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:25,603
We look forward to being provided with the best tools, most modern technology available to do our job.

83
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:32,244
We look forward to continuing to provide the citizens of Medford with the very best possible police service available.

84
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:38,605
We look forward to finally working in a building that will meet the needs of 21st century policing.

85
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:42,266
Again, we thank Mayor Burke and Medford City Council.

86
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:46,707
We look forward to another groundbreaking ceremony when the firefighters get a new building.

87
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:51,849
And in conclusion, I want to just say we got another MPPA fact check.

88
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,750
We got a new building.

89
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,731
Thank you very much.

90
00:07:53,751 --> 00:08:03,521
So Chief Sacco also left behind something else.

91
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:09,547
A beautiful orange shag carpet for Chief Buckley to enjoy for the next year and a half.

92
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,508
So kudos, right?

93
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:12,688
He's a really good man.

94
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:18,652
The next woman I'd like to introduce really needs no introduction, especially in the law enforcement community.

95
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:26,736
Our district attorney, Marion Ryan, is one of those people that are always there by your side, 24-7.

96
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:30,978
She's always on scene, always willing to talk to anyone and help anyone.

97
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:33,179
And she's just a magnificent district attorney.

98
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:37,642
I know that the police department and DA Ryan work very closely together.

99
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:43,769
Chief Buckley, as a lieutenant, I know worked immensely with the district attorney.

100
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,577
So she's always been a partner in crime in the city of Medford and alleviating crime more so.

101
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:52,702
So I'd like to introduce our district attorney, Marion Ryan.

102
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:01,970
Thank you and thank you to Mayor Burke and Chief Buckley for inviting me to be here today.

103
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,811
And of course we thank Chief Sacco.

104
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:13,698
You know, I don't want to say this has been a long anticipated project, but we used to say it would be a cold day in hell when Medford got a new police station.

105
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:14,899
I'm just saying.

106
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:26,489
You know, of course, as the mayor mentioned, the police department are our closest partners and we are happy to see them have this new facility to do their work.

107
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:33,855
But I want to spend a minute just talking about what the groundbreaking for this new building means for the citizens of Medford.

108
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:39,040
Think about what we ask of our police departments today.

109
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:57,807
We ask them to do impeccable investigations, to use technology that literally changes every day, to ensure that we preserve evidence in a way that leads to convictions that are unassailable.

110
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:03,012
We ask them to be here when you are lost,

111
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,785
when you need help, when your family hurts, that's what we ask of our police departments.

112
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:21,333
And there is probably no discipline that in the last 15 years has changed more and has risen to that challenge.

113
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:30,960
No matter what people say, no matter what their take is on the issue, when they are hurt, they need help.

114
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,281
They dial 911.

115
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:44,729
And to have people here that we treat with dignity and show that by the places we give them to work is a very, very important statement by a community.

116
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:54,316
You can be certain in Medford that you have chosen well in the people who lead you, in the people who guide your public safety.

117
00:10:55,502 --> 00:11:01,844
As the New Testament tells us, where your treasure is, that is where your heart is.

118
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:13,468
And by making the stand to commit funds to this building, Medford has truly shown the community where the heart and the soul of this city lay.

119
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:14,568
So thank you.

120
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:18,230
I'm great looking forward to this building and I'm happy to be here this morning.

121
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,710
Thank you.

122
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:30,266
So we all know that it takes many to get the job done.

123
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:36,948
And I want to recognize some of the team within City Hall that has been working on this project for the last two and a half years.

124
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:40,309
And there are more than I'm going to name, but these are the key people.

125
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:41,849
Of course, Chief Sacco.

126
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:49,612
Chief Sacco fought every day to make this happen, knowing he would not be chief when the building is completed.

127
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:53,813
He knew how important it was for the members of the Medford Police Department.

128
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:55,614
Thank you to Chief Sacco.

129
00:11:55,674 --> 00:12:05,458
I think he's enjoying a little bit of sun right now and maybe he can send some our way too but we thank Chief Sacco for all the work that he did on behalf of the Medford Police Department.

130
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:09,699
And of course Chief Buckley who stepped up, carried the reins.

131
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,940
I don't think we skipped a beat.

132
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,302
We just continued to have our weekly meetings and instead of Chief Sacco we had Chief Buckley present.

133
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:20,104
So thank you Chief Buckley also for jumping right in and

134
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,617
keeping the process moving.

135
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,281
We have our city solicitor Mark Rumley who I believe is here today.

136
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:36,449
Mark has been through every step of this process and he has been our confidant and he has kept us moving and always

137
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:38,880
how to do everything the right way.

138
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,780
So thank you, Mark.

139
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,601
Jen Deverwood, Chief of Staff.

140
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,043
She's in on all the weekly meetings and she has definitely kept us moving.

141
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:50,065
She keeps everybody informed and makes sure that the process is on target and on date.

142
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:52,186
Annmarie Irwin, our treasurer.

143
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,708
Where would we be without the money, right?

144
00:12:54,748 --> 00:13:00,130
So Annmarie's been watching the dollars, watching the cash flow, and she makes sure that everything happens right.

145
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,391
So she's been an integral part of this process.

146
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,953
Paul Mokia, Building Commissioner and his team.

147
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:07,852
You've looked at every plan.

148
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,013
You gave guidance.

149
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:09,813
You gave advice.

150
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,574
So you have made this a better project.

151
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:13,854
So thank you, Paul and the team in the building department.

152
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:17,936
Alicia Hunt, as we all know, she's actually in Boston today.

153
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:29,779
Her office has been at the meetings regularly and has made sure that this building is built to our 21st century standards from an energy perspective, environmental perspective.

154
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:31,960
And I think you can see the pile behind us.

155
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,543
We had to let that wait for about six, seven months because we're building up the site.

156
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:39,685
Because in 50 years, we don't know where the Mystic River is going to end up.

157
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,227
And we wanted to protect our investment.

158
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:47,331
So we spent the time in order to make this site be about four feet, four feet, am I correct?

159
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:48,572
Four feet taller, higher.

160
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:50,092
four feet higher.

161
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:56,035
So thank you Alicia Hunt for all the work you've done and also Shab Khan from our procurement office.

162
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:01,678
Shab has made sure everything has been ticked and tied and done correctly so according to the law.

163
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,479
So thank you Shab from our team.

164
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,202
We of course have the members of the Medford Police Department that went and visited many sites

165
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:11,606
They saw some new stations, some not so new stations.

166
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:13,809
They tried to pick the best of what they saw.

167
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:19,556
And I think that when we open up this building, you're going to see that this is a beautiful building.

168
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:25,684
It's an efficient building, and it will work for the benefit of the men and women of our Medford Police Department.

169
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:31,588
And a man that I'm going to introduce up next, Jeff Shaw.

170
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:34,689
Jeff Shaw has been with us for the last seven years.

171
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:40,750
I know he's going to elaborate in his words, but he's been with us since we started doing the space needs assessment.

172
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,710
And Jeff has been a partner.

173
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,091
And if I told you he's looked at 10 sites for us, that's probably an understatement.

174
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:52,772
Whenever I had an idea, or if I drove by a vacant lot, or I drove by a building, I'd say, hey, Jeff, what do you think?

175
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,453
Can you go, can you fit a police station on that, number one?

176
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:56,753
And what would it look like?

177
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:58,054
in the surroundings.

178
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:03,879
And Jeff has done more than one big sketch for us to see if we could find a perfect location.

179
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:12,286
And it wasn't until an officer that I won't name came by and visited my office and he said, have you looked at the training center?

180
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,911
And I'm like, you guys use the training center.

181
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:20,016
And he was like, that'd be a perfect location, because we like being right here.

182
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,178
We like this location.

183
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:22,299
We like the proximity.

184
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,861
We like being in the square.

185
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:30,069
So to that officer, thank you for opening up our eyes, because we really, we were not looking at this at that time.

186
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:30,709
So thank you.

187
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:42,305
And today would not have been possible without our DPW crew that put together everything that you see here in the last minute, as well as the Murphy brothers that provided the tenting for us.

188
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:43,345
So, you know, thank you.

189
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:48,186
It takes a village, and you guys are part of our village, and we really appreciate all the work you do.

190
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:53,187
And sometimes you're in the background, but we know you're there, and you're always trying to look out for our best interest.

191
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:56,628
So thank you to our whole DPW department for everything you do every day.

192
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,306
You know, Marion mentioned, D.A.

193
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:04,607
Ryan mentioned, that you call 911 and people come.

194
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:10,868
So we have our police that come, we have our fire that come, and a lot of times we have our DPW that come.

195
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:14,309
So they're an integral role in public safety in our community.

196
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:19,609
And before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to acknowledge our fire chief, Gil Birdy's in the building here.

197
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,290
Thank you, chief, for joining us today.

198
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,551
So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Jeff Shaw, our architect of record, to say a few words.

199
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,577
Well it's not often that they ask the architect to speak.

200
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:43,684
I will spare you the many words I could spill over the time that we've spent working on this project.

201
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:56,537
I know many of you personally now over the years, but thank you to the Mayor Burke, to the City Council, and the Police Department, and all the other officials

202
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:15,378
and staff and everyone else that we worked with over the course of this project, including the contractor, CTA Construction, and the Owner's Project Manager, Daedalus Projects, who have, like everybody else on this project, just seamlessly integrated with the team and the staff to keep this project moving smoothly.

203
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:31,706
As the mayor mentioned, it's been about seven years to the day that we were hired and have been working on this project and it's been an honor to work alongside such dedicated public servants that we found in the city of Medford to build a new home for the Medford Police Department.

204
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:36,080
Our firm does specialize in police and fire stations.

205
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:43,104
We've completed many, many projects as well as many, many studies for departments across the state.

206
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:50,129
But we began our work here with the completion of a study looking at both the police and the fire department.

207
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:55,512
We did that because we wanted to identify the space needs that are required in this building.

208
00:17:56,593 --> 00:18:00,215
That study concluded with the result that the department needed 35,000 square feet

209
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:03,977
for a modern police facility.

210
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:27,992
We worked very closely with Chief Sacco, Captain Clemente, Captain Fowler, Lieutenant Colarusso, Lieutenant Buckley, and now Chief Buckley on the program, which is taking that space need and developing plans that identified how we would build a new station to meet the physical space requirements of the police department.

211
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:29,953
During that study,

212
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,022
As the mayor mentioned, we looked at many different sites around the city.

213
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:39,324
Many that have been named, many that have not been named.

214
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:43,606
And that took us to practically every corner of the city.

215
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:50,329
And we ultimately, as the mayor said, came back home here to the police station site.

216
00:18:55,355 --> 00:19:04,223
On this site we considered all options for the police department not just in the current academy location but what could we do on other areas of the site.

217
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:19,496
We looked at parking, we looked at how this site integrated with the bus stop that was out front and all the other needs that would need to be solved as part of this project went forward including working carefully with city staff

218
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:32,465
the police and the City Council to look at site needs for drainage, for conservation, and for many other things that were required to get our regulatory permits for this project.

219
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:54,528
were other special sessions that the city encouraged the team to to go forward with including resiliency planning as the mayor mentioned raising the site up for potential future proofing of this parcel of land it's an emergency facility it needs to be able to respond to the needs of the city we looked at planning

220
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,514
especially for environmental and energy sustainability.

221
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:08,271
There's now plans in place to put solar panels on the building, as well as the energy efficiencies that we've incorporated into the building.

222
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:16,006
We looked at site and utility planning, considering that if this site were to flood, what would happen to the utilities on the site?

223
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:19,129
We located our mechanical rooms on the second floor of the building.

224
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:27,895
There's been a significant amount of work by all the professionals involved to help to make this a truly state-of-the-art building.

225
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:35,922
I think along the way we answered just about as many questions about the technological and physical capabilities of the station that could possibly be asked.

226
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:56,025
The building has the capability to house 130 staff, including a full-size training room, roll call, and physical fitness center, a modern detectives bureau with full evidence storage and processing facility, and an up-to-date flexible holding and processing center for detainees.

227
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:16,349
Ultimately, we're very happy to see the city make the commitment to building a fossil fuel-free building, as I said, installing solar panels and making the building a leader in energy-efficient design for public safety facilities, which is not easy because these are 24-7 facilities that do use quite a bit of energy compared to other buildings.

228
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:26,473
These are not goals that are seen in other projects, and we have not seen it in the past, so we truly applaud the city and the mayor and everyone for making this commitment.

229
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:33,066
Now, seven years later, we believe the city has surpassed what it set out originally to accomplish.

230
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:37,928
We are excited to begin the final phase of the project, establishing a new home for the police department.

231
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:38,668
Thank you.

232
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:43,971
Thank you, Jeff.

233
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:47,313
And you do feel like a member of the family to all of us, so thank you.

234
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:51,815
I also want to acknowledge a few more department heads that are present with us today.

235
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:56,297
We have Alicia Nunley-Benjamin, head of our finance department at City Hall.

236
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:57,298
Thank you, Alicia.

237
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,161
We have Michael Durham, our veterans agent who's here today.

238
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,984
Our superintendent of schools, Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

239
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,208
I think, have I missed any other department heads?

240
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,051
Our city engineer, Tim McGivern.

241
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,033
Tim, thank you.

242
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:26,179
And at this time, I would like to introduce the chief of police, John Jack Buckley.

243
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,594
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

244
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,778
First, not the Madam, but that goes hand-in-hand with the John Jack.

245
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:46,542
I was born a John and have been Jack since, well, go back to that one.

246
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,525
It's a little bit unfair for me before I officially begin.

247
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:54,109
I saw that I was put on the bottom of the speaking rolls.

248
00:22:55,831 --> 00:23:04,938
Everyone speaks so eloquently, and I'm new to this, so bear with me, especially if you saw my speech blow away in the wind a couple of minutes ago.

249
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,240
If it's out of order, it's not my fault.

250
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:12,285
But when the architect comes up and hits a home run in his speech before you, you know you're up against the wall.

251
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:21,072
Good morning, and thank you all for being here, and for doing your part to bring this building to where we are today.

252
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:31,340
Today we move from pre-construction to construction, and I cannot wait until we all come back in some 20 months to open the doors to this new police station.

253
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:37,889
There are many people to thank for this day coming about, but I'd like to begin with my own officers.

254
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:55,866
The efforts of the Medford Police Patrolmen's Association, Officer Harold McGillivray, and the support of the Medford Police Superior Officer's Association, Sergeant David Bononell, and for many years, Lieutenant Andy Michael Bryan, were the impetus, or should I say push, that got this project rolling.

255
00:23:56,926 --> 00:24:04,431
And I truly thank them for their support, and I thank the members of my police department for bearing with us throughout this time.

256
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,452
The end is in sight.

257
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:08,053
We will have our building soon.

258
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:12,363
I also want to give a nod to a special group of officers.

259
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:30,327
We often speak of the men and women of the Medford Police Department, but in this case, it's the women of this police department that took on a special role to help bring about this day, and I thank them for their loyalty and their hard work.

260
00:24:32,147 --> 00:24:34,908
This past year has been truly amazing for our police department.

261
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:39,909
Police departments and change are two things that don't often get along.

262
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:44,430
Yet for the first time in three decades, we have a new police chief.

263
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,592
And now for the first time in almost six decades, we will have a new police station.

264
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:56,653
I owe a strong debt of gratitude for the support the city has shown our department.

265
00:24:57,614 --> 00:25:00,154
Most importantly, I want to thank Mayor Stephanie Burke.

266
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:01,735
Mayor Burke,

267
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:05,703
My officers are truly grateful for your backing of this project.

268
00:25:06,783 --> 00:25:14,366
It wasn't easy, but somehow you pushed us through, and we stand here today to put the first shovels in the ground to a long overdue project.

269
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,128
Your commitment to public safety is noted and appreciated.

270
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:29,912
You led the process to replace a 28-year legendary police chief, and you guided this department in the city to envision a new future for the community and their police department.

271
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,440
We have a new police station on the way.

272
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,203
You recently purchased new firearms and equipment that were also long overdue.

273
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:42,445
And you will be providing nine new police vehicles over the next few months.

274
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:48,369
But most importantly, you've maintained a commitment to advancing this department's community mission.

275
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:53,611
We have hired 15 to 20 officers since 2016 alone.

276
00:25:53,831 --> 00:26:02,160
And just yesterday, we spoke about hiring up to nine more officers in the very near future to support this building in the community vision.

277
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:07,866
On a personal note, as the new chief, I want to thank you for your guidance, support, and advice.

278
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:14,062
You can imagine that replacing a chief who served for three decades can be a daunting task.

279
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:21,305
You have provided me your lessons learned, having yourself replaced a mayor who served almost three decades before you took office.

280
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:30,487
You've shown me that once you commit to your job, you do not just own the present and the future, but you own the past.

281
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:36,529
Regardless of what happened in the past, you learn, you adapt, and you move forward.

282
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:43,542
I think this building is a great example of those lessons learned and I thank you and our officers.

283
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,768
Yesterday I was on the phone with Chief Sacco.

284
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:57,750
He too has had a large role in bringing this police station to life.

285
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:03,334
The chief is hiding out in Florida and could not be here today.

286
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:06,876
He promises he will be here when we open these doors

287
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:15,298
And he wants you all to know that he's very happy that that stay is here and he's extremely overjoyed for his officers in this department.

288
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:22,363
He's also overjoyed knowing this community, which he loves so much, will be getting the police station they deserve.

289
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:27,787
Take a few moments to acknowledge and thank the city council.

290
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:33,544
Long before I became chief, I watched those city council meetings every night.

291
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:35,346
And I know what you went through.

292
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:37,327
I know the decisions you had to make.

293
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:38,689
They weren't easy.

294
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,751
And I appreciate you sticking with us and pushing through.

295
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:43,613
It was tough.

296
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:45,114
You made some right decisions.

297
00:27:46,565 --> 00:28:02,074
City Council President John Falco, Vice President Brianna Lungokin, Councilor Michael Mox, Councilor Rick Caraviello, Councilor Fred DelaRusso, Councilor Adam Knight, Councilor George Schiapelle, Police Department thanks you for your part in this.

298
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:06,377
We recognize it and we appreciate your advancement and going forward.

299
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:11,970
I want to thank Senator Donato, Senator Jalen for your support of policing.

300
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,891
Representative Garberlee and Christine Barber, I thank you.

301
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:20,253
We're getting used to each other and we'll have long meetings.

302
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:24,015
District Attorney Marion Ryan, we've had a long relationship.

303
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:29,458
Your agency works well with the Memphis Police Department.

304
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:34,200
This station will encourage our relationship moving forward and I thank you.

305
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:50,133
Jeff Shaw, Elizabeth Appledoom, Alicia Monks, Richard Marks, and Larry McDonough for all the work and for putting up with me, especially in all the changes I make at the last minute.

306
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:54,717
There's one thing to replace the chief, but I'm not sure they appreciated the changes I made coming in.

307
00:28:56,377 --> 00:29:01,039
I also want to thank a special group of officers who sat with me through these committee meetings.

308
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,181
Captain Kevin Fowler, Captain Barry Clemente, and Lieutenant Jim Colarusso.

309
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:10,543
Your support is noted and I appreciate it.

310
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:13,884
If I forget someone, I apologize.

311
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:16,766
Know that I am grateful to you all.

312
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:22,148
However, I do need to thank one last person, and this person comes with a remarkable story.

313
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,481
If you haven't met Alva Erickson, take some time to talk to her today.

314
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:34,782
Alva is my personal secretary, my assistant, and my advisor.

315
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,462
I cannot get through a day without her counsel.

316
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:41,063
She knows everyone and everything.

317
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:46,164
She knows more about this department and the history of this department than anyone else.

318
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:53,445
And for those of you who don't know her story, Alva came to work at the Medford Police Department 60 years ago.

319
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:55,475
60 years.

320
00:29:56,396 --> 00:30:03,062
She sat through this same process of planning, groundbreaking, and opening the doors to that building behind us.

321
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:16,695
Alba will have worked in all three police stations once we open up.

322
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:18,136
She has seen it all.

323
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:24,451
HBO could pull her in and do their own miniseries on the things she knows and the stories she tells.

324
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:31,701
Alva, I'd like to give you these items and ask that you help break the ground today.

325
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:32,422
It's only fair.

326
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:05,860
And I mean, it takes some time to talk to Alvin.

327
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,462
She knows everything.

328
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:11,364
So this building is good for the police department.

329
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:13,266
That goes without saying.

330
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:17,589
It will bring us into the 21st century and beyond.

331
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:25,535
All new equipment, all the modern tools, a clean, friendly environment, and we thank you all for that.

332
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:29,879
But most importantly, this building will become a pillar of our community.

333
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:40,727
We will open the doors to a modern police station that is inviting to the public, evokes confidence in the community and the police partnership we work so hard to foster.

334
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:50,654
The MPD community soon will flourish and be the center of our relationships, our openness and our commitment to all those who make Medford their home.

335
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:54,777
When it's all said and done, we will have that new police station,

336
00:31:55,782 --> 00:32:01,464
but this building will stand as a monument to the public partnership our city will have with its community.

337
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:06,265
You should all be proud that you had a part in that.

338
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,766
I personally thank each and every one of you.

339
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:10,026
Thank you.

340
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:27,879
Congratulations, you really are amazing and you are the heart and soul of this police department.

341
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,843
So thank you for everything you've done and being a part of this today.

342
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:41,425
At this time I'd like to invite Father Robert Casey to conclude the ceremony with a convocation.

343
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:47,007
Oh God, builder of all things, you have placed on all of us the obligation of toil and work.

344
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:56,129
Grant that the work we begin as we break ground on the new Medford Police Headquarters may serve to better the lives of all the citizens of Medford.

345
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:59,030
Watch over all who take on this work.

346
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:07,513
And when it is completed, may it be a source of pride and accomplishment for all who planned it, built it, and occupy it.

347
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,755
Bless Chief Jack Buckley and the members of the Medford Police Department.

348
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:17,437
Watch over them, keep them safe, and always guide them to be respectful to all they serve.

349
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:19,538
We ask this in God's name.

350
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:20,418
Amen.

351
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:26,034
Thank you everybody for joining us.

352
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:27,375
We're now going to kick it over there.

353
00:33:57,945 --> 00:33:59,007
Thank you.
