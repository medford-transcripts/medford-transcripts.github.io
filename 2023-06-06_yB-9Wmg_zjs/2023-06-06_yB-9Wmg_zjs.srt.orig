[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Longo, okay.

36
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:08,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven the affirmative.

37

[SPEAKER_06]: Seven are present, none absent.

38
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:12,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Member McLaughlin on Zoom for now.

39
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:13,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that working?

40
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:15,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that working?

41
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Member, I'll turn it over to Member Graham and then Member Hayes.

42
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:20,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

43
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,682
[SPEAKER_02]: We met over the course of several meetings and most recently on Thursday night to

44
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:32,024
[SPEAKER_02]: compile the superintendent's composite evaluation.

45
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:42,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a reminder to anyone who might be listening, we as the school committee are collectively in charge of the superintendent's evaluation.

46
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:48,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means we must coalesce by a majority vote on a single evaluation.

47
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:52,336
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way that we do that here in Medford, and I think in general,

48
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:58,903
[SPEAKER_02]: is that all members of the committee spend some time thinking about the same exact evaluation.

49
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:10,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We all do our own individual evaluation and then we roll up and consolidate each of the seven individual evaluations into one cohesive evaluation.

50
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:10,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So

51
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:23,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the important thing to note is that the individual evaluations certainly are available to the superintendent, but they are relatively meaningless in the big scheme of what evaluation it is that goes to Desi.

52
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:31,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have done is work to take seven and become one, and we'll talk about that as we go through tonight.

53
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:53,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other important thing to note is that as we do that, what we have done is try to take a pretty careful and planned approach to representing a bunch of differing views on the various components of the evaluation, as well as represent and be clear and transparent about

54
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,755
[SPEAKER_02]: how those individual scores affected the ultimate recommendation.

55
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:05,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as we, as we progress through the form, it'll look the same as what you all saw when you did your individual evaluations.

56
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:17,510
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, Sharon did, member Hayes did go in and put the distribution of scores across each of the rankings so you can see sort of where the committee was at in total.

57
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the comments are left somewhat

58
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:41,823
[SPEAKER_02]: intact so we we opted to represent the comments made by the committee so that we could represent a full picture because we didn't all agree on everything all the time and we felt like the comments were substantive and thoughtful and we wanted to make sure that they were provided to the superintendent.

59
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:45,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ultimately at the end of this, we'll need to take a vote.

60
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:47,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the committee of the whole, right?

61
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will need to take a vote on committee of the whole, and then we will need to take a vote next week in our regular school committee meeting to approve the evaluation.

62
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:59,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those final composite scores get submitted to DESE.

63
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:03,066
[SPEAKER_02]: The comments and all of that really don't go to DESE.

64
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:04,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just that composite score.

65
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:10,909
[SPEAKER_02]: But the conversation that we'll have tonight is really about the superintendent's performance over the course of the school year.

66
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,146
[SPEAKER_02]: from our perspective and from our purview.

67
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:20,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And the goal is for us to all agree on a single evaluation that represents the view of quote, the committee.

68
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that help everyone set the stage and the frame?

69
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:25,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

70
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

71
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:31,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a copy to pull up that we could all take a look at?

72
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing is going to do that in a minute.

73
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

74
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can see here is Desi's suggested template, and we each filled out one that looks exactly like this.

75
00:11:54,663 --> 00:12:01,665
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we have done here is make a consolidated one that will represent ultimately the review of the committee.

76
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:09,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll just go step-by-step through this form, and I'll stop at the end of each section and we can talk, discuss,

77
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:13,222
[SPEAKER_02]: make updates, field questions, and that kind of thing as we go.

78
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:17,947
[SPEAKER_02]: But in step one, we are talking about assessment towards goals.

79
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:22,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a reminder, the superintendent presented a series of goals to us back in the fall.

80
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:24,253
[SPEAKER_02]: We unanimously approved them.

81
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three categories, professional practice goal, a student learning goal, and a district improvement goal.

82
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:40,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So for each of those goals, DESE requires that we, or recommends that we evaluate the superintendent on a five point scale.

83
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:42,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So from did not meet to exceeded.

84
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:54,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can see here across each of the lines is what the distribution of rankings was across the seven members.

85
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see each one adds up to seven,

86
00:12:57,697 --> 00:13:12,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And for example, in the professional practice goal, one person thought significant progress had been made, five thought that the superintendent had met her goal, and one thought that she had exceeded the goal.

87
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,735
[SPEAKER_02]: In this particular category, step one, which is the particular goals that we approved unanimously,

88
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:26,927
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the recommendation of the evaluation subcommittee that MET be submitted for each of these three goals.

89
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:36,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can see is that the majority of folks did suggest that MET was the right qualifier for them.

90
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:47,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think in places where there was some variability, we still recommend that MET be the school committee ranking for these three goals.

91
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,965
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the distribution of the ones that were not strictly met.

92
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:58,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions about the items in step one?

93
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:02,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rossell?

94
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:13,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I just for anybody watching I just think it's important to highlight that there's goals and then standards and that they're different things and Jesse has been changing that over the years.

95
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:22,614
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for instance, there are five categories of performance on the top section and there's only four in the bottom.

96
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,317
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe someday, they'll.

97
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:30,503
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll bring it all together so that it's not weird like that.

98
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:34,225
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just think that's an important distinction is that they're different things.

99
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:35,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

100
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:39,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

101
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:46,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions or comments about or objections on the first component?

102
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:47,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Step one?

103
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:53,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if you can scroll down a little bit, Dr. Cushing, that's perfect.

104
00:14:54,304 --> 00:15:04,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So step two, we'll talk about this at the composite level, and then we'll get into a little bit of detail, particularly as we look at the comments.

105
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:10,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So, essentially, this is what this is the level of information that gets provided to Desi about the superintendent's evaluation.

106
00:15:11,063 --> 00:15:15,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as member Rousseau was saying, there are goals and there are standards.

107
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,108
[SPEAKER_02]: They are different.

108
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:21,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Goals are something that are established uniquely here in Medford.

109
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:28,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Standards are a series of attributes that Desi has established are important for superintendents to

110
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:37,154
[SPEAKER_02]: to have and to exhibit as they complete their role on a year to year basis.

111
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So those standards fall into four categories.

112
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:50,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So standard number one is instructional leadership, standard number two is management and operations, standard number three is family and community engagement, and then standard four is professional culture.

113
00:15:51,804 --> 00:16:05,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the scale changes here a little bit so we had a five point scale and step one, and as member so said maybe someday we'll have the same kind of scale and in both places but in this in this section and then really for the rest of the review.

114
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:12,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we will see a four point scale unsatisfactory needs improvement proficient and exemplary.

115
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:30,259
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get to the comments, what will be important to remember as we talk about comments is that members are required to provide comments if they provide a ranking other than proficient, but if they are evaluating the superintendent as proficient, there is no requirement for comments.

116
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:41,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, what you can see is under instructional leadership, we unanimously agreed that proficient was the appropriate rank, the appropriate evaluation decision.

117
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:47,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Under management and operations, we had two members who said needs improvements, five who said proficient.

118
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:53,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Under family and community engagement, we had one that said needs improvement and six that said proficient.

119
00:16:54,401 --> 00:17:00,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And then under standard four, professional culture, we had one that said needs improvement and six that said proficient.

120
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:08,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was the recommendation of the evaluation subcommittee that proficient be submitted to DESE on behalf of each of these four standards.

121
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions about step two?

122
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:12,312
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

123
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:15,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

124
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:23,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in step three, we roll all of those things up together into one single number.

125
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still on a four-point scale here.

126
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:41,277
[SPEAKER_02]: but the overall summative performance based on the rankings and the evaluations in step one and step two, all seven of us unanimously agreed that Proficient was the appropriate aggregated summative performance recommendation.

127
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:55,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So in step three, we would plan to submit Proficient to the, to DESE on behalf of the committee if we take this ultimately to a majority vote.

128
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:57,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions about step three.

129
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:04,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

130
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,436
[SPEAKER_02]: In step four, there's some.

131
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,001
[SPEAKER_02]: comments that pertain to the overall evaluation.

132
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:23,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these comments, as you can see, came from various members and the committee had some conversation around, should we be trying to compress these into one narrative?

133
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:26,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it important for them to sort of stand alone?

134
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:31,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, as a group, unanimously agreed that it was important for them to stand alone.

135
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:32,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They do represent

136
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:58,854
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly, you know, different points of view and different takes on the same thing and I think that's the thing about any evaluation is that as objective as you try to be, there's still a very subjective part to somebody's performance evaluation and I think all of these comments, you know, in in the big scheme of things are intended to both compliment the superintendent on the things that she did well and also point out the places where we would like to see

137
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:04,218
[SPEAKER_02]: continued growth on the part of the superintendent as it relates to certain things.

138
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:09,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think I'll give you all a minute to read through this provided you can all see the screen.

139
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:11,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Can everyone see the screen?

140
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:12,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

141
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if everyone just wants to take a minute and read through, I think that probably is a good way to move through what are some media comments here.

142
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Has everybody had a chance to read or should I wait another minute?

143
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:28,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

144
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:28,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Um any

145
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:42,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you scroll down, what happens next in this form is

146
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:50,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as you fill it out for practical matters, you actually fill it out sort of in the reverse.

147
00:20:51,208 --> 00:21:02,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we've covered all of this section, so this is just a summary of exactly what we talked about, the three district goals at the top here that you saw up above.

148
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:13,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just provides a little bit more information about what those goals were, which is really a very short summary of an otherwise pretty in-depth set of information about what those goals were.

149
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,201
[SPEAKER_02]: The student learning goal was early literacy.

150
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:26,526
[SPEAKER_02]: The professional practice goal was leading now sessions with MASS on race, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

151
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,266
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called ready sessions.

152
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:34,309
[SPEAKER_02]: District improvement goal number one was maintaining a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity, and consistency.

153
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,851
[SPEAKER_02]: District goal number two is creating a culture that values consistent communication.

154
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:44,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And district improvement goal number three was creating structures that promote healthy transportation to school.

155
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:52,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see here, again, the distribution all sort of coalesces around MET.

156
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:58,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sorry, we're back to five categories here, just to make things very clear.

157
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:08,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're back to five categories from did not meet to exceed, but the committee did coalesce again around that MET score for these schools.

158
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:14,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make one comment about this section that I noticed earlier?

159
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:22,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Under district improvement goal number two, there are only six ratings listed.

160
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I think an early version, one person had not sent me their rating for that.

161
00:22:27,783 --> 00:22:29,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will correct that in the final draft.

162
00:22:29,844 --> 00:22:30,904
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the first draft.

163
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:40,919
[SPEAKER_01]: three significant progress and one met under, I mean, and four met, three significant progress, four met under district improvement goal number two.

164
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

165
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:46,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, can you scroll down?

166
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:55,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this next section is where we go back to our standards.

167
00:22:55,816 --> 00:23:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And in each standard, we have a series of options that are presented to us, and they would, I think, represent what we would consider to be the whole job under this particular standard.

168
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:29,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Um but what the what DESE encourages school committees to do is to pick one or two focused indicators um and base the entire evaluation of this component around those one or two or maybe possibly three um focused indicators.

169
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:32,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So the our focused indicators are highlighted in yellow.

170
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,679
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the only things that this committee um

171
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:44,256
[SPEAKER_02]: did evaluate the superintendent based on, so her composite score for instructional leadership is based on two things.

172
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:58,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1B, which is ensures that practices in all settings reflect high expectations regarding content and quality of effort and work, engage all students, and are personalized to accommodate diverse learning styles, needs, interests, and levels of readiness.

173
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:20,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I-3, sorry, I-E, is data-informed decision-making, uses multiple sources of evidence, including related to student learning, including state, district, and school assessment results and growth data to inform school and district goals and improve organizational performance, educator effectiveness, and student learning.

174
00:24:21,104 --> 00:24:28,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were the two goals that we met and unanimously agreed were the things that most closely aligned to the goals that we had set out for the year.

175
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:35,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the scores there pretty unanimously proficient is the the ranking and evaluation there.

176
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:40,877
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some comments here that are specific to instructional leadership.

177
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:45,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are three comments here, or actually, I'm sorry, two comments here.

178
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:47,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give you all a minute to read those.

179
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:14,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Is everybody okay if I move forward?

180
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:20,699
[SPEAKER_02]: If you scroll down standard number two is management and operations.

181
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:36,169
[SPEAKER_02]: We selected one focus indicator here it was environment, which is develops and executes effective plans procedures routines and operational systems to address the full range of safety, health, emotional and social needs, and the committee.

182
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:43,749
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately rated this entire section five people saying met two people saying needs improvement.

183
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:51,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you can scroll down a little bit more Dr. Cushing, there's a series of comments there that I will pause for you all to read.

184
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Rousseau, could we scroll up actually?

185
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:10,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confused how somebody would say on the only focus indicator that somebody needs improvement and then say that they were proficient.

186
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:13,030
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one thing you can grade the person on.

187
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:28,443
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you had one class and you got a B, your GPA is a B. So I'm confused how somebody, I mean, the outcome is the same, but I don't understand how you can,

188
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,182
[SPEAKER_00]: you have one thing you're measuring, and then when you average your one thing you're measuring, you get a better score.

189
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:38,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

190
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:40,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

191
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

192
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:43,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

193
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might be better understood if you read the different ratings for the needs improvement versus proficient back up at the top.

194
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a little bit of

195
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:03,340
[SPEAKER_04]: abstract or needs improvement, needs improvement.

196
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:15,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can go back up to the top and look at what those needs improvement and proficient, actually how they're defined.

197
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:23,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, right there.

198
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:26,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So needs improvement.

199
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:27,209
[SPEAKER_04]: May I, Max?

200
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:28,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

201
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:38,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Performance on a standard or overall is below the requirements of a standard or overall, but is not considered to be unsatisfactory at the time improvement is necessary and expected.

202
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:43,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Proficient practice is understood to be fully satisfactory.

203
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:47,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess, yeah, I can see where the conflict is there.

204
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:51,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, yeah, I guess, yeah, one has to be needs improvement.

205
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:54,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Proficient has to be actually fully satisfactory.

206
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So it does say fully.

207
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:57,192
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not ambiguity.

208
00:27:58,362 --> 00:27:58,883
[SPEAKER_05]: or proficient.

209
00:27:59,083 --> 00:27:59,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

210
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:02,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have to look at the ratings.

211
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:04,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for pointing that out.

212
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:11,314
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll review that between now and the next meeting before it's reviewed to the committee.

213
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:22,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And I might also just add, I wanted to, if I could Mayor, say thank you to the subcommittee, which was member Graham, member Hayes and myself for the multiple meetings that this took to put this together.

214
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:23,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all.

215
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:26,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

216
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:27,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can take a look at that.

217
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:33,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And before the final is presented just to clean up that conflict, but good catch.

218
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not notice that the other day when we were going through this.

219
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:40,094
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dr. Cushing, can you scroll down and let everyone read the comments there?

220
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:41,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

221
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:05,479
Silence.

222
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:05,639
Silence.

223
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:49,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any questions about this section?

224
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:50,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor?

225
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:51,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau?

226
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:52,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

227
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:58,394
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to point out that the thing we were just talking about about the discrepancy is actually my review.

228
00:30:00,035 --> 00:30:05,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are two different places where you provide your summary of the count.

229
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:09,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the bottom one, which we were just looking at, I actually had said

230
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:26,793
[SPEAKER_00]: needs improvement, but at the very, very top of the document is actually another place where you're yet again transcribe the same information so that error was mine so I wanted to own that and we now know how to fix that because it's not a mystery.

231
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:31,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I would blame the people that required into the same data multiple times.

232
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:33,480
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to.

233
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:39,704
[SPEAKER_00]: make a I don't know if we need a motion, but my comments that were so this is a PDF.

234
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:49,010
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, this document, I swear, sometimes I feel like nobody uses a document before they send it out to 351 communities.

235
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:59,236
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you click into the document to put comments and then click out of the box, anything too big just disappears off the bottom of the page.

236
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:00,317
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't even see it.

237
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:01,578
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a

238
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:07,871
[SPEAKER_00]: not a well-designed piece of, not a well-designed tool.

239
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:19,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So my comments have been compressed to try and fit them into here, but I wanted to just have a request that my original comments that I sent actually be replacing, that they replace this.

240
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:23,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And my comments, for the most part, are the same.

241
00:31:23,406 --> 00:31:26,409
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some compression of like the structure of my comments.

242
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:35,494
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing new, but I just felt like this doesn't flow as what I actually wrote for comments the way I originally did.

243
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:40,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly understand the need to figure out how to fit it into this PDF.

244
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,499
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only change I'd like to make to this.

245
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless there's an objection.

246
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:50,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to amend?

247
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:53,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to amend.

248
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:53,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

249
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:57,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to amend by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

250
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:58,843
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

251
00:31:59,324 --> 00:31:59,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

252
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:00,865
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

253
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:02,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Ayes have it.

254
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:04,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hayes?

255
00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:06,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to comment.

256
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:09,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to thank Member Rousseau for kind of giving me a heads up about this.

257
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm working on getting a second page.

258
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:17,415
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens, or at least, it worked differently apparently in different browsers.

259
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:22,198
[SPEAKER_01]: The font size got too small with yours.

260
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:24,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It fit, but it was too small to be legible.

261
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:27,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working on making a second page to have your comments on.

262
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:29,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.

263
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you member Hayes.

264
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for doing this and to the committee as well.

265
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

266
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:38,504
[SPEAKER_02]: On to standard number three, which is family and community engagement.

267
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:48,587
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, we elected for three focus indicators under family and community engagement.

268
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:57,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first is actively ensures that all families are welcome members of the classroom and school community and can contribute to the effectiveness of the classroom school district and community.

269
00:32:57,973 --> 00:33:06,058
[SPEAKER_02]: The second is continuously collaborates with families and community stakeholders to support student learning and development at home school and in the community.

270
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:16,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third is engages in regular two-way culturally proficient communication with family and community stakeholders about student learning and performance.

271
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:31,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, here, the committee is recommending, as we talked about in step two earlier, that MET is the metric that is submitted for the standard number three family and community engagement based on these scores.

272
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:37,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Dr. Cushing, if you can scroll down just a little bit so that people can see those comments, that would be great.

273
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a minute to read those.

274
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:31,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody have any questions or need more time?

275
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:45,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's move on to standard for professional culture commitment to high standards was the first focus indicator that we chose.

276
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:52,101
[SPEAKER_02]: fosters a shared commitment to high standards of service teaching and learning with high expectations and achievements for all.

277
00:34:53,522 --> 00:35:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee, the committee unanimously said that the second focus indicator cultural proficiency was also important to us to share ensures that policies and practices enable staff members and students to interact effectively in a culturally diverse environment in which students backgrounds identities strengths and challenges are respected.

278
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:23,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third component was managing conflict, employee strategies for responding to disagreement and dissent, constructively resolving conflict and building consensus throughout the district or school community.

279
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:36,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And again here, the consensus among the evaluation subcommittee and the committee at large was that the overall rating here was a six.

280
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:47,795
[SPEAKER_02]: six, four, sorry, six, four met and one, four needs improvement and you can see the individual standards throughout and what those scores are.

281
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:57,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctor Cushing, if you could scroll down, there's a series of comments about about this standard number four professional culture as well.

282
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:02,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It is tiny.

283
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, this one got pretty

284
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:13,266
Thank you.

285
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:44,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any questions about the comments here?

286
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:51,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that is the entire review.

287
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:57,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I will turn it back over to the mayor.

288
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:01,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's additional discussion or a motion.

289
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:05,825
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all reviewed the full report.

290
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for either discussion or a motion for approval of acceptance.

291
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:11,990
[SPEAKER_06]: We already motioned to amend

292
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:15,035
[SPEAKER_06]: per member Rousseau.

293
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:17,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll take a motion on the floor unless there's questions.

294
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:19,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Kratz?

295
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:23,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I just wanted to thank the subcommittee for all the hard work on putting this together.

296
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:39,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how much time you spent on it, and I appreciate I had many text messages going back and forth to Sharon, because I was working with a different browser, so I understand, and I figured out a way to, like, cut, I guess, copy and paste my comments in and then print it.

297
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:43,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't, you know, I couldn't save it, but that I figured it out.

298
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:44,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, okay, let me do that.

299
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:45,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I brought it in here.

300
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:46,738
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate it.

301
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:49,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know she was there for me.

302
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent her many, many messages.

303
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:51,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Sharon.

304
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:54,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you all for all your hard work.

305
00:37:54,062 --> 00:37:56,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how many meetings you had and appreciate it.

306
00:37:56,444 --> 00:38:02,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this time around, it was much smoother and I think it went very well.

307
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:06,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was, we all got to participate and, you know, it was

308
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:09,696
[SPEAKER_07]: the instructions you did were excellent and easy to follow.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want to reiterate member, member Kratz, um, you had six or seven meetings just to get to the place we're at today and tonight proved that it was well worth it.

313
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks for all your efforts.

314
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,481
[SPEAKER_06]: They're emotional.

315
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,061
