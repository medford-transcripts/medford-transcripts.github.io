1
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:42,115
The secretary will call the roll.

2
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:45,296
Mrs. DeVita, present.

3
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:46,897
Mrs. Kretzmann, here.

4
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:47,958
Mrs. McStone, here.

5
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:50,779
Mrs. Ritchie, here.

6
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,920
Mr. Russo, present.

7
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,901
Mrs. Hinton, present.

8
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,221
Mayor Burke, present.

9
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,482
Seven present, none absent.

10
00:08:56,642 --> 00:08:59,924
Also in attendance is Jasper Sue, our school committee representative.

11
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:01,825
All please rise and salute our flag.

12
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:08,388
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for

13
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:14,859
and justice for all.

14
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,580
Approval of the minutes of October 15, 2018.

15
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,703
There's a motion on the floor for approval of Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

16
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:25,543
All those in favor?

17
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:25,643
Aye.

18
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:27,364
All those opposed?

19
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:28,425
Motion passes.

20
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,106
Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

21
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:32,406
Mr. Benedetto.

22
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,807
I just had a couple questions.

23
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,467
It's probably very easily explained.

24
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:54,439
On page 7 of 8, it says three quarters of the way down, I'd say, right above the vocational automotive supplies is SPED pro-development expenses.

25
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:58,162
Did they come in?

26
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,243
Did we send people out?

27
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:03,847
I was just curious what we were doing for professional development for the special education department.

28
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:18,856
Okay, I'll just send an email to them.

29
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:20,857
And I had one more question since you're here.

30
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:25,119
It was on page 5 of 8 and the bottom of 4 of 8.

31
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:57,502
Riddell All-American Athletic Officials, the total looks like about $9,000, and I was just wondering, I know it looks like a company, but it just seems like a lot of money for athletic officials, and it might be like five different sports or, I don't know, I just saw a lot of athletic officials individually paid, which I know we hire

32
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:04,266
individual people, but when I saw this large amount, $3,027.40, and then $5,596.39, and a $416.37 together, it's about $9,000.

33
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:04,826
I was just wondering,

34
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,591
if you knew a little bit more about that.

35
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,812
It seemed like a lot of money.

36
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:19,473
Sure.

37
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:24,397
So again, the description is not always indicative of the exact expense.

38
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:32,263
The account code itself has directly in the middle the 0400, which identifies it as a contracted service.

39
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:39,308
So Riddell All-American is a contracted service provider under athletics.

40
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,689
So they may be doing

41
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:52,494
shoulder pad renovations, the helmet, instead of buying all new helmets, they can have them refurbished, things of that nature.

42
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:59,417
So again, the exact identifier of this particular invoice, I would have to go back and look that up for you.

43
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:04,438
Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

44
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,479
Offered by Ms.

45
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,620
McStone, seconded by Ms.

46
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,061
Kretz, roll call vote please.

47
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,096
Yes.

48
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:20,737
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

49
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:21,677
The motion passes.

50
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,798
Approval of payrolls.

51
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,541
Motion for approval by Ms.

52
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,222
Van de Kloet, seconded by Ms.

53
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:28,883
Mustone.

54
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:30,444
Roll call vote, please.

55
00:12:30,464 --> 00:12:31,605
Mr. Van de Kloet.

56
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:32,365
Yes.

57
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:34,427
Ms.

58
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,368
Mustone.

59
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:35,488
Yes.

60
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:36,328
Mr. Otero.

61
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:36,508
Yes.

62
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:36,729
Ms.

63
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:37,029
DeWolfson.

64
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:37,349
Yes.

65
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:37,769
Ms.

66
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,590
Van de Kloet.

67
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:38,690
Yes.

68
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,830
Ms.

69
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:39,851
Van de Kloet.

70
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:40,251
Yes.

71
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,672
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

72
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:42,493
Motion passes.

73
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,514
Report of secretary.

74
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:43,574
Ms.

75
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:45,855
Van de Kloet.

76
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:45,955
Amen.

77
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:46,556
Thank you.

78
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,637
Report of committees.

79
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:48,984
None.

80
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,605
Community participation?

81
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:54,225
None.

82
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,486
Report of the Superintendent.

83
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,927
Item 1, report on Andrews Middle School and Brooks Elementary School students.

84
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:02,488
Miss, Madam Superintendent.

85
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:11,350
Prior to that, I just wanted to make a few brief statements to talk about things that have happened in the district these past

86
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,191
two weeks since we haven't met.

87
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,993
We've had a lot of exciting activities.

88
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:27,178
Our DA, Marion Ryan, came to the high school and presented the Cut It Out program and she spoke with both our cosmetology

89
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:39,930
and health assistance students and it teaches them about their future work roles and how to notice symptoms of domestic violence and how to refer clients to get help.

90
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,834
So that was a wonderful training that did take place at the vocational school.

91
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:50,177
In addition to that, our garden club did host a harvest party.

92
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:57,139
We, as a school committee, had a wonderful retreat, and I'm looking forward to our next session.

93
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,381
I continue to work with my mentor, Carla Bear.

94
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:12,365
I had the pleasure of attending the State of the City Luncheon that took place for Mayor Burke, and that was a wonderful opportunity to be with other

95
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,546
department heads from the city.

96
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:25,168
The McGlynn School hosted an ethnic pride week where students really were able to celebrate all of their cultures.

97
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:29,069
And it culminated with a wonderful fashion show.

98
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,990
And I did get to see school committee member Kretz there as well.

99
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:42,212
And the students were really excited about demonstrating their pride from where they attended.

100
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:54,974
I also had the opportunity to attend Chief Sacco's retirement, which was a wonderful tribute and honor to his many, many years of service to Medford.

101
00:14:56,394 --> 00:15:01,375
And on the instructional front, I'm continuing to conduct instructional rounds.

102
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:11,417
I had the pleasure of walking with Charlene Douglas, who is the MTA president, and we were able to go and look at instruction at both the Brooks

103
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:19,483
and the McGlynn schools last week, so we are continuing to look at instruction and build a collaborative partnership.

104
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:24,367
So there were many, many positive things that happened.

105
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:32,093
The Roberts playground, we had a wonderful ribbon cutting, and I hope for our next school committee meeting to be able to show

106
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:38,019
a short video clip showing the many stages that the playground went through.

107
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:43,745
And so I want to just thank again the CPC, the Roberts Community PTO.

108
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:47,789
I want to thank all the members that worked collaboratively together.

109
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:52,494
I want to thank Cheryl Rodriguez for being a strong parent advocate.

110
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:55,357
And the schoolyard came out beautifully.

111
00:15:56,077 --> 00:16:05,765
And so I'm so happy to see that again another collaborative effort producing a beautiful play surface for all students to be able to enjoy.

112
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:17,976
The last piece that I did want to mention was that last week we did have an empty bullet casing that was located on the field of the high school.

113
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:28,124
and that a concerned citizen did turn it over to our school officer, Officer Mazeka, and that the appropriate steps were followed.

114
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:29,746
Police were notified.

115
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,307
They investigated.

116
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:41,415
We communicated to families that evening, and the following day, we had nine police officers

117
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:46,301
walked the field with metal detectors.

118
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:53,710
Then they came into the high school and they continued to search the different floors, the high traffic areas.

119
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:59,817
And we had a canine, a dog, come into the school building.

120
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:00,678
Three dogs.

121
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,080
to three dogs in the end.

122
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:14,630
We had one dog from Cambridge, one from the state police, and our Medford police dog to search the property and go back and look at the field.

123
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,972
And so nothing else was found.

124
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:23,038
I want to just thank Chief Sacco and all the police officers who worked collaboratively to

125
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:28,801
keep Medford safe and that it truly is a priority.

126
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,922
So those are the things that I wanted to report out and I was very pleased with that outcome.

127
00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:34,702
Thank you.

128
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,103
Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

129
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:37,023
Mr. Ruggiero.

130
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,645
I just had a quick question about the spent ammunition that you found on the field.

131
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:48,307
Was the caliber the same caliber or a different caliber of bullet that was from the prior incident?

132
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:54,873
It was a 9mm just, not to say just, but it was one single empty bullet.

133
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,335
Was the prior bullet a 9mm?

134
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:57,696
That was a cartridge.

135
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,677
That was a cartridge.

136
00:17:58,697 --> 00:17:59,298
Much different.

137
00:17:59,618 --> 00:17:59,918
Thank you.

138
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,662
Are there any other questions?

139
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,584
The motion to accept the superintendent's report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

140
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:09,884
Kretz.

141
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:10,585
All those in favor?

142
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:10,665
Aye.

143
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,166
All those opposed?

144
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:13,047
Motion granted.

145
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:17,531
Item 1, report on Andrews Middle School and Brooks Elementary School students.

146
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:18,171
Ms.

147
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:18,612
Caldwell.

148
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:20,413
Good evening everyone.

149
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:29,721
So every once in a while we have meetings where I feel it's wonderful to celebrate our young kids and tonight is one of those meetings.

150
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:36,263
We have three students with us, or I think we only have two this evening, that I'd like to tell you a little bit about.

151
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:45,885
One is an Andrews Middle School student, and the Andrews Middle School stands for core values such as excellence through responsibility and respect.

152
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:56,408
And we have one student from the Brooks School that is committed to nurturing collaboration, imagination, creative and creative problem solving.

153
00:18:57,228 --> 00:19:05,210
So with these students, let me tell you a little bit about what Orlando and his sisters Delilah and Isabella have done.

154
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:16,394
During this past summer, they collected money for donations for gift cards and were able to pack 90 backpacks for the Andrews Middle School.

155
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,334
Wonderful.

156
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:28,428
filled with materials and supplies that could probably last the whole year for these students over at the Andrews.

157
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:33,710
And at the Brooks Elementary School, there were 11 backpacks.

158
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,271
So I'd like to call these students up with their principals.

159
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:45,933
And Mr. Downs, the Andrews Middle School principal, said that his student wrote some inspirational notes that he put inside the backpacks.

160
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,594
And I've asked him to see if he would read a few for us.

161
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,235
So Mr. Downs and Ms.

162
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,258
Galussi with us from the Brooks Elementary School, please come up.

163
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,482
And our students, Orlando and Isabella.

164
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:05,610
Come on in.

165
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,271
On either side of you.

166
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,081
Good evening.

167
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:11,282
I'm sorry.

168
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,122
Welcome, everyone.

169
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:16,963
Thank you for having me this evening with my student Orlando and his sister here.

170
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:23,965
It's always great news to have students provide other students with things that they may not normally be able to provide through their own means.

171
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:28,807
So again, these two students exemplify our core values at the Andrews School.

172
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:34,068
So there are just some notes that I want to share with you, because good news is always nice to have.

173
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:35,428
And so here's some of the notes.

174
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,509
You can be anything you want.

175
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:39,840
You can do anything.

176
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,803
You are such a great friend.

177
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:43,966
You are so amazing.

178
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:50,836
But the one that I really liked, and it was probably my favorite one that I read, was, be kind, be great, and be you.

179
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:52,879
So those are just some of the quotes.

180
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,046
So thank you very much, everyone.

181
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,909
And I'll stay here, or do you want me?

182
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:03,369
Yeah.

183
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,294
Well, we have a few citations for Orlando and his sister, Isabella.

184
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:08,495
Wonderful.

185
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:09,396
Would you like to come up?

186
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:31,806
I'm going to read this, OK?

187
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:41,769
It's a certificate of appreciation the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Orlando Putnam Bagley for his dedication to the students of Medford.

188
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:55,013
By myself, Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke, Chairman Mia Mastone, Vice Chair Erin DiBenedetto, Kathy Kretz, Secretary Maryse Edward-Vincent, our Superintendent Michael Ruggiero, Paul Russo, and Paulette Van de Kloop.

189
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,002
And likewise, we have one for Isabella and her sister Delilah for your dedication to this wonderful effort.

190
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:11,804
You guys did an amazing job and we're so proud of you.

191
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:28,674
Okay, so make sure you give this to your sister.

192
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:29,914
Give her a hug.

193
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:30,335
Oh, sure.

194
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:31,015
Yeah, come on up.

195
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:59,316
So, yeah, I'm Orlando and over the summer I was doing a project for the NJHS and we decided to do a project with Operation Be Kind where we would pack school supplies for underprivileged children and bring them to the school so they could have supplies because, you know,

196
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:07,586
The core thing we were trying to say was that it's important for children to have the tools they need to succeed in school.

197
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,606
And we wanted to support that.

198
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,808
So they mailed us 100 Operation Be Kind bags.

199
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:22,211
And we got gift certificates from Target and Costco.

200
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:26,213
And we bought lots of school supplies.

201
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:30,516
And we filled each bag with notebooks and pencils.

202
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:38,319
And we also wrote nice messages on cards and put one card in each bag.

203
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:43,122
And we brought 11 bags to the Brooks Elementary School and the Andrews Middle School.

204
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:47,044
And it was pretty successful.

205
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:49,325
Wonderful.

206
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,957
So I don't know if Orlando has got to meet some of the CCSR students that are in the audience.

207
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:05,760
And that's the whole mission, is being kind, being global citizens.

208
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,681
So Orlando certainly replicates that at the middle school level.

209
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:24,291
Did you tell him you did something?

210
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:24,391
Yeah.

211
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:24,651
Does he know?

212
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:47,298
Is there a motion to accept that report and place it on file?

213
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:48,959
So moved by Ms.

214
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,360
Vandeclude, seconded by Ms.

215
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:50,821
Mustone.

216
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:51,501
All those in favor?

217
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:51,581
Aye.

218
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:52,762
All those opposed?

219
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:53,543
Motion passes.

220
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:58,467
Report on the Mass Jazz Symposium.

221
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:01,910
Medford High School senior, Chewbacca Durali.

222
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,091
I hope I said that right.

223
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:04,252
Chewbacca.

224
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:05,053
Chewbacca.

225
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,435
By Dr. Sue Betcha.

226
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,828
Say it right, no?

227
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:15,773
Yes, so Rocco Sieri, our director of science, is going to present the award.

228
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:16,394
Thank you.

229
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:19,297
Good evening, everyone.

230
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:28,465
And dad, and sister, come on up.

231
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:32,909
So, Subbasha is a senior this year at Medford High School.

232
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:43,201
on the optical monitoring of muscle hemodynamics in humans after exercise.

233
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:49,984
And I have to take breaths through the names, like I always do for the science fair projects, because they have these complex names.

234
00:25:50,925 --> 00:26:00,730
But I am going to let Subhash tell you a little bit about why she chose that project and what it meant in layman's terms.

235
00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:06,411
Once she presents that project, she received the first prize at the state fair.

236
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:14,674
And then, in the fall, they have a symposium where students present their projects at MIT to a panel.

237
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:19,116
And at that particular event, Subhashra placed second.

238
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:29,320
And she is now invited to go to the AAAS meeting, the American Academy of

239
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,042
Sciences, I believe.

240
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,505
Advancement of Science.

241
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:36,307
I knew I missed a letter there.

242
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:44,255
Which happens to be the national organization where probably all of the premier scientists in this country participate.

243
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:46,258
And it's a national conference.

244
00:26:49,656 --> 00:27:07,521
By participating, she'll have her abstract printed, she'll present there, and then probably interact with many students, but also many scientists, where her work will be shared out.

245
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:14,788
So I'm extremely proud of what she's been able to do and what she accomplished.

246
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,652
She is a delight.

247
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:24,481
So it's always a privilege to have students that are able to balance

248
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:37,008
They're sort of the two pieces of communicating and being passionate and the scientific know-how of how to do a project.

249
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:38,988
So it's a real honor.

250
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,711
As you know, in the report I did state that there was a cost to the

251
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:51,381
to attend, just informing that it might be even higher than what the cost is.

252
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:58,332
We're kind of opening it up to find a way, a creative way, to get her there.

253
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:19,665
There were two previous students that participated but I'm not sure that they, I was under the impression that those were under a grant at that time that paid for the participation whereas the grant no longer exists for these students so we have to find a way to be a bit more creative to get her there because I think it's a really

254
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:22,128
extraordinary opportunity.

255
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:34,627
The two students that did participate before are scientists in their own right currently doing some fine work and so I know that the path for her is well tread and it's a good one.

256
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:37,629
I'll betcha we want to congratulate you.

257
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:39,149
What an amazing accomplishment.

258
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,390
And I believe I saw you last year at the science fair.

259
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,972
I think a few of us may have witnessed your project and we were floored by some of the work you did.

260
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:53,734
And I just wanted you to know, I did reach out to a corporation just this morning and I'm waiting to hear back from the president by Wednesday.

261
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:57,215
So possibly we might have something in the works to cover it.

262
00:28:57,255 --> 00:29:00,636
And I'm sure if not, we will figure out a way to get you there.

263
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:02,197
Mr. Benedetto.

264
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:21,087
Of course, we would love to receive that corporate sponsor, but if not, I would like to make a motion on the floor to cover the expenses since she'll be representing MEDFED in a way that is so important for our community that there's a motion on the floor to cover the cost.

265
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:25,291
It wouldn't be the first time that this committee has allocated funds in this way.

266
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:35,015
So I'd like to make the motion that if corporate sponsorship does not come through, that we pay the full cost for her.

267
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:35,838
Ms.

268
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:36,238
Van de Kloot.

269
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,200
Yes, Mayor Burke, I commend you for already reaching out.

270
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,583
And if that does come through, that's great, but I'll second my colleague's motion.

271
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:53,630
It's not been unusual for us at all when we have outstanding students to support them and to let them be able to represent us with great pride.

272
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,033
So we want to make sure you get to go no matter what.

273
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:08,228
And before I call the roll, I'd like to invite Subbatcha up so that she could accept this commendation from the Medford School Committee.

274
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:33,468
Certificate of Achievement, the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Subbacha Durali for her second place finish at the Mass JS Symposium.

275
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:40,390
And it's offered by all of us here at the school committee, including our superintendent, on an amazing accomplishment.

276
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,950
So we're very, very proud of you.

277
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,931
Congratulations.

278
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:49,733
Thank you.

279
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:50,493
Thank you.

280
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:51,113
Thank you.

281
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:10,478
Do I use the mic?

282
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:12,819
You don't even have to use the talk mic.

283
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:20,902
So my project for Science Fair last year was inspired by a trip actually to my home country, which is Nepal.

284
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:22,202
I was actually born there.

285
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:30,145
And after the 2015 earthquake, I learned about all of the medical implications that my grandparents had to go through because of their diabetes.

286
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:37,407
They had to pay so much more cost to get pills, just insufficient amounts of pills weekly.

287
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:44,492
to just have basic medication so that they wouldn't experience pain when sitting up or when laying down.

288
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:47,714
And this inspired me to try to do something scientific.

289
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:54,980
I had already done some science fair projects, but I wasn't really completely in love with them, if that makes sense.

290
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:06,188
So in 10th grade, I got to go to the Tufts University's biomedical and science program, Tubers, with Professor Fantini, and he allowed me

291
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:12,595
to use his resources to actually make a project of my own involving mirror infrared spectroscopy.

292
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:20,464
And through that I was able to kind of research on my own path to discover a protocol that would help to create

293
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:43,797
kind of like an early detection device or method that could allow for us in the population, not only in the United States, but globally, to detect onset disease of diabetes and something called peripheral arterial disease so that more people are able to change their lives, not only paying high amounts for medications, but just for themselves.

294
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:47,439
And if that's able to be done through a small device,

295
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:53,543
which anybody can use on their calf muscle, then they'll be able to get a second chance at life.

296
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:54,024
Wow.

297
00:32:54,404 --> 00:33:00,308
Thank you so much.

298
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:07,874
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.

299
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:08,334
Thank you.

300
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:24,777
Congratulations.

301
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:32,883
And on the motion, authored by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

302
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:40,488
Van de Kloot, that if funding is not secured privately, that the school committee, school department, will put up the necessary monies to advance her.

303
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:42,629
On that motion, roll call vote.

304
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,530
Madam Secretary.

305
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,531
Mr. Benedetto.

306
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:45,171
Yes.

307
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:46,112
Mrs. Grant.

308
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:46,332
Yes.

309
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:47,333
Mr. Owens.

310
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:47,553
Yes.

311
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:55,875
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

312
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:56,695
Motion passes.

313
00:33:57,055 --> 00:33:58,176
Congratulations again.

314
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,016
Wonderful job.

315
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:10,139
Report on the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, school year 17-18.

316
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,639
Mr. Trotter?

317
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,359
Mr. Trotter is the director

318
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:39,537
CCSR project, and in addition to that, after him, we will have Michael Skorker speaking, who's our program coordinator for CCSR, and we're gonna hear from four wonderful Medford High School students, and I want to say their names correctly, Sam Klugisch, Stephan Lungscher, Nicole Chin, and Tia Ballot.

319
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,638
So I look forward to hearing from everyone this evening.

320
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,220
Good evening.

321
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,962
Thank you very much for allowing us to come tonight.

322
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:57,709
At first I want to thank the superintendent and the mayor and the school committee for the continual support over the years for the CCSR.

323
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:04,094
And most of us say CCSR because it's a mouthful to say the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibilities.

324
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,376
But that's the real name.

325
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,259
But before I talk about the report, I want to make a couple of announcements.

326
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:17,882
One, we have a walk for veterans on Sunday, November 11th, starting in front of City Hall at 10 o'clock in the morning.

327
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:21,905
There's no fee involved, you can make a donation.

328
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:40,147
selling t-shirts and then there'll be a two and a half mile walk and then afterwards there's a reception at carol's restaurant on main street for free freshmen so i'd like to have that set here so people from tv home can watch it and also that you guys hopefully will come and participate

329
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:48,577
Also, I want to just respond to the fact that we got a contribution from the Boston Foundation for the Crystal Camel Betterment Project.

330
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,020
We're really excited about that.

331
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:59,930
That's $125,000 that will be in our possession to use in projects for Crystal's name over the years.

332
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:07,435
Most of it, the vast majority of it will be invested, and money will be taken out of the proceeds from that investment each year to do projects.

333
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:12,458
And so that's a very beneficial thing for not only CCSR, but for the community.

334
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,639
And so we're really pleased with that.

335
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,901
So now the report.

336
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:23,004
It's a long report, it's 104 pages long, so I thought I'd only read 65 of those.

337
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:27,787
No, actually it's here.

338
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:37,025
So, this is a report that we put together for last year's activities.

339
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:47,509
Michael and I were sitting down thinking about how much we had done last year, and we had no record of it, because it was such a comprehensive year, and we did so much, and the kids did so much, really, not us.

340
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,532
And so we wanted to have a record and pass it on to the school committee, and the community, so to show what

341
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:54,792
what students can do.

342
00:36:54,812 --> 00:37:01,734
If you give them enough help and support and allow them to be creative, they do amazing things.

343
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:03,674
And this is an example of it.

344
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:07,035
There are other examples like the students in Parkland, Florida.

345
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:11,196
But we're really pleased that our students are doing such positive things.

346
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,617
So in the report, there were a whole list of activities that were performed by students K-12.

347
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:20,538
The vast majority were the high school because we have this outstanding

348
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:25,160
person called Michael Skorka who does a fantastic job at the high school.

349
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:29,963
One of our goals this year is to create more Michael Skorkas if we can at the other schools.

350
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:34,106
And this year's crop of leaders, he's one of them too.

351
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:37,948
By the way, I want to recruit those two students from the Andrews.

352
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:46,013
So we do have some really good teachers who are involved this year at the other schools and we look forward to having a bigger program, a bigger report next year.

353
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:49,794
But with that being said, let's get into reports so we can go forward.

354
00:37:51,175 --> 00:38:08,443
So as you know, the mission of the CCDR is to develop responsible global citizens and leaders who will be positive contributors to society and will work on important issues such as global warming, addiction, prejudice, racism, pollution, gender bias, poverty, and education and health care.

355
00:38:08,783 --> 00:38:13,165
Those are the kinds of topics the students work on in their own world, in their own level.

356
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,486
Once again, the students pick the projects

357
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:18,188
with the help of Mr. Skorka and the other advisors.

358
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,309
They're not given to them.

359
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:21,710
It's their own ideas.

360
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,432
So the projects mean something to them.

361
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:40,404
We believe by providing the proper learning activities and engaging students from all backgrounds, we can prevent some of them from being negative behaviors such as addiction to harmful substances and developing negative perceptions of others such as racism and prejudice.

362
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:49,029
So not only do projects, by working with students and getting them involved in positive work, they're less likely to go to a negative place.

363
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:57,174
And the satisfaction and the feeling of success and creativity is on a positive thing, not a negative thing.

364
00:38:57,434 --> 00:39:07,200
And we'd like to start that as early as possible, so we're putting a strong emphasis next year on K-5 and K-5 in the middle schools next year.

365
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,882
So that will be a vibrant program, such as the high school.

366
00:39:11,745 --> 00:39:12,606
And this is my opinion.

367
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:17,288
Our public education system is the foundation of our democracy and the cauldron of the melting pot.

368
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:28,993
We believe that public and private schools must incorporate social-emotional learning, empathy, compassion, and citizenship in the school experience, and to develop student leaders who will combat racism, bigotry, and hate.

369
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:35,276
If we fail to do this, we miss an opportunity to have a profound impact on the kind of world we want our children to live in.

370
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:39,198
And so that's kind of my philosophy and why I'm involved.

371
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:46,342
I've spent 40 years in education and always felt that something was missing in education and I think this is it.

372
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:52,005
I think we need to do more after school and during school to

373
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:59,897
provide an education that creates leaders and positive people and compassion and empathy.

374
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:18,691
So, just closing, I'd like to have people who don't know about the CCSR or want more information to go to our webpage, which is on the link of the public school's webpage, and information is there, and so I hope people will go there and check it out.

375
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:20,512
And one more thing in closing,

376
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,658
There's at least one public school who's doing the same thing next year.

377
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,561
I shouldn't say they're doing the same thing.

378
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:31,988
They're applying for the Cummings grant with the same model that we have.

379
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:33,370
That's Burlington.

380
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:36,996
They're going to call it the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

381
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:50,482
I think a couple others were of interest, like Lynn and Wakefield, but I would really hope that we have more school districts and schools do this type of program to help make the world a better place.

382
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,563
So with that, I'm closing.

383
00:40:52,623 --> 00:40:55,224
Any questions or comments before I pass it on to Michael?

384
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:59,106
Thank you Mr. Trotter for all of your efforts, hard work, getting this off the ground.

385
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:00,366
You've done an amazing job.

386
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:01,167
Okay, thank you.

387
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:02,727
So no questions then.

388
00:41:02,787 --> 00:41:03,708
Michael Skorka?

389
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:04,728
Mr. Skorka!

390
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:06,569
Who's the ace?

391
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,880
Hi, good evening, everyone.

392
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:13,741
Thank you so much for having us.

393
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:17,402
We're so grateful for all of your support over the years.

394
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:21,183
This is the fourth year with student involvement in the CCSR.

395
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:24,144
When we first started, there were only 18 students.

396
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:26,665
That was our first year with the CCSR.

397
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:32,447
And last year, you've seen the annual report, 200 active students in the district, K through 12.

398
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:37,949
And they created events in which over 1,000 people participated in.

399
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,651
throughout the district, which is really exceptional.

400
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:52,021
I also am the high school advisor, and at the high school this year, we have 125 students already enrolled and working on 60 projects, and we will get that project booklet to you soon.

401
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,222
We're working on the portfolio.

402
00:41:53,583 --> 00:42:03,372
Jasper Hsu is actually the project portfolio manager and has been working tirelessly to get all of the information accurate, because we have so many students at the high school level, really lucky to have him.

403
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:13,402
So you know, we also, when we're not working on projects, the 60 projects that we mentioned, this year we've also attended and some of you were at the Cummings event.

404
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:19,889
We had a really large number of students that participated and went to the Cummings event, which I thought was really nice.

405
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:22,551
It was great because he's been so generous to us.

406
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,553
It was great to have that collaboration.

407
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:31,396
Also, Senator Jalen has came to our class and talked about the importance of civic engagement, which was wonderful.

408
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:33,216
That was just last week.

409
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:38,278
You're going to be hearing from two students who worked to help the victims in the Merrimack Valley.

410
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:40,798
They're going to be coming up and talking about that in just a second.

411
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:44,820
As Rich mentioned, the Veterans Day Walk, which is happening this Sunday.

412
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,921
We also had a student-run open house, the 8th grade open house, and I think some of you were there as well.

413
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,362
We didn't have one second free.

414
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:56,125
The parents chose to come to us because they're really excited about our program.

415
00:42:56,505 --> 00:43:01,949
Actually, one parent mentioned that they're talking about this program in Marshfield, which was outstanding.

416
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,431
So, like Rich said, we're expanding and we're really excited about it.

417
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:22,408
The newest development, as we'll start this week, is Mr. Tucci and myself and the advisor at the McGlynn Middle School, we're going to be working on an anti-bullying assembly for the McGlynn Middle School and then once we get that all set we're going to be moving that over to the Andrews.

418
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:25,432
So that's sort of down the pipeline that's happening.

419
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:33,396
As you all know, we've already expanded into all elementary schools and all middle schools.

420
00:43:33,637 --> 00:43:35,658
Advisors have been hired for all of those schools.

421
00:43:36,138 --> 00:43:38,019
We met on October 29th.

422
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,780
It was our first meeting with all of the advisors who were present.

423
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:49,005
We talked about what their role would be, how I can support them as the coordinator, and also ideas for projects and fundraisers, etc.

424
00:43:49,525 --> 00:43:53,427
It was really great to see such enthusiasm throughout the whole district.

425
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:54,888
People are really excited about doing this.

426
00:43:55,789 --> 00:44:04,717
All programs should be really off the ground either this week or the following week, so anybody in the Medford district can participate in the CCSR K-12.

427
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,061
I think I've said everything.

428
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:17,430
One more thing is that to foster the collaboration that we were talking about and to build the enthusiasm, what we're going to be doing is we're going to be sending high school CCSR

429
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:25,096
students to go to those meetings at the other school to get those kids excited about it, and that should be happening within the next month.

430
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:33,163
I know they're going next week, I think it's to the Brooks, and then they'll be hopefully going to every single school as well.

431
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:36,646
Does anybody have any questions?

432
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:45,983
Not really a question, but I just wanted to say to the students and to yourself, it was so great to see you at the Cummings event.

433
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:57,408
I thought it was, I thought the students who asked questions did a particularly good job and it was really nice, especially since Mr. Cummings has been so grateful and generous to the CCSR.

434
00:44:57,448 --> 00:45:02,050
It was so grateful to see the students in attendance and to express their gratitude.

435
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:10,535
Thank you very much for going and for being there and for all the work you're doing both to Rich, Michael, and to the students.

436
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:11,896
Thank you so much.

437
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:13,237
Mr. Russo.

438
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

439
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,000
Mr. Benedetto.

440
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:16,801
Thank you.

441
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,321
I just had a question.

442
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:23,362
In the book, I didn't see the Roberts School representative when it represented it.

443
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:27,543
Last year, the Roberts was not part of the CCSR.

444
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:32,064
But this year, we do have an advisor, Jennifer Devlin.

445
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:34,965
She is going to be the advisor for the Roberts.

446
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:36,265
So every school is represented.

447
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:38,026
We didn't have every school represented last year.

448
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,226
We were sort of building the program.

449
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,366
But every school will be represented this year.

450
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:41,766
You know me.

451
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:42,707
I don't miss a thing.

452
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:43,607
You don't miss a thing.

453
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:50,633
So you know that obviously we advertised to all the schools and just we couldn't make people do it.

454
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:53,536
Someone's come forward this year so we're really excited.

455
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:54,857
That's excellent.

456
00:45:55,738 --> 00:46:06,769
I also want to say how appreciative I am that empathy and the whole child learning is really coming out.

457
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:16,583
in these projects, and I think that the joy that they'll get from serving their community will also reflect in everything else they do in life.

458
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:18,946
You're inspiring people.

459
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:20,007
It's great work.

460
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:20,528
Thank you so much.

461
00:46:20,548 --> 00:46:21,449
I really appreciate that.

462
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:25,047
Mr. Ruggiero, for the community, how often do you guys meet?

463
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:26,968
At the high school level?

464
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:28,289
At the high school level.

465
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:35,032
We meet every other week, and so today we met actually to try to get all of our project portfolio ready and edited.

466
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:40,594
The idea is to meet at least twice a month to sort of check in with projects.

467
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:50,739
Also, of course, on the side, we're checking in with each group individually because there are 60 groups this year, just trying to make sure that the projects are on task and happening.

468
00:46:51,259 --> 00:47:06,045
That's been a big struggle, would be the word I'm using, but it's actually been really, like you said, when you see all these projects, it's been really great to see all the passion and enthusiasm the kids have, especially when they get to choose their own projects.

469
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:08,086
Thank you.

470
00:47:09,686 --> 00:47:14,188
And for anyone watching, the Veterans Walk is 10 o'clock Sunday morning on Veterans Day.

471
00:47:15,037 --> 00:47:17,439
Right here, City Hall, come on over.

472
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:24,323
Also, you wanted some children, children, I'm so sorry, children, some young adults to come up and speak about the program?

473
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:31,748
Yes, I'd like to invite Tia Balot and Nicole Chin up to speak about helping the victims of the Merrimack Valley.

474
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:42,529
Hi, my name is Nicole Chin.

475
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:48,913
Hi, my name is Tia Balot, and we're both juniors at Medford High School, and we are both part of the CSSR program.

476
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:56,165
So for one of our CCSR projects, we created a disaster relief drive for the victims of the gas explosions.

477
00:47:56,785 --> 00:48:01,748
And about two months ago, on September 13, the Merrimack Valley gas explosions occurred.

478
00:48:02,368 --> 00:48:08,311
And the two of us, along with three other students, created a one-week donation drive to help the families that were affected.

479
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:11,853
We collected donations from many places, including the mayor's office.

480
00:48:12,513 --> 00:48:16,395
And we received over $400 in checks and over 200 bags of donations.

481
00:48:17,015 --> 00:48:25,708
My parents rented a U-Haul truck and with Mr. Skorka's help, my family and I drove up to Lawrence and we unloaded the donations to two separate places.

482
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:30,315
We donated to the Lawrence Senior Center as well as the Debbie's Treasure Chest.

483
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:31,456
Very nice.

484
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:45,749
From this experience, with this project, as well as the CCSR member in general, we've learned a lot, and we've learned what it means to be part of a community and how to be a good citizen.

485
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:52,572
There are several issues within our society that we wish to change, and we realize the only way to bring about this change is to do something about it.

486
00:48:53,212 --> 00:48:55,473
Being a student means more than just what we learn in school.

487
00:48:55,673 --> 00:48:57,874
We are the next generation, and we have the power to change the world.

488
00:48:58,474 --> 00:49:04,897
And the CCSR allows us to go beyond our school curriculum and gives us the opportunity to address the problems we see around us today.

489
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:11,983
The CCSR program is not only important to Nicole and myself and the members, but it's also important to the improvement of our community.

490
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:20,951
It gives the young people in Medford a voice and the chance to attain the skills needed to become a positive leader and a positive contributor to the world and also to our community.

491
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:29,079
And the CCSR has affected our lives greatly and has given us a chance to project ourselves and show what we really are passionate about.

492
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,923
And we would like to thank you all for allowing us to speak today and for listening to us.

493
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:34,645
Thank you.

494
00:49:34,865 --> 00:49:39,450
And now we would like to introduce our fellow CCSR members, Sam Klugisch and Stephan Langsher.

495
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:48,710
Hello, my name is Stephan Langsher.

496
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,050
And I'm Sam Glogish.

497
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:54,212
We're both sophomores at Medford High School and members of the CCSR.

498
00:49:54,833 --> 00:50:04,617
And our project this year was to clean up McDonald Park, specifically the waterfront area, boat launch area of the McDonald Park.

499
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:08,879
We're both members of the cross-country team, and that is our home course.

500
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:11,381
And we're running races and having practices there.

501
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:14,002
We noticed a lot of trash, and we didn't really like it.

502
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:27,073
So we decided that on weekends and free days, possibly tomorrow, to go out and collect trash and make it a much nicer space for the community, for the cross-country team and anyone else who might want to be there.

503
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:44,531
We went out a couple weeks ago and we found a lot more trash than we thought and it's just made us like we got to do this and we really want to get it as nice as we can so that other people and ourselves in years to come can enjoy it.

504
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:50,077
There's not much more to say.

505
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:56,710
People have done a really good job.

506
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:09,013
CCSR has really allowed us to do such a thing because it's really all about, for us, helping the community, which is pretty much the main goal of the CCSR.

507
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:12,534
And we really liked it.

508
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:21,157
It really went nicely because we were down there and we saw the trash and I turned to Stephanie and I go, this is our CCSR project.

509
00:51:24,058 --> 00:51:28,301
I feel like without the CCSR, Medford would be much different than what it is.

510
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:40,709
The CCSR really does so much to help the community, to make that sense of citizenship feel really strong in this great city.

511
00:51:43,631 --> 00:52:11,378
I'm really proud of all of you and last year I got to meet many of you with some of the projects and what I found astounding was how two people would come in one week and then the next week one of those people would be with a new group so everybody was working on multiple projects at the same time so really accomplishing a lot and with over a hundred students I know that you can really make things happen and we've noticed and we're very very proud of your efforts and how you've built community and you are our next

512
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:13,865
leaders, so congratulations.

513
00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:31,895
Hi, I just wanted to speak on the CCSR because I think it's a fantabulous program.

514
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:39,118
I've been running the project portfolio, which you'll be getting next month hopefully, and I've been doing that for three years.

515
00:52:39,558 --> 00:52:46,381
So I have seen personally and talked with a bunch of groups on just their amazing projects, whether it be

516
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:52,023
cultural inclusivity or environmental improvement or things along that manner.

517
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:56,525
And I think one of the greatest parts about it is that these projects are student-led.

518
00:52:57,026 --> 00:53:00,627
So they get to choose what manner their project is carried out with.

519
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,030
what topic they're going to be focusing on.

520
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:14,456
And then we have amazing people like Mr. Richard Trotta and like a Skorka here just to enable us to pursue our passions and really give back to the community.

521
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:20,701
So this is a program that I really truly endorse and I hope that it continues on into the future.

522
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:21,561
Absolutely.

523
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:22,442
Very good.

524
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:22,762
Thank you.

525
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:27,465
Thank you all.

526
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:29,227
Would you like to close, Mr.?

527
00:53:29,854 --> 00:53:40,863
One more shameless plug, the walk on Sundays is coordinated by City Mayor's office as well as the CCSR, so we want to thank you for providing support for the walk.

528
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:42,484
And hopefully we'll see you all there.

529
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:42,885
Thank you.

530
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:43,405
You bet.

531
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:44,946
Ms.

532
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:45,607
Van de Kloot.

533
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:53,614
So I'm not sure whether I can make it on Monday, but I, uh, on Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, but I know that I can start off the donations, so here you go.

534
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:54,154
Save her a t-shirt.

535
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:02,959
Very good.

536
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:03,859
Well, thank you all.

537
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,441
What a great, this is a great night.

538
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:06,542
Very nice.

539
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:07,262
Thank you so much.

540
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:08,143
And we'll see you Sunday.

541
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:09,044
Thank you.

542
00:54:11,145 --> 00:54:15,349
Motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Rousseau.

543
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:16,470
All those in favor?

544
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:16,570
Aye.

545
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:17,931
All those opposed?

546
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:18,732
Motion passes.

547
00:54:19,873 --> 00:54:24,236
Report on 2018 Medford High School, Medford Volk Technical High School College Fair.

548
00:54:26,114 --> 00:54:30,936
And I'd like to see Amelia Jensen come forward, our Director of Guidance, to update us.

549
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:32,537
Hi, good evening everyone.

550
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:33,417
Thank you for having me.

551
00:54:34,157 --> 00:54:40,940
I'm here tonight to present a report on our 2018 MHS and VTHS College Fair.

552
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:56,240
24th, we hosted over 99, no exactly 99 public and private colleges and universities, community colleges, military branches, and support programs and technical schools.

553
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:02,445
On the following page you'll see a list of all of the schools that were in attendance.

554
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:08,670
This is a yearly tradition that we do and we held it this year in the gymnasium at Medford

555
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:10,669
PM.

556
00:55:11,631 --> 00:55:16,259
This event was all evening long.

557
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:21,103
We had a wonderful mix of 9th through 12th grade students and parents.

558
00:55:21,623 --> 00:55:27,544
We also had students and parents not only from the Medford community, but from the surrounding Medford community.

559
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:35,586
We invite local and private schools and public schools to come to our high school.

560
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:40,847
So not every high school in the area hosts their own college fair, which is why some of them come to ours.

561
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:53,642
In conjunction with the college fair, the special education department also hosted a parent and student presentation titled, The Transition to College for Students with IEPs and 504 Accommodation Plans.

562
00:55:54,843 --> 00:56:06,745
This presentation's focus was on what students should be doing to prepare for college, the college application process, and what special education students should do to supplement their application.

563
00:56:07,385 --> 00:56:10,307
We had a representative from Newberry College there to speak.

564
00:56:11,028 --> 00:56:24,218
She was the Disability Services Coordinator, and she spoke about the transition planning and being able to identify what supports are available in colleges to help students transition.

565
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,623
Overall, this was a very successful evening, so I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.

566
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,865
Does anyone have any questions for Ms.

567
00:56:32,885 --> 00:56:33,245
Jensen?

568
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:34,446
Ms.

569
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:34,887
Mostona?

570
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:38,854
Not a question, but just it goes with your college fair night.

571
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:46,838
Tomorrow night at the Danvers Port Yacht Club, there's over 20 military colleges and universities who have their own college fair.

572
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:47,778
Oh, wow.

573
00:56:47,858 --> 00:56:49,179
Someone had asked me to share that.

574
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:54,481
So tomorrow is Wednesday, November 7, 7 p.m.

575
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:58,823
at Danvers Port Yacht Club, over 20 military colleges and universities.

576
00:57:00,123 --> 00:57:00,823
So that's FYI.

577
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:02,604
Wednesday or Tuesday?

578
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:03,164
Wednesday.

579
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:04,885
Wednesday the 7th.

580
00:57:05,285 --> 00:57:06,005
November 7th.

581
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,005
Thank you.

582
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:08,646
Thank you.

583
00:57:10,506 --> 00:57:11,126
Did anyone else?

584
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:11,366
Ms.

585
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:12,807
Domenico?

586
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:18,008
I just had a quick question on students with IEPs and 504 plans.

587
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:22,210
Is their presentation the same time as the college night?

588
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:26,591
Because some students could go to that presentation and still need to go.

589
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:33,516
Yes, so we plan to have that at 5.30 to 6.30 and then the college fair starts at 6.30.

590
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:40,821
So parents can come early, parents and students can come early, see that presentation in the Karen Theater and then still make the college fair.

591
00:57:41,281 --> 00:57:41,521
Perfect.

592
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,382
This already happened?

593
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:42,962
Yes.

594
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:49,867
I was just making sure that when it's planned it's not at the same exact time so that students had an opportunity.

595
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:52,818
Hi.

596
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:58,500
So what's the process for colleges getting on this list?

597
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,060
Yeah.

598
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:03,041
So we invite every college who has previously come.

599
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:11,744
We also look at what colleges students have applied to to see what their current interest is and what the interest was in previous years.

600
00:58:12,504 --> 00:58:16,245
We invite about 300 or more colleges every year.

601
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:21,007
And then colleges that, for one reason or another, we didn't find out about it because we're in their

602
00:58:22,927 --> 00:58:25,468
I can't remember what it's called, but it's the registry for college fairs.

603
00:58:25,508 --> 00:58:30,151
So we're in that so they can see what college fairs are in the area and sign up for it.

604
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:41,057
So for example, if there are, for some reason, there are schools from the southwestern part of the United States visiting the northeast during that time, they will usually come to our college fair.

605
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:44,859
That's awesome.

606
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,240
And 99 is a big number.

607
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,641
I'm sure it must be fun to fit them in there.

608
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:51,763
But what is the capacity of, like,

609
00:58:52,305 --> 00:58:55,106
If we had 300 show up, would you be able to manage that?

610
00:58:55,806 --> 00:59:06,490
I think we could manage... We had 110 tables and that was somewhat squeezing it, but we could always... What we have done in the past is we've put 3 to every 2 table.

611
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,312
So I don't know the math on that, but I think we could probably squeeze about 200.

612
00:59:11,352 --> 00:59:15,213
The issue would, I think, become parking if we did that.

613
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:17,474
Thank you.

614
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:23,791
Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Agiro, seconded by Ms.

615
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:24,272
Mustone.

616
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:25,132
All those in favor?

617
00:59:25,152 --> 00:59:25,653
Aye.

618
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:26,673
All those opposed?

619
00:59:27,154 --> 00:59:27,954
Motion passes.

620
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:28,234
Thank you.

621
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:36,520
Oh, and can I also say that on Wednesday night, November 7th, we're having our financial aid night and a MIFA representative will be in attendance.

622
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,443
She also works at Tufts in the financial aid department and she'll be putting on a presentation.

623
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:41,663
Excellent.

624
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:42,004
Thank you.

625
00:59:42,024 --> 00:59:42,764
Thank you very much.

626
00:59:44,926 --> 00:59:46,627
Report on elementary highlights.

627
00:59:47,412 --> 00:59:49,261
Our associate superintendent, Ms.

628
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:50,106
Diane Caldwell.

629
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:52,795
Such a good night for me.

630
00:59:55,496 --> 00:59:59,837
Every once in a while, you start really positive and we end really positive.

631
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:02,677
So thank you for indulging me this evening.

632
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:09,339
The superintendent did allude to some of the wonderful events that are taking place in our elementary buildings earlier.

633
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:18,241
One was the multicultural week at the McGlynn Elementary School where they had step dance and Irish folktales, art and food, and a fashion show.

634
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:24,984
And students would come to the microphone early in the morning to say good morning in their native language.

635
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:29,325
At the Columbus Elementary School, some of you, maybe all of you, attended.

636
01:00:29,405 --> 01:00:31,406
I was busy at the high school that day.

637
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:36,648
But we had Jump Start read for the record, maybe something beautiful, a book that was read.

638
01:00:36,748 --> 01:00:44,772
And if you go to Pepe's Gas Station, you can see the beautiful artwork to make that connection, highlighting building literacy.

639
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:49,493
And Dr. K told me over 420 participants to jumpstart.

640
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:54,075
At the Roberts School, I was proud to attend their STEM fair.

641
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:57,036
And Mr. Cieri was there as well.

642
01:00:57,516 --> 01:01:01,417
I'd like to thank Joanne McKay, a fourth grade teacher, and Ms.

643
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,778
Rodriguez, who organized that.

644
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:10,140
The children learned to make kazoos, volcanoes, engineering, seedy spinners,

645
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:15,641
And my very favorite one was gumdrop engineering activity.

646
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:20,882
You'd be surprised how you put those gumdrops together, although I wanted to eat them too.

647
01:01:21,703 --> 01:01:30,465
And the Brooks Elementary School, we had a fall fest where there was games, crafts, food and entertainment, as well as an open mic night.

648
01:01:30,545 --> 01:01:36,666
I don't know if any of you have ever gone to that, but Michael Allen usually does that and does a phenomenal job.

649
01:01:37,246 --> 01:01:40,107
So I'm very happy to talk about the elementary highlights.

650
01:01:40,787 --> 01:01:49,093
As you know, we do literacy nights and math nights as well as our STEM nights, and I'm happy to get those dates to you when they come up and invite you all to that as well.

651
01:01:49,853 --> 01:01:56,498
And maybe in the next few meetings, we'll be able to highlight the McGlenn Middle School and the Andrews Middle School highlights.

652
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:57,698
Any questions?

653
01:01:57,718 --> 01:01:57,758
Ms.

654
01:01:57,778 --> 01:02:04,263
Caldwell, could you mention the Read for Bingo, the Reading Bingo that's taking place this evening?

655
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:12,766
Oh, you know, sometimes I forget about my many hats that I wear, so thank you, Superintendent Vincent.

656
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:24,592
Tonight, Title I is sponsoring Bingo for Books, and so my Title I staff, this is all organized, I must say, by Michelle, my mighty Michelle, I call her.

657
01:02:24,772 --> 01:02:34,397
We had, this began at about 5 o'clock, and we had pizza about 5.30 with the kids, and the staff

658
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:39,628
family that's including parents.

659
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:47,054
And so this is November's National Literacy Month, so we talk a little bit about the importance of literacy and reading to your children.

660
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:50,396
And then we play bingo for books for the kids.

661
01:02:50,617 --> 01:02:57,002
And the prize is, you guessed it, a book or a bunch of books at the end of the evening.

662
01:02:57,082 --> 01:02:59,003
So, yes, thank you for bringing that up.

663
01:03:01,025 --> 01:03:01,585
Any questions?

664
01:03:01,605 --> 01:03:01,706
Good.

665
01:03:01,746 --> 01:03:02,486
Are there any questions?

666
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,467
Is there a motion on the floor to accept the report and place it on file?

667
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:07,628
Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

668
01:03:07,648 --> 01:03:08,128
Vanden Heuvel.

669
01:03:08,168 --> 01:03:08,888
All those in favor?

670
01:03:08,908 --> 01:03:08,969
Aye.

671
01:03:09,629 --> 01:03:10,349
All those opposed?

672
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,730
Motion passes.

673
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,491
Negotiation on legal matters, are there any?

674
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:15,972
None.

675
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:16,892
Okay.

676
01:03:17,873 --> 01:03:18,473
New business.

677
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:24,036
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Jack Forcier.

678
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:27,378
Mr. Forcier was a 2011 graduate of Medford High School.

679
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:33,754
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Michael Caudry.

680
01:03:33,954 --> 01:03:37,916
Mr. Caudry was the father of Andrew's middle school teacher, Sarah Caudry.

681
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:44,860
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Joseph Luongo.

682
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,702
Mr. Luongo was the uncle of Andrew's middle school teacher, Lisa Luongo.

683
01:03:50,803 --> 01:03:55,728
Also be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Harvey Howell.

684
01:03:55,989 --> 01:04:06,139
Mr. Howell was the father of former EL Director Leslie Trotta and father-in-law of former Director of Technology and Fine Arts and current CCSR Director Richard Trotta.

685
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,804
Also at this time if we could send out our condolences to the families

686
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:16,888
of those that were murdered at the Temple of Worship Synagogue in Pittsburgh.

687
01:04:18,209 --> 01:04:26,313
Our thoughts and prayers are with them and the whole community, including our own Jewish community, that we feel the pain with them.

688
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:33,457
And also the first responders that ran into the synagogue to help those and also got injured in the line of duty.

689
01:04:33,877 --> 01:04:35,158
So our thoughts and prayers are with them.

690
01:04:35,398 --> 01:04:38,120
If we could all just rise for a moment of silence, please.

691
01:04:50,092 --> 01:04:50,452
Thank you.

692
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,402
That looks like it's it.

693
01:04:57,942 --> 01:04:59,324
Is there a motion to adjourn?

694
01:05:00,506 --> 01:05:01,407
So moved.

695
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:03,550
This meeting is now adjourned.
