1
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:42,115

00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:45,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. DeVita, present.

00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:46,897

00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo, present.

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,901

[SPEAKER_14]: Also in attendance is Jasper Sue, our school committee representative.

11
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:01,825
[SPEAKER_14]: All please rise and salute our flag.

12
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:08,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for

13
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:14,859
[SPEAKER_01]: and justice for all.

14
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Approval of the minutes of October 15, 2018.

15
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,703
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion on the floor for approval of Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

16
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:25,543
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

17
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:25,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

18
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:27,364
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

19
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:28,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

20
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

21
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:32,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Benedetto.

22
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I just had a couple questions.

23
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,467
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably very easily explained.

24
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:54,439
[SPEAKER_13]: On page 7 of 8, it says three quarters of the way down, I'd say, right above the vocational automotive supplies is SPED pro-development expenses.

25
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:58,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Did they come in?

26
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we send people out?

27
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:03,847
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just curious what we were doing for professional development for the special education department.

28
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:18,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I'll just send an email to them.

29
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:20,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had one more question since you're here.

30
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:25,119
[SPEAKER_13]: It was on page 5 of 8 and the bottom of 4 of 8.

31
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:57,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Riddell All-American Athletic Officials, the total looks like about $9,000, and I was just wondering, I know it looks like a company, but it just seems like a lot of money for athletic officials, and it might be like five different sports or, I don't know, I just saw a lot of athletic officials individually paid, which I know we hire

32
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:04,266
[SPEAKER_13]: individual people, but when I saw this large amount, $3,027.40, and then $5,596.39, and a $416.37 together, it's about $9,000.

33
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:04,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just wondering,

34
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,591
[SPEAKER_13]: if you knew a little bit more about that.

35
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,812
[SPEAKER_13]: It seemed like a lot of money.

36
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:19,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

37
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:24,397
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, the description is not always indicative of the exact expense.

38
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:32,263
[SPEAKER_21]: The account code itself has directly in the middle the 0400, which identifies it as a contracted service.

39
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:39,308
[SPEAKER_21]: So Riddell All-American is a contracted service provider under athletics.

40
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,689
[SPEAKER_21]: So they may be doing

41
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:52,494
[SPEAKER_21]: shoulder pad renovations, the helmet, instead of buying all new helmets, they can have them refurbished, things of that nature.

42
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:59,417
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, the exact identifier of this particular invoice, I would have to go back and look that up for you.

43
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:04,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

44
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Ms.

45
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone, seconded by Ms.

46
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz, roll call vote please.

47

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

48
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:20,737
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:21,677
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

50
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Approval of payrolls.

51
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,541

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Otero.

61
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:36,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

62
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:36,729

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:37,769
Ms.

66
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,590
Van der Kloot.

67
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:38,690
Yes.

68
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,830
Ms.

69
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:39,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot.

70
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:40,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

71
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,672
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

72
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:42,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

73
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,514

00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:43,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

75
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:45,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

76
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:45,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Amen.

77
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:46,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

78
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of committees.

79
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:48,984
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

80
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Community participation?

81
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:54,225
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

82
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of the Superintendent.

83
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Item 1, report on Andrews Middle School and Brooks Elementary School students.

84
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:02,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Miss, Madam Superintendent.

85
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:11,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to that, I just wanted to make a few brief statements to talk about things that have happened in the district these past

86
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,191
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks since we haven't met.

87
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,993
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of exciting activities.

88
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:27,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Our DA, Marion Ryan, came to the high school and presented the Cut It Out program and she spoke with both our cosmetology

89
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:39,930
[SPEAKER_01]: and health assistance students and it teaches them about their future work roles and how to notice symptoms of domestic violence and how to refer clients to get help.

90
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a wonderful training that did take place at the vocational school.

91
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:50,177
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, our garden club did host a harvest party.

92
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:57,139
[SPEAKER_01]: We, as a school committee, had a wonderful retreat, and I'm looking forward to our next session.

93
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I continue to work with my mentor, Carla Bear.

94
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:12,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the pleasure of attending the State of the City Luncheon that took place for Mayor Burke, and that was a wonderful opportunity to be with other

95
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,546
[SPEAKER_01]: department heads from the city.

96
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:25,168
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn School hosted an ethnic pride week where students really were able to celebrate all of their cultures.

97
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:29,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And it culminated with a wonderful fashion show.

98
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did get to see school committee member Kreatz there as well.

99
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:42,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And the students were really excited about demonstrating their pride from where they attended.

100
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:54,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had the opportunity to attend Chief Sacco's retirement, which was a wonderful tribute and honor to his many, many years of service to Medford.

101
00:14:56,394 --> 00:15:01,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the instructional front, I'm continuing to conduct instructional rounds.

102
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:11,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the pleasure of walking with Charlene Douglas, who is the MTA president, and we were able to go and look at instruction at both the Brooks

103
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:19,483
[SPEAKER_01]: and the McGlynn schools last week, so we are continuing to look at instruction and build a collaborative partnership.

104
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:24,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were many, many positive things that happened.

105
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:32,093
[SPEAKER_01]: The Roberts playground, we had a wonderful ribbon cutting, and I hope for our next school committee meeting to be able to show

106
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:38,019
[SPEAKER_01]: a short video clip showing the many stages that the playground went through.

107
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:43,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to just thank again the CPC, the Roberts Community PTO.

108
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:47,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all the members that worked collaboratively together.

109
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:52,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Cheryl Rodriguez for being a strong parent advocate.

110
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:55,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And the schoolyard came out beautifully.

111
00:15:56,077 --> 00:16:05,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm so happy to see that again another collaborative effort producing a beautiful play surface for all students to be able to enjoy.

112
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:17,976
[SPEAKER_01]: The last piece that I did want to mention was that last week we did have an empty bullet casing that was located on the field of the high school.

113
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:28,124
[SPEAKER_01]: and that a concerned citizen did turn it over to our school officer, Officer Mazeka, and that the appropriate steps were followed.

114
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:29,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Police were notified.

115
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,307
[SPEAKER_01]: They investigated.

116
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:41,415
[SPEAKER_01]: We communicated to families that evening, and the following day, we had nine police officers

117
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:46,301
[SPEAKER_01]: walked the field with metal detectors.

118
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:53,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they came into the high school and they continued to search the different floors, the high traffic areas.

119
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:59,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a canine, a dog, come into the school building.

120
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:00,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Three dogs.

121
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,080
[SPEAKER_01]: to three dogs in the end.

122
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:14,630
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one dog from Cambridge, one from the state police, and our Medford police dog to search the property and go back and look at the field.

123
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nothing else was found.

124
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:23,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just thank Chief Sacco and all the police officers who worked collaboratively to

125
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:28,801
[SPEAKER_01]: keep Medford safe and that it truly is a priority.

126
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things that I wanted to report out and I was very pleased with that outcome.

127
00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:34,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

128
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

129
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:37,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Ruggiero.

130
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I just had a quick question about the spent ammunition that you found on the field.

131
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:48,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Was the caliber the same caliber or a different caliber of bullet that was from the prior incident?

132
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:54,873
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a 9mm just, not to say just, but it was one single empty bullet.

133
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Was the prior bullet a 9mm?

134
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:57,696
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a cartridge.

135
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,677
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a cartridge.

136
00:17:58,697 --> 00:17:59,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Much different.

137
00:17:59,618 --> 00:17:59,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

138
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any other questions?

139
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,584
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion to accept the superintendent's report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

140
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:09,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Kreatz.

141
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:10,585
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

142
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:10,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

143
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,166
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

144
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:13,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion granted.

145
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:17,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Item 1, report on Andrews Middle School and Brooks Elementary School students.

146
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:18,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

147
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:18,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Caldwell.

148
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:20,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening everyone.

149
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:29,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So every once in a while we have meetings where I feel it's wonderful to celebrate our young kids and tonight is one of those meetings.

150
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:36,263
[SPEAKER_09]: We have three students with us, or I think we only have two this evening, that I'd like to tell you a little bit about.

151
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:45,885
[SPEAKER_09]: One is an Andrews Middle School student, and the Andrews Middle School stands for core values such as excellence through responsibility and respect.

152
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:56,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have one student from the Brooks School that is committed to nurturing collaboration, imagination, creative and creative problem solving.

153
00:18:57,228 --> 00:19:05,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So with these students, let me tell you a little bit about what Orlando and his sisters Delilah and Isabella have done.

154
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:16,394
[SPEAKER_09]: During this past summer, they collected money for donations for gift cards and were able to pack 90 backpacks for the Andrews Middle School.

155
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

156
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:28,428
[SPEAKER_09]: filled with materials and supplies that could probably last the whole year for these students over at the Andrews.

157
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:33,710
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the Brooks Elementary School, there were 11 backpacks.

158
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,271
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to call these students up with their principals.

159
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:45,933
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Downs, the Andrews Middle School principal, said that his student wrote some inspirational notes that he put inside the backpacks.

160
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've asked him to see if he would read a few for us.

161
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,235
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mr. Downs and Ms.

162
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Galussi with us from the Brooks Elementary School, please come up.

163
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And our students, Orlando and Isabella.

164
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:05,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on in.

165
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,271
[SPEAKER_09]: On either side of you.

166
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

167
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:11,282
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

168
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome, everyone.

169
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:16,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for having me this evening with my student Orlando and his sister here.

170
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:23,965
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always great news to have students provide other students with things that they may not normally be able to provide through their own means.

171
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:28,807
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, these two students exemplify our core values at the Andrews School.

172
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:34,068
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are just some notes that I want to share with you, because good news is always nice to have.

173
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:35,428
[SPEAKER_19]: And so here's some of the notes.

174
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,509
[SPEAKER_19]: You can be anything you want.

175
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:39,840
[SPEAKER_19]: You can do anything.

176
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,803
[SPEAKER_19]: You are such a great friend.

177
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:43,966
[SPEAKER_19]: You are so amazing.

178
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:50,836
[SPEAKER_19]: But the one that I really liked, and it was probably my favorite one that I read, was, be kind, be great, and be you.

179
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:52,879
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are just some of the quotes.

180
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,046
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you very much, everyone.

181
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,909
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll stay here, or do you want me?

182
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:03,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

183
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have a few citations for Orlando and his sister, Isabella.

184
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:08,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

185
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:09,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like to come up?

186
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:31,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to read this, OK?

187
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:41,769
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a certificate of appreciation the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Orlando Putnam Bagley for his dedication to the students of Medford.

188
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:55,013
[SPEAKER_14]: By myself, Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke, Chairman Mia Mastone, Vice Chair Erin DiBenedetto, Kathy Kreatz, Secretary Maryse Edward-Vincent, our Superintendent Michael Ruggiero, Paul Russo, and Paulette Van de Kloop.

189
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And likewise, we have one for Isabella and her sister Delilah for your dedication to this wonderful effort.

190
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:11,804
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys did an amazing job and we're so proud of you.

191
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:28,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so make sure you give this to your sister.

192
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:29,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Give her a hug.

193
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:30,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sure.

194
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:31,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, come on up.

195
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:59,316
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, I'm Orlando and over the summer I was doing a project for the NJHS and we decided to do a project with Operation Be Kind where we would pack school supplies for underprivileged children and bring them to the school so they could have supplies because, you know,

196
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:07,586
[SPEAKER_16]: The core thing we were trying to say was that it's important for children to have the tools they need to succeed in school.

197
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,606
[SPEAKER_16]: And we wanted to support that.

198
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,808
[SPEAKER_16]: So they mailed us 100 Operation Be Kind bags.

199
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:22,211
[SPEAKER_16]: And we got gift certificates from Target and Costco.

200
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:26,213
[SPEAKER_16]: And we bought lots of school supplies.

201
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:30,516
[SPEAKER_16]: And we filled each bag with notebooks and pencils.

202
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:38,319
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also wrote nice messages on cards and put one card in each bag.

203
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:43,122
[SPEAKER_16]: And we brought 11 bags to the Brooks Elementary School and the Andrews Middle School.

204
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:47,044
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was pretty successful.

205
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:49,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Wonderful.

206
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,957
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if Orlando has got to meet some of the CCSR students that are in the audience.

207
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:05,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the whole mission, is being kind, being global citizens.

208
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,681
[SPEAKER_14]: So Orlando certainly replicates that at the middle school level.

209
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:24,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you tell him you did something?

210
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:24,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

211
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:24,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Does he know?

212
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:47,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to accept that report and place it on file?

213
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:48,959
[SPEAKER_14]: So moved by Ms.

214
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Vandeclude, seconded by Ms.

215
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:50,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone.

216
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:51,501
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

217
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:51,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

218
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:52,762
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

219
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:53,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

220
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:58,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on the Mass Jazz Symposium.

221
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:01,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford High School senior, Chewbacca Durali.

222
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope I said that right.

223
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:04,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Chewbacca.

224
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:05,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Chewbacca.

225
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,435
[SPEAKER_14]: By Dr. Sue Betcha.

226
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Say it right, no?

227
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:15,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so Rocco Sieri, our director of science, is going to present the award.

228
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:16,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

229
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:19,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

230
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:28,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And dad, and sister, come on up.

231
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:32,909
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Subbasha is a senior this year at Medford High School.

232
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:43,201
[SPEAKER_02]: on the optical monitoring of muscle hemodynamics in humans after exercise.

233
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:49,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to take breaths through the names, like I always do for the science fair projects, because they have these complex names.

234
00:25:50,925 --> 00:26:00,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to let Subhash tell you a little bit about why she chose that project and what it meant in layman's terms.

235
00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:06,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Once she presents that project, she received the first prize at the state fair.

236
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, in the fall, they have a symposium where students present their projects at MIT to a panel.

237
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:19,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that particular event, Subhashra placed second.

238
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:29,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is now invited to go to the AAAS meeting, the American Academy of

239
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Sciences, I believe.

240
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Advancement of Science.

241
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:36,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew I missed a letter there.

242
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:44,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Which happens to be the national organization where probably all of the premier scientists in this country participate.

243
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:46,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a national conference.

244
00:26:49,656 --> 00:27:07,521
[SPEAKER_02]: By participating, she'll have her abstract printed, she'll present there, and then probably interact with many students, but also many scientists, where her work will be shared out.

245
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:14,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm extremely proud of what she's been able to do and what she accomplished.

246
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,652
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a delight.

247
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:24,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always a privilege to have students that are able to balance

248
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:37,008
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sort of the two pieces of communicating and being passionate and the scientific know-how of how to do a project.

249
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:38,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real honor.

250
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,711
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, in the report I did state that there was a cost to the

251
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:51,381
[SPEAKER_02]: to attend, just informing that it might be even higher than what the cost is.

252
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:58,332
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of opening it up to find a way, a creative way, to get her there.

253
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:19,665
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two previous students that participated but I'm not sure that they, I was under the impression that those were under a grant at that time that paid for the participation whereas the grant no longer exists for these students so we have to find a way to be a bit more creative to get her there because I think it's a really

254
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:22,128
[SPEAKER_02]: extraordinary opportunity.

255
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:34,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The two students that did participate before are scientists in their own right currently doing some fine work and so I know that the path for her is well tread and it's a good one.

256
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:37,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll betcha we want to congratulate you.

257
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:39,149
[SPEAKER_14]: What an amazing accomplishment.

258
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,390
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe I saw you last year at the science fair.

259
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,972
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a few of us may have witnessed your project and we were floored by some of the work you did.

260
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:53,734
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted you to know, I did reach out to a corporation just this morning and I'm waiting to hear back from the president by Wednesday.

261
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:57,215
[SPEAKER_14]: So possibly we might have something in the works to cover it.

262
00:28:57,255 --> 00:29:00,636
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure if not, we will figure out a way to get you there.

263
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:02,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Benedetto.

264
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:21,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, we would love to receive that corporate sponsor, but if not, I would like to make a motion on the floor to cover the expenses since she'll be representing MEDFED in a way that is so important for our community that there's a motion on the floor to cover the cost.

265
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:25,291
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't be the first time that this committee has allocated funds in this way.

266
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:35,015
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to make the motion that if corporate sponsorship does not come through, that we pay the full cost for her.

267
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

268
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:36,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Van der Kloot.

269
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mayor Burke, I commend you for already reaching out.

270
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:43,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that does come through, that's great, but I'll second my colleague's motion.

271
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:53,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not been unusual for us at all when we have outstanding students to support them and to let them be able to represent us with great pride.

272
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to make sure you get to go no matter what.

273
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:08,228
[SPEAKER_14]: And before I call the roll, I'd like to invite Subbatcha up so that she could accept this commendation from the Medford School Committee.

274
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:33,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Certificate of Achievement, the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Subbacha Durali for her second place finish at the Mass JS Symposium.

275
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:40,390
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's offered by all of us here at the school committee, including our superintendent, on an amazing accomplishment.

276
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,950
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're very, very proud of you.

277
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

278
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:49,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

279
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:50,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

280
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:51,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

281
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:10,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I use the mic?

282
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:12,819
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't even have to use the talk mic.

283
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:20,902
[SPEAKER_05]: So my project for Science Fair last year was inspired by a trip actually to my home country, which is Nepal.

284
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:22,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually born there.

285
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:30,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And after the 2015 earthquake, I learned about all of the medical implications that my grandparents had to go through because of their diabetes.

286
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:37,407
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to pay so much more cost to get pills, just insufficient amounts of pills weekly.

287
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:44,492
[SPEAKER_05]: to just have basic medication so that they wouldn't experience pain when sitting up or when laying down.

288
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:47,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And this inspired me to try to do something scientific.

289
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:54,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I had already done some science fair projects, but I wasn't really completely in love with them, if that makes sense.

290
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:06,188
[SPEAKER_05]: So in 10th grade, I got to go to the Tufts University's biomedical and science program, Tubers, with Professor Fantini, and he allowed me

291
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:12,595
[SPEAKER_05]: to use his resources to actually make a project of my own involving mirror infrared spectroscopy.

292
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:20,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And through that I was able to kind of research on my own path to discover a protocol that would help to create

293
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:43,797
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of like an early detection device or method that could allow for us in the population, not only in the United States, but globally, to detect onset disease of diabetes and something called peripheral arterial disease so that more people are able to change their lives, not only paying high amounts for medications, but just for themselves.

294
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:47,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's able to be done through a small device,

295
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:53,543
[SPEAKER_05]: which anybody can use on their calf muscle, then they'll be able to get a second chance at life.

296
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:54,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

297
00:32:54,404 --> 00:33:00,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

298
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:07,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's so nice to see you again.

299
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:08,334
Thank you.

300
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:24,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

301
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:32,883
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the motion, authored by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

302
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:40,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot, that if funding is not secured privately, that the school committee, school department, will put up the necessary monies to advance her.

303
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:42,629
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion, roll call vote.

304
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Secretary.

305
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Benedetto.

306
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:45,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

307
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:46,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Grant.

308
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:46,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

309
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:47,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Owens.

310
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:47,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

311
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:55,875
[SPEAKER_15]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

312
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:56,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

313
00:33:57,055 --> 00:33:58,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations again.

314
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful job.

315
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:10,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, school year 17-18.

316
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Trotter?

317
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Trotter is the director

318
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:39,537
[SPEAKER_01]: CCSR project, and in addition to that, after him, we will have Michael Skorker speaking, who's our program coordinator for CCSR, and we're gonna hear from four wonderful Medford High School students, and I want to say their names correctly, Sam Klugisch, Stephan Lungscher, Nicole Chin, and Tia Ballot.

319
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look forward to hearing from everyone this evening.

320
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

321
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much for allowing us to come tonight.

322
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:57,709
[SPEAKER_20]: At first I want to thank the superintendent and the mayor and the school committee for the continual support over the years for the CCSR.

323
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:04,094
[SPEAKER_20]: And most of us say CCSR because it's a mouthful to say the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibilities.

324
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,376
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's the real name.

325
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,259
[SPEAKER_20]: But before I talk about the report, I want to make a couple of announcements.

326
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:17,882
[SPEAKER_20]: One, we have a walk for veterans on Sunday, November 11th, starting in front of City Hall at 10 o'clock in the morning.

327
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:21,905
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no fee involved, you can make a donation.

328
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:40,147
[SPEAKER_20]: selling t-shirts and then there'll be a two and a half mile walk and then afterwards there's a reception at carol's restaurant on main street for free freshmen so i'd like to have that set here so people from tv home can watch it and also that you guys hopefully will come and participate

329
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:48,577
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, I want to just respond to the fact that we got a contribution from the Boston Foundation for the Crystal Camel Betterment Project.

330
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,020
[SPEAKER_20]: We're really excited about that.

331
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:59,930
[SPEAKER_20]: That's $125,000 that will be in our possession to use in projects for Crystal's name over the years.

332
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:07,435
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of it, the vast majority of it will be invested, and money will be taken out of the proceeds from that investment each year to do projects.

333
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:12,458
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's a very beneficial thing for not only CCSR, but for the community.

334
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,639
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we're really pleased with that.

335
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,901
[SPEAKER_20]: So now the report.

336
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:23,004
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a long report, it's 104 pages long, so I thought I'd only read 65 of those.

337
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:27,787
[SPEAKER_20]: No, actually it's here.

338
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:37,025
[SPEAKER_20]: So, this is a report that we put together for last year's activities.

339
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:47,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Michael and I were sitting down thinking about how much we had done last year, and we had no record of it, because it was such a comprehensive year, and we did so much, and the kids did so much, really, not us.

340
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,532
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we wanted to have a record and pass it on to the school committee, and the community, so to show what

341
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:54,792
[SPEAKER_20]: what students can do.

342
00:36:54,812 --> 00:37:01,734
[SPEAKER_20]: If you give them enough help and support and allow them to be creative, they do amazing things.

343
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:03,674
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is an example of it.

344
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:07,035
[SPEAKER_20]: There are other examples like the students in Parkland, Florida.

345
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:11,196
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're really pleased that our students are doing such positive things.

346
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,617
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the report, there were a whole list of activities that were performed by students K-12.

347
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:20,538
[SPEAKER_20]: The vast majority were the high school because we have this outstanding

348
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:25,160
[SPEAKER_20]: person called Michael Skorka who does a fantastic job at the high school.

349
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:29,963
[SPEAKER_20]: One of our goals this year is to create more Michael Skorkas if we can at the other schools.

350
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:34,106
[SPEAKER_20]: And this year's crop of leaders, he's one of them too.

351
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:37,948
[SPEAKER_20]: By the way, I want to recruit those two students from the Andrews.

352
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:46,013
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do have some really good teachers who are involved this year at the other schools and we look forward to having a bigger program, a bigger report next year.

353
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:49,794
[SPEAKER_20]: But with that being said, let's get into reports so we can go forward.

354
00:37:51,175 --> 00:38:08,443
[SPEAKER_20]: So as you know, the mission of the CCDR is to develop responsible global citizens and leaders who will be positive contributors to society and will work on important issues such as global warming, addiction, prejudice, racism, pollution, gender bias, poverty, and education and health care.

355
00:38:08,783 --> 00:38:13,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the kinds of topics the students work on in their own world, in their own level.

356
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Once again, the students pick the projects

357
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:18,188
[SPEAKER_20]: with the help of Mr. Skorka and the other advisors.

358
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,309
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not given to them.

359
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:21,710
[SPEAKER_20]: It's their own ideas.

360
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,432
[SPEAKER_20]: So the projects mean something to them.

361
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:40,404
[SPEAKER_20]: We believe by providing the proper learning activities and engaging students from all backgrounds, we can prevent some of them from being negative behaviors such as addiction to harmful substances and developing negative perceptions of others such as racism and prejudice.

362
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:49,029
[SPEAKER_20]: So not only do projects, by working with students and getting them involved in positive work, they're less likely to go to a negative place.

363
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:57,174
[SPEAKER_20]: And the satisfaction and the feeling of success and creativity is on a positive thing, not a negative thing.

364
00:38:57,434 --> 00:39:07,200
[SPEAKER_20]: And we'd like to start that as early as possible, so we're putting a strong emphasis next year on K-5 and K-5 in the middle schools next year.

365
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,882
[SPEAKER_20]: So that will be a vibrant program, such as the high school.

366
00:39:11,745 --> 00:39:12,606
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is my opinion.

367
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:17,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Our public education system is the foundation of our democracy and the cauldron of the melting pot.

368
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:28,993
[SPEAKER_20]: We believe that public and private schools must incorporate social-emotional learning, empathy, compassion, and citizenship in the school experience, and to develop student leaders who will combat racism, bigotry, and hate.

369
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:35,276
[SPEAKER_20]: If we fail to do this, we miss an opportunity to have a profound impact on the kind of world we want our children to live in.

370
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:39,198
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's kind of my philosophy and why I'm involved.

371
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:46,342
[SPEAKER_20]: I've spent 40 years in education and always felt that something was missing in education and I think this is it.

372
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:52,005
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we need to do more after school and during school to

373
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:59,897
[SPEAKER_20]: provide an education that creates leaders and positive people and compassion and empathy.

374
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:18,691
[SPEAKER_20]: So, just closing, I'd like to have people who don't know about the CCSR or want more information to go to our webpage, which is on the link of the public school's webpage, and information is there, and so I hope people will go there and check it out.

375
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:20,512
[SPEAKER_20]: And one more thing in closing,

376
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,658
[SPEAKER_20]: There's at least one public school who's doing the same thing next year.

377
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,561
[SPEAKER_20]: I shouldn't say they're doing the same thing.

378
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:31,988
[SPEAKER_20]: They're applying for the Cummings grant with the same model that we have.

379
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:33,370
[SPEAKER_20]: That's Burlington.

380
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:36,996
[SPEAKER_20]: They're going to call it the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

381
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:50,482
[SPEAKER_20]: I think a couple others were of interest, like Lynn and Wakefield, but I would really hope that we have more school districts and schools do this type of program to help make the world a better place.

382
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,563
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, I'm closing.

383
00:40:52,623 --> 00:40:55,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Any questions or comments before I pass it on to Michael?

384
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:59,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you Mr. Trotter for all of your efforts, hard work, getting this off the ground.

385
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:00,366
[SPEAKER_14]: You've done an amazing job.

386
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:01,167
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

387
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:02,727
[SPEAKER_20]: So no questions then.

388
00:41:02,787 --> 00:41:03,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Michael Skorka?

389
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:04,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Skorka!

390
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:06,569
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's the ace?

391
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

392
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:13,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for having us.

393
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:17,402
[SPEAKER_18]: We're so grateful for all of your support over the years.

394
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:21,183
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the fourth year with student involvement in the CCSR.

395
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:24,144
[SPEAKER_18]: When we first started, there were only 18 students.

396
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:26,665
[SPEAKER_18]: That was our first year with the CCSR.

397
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:32,447
[SPEAKER_18]: And last year, you've seen the annual report, 200 active students in the district, K through 12.

398
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:37,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And they created events in which over 1,000 people participated in.

399
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,651
[SPEAKER_18]: throughout the district, which is really exceptional.

400
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:52,021
[SPEAKER_18]: I also am the high school advisor, and at the high school this year, we have 125 students already enrolled and working on 60 projects, and we will get that project booklet to you soon.

401
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,222
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working on the portfolio.

402
00:41:53,583 --> 00:42:03,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Jasper Hsu is actually the project portfolio manager and has been working tirelessly to get all of the information accurate, because we have so many students at the high school level, really lucky to have him.

403
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:13,402
[SPEAKER_18]: So you know, we also, when we're not working on projects, the 60 projects that we mentioned, this year we've also attended and some of you were at the Cummings event.

404
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:19,889
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a really large number of students that participated and went to the Cummings event, which I thought was really nice.

405
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:22,551
[SPEAKER_18]: It was great because he's been so generous to us.

406
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,553
[SPEAKER_18]: It was great to have that collaboration.

407
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:31,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, Senator Jalen has came to our class and talked about the importance of civic engagement, which was wonderful.

408
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:33,216
[SPEAKER_18]: That was just last week.

409
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:38,278
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to be hearing from two students who worked to help the victims in the Merrimack Valley.

410
00:42:38,738 --> 00:42:40,798
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to be coming up and talking about that in just a second.

411
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:44,820
[SPEAKER_18]: As Rich mentioned, the Veterans Day Walk, which is happening this Sunday.

412
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,921
[SPEAKER_18]: We also had a student-run open house, the 8th grade open house, and I think some of you were there as well.

413
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,362
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't have one second free.

414
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:56,125
[SPEAKER_18]: The parents chose to come to us because they're really excited about our program.

415
00:42:56,505 --> 00:43:01,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, one parent mentioned that they're talking about this program in Marshfield, which was outstanding.

416
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,431
[SPEAKER_18]: So, like Rich said, we're expanding and we're really excited about it.

417
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:22,408
[SPEAKER_18]: The newest development, as we'll start this week, is Mr. Tucci and myself and the advisor at the McGlynn Middle School, we're going to be working on an anti-bullying assembly for the McGlynn Middle School and then once we get that all set we're going to be moving that over to the Andrews.

418
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:25,432
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's sort of down the pipeline that's happening.

419
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:33,396
[SPEAKER_18]: As you all know, we've already expanded into all elementary schools and all middle schools.

420
00:43:33,637 --> 00:43:35,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Advisors have been hired for all of those schools.

421
00:43:36,138 --> 00:43:38,019
[SPEAKER_18]: We met on October 29th.

422
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,780
[SPEAKER_18]: It was our first meeting with all of the advisors who were present.

423
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:49,005
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about what their role would be, how I can support them as the coordinator, and also ideas for projects and fundraisers, etc.

424
00:43:49,525 --> 00:43:53,427
[SPEAKER_18]: It was really great to see such enthusiasm throughout the whole district.

425
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:54,888
[SPEAKER_18]: People are really excited about doing this.

426
00:43:55,789 --> 00:44:04,717
[SPEAKER_18]: All programs should be really off the ground either this week or the following week, so anybody in the Medford district can participate in the CCSR K-12.

427
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,061
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I've said everything.

428
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:17,430
[SPEAKER_18]: One more thing is that to foster the collaboration that we were talking about and to build the enthusiasm, what we're going to be doing is we're going to be sending high school CCSR

429
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:25,096
[SPEAKER_18]: students to go to those meetings at the other school to get those kids excited about it, and that should be happening within the next month.

430
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:33,163
[SPEAKER_18]: I know they're going next week, I think it's to the Brooks, and then they'll be hopefully going to every single school as well.

431
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:36,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Does anybody have any questions?

432
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really a question, but I just wanted to say to the students and to yourself, it was so great to see you at the Cummings event.

433
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:57,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was, I thought the students who asked questions did a particularly good job and it was really nice, especially since Mr. Cummings has been so grateful and generous to the CCSR.

434
00:44:57,448 --> 00:45:02,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so grateful to see the students in attendance and to express their gratitude.

435
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:10,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for going and for being there and for all the work you're doing both to Rich, Michael, and to the students.

436
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:11,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

437
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:13,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo.

438
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.

439
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

440
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:16,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

441
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,321
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had a question.

442
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:23,362
[SPEAKER_13]: In the book, I didn't see the Roberts School representative when it represented it.

443
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:27,543
[SPEAKER_18]: Last year, the Roberts was not part of the CCSR.

444
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:32,064
[SPEAKER_18]: But this year, we do have an advisor, Jennifer Devlin.

445
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:34,965
[SPEAKER_18]: She is going to be the advisor for the Roberts.

446
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:36,265
[SPEAKER_18]: So every school is represented.

447
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:38,026
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't have every school represented last year.

448
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,226
[SPEAKER_18]: We were sort of building the program.

449
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,366
[SPEAKER_18]: But every school will be represented this year.

450
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:41,766
[SPEAKER_13]: You know me.

451
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:42,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't miss a thing.

452
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:43,607
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't miss a thing.

453
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:50,633
[SPEAKER_20]: So you know that obviously we advertised to all the schools and just we couldn't make people do it.

454
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:53,536
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone's come forward this year so we're really excited.

455
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:54,857
[SPEAKER_13]: That's excellent.

456
00:45:55,738 --> 00:46:06,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to say how appreciative I am that empathy and the whole child learning is really coming out.

457
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:16,583
[SPEAKER_13]: in these projects, and I think that the joy that they'll get from serving their community will also reflect in everything else they do in life.

458
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:18,946
[SPEAKER_13]: You're inspiring people.

459
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:20,007
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great work.

460
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:20,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

461
00:46:20,548 --> 00:46:21,449
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate that.

462
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:25,047
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Ruggiero, for the community, how often do you guys meet?

463
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:26,968
[SPEAKER_18]: At the high school level?

464
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:28,289
[SPEAKER_18]: At the high school level.

465
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:35,032
[SPEAKER_18]: We meet every other week, and so today we met actually to try to get all of our project portfolio ready and edited.

466
00:46:35,772 --> 00:46:40,594
[SPEAKER_18]: The idea is to meet at least twice a month to sort of check in with projects.

467
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:50,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, of course, on the side, we're checking in with each group individually because there are 60 groups this year, just trying to make sure that the projects are on task and happening.

468
00:46:51,259 --> 00:47:06,045
[SPEAKER_18]: That's been a big struggle, would be the word I'm using, but it's actually been really, like you said, when you see all these projects, it's been really great to see all the passion and enthusiasm the kids have, especially when they get to choose their own projects.

469
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:08,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

470
00:47:09,686 --> 00:47:14,188
[SPEAKER_14]: And for anyone watching, the Veterans Walk is 10 o'clock Sunday morning on Veterans Day.

471
00:47:15,037 --> 00:47:17,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Right here, City Hall, come on over.

472
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:24,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, you wanted some children, children, I'm so sorry, children, some young adults to come up and speak about the program?

473
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:31,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I'd like to invite Tia Balot and Nicole Chin up to speak about helping the victims of the Merrimack Valley.

474
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:42,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Nicole Chin.

475
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:48,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Tia Balot, and we're both juniors at Medford High School, and we are both part of the CSSR program.

476
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:56,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So for one of our CCSR projects, we created a disaster relief drive for the victims of the gas explosions.

477
00:47:56,785 --> 00:48:01,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And about two months ago, on September 13, the Merrimack Valley gas explosions occurred.

478
00:48:02,368 --> 00:48:08,311
[SPEAKER_08]: And the two of us, along with three other students, created a one-week donation drive to help the families that were affected.

479
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:11,853
[SPEAKER_08]: We collected donations from many places, including the mayor's office.

480
00:48:12,513 --> 00:48:16,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And we received over $400 in checks and over 200 bags of donations.

481
00:48:17,015 --> 00:48:25,708
[SPEAKER_08]: My parents rented a U-Haul truck and with Mr. Skorka's help, my family and I drove up to Lawrence and we unloaded the donations to two separate places.

482
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:30,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We donated to the Lawrence Senior Center as well as the Debbie's Treasure Chest.

483
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:31,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

484
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:45,749
[SPEAKER_03]: From this experience, with this project, as well as the CCSR member in general, we've learned a lot, and we've learned what it means to be part of a community and how to be a good citizen.

485
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:52,572
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several issues within our society that we wish to change, and we realize the only way to bring about this change is to do something about it.

486
00:48:53,212 --> 00:48:55,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Being a student means more than just what we learn in school.

487
00:48:55,673 --> 00:48:57,874
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the next generation, and we have the power to change the world.

488
00:48:58,474 --> 00:49:04,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And the CCSR allows us to go beyond our school curriculum and gives us the opportunity to address the problems we see around us today.

489
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:11,983
[SPEAKER_03]: The CCSR program is not only important to Nicole and myself and the members, but it's also important to the improvement of our community.

490
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:20,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives the young people in Medford a voice and the chance to attain the skills needed to become a positive leader and a positive contributor to the world and also to our community.

491
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:29,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And the CCSR has affected our lives greatly and has given us a chance to project ourselves and show what we really are passionate about.

492
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,923
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would like to thank you all for allowing us to speak today and for listening to us.

493
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:34,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

494
00:49:34,865 --> 00:49:39,450
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we would like to introduce our fellow CCSR members, Sam Klugisch and Stephan Langsher.

495
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:48,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Stephan Langsher.

496
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Sam Glogish.

497
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:54,212
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both sophomores at Medford High School and members of the CCSR.

498
00:49:54,833 --> 00:50:04,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And our project this year was to clean up McDonald Park, specifically the waterfront area, boat launch area of the McDonald Park.

499
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:08,879
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both members of the cross-country team, and that is our home course.

500
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:11,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're running races and having practices there.

501
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:14,002
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed a lot of trash, and we didn't really like it.

502
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:27,073
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that on weekends and free days, possibly tomorrow, to go out and collect trash and make it a much nicer space for the community, for the cross-country team and anyone else who might want to be there.

503
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:44,531
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out a couple weeks ago and we found a lot more trash than we thought and it's just made us like we got to do this and we really want to get it as nice as we can so that other people and ourselves in years to come can enjoy it.

504
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:50,077
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not much more to say.

505
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:56,710
[SPEAKER_12]: People have done a really good job.

506
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:09,013
[SPEAKER_12]: CCSR has really allowed us to do such a thing because it's really all about, for us, helping the community, which is pretty much the main goal of the CCSR.

507
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:12,534
[SPEAKER_12]: And we really liked it.

508
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:21,157
[SPEAKER_12]: It really went nicely because we were down there and we saw the trash and I turned to Stephanie and I go, this is our CCSR project.

509
00:51:24,058 --> 00:51:28,301
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like without the CCSR, Medford would be much different than what it is.

510
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:40,709
[SPEAKER_12]: The CCSR really does so much to help the community, to make that sense of citizenship feel really strong in this great city.

511
00:51:43,631 --> 00:52:11,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really proud of all of you and last year I got to meet many of you with some of the projects and what I found astounding was how two people would come in one week and then the next week one of those people would be with a new group so everybody was working on multiple projects at the same time so really accomplishing a lot and with over a hundred students I know that you can really make things happen and we've noticed and we're very very proud of your efforts and how you've built community and you are our next

512
00:52:12,011 --> 00:52:13,865
[SPEAKER_14]: leaders, so congratulations.

513
00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:31,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, I just wanted to speak on the CCSR because I think it's a fantabulous program.

514
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:39,118
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been running the project portfolio, which you'll be getting next month hopefully, and I've been doing that for three years.

515
00:52:39,558 --> 00:52:46,381
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have seen personally and talked with a bunch of groups on just their amazing projects, whether it be

516
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:52,023
[SPEAKER_17]: cultural inclusivity or environmental improvement or things along that manner.

517
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:56,525
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think one of the greatest parts about it is that these projects are student-led.

518
00:52:57,026 --> 00:53:00,627
[SPEAKER_17]: So they get to choose what manner their project is carried out with.

519
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,030
[SPEAKER_17]: what topic they're going to be focusing on.

520
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:14,456
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have amazing people like Mr. Richard Trotta and like a Skorka here just to enable us to pursue our passions and really give back to the community.

521
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:20,701
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a program that I really truly endorse and I hope that it continues on into the future.

522
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:21,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

523
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:22,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

524
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:22,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

525
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:27,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

526
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:29,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like to close, Mr.?

527
00:53:29,854 --> 00:53:40,863
[SPEAKER_20]: One more shameless plug, the walk on Sundays is coordinated by City Mayor's office as well as the CCSR, so we want to thank you for providing support for the walk.

528
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:42,484
[SPEAKER_20]: And hopefully we'll see you all there.

529
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:42,885
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

530
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:43,405
[SPEAKER_04]: You bet.

531
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:44,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

532
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:45,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Van der Kloot.

533
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:53,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure whether I can make it on Monday, but I, uh, on Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, but I know that I can start off the donations, so here you go.

534
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:54,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Save her a t-shirt.

535
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:02,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

536
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:03,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you all.

537
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,441
[SPEAKER_14]: What a great, this is a great night.

538
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:06,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

539
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:07,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

540
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:08,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you Sunday.

541
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:09,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

542
00:54:11,145 --> 00:54:15,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Rousseau.

543
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:16,470
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

544
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:16,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

545
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:17,931
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

546
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:18,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

547
00:54:19,873 --> 00:54:24,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on 2018 Medford High School, Medford Volk Technical High School College Fair.

548
00:54:26,114 --> 00:54:30,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to see Amelia Jensen come forward, our Director of Guidance, to update us.

549
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:32,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, good evening everyone.

550
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:33,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.

551
00:54:34,157 --> 00:54:40,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here tonight to present a report on our 2018 MHS and VTHS College Fair.

552
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:56,240
[SPEAKER_06]: 24th, we hosted over 99, no exactly 99 public and private colleges and universities, community colleges, military branches, and support programs and technical schools.

553
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:02,445
[SPEAKER_06]: On the following page you'll see a list of all of the schools that were in attendance.

554
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:08,670
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a yearly tradition that we do and we held it this year in the gymnasium at Medford

555
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:10,669
[SPEAKER_10]: PM.

556
00:55:11,631 --> 00:55:16,259
[SPEAKER_10]: This event was all evening long.

557
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:21,103
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a wonderful mix of 9th through 12th grade students and parents.

558
00:55:21,623 --> 00:55:27,544
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had students and parents not only from the Medford community, but from the surrounding Medford community.

559
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:35,586
[SPEAKER_06]: We invite local and private schools and public schools to come to our high school.

560
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:40,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So not every high school in the area hosts their own college fair, which is why some of them come to ours.

561
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:53,642
[SPEAKER_06]: In conjunction with the college fair, the special education department also hosted a parent and student presentation titled, The Transition to College for Students with IEPs and 504 Accommodation Plans.

562
00:55:54,843 --> 00:56:06,745
[SPEAKER_06]: This presentation's focus was on what students should be doing to prepare for college, the college application process, and what special education students should do to supplement their application.

563
00:56:07,385 --> 00:56:10,307
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a representative from Newberry College there to speak.

564
00:56:11,028 --> 00:56:24,218
[SPEAKER_06]: She was the Disability Services Coordinator, and she spoke about the transition planning and being able to identify what supports are available in colleges to help students transition.

565
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Overall, this was a very successful evening, so I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.

566
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone have any questions for Ms.

567
00:56:32,885 --> 00:56:33,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Jensen?

568
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:34,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

569
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:34,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostona?

570
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:38,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a question, but just it goes with your college fair night.

571
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:46,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow night at the Danvers Port Yacht Club, there's over 20 military colleges and universities who have their own college fair.

572
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:47,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

573
00:56:47,858 --> 00:56:49,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone had asked me to share that.

574
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:54,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So tomorrow is Wednesday, November 7, 7 p.m.

575
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:58,823
[SPEAKER_07]: at Danvers Port Yacht Club, over 20 military colleges and universities.

576
00:57:00,123 --> 00:57:00,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's FYI.

577
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:02,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday or Tuesday?

578
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:03,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday.

579
00:57:03,204 --> 00:57:04,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday the 7th.

580
00:57:05,285 --> 00:57:06,005
[SPEAKER_07]: November 7th.

581
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

582
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:08,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

583
00:57:10,506 --> 00:57:11,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Did anyone else?

584
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:11,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

585
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:12,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Domenico?

586
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:18,008
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had a quick question on students with IEPs and 504 plans.

587
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:22,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Is their presentation the same time as the college night?

588
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:26,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Because some students could go to that presentation and still need to go.

589
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:33,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we plan to have that at 5.30 to 6.30 and then the college fair starts at 6.30.

590
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:40,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So parents can come early, parents and students can come early, see that presentation in the Karen Theater and then still make the college fair.

591
00:57:41,281 --> 00:57:41,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.

592
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,382
[SPEAKER_14]: This already happened?

593
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:42,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

594
00:57:43,302 --> 00:57:49,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just making sure that when it's planned it's not at the same exact time so that students had an opportunity.

595
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:52,818
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

596
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:58,500
[SPEAKER_22]: So what's the process for colleges getting on this list?

597
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

598
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:03,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So we invite every college who has previously come.

599
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:11,744
[SPEAKER_06]: We also look at what colleges students have applied to to see what their current interest is and what the interest was in previous years.

600
00:58:12,504 --> 00:58:16,245
[SPEAKER_06]: We invite about 300 or more colleges every year.

601
00:58:17,066 --> 00:58:21,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And then colleges that, for one reason or another, we didn't find out about it because we're in their

602
00:58:22,927 --> 00:58:25,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember what it's called, but it's the registry for college fairs.

603
00:58:25,508 --> 00:58:30,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're in that so they can see what college fairs are in the area and sign up for it.

604
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:41,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, if there are, for some reason, there are schools from the southwestern part of the United States visiting the northeast during that time, they will usually come to our college fair.

605
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:44,859
[SPEAKER_22]: That's awesome.

606
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:46,240
[SPEAKER_22]: And 99 is a big number.

607
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,641
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure it must be fun to fit them in there.

608
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:51,763
[SPEAKER_22]: But what is the capacity of, like,

609
00:58:52,305 --> 00:58:55,106
[SPEAKER_22]: If we had 300 show up, would you be able to manage that?

610
00:58:55,806 --> 00:59:06,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we could manage... We had 110 tables and that was somewhat squeezing it, but we could always... What we have done in the past is we've put 3 to every 2 table.

611
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know the math on that, but I think we could probably squeeze about 200.

612
00:59:11,352 --> 00:59:15,213
[SPEAKER_06]: The issue would, I think, become parking if we did that.

613
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:17,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

614
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:23,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Agiro, seconded by Ms.

615
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:24,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Mustone.

616
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:25,132
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

617
00:59:25,152 --> 00:59:25,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

618
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:26,673
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

619
00:59:27,154 --> 00:59:27,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

620
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:28,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

621
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:36,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and can I also say that on Wednesday night, November 7th, we're having our financial aid night and a MIFA representative will be in attendance.

622
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,443
[SPEAKER_06]: She also works at Tufts in the financial aid department and she'll be putting on a presentation.

623
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:41,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

624
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:42,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

625
00:59:42,024 --> 00:59:42,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

626
00:59:44,926 --> 00:59:46,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on elementary highlights.

627
00:59:47,412 --> 00:59:49,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Our associate superintendent, Ms.

628
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:50,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Diane Caldwell.

629
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:52,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Such a good night for me.

630
00:59:55,496 --> 00:59:59,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Every once in a while, you start really positive and we end really positive.

631
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:02,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for indulging me this evening.

632
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:09,339
[SPEAKER_09]: The superintendent did allude to some of the wonderful events that are taking place in our elementary buildings earlier.

633
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:18,241
[SPEAKER_09]: One was the multicultural week at the McGlynn Elementary School where they had step dance and Irish folktales, art and food, and a fashion show.

634
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:24,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And students would come to the microphone early in the morning to say good morning in their native language.

635
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:29,325
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Columbus Elementary School, some of you, maybe all of you, attended.

636
01:00:29,405 --> 01:00:31,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I was busy at the high school that day.

637
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:36,648
[SPEAKER_09]: But we had Jump Start read for the record, maybe something beautiful, a book that was read.

638
01:00:36,748 --> 01:00:44,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go to Pepe's Gas Station, you can see the beautiful artwork to make that connection, highlighting building literacy.

639
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:49,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dr. K told me over 420 participants to jumpstart.

640
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:54,075
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Roberts School, I was proud to attend their STEM fair.

641
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:57,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Cieri was there as well.

642
01:00:57,516 --> 01:01:01,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to thank Joanne McKay, a fourth grade teacher, and Ms.

643
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Rodriguez, who organized that.

644
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:10,140
[SPEAKER_09]: The children learned to make kazoos, volcanoes, engineering, seedy spinners,

645
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:15,641
[SPEAKER_09]: And my very favorite one was gumdrop engineering activity.

646
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:20,882
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be surprised how you put those gumdrops together, although I wanted to eat them too.

647
01:01:21,703 --> 01:01:30,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Brooks Elementary School, we had a fall fest where there was games, crafts, food and entertainment, as well as an open mic night.

648
01:01:30,545 --> 01:01:36,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if any of you have ever gone to that, but Michael Allen usually does that and does a phenomenal job.

649
01:01:37,246 --> 01:01:40,107
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very happy to talk about the elementary highlights.

650
01:01:40,787 --> 01:01:49,093
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, we do literacy nights and math nights as well as our STEM nights, and I'm happy to get those dates to you when they come up and invite you all to that as well.

651
01:01:49,853 --> 01:01:56,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe in the next few meetings, we'll be able to highlight the McGlenn Middle School and the Andrews Middle School highlights.

652
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:57,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?

653
01:01:57,718 --> 01:01:57,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

654
01:01:57,778 --> 01:02:04,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Caldwell, could you mention the Read for Bingo, the Reading Bingo that's taking place this evening?

655
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:12,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you know, sometimes I forget about my many hats that I wear, so thank you, Superintendent Vincent.

656
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:24,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, Title I is sponsoring Bingo for Books, and so my Title I staff, this is all organized, I must say, by Michelle, my mighty Michelle, I call her.

657
01:02:24,772 --> 01:02:34,397
[SPEAKER_09]: We had, this began at about 5 o'clock, and we had pizza about 5.30 with the kids, and the staff

658
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:39,628
[SPEAKER_09]: family that's including parents.

659
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:47,054
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this is November's National Literacy Month, so we talk a little bit about the importance of literacy and reading to your children.

660
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:50,396
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we play bingo for books for the kids.

661
01:02:50,617 --> 01:02:57,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And the prize is, you guessed it, a book or a bunch of books at the end of the evening.

662
01:02:57,082 --> 01:02:59,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, thank you for bringing that up.

663
01:03:01,025 --> 01:03:01,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions?

664
01:03:01,605 --> 01:03:01,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

665
01:03:01,746 --> 01:03:02,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any questions?

666
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept the report and place it on file?

667

[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_14]: None.

675
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:16,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_14]: of those that were murdered at the Temple of Worship Synagogue in Pittsburgh.

[SPEAKER_14]: Our thoughts and prayers are with them and the whole community, including our own Jewish community, that we feel the pain with them.

688
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:33,457
[SPEAKER_14]: And also the first responders that ran into the synagogue to help those and also got injured in the line of duty.

689
01:04:33,877 --> 01:04:35,158
[SPEAKER_14]: So our thoughts and prayers are with them.

690

[SPEAKER_14]: That looks like it's it.
