And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792

And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:42,931
All right.

10
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:44,512
Thank you so much for joining me tonight.

11
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:48,215
If you don't mind by just sharing your name and pronouns and a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:50,996
My name is Len Glyona.

13
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:52,477
He, him.

14
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:55,079
I'm a lifelong resident of Medford.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,480
Thanks Len.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,844
So the question that we ask everybody on the podcast is what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

17
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:06,604
Well, for Chinese food, I like Tiki Island.

18
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:11,226
And for Italian, I like Amici's in West Medford Square.

19
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:14,348
And I like Rosso's.

20
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:21,111
And every Saturday morning, a group of us go to Classic Cafe on the corner of

21
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:29,698
It's Central Ave and Spring Street, which is run by a very nice Albanian family.

22
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:34,942
And we meet there every morning, every Saturday morning, nine o'clock, and we talk politics.

23
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:36,675
Sounds fun.

24
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:38,797
Hopefully what we're going to be doing today.

25
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:41,700
So yeah, lots of places to eat in Medford.

26
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,162
Sounds like you've had a sampled quite a few.

27
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:44,803
So great.

28
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:54,013
So yeah, I'm wondering if you could just share a little bit about kind of your path to local politics and what's motivating you to run for city council.

29
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:58,349
I got involved with politics at a very young age.

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:06,434
My father was a member of the Medford Democratic Ward and City Committee, and I joined many years ago.

31
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:13,438
And I've been a delegate to the Democratic State Convention for probably 12 years or so.

32
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,802
And I've run campaigns for candidates.

33
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:37,135
And I've always had a love for local politics and county politics before the Middlesex County former government was eliminated, and statewide politics.

34
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:49,540
And it's always been for, as I said, Democratic politics, politicians, mostly, I would say, moderate to

35
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,334
Back then the term was liberal.

36
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:58,038
Those are the people I tended to support.

37
00:02:59,019 --> 00:02:59,339
Thank you.

38
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:04,824
So yeah, it sounds like some kind of behind the scenes support of local politicians.

39
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:10,950
I know you've kind of supported people that are currently on the city council a little bit in their campaigns.

40
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:15,434
What's motivating you to run for your own seat?

41
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,859
Well, it's been on my bucket list, and I've been running out of time.

42
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:35,514
And as you probably know, I ran Nicole Morrell's campaign four years ago and two years ago with the help of other people, obviously, and when I thought that she—

43
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:41,563
was not going to run and there would be three openings, I thought this was my best chance ever.

44
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:49,294
And so I just decided to pull papers on the last possible day and I jumped in.

45
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,926
Right under the under the gun there.

46
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:52,587
All right.

47
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:53,547
Great.

48
00:03:53,567 --> 00:04:03,794
So is it are there any you know, like, I think a lot of the folks that I've talked to, there was sort of an issue or a set of issues that were kind of priorities for them.

49
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:10,639
So if elected, what would be sort of your priorities for things you'd want City Council to focus on or work on?

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,040
First,

51
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:36,793
issue that I am interested in is having the city build a new fire department headquarters because our firefighters certainly deserve it and I think they should have got a better place to work when the new police station was built but that didn't happen you know for whatever reason probably financial reasons

52
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:47,557
So I would, you know, advocate on the council for allocating the money and suggesting to the mayor.

53
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:51,618
Again, the mayor is the final word on the project of that scope.

54
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:57,340
And hopefully we'll get a new fire department headquarters within the next few years.

55
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:00,984
So fire department kind of number one priority for you?

56
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:01,885
Yes.

57
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:02,405
Okay.

58
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:22,757
What about so in the podcast we try to kind of focus on issues of like diversity and inclusivity in Medford and I wonder kind of you've been here for a long time probably seen different types of changes in the city if you have any thoughts about that sort of how Medford could be more equitable what you know what your role in the City Council would do to focus on that?

59
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:41,506
I was probably one of the first families, my wife and I, that sent sons to the Hervey Magnet School, which was, you know, a school in West Medford on Sharon Street that advocated

60
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:51,533
uh, educated, uh, children, um, of all races to, to work together and to learn together, et cetera.

61
00:05:52,233 --> 00:06:09,908
And I think it was a shame that, that, and it was federally funded, um, but it was under the purview of, um, our school department, you know, our superintendent, our school committee and, um, the class sizes were very small.

62
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,732
They had great field trips, of which I was a chaperone many times.

63
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:21,237
So I guess I can say I walked the walk.

64
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,599
I live on Chandler Road.

65
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:32,425
It's not exactly a walking distance to Sharon Street, but we did it.

66
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:38,790
And then our kids went to the Brooks School, and then they went to Hobbs Junior High, and then they went to Medford High School.

67
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:51,074
So, they've got a great education working with, you know, all nationalities, races, etc.

68
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:58,657
And all three of my sons played sports, and there were a lot of, you know, African American kids.

69
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:15,445
kids from different backgrounds which gave us as a family the ability to meet with people from all walks of life and it made for a well-rounded education for the three boys.

70
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:22,564
It sounds like that kind of element of diversity is important for you, is important for your family, your kids, and their education.

71
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:27,989
And I think, you know, how do you think about that now, like as Medford schools are now?

72
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,212
What do you observe about that?

73
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:37,707
Well, again, my two grandchildren, I have four grandchildren all together.

74
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:44,689
Two live in New York City and Brooklyn, and they actually go to what's called a Quaker school.

75
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:55,752
The two that grew up in Medford went to the Brook school, so they were exposed to kids from, as I said, all walks of life.

76
00:07:56,512 --> 00:08:01,113
But as far as my own personal experience, I spent 12 years in the military.

77
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:17,357
So, you know, I was with African American, Asian American, a lot of Spanish speaking kids, you know, 12 years in the U.S.

78
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:22,298
Army Reserve that, you know, exposed me to a lot of different people.

79
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:38,661
You know, I actually taught GED when I was in the Army to young men that were probably going to be on their way to Vietnam.

80
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:45,347
And they were from primarily African American neighborhoods of Chicago, et cetera.

81
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:48,629
So that was a learning experience.

82
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,975
And during the busing crisis in the 70s, I was working for the U.S.

83
00:08:54,995 --> 00:09:11,792
Department of Health Education and Welfare, and they had a volunteer program that they would send, I was an accountant back then, and they would send us to different Boston schools to volunteer and teach kids in those schools.

84
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:15,887
So I have been exposed and it is important to me.

85
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:16,868
Very important.

86
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:17,269
Yeah.

87
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:31,362
And what about, so I think some, you know, in addition to like inclusivity and diversity in Bedford, over the last year or so there's been this focus on the high school and like some events at the high school around that involve violence.

88
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:58,271
and I think a hot topic too is the state of our high school and the you know the differing opinions about a need for a new high school so and I think all of that filters into a bigger question about our city's budget and how You know there seems to be a real issue every year when we talk about the budget and approve the budget and so I wonder how you think about that playing into your kind of priorities for Medford

89
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,595
Well, let me just back up and say that I graduated Medford High School.

90
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,376
I won't tell you the year because I'll be aging myself.

91
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,737
My wife graduated Medford High and all three of my sons.

92
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:17,860
So a good public education is very important to me and my family and everyone else in the community.

93
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,162
As far as a new high school, I would support expending money to

94
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:36,664
put a study together to see what the needs are, because that high school was built for between 4,500 and 5,000 students.

95
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39,267
Presently, there's a little under 1,200 from what I'm told, like 1,197 students.

96
00:10:49,998 --> 00:11:05,153
I would love to see a brand new, sparkling new high school because when people come to a community, whether they're going to an athletic field like Placid Park, etc., that's the image that the city projects to visitors.

97
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,255
If somebody's coming from

98
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:22,884
you know, Wellesley, Iraq, et cetera, to play on our fields, if the fields have holes in them and people break their ankles, or it's just not aesthetically attractive, I think it sends a bad image for the city.

99
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:26,726
So to have a new high school would be wonderful.

100
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:44,535
the flip side of that is how much would it cost what would the state reimbursement rate be i'm told it would be somewhere between 25 and 30 percent of a 300 million dollar high school say so we would have to

101
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:57,356
As a matter of fairness, because it's the old saying, he who pays the fiddler picks the tune, we have to tell the taxpayers what it would cost them on an average single-family home.

102
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,697
We said 800 more per year, is it 1,000?

103
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,318
And what about a two-family or a three-family or a condominium?

104
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:09,183
So, to be fair to everybody, we have to put the facts and figures out there.

105
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:17,711
Now, could a new high school be placed where it stands?

106
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:26,895
That would probably be the best scenario because I live in that neighborhood and I know the amount of ledge that's up.

107
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:36,819
If you looked at the Field of Dreams, which some people have proposed, and it may work, it'd be a beautiful view of downtown Boston, but how much ledge is under there?

108
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,143
Another issue is a second means of egress.

109
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,729
Right now you have one driveway coming in and out of the high school.

110
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:53,581
I'm told, I've never verified this yet, but you need a second means of egress, you know, for fire apparatus, etc.

111
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:54,582
Where would that

112
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:55,863
Where would that be?

113
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:59,386
Would that be going through one of the abutting neighborhoods?

114
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,827
Would that disrupt the neighborhoods?

115
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:10,493
I mean, you can see just with the 10 lot subdivision on Winthrop Street, what it's doing to that neighborhood and to Winthrop Street.

116
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:17,359
You can imagine, you know, the disruption of a new high school.

117
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:20,081
And what about the disruption to the kids' education?

118
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:23,144
Where do we put the kids while we build that high school?

119
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:32,953
So I'm all for a new high school, but I have to be realistic enough to say we have to study the possibilities and put it to the voters.

120
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,235
Let the voters decide.

121
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,288
Yeah, that seems to be a common refrain.

122
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:45,119
I think when we talk about any of these major changes, same, you know, same with charter view that we're that's, you know, that we're working on at present.

123
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:53,390
Yes, I'm wondering, like any other priorities that you would have for change or or things that you think are going really well that you want to see stay the same.

124
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,562
Well, as you know, you're a member of the Charter Commission.

125
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:56,863
Yes.

126
00:13:57,743 --> 00:14:03,006
And I followed your meetings, and I am a strong advocate for charter change.

127
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:04,927
And I spoke before your body.

128
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:14,372
And my position, my personal position is, ward representation would be a good thing for the city of Medford.

129
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:17,434
And the reason I say that is I look at

130
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,364
just as an example, because my daughter-in-law teaches in Everett.

131
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:24,886
And I follow Everett politics.

132
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:28,549
Not because she teaches it, but I just know some of the people.

133
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:29,369
You're a political guy.

134
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,150
Yeah, right.

135
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,051
It's an abutting city.

136
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:34,513
It's a little smaller than Medford.

137
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:42,079
But 55 people pulled papers to run for municipal office in Medford, in Everett.

138
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:42,700
22 in Medford.

139
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:44,701
Now, Medford's a bigger city.

140
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:46,643
Now, why did that happen?

141
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:48,826
It happened because of ward representation.

142
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:55,554
In each of the wards, there's probably two or three candidates running for a seat, and then they have, I believe, four at large.

143
00:14:56,373 --> 00:15:00,154
in addition to, and this isn't even a mayoral election year in Everett.

144
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:01,495
They have a four-year term.

145
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:07,437
Now, Everett has the advantage of having three local newspapers.

146
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:19,302
We have none, which makes it increasingly difficult for a candidate like myself, who can't buy ads in a newspaper, to run citywide.

147
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:26,727
If it was ward representation, let's say, use me as an example.

148
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:35,593
I live in Ward 3, so the chances I would be running in Ward 3, and there'd probably be other candidates running as well.

149
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:45,260
And if elected as a ward representative, you know, counselor, my focus, you know, primarily would be the issues

150
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:53,227
you know, facing war three residents, which Winthrop Street would be an issue, a new high school would be an issue, etc.

151
00:15:53,827 --> 00:16:01,695
And it also would make it easier for people of limited means to run for office.

152
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:02,696
It would also,

153
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:09,509
make it easier for, say, African-American candidates.

154
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,131
I mean, we've had some in the past.

155
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:17,116
We had Kenny Holmes as a, he was a World War II veteran and he became a city councilor.

156
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:29,526
We've had school committee members, Madeline Duggar Andrews, whose school is named after, and there are others.

157
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:32,569
But we haven't had many.

158
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:40,005
So I think water representation would help that situation.

159
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,252
Yeah, it's interesting to talk to you about this as you're running your campaign.

160
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:57,681
And I think some people have shared their reluctance to ward representation, saying that they would only have one person that they could take their needs to in their ward.

161
00:16:57,841 --> 00:17:03,424
So they kind of talk about that as less representation, which I do personally disagree with.

162
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:07,327
I think that right now, because we have seven city councilors, eight wards,

163
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:10,189
that there's already unrepresented parts of the city.

164
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,031
And we know that those city councilors don't represent all of our wards.

165
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:29,441
So it would be like less resources to run for office, which would mean people with less resources could run for office, but also people that like, you know, might not, they might be doing other things or they might not like, you know, there'd be like an economic diversity, but also a diversity throughout the city.

166
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:36,706
So we're making sure that like some of these neighborhoods, I think a conversation we have a lot about the city is how do we reach all these different, you know, like,

167
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:42,733
Types of people, neighborhoods of people, and having ward representation sounds like a solution.

168
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:44,055
I agree.

169
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:49,261
And just going back to the numbers, we have eight wards, as you said.

170
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:51,604
It was seven up until a few years ago.

171
00:17:53,366 --> 00:18:00,630
But in most cities, if you have ward representation, you have a certain number of at-large candidates.

172
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:12,217
And if you have eight wards, you're going to have to have at least three in order to have an odd number, you know, so somebody can cast a deciding vote in terms of a tie.

173
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:17,640
So realistically, we would have eight ward councils and three at-large.

174
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,281
So we would have a body of 11.

175
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:22,563
then the issue goes to the school committee.

176
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,205
Does the school committee go to ward representation?

177
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,047
And would it have the same format, you know, eight and three?

178
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:42,453
And from what I observe, say, in Malden, which is another city I follow their politics, it seems like the ward counselor and the

179
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:46,476
ward school committee person, they sort of work as a team.

180
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:50,780
They work in tandem on issues that affect their particular ward.

181
00:18:51,020 --> 00:19:02,611
But if a resident has an issue that they don't get satisfaction from their ward representation, they would have three at-large counselors to go to.

182
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,353
And then, you know, again,

183
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:09,655
most of the power in the city rests with the mayor's office.

184
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:18,399
So you get in touch with the mayor or her staff and you know you ask them to in the department heads.

185
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:25,982
Counselors can, they can't direct you know departments to do anything.

186
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:26,582
They can only

187
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:37,029
you know, respectfully requested or, you know, as an elected official, they would call the mayor's office and ask the mayor to look into a situation.

188
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,651
And, you know, she's been very responsive.

189
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:46,216
I've had a situation with a tree and, you know, they answered the question within 10 minutes.

190
00:19:49,578 --> 00:20:00,923
So I think Medford deserves at least an opportunity to put it on the ballot and let the people decide, again, whether or not they want more water at his station.

191
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:09,667
Yeah, no, and I'm glad that you shared kind of your thoughts within that conversation, because I think a lot of candidates—or not a lot, but some candidates might just say, like,

192
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,248
Let's leave it to the people.

193
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:17,370
But I think that there is some education needed for folks, which is part of our work on the committee.

194
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,450
What does this all mean?

195
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,772
What could I even know that I want if I don't understand what we're doing here?

196
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:23,232
Thank you.

197
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:29,515
I'm wondering, any other topics or issues that you would want to take on as a city councilor?

198
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:38,557
Well, the existing council did a wonderful job under the leadership of Nicole Morrell and Zach Beers in terms of the zoning.

199
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:44,739
And zoning changes leads to economic development.

200
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:51,501
You know, I grew up on Hancock Street, the last house on Hancock Street abutting Mystic Avenue.

201
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,642
And when I was a kid,

202
00:20:57,135 --> 00:21:02,781
You know, Mr. Gabb was referred to as the gateway to the city.

203
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:08,646
50, 60 years have gone by and we still don't have the development that we should have down there.

204
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:14,831
We did have, you know, the Century Bank building was awarded a variance to go six stories.

205
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:16,773
But as you travel down,

206
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:31,680
Mr. Gavin you towards Boston the right-hand side of the zone c2 which means commercial two stories and that's to protect the the houses the residents of South Bedford along that stretch of Mr. Gavin you

207
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:41,146
The other side of the street is C4, unless it's been changed with the latest code, and that gives you the right to go up four stories.

208
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,428
That's where the side with the VFW is.

209
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:50,314
Now, the Century Bank building, as I said, got the variance to go up six stories.

210
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:56,538
In my opinion, there's no reason why all along that west side of

211
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:06,278
Mr. Gabb shouldn't, they should be allowed to go six stories and we should have bio labs or we should have apartment buildings.

212
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:13,161
My preference would be apartment buildings with commercial space on the ground floor.

213
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:17,803
As I said earlier before we went on the podcast,

214
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:30,947
I have a son in this family who lives in Brooklyn, and if you go to Brooklyn, almost all your commercial areas, you know, you have the apartments up above the commercial, and it works great.

215
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:35,549
You have markets down below, variety stores, bodegas, etc.

216
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:37,730
So I think

217
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,076
We've really missed the opportunity to develop that west side.

218
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,577
And what does that lead to?

219
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:47,739
Well, it leads to increased tax revenue.

220
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:59,252
I mean, not only is it the building permit fees, it's the restaurant meals taxes that will come in because of what's going to go into those commercial spaces.

221
00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:10,215
And then the annual real estate taxes that the commercial properties are going to bring, that's what will fund the repair of the streets, the removal of the tree stumps.

222
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:12,856
The building of a new high school.

223
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,217
The building of a new high school, a new fire station, etc.

224
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:24,739
And some of our existing fire stations in the neighborhood, up in Fulton Heights or in West Medford or on Salem Street, they certainly need some work.

225
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,841
existing schools.

226
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:30,142
We call them new schools, but it's 22 years now.

227
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,683
They need maintenance.

228
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:36,525
I mean, we've made some, you know, progress.

229
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:51,214
We've got a beautiful new community space and playground going into the McGlynn School under the, you know, leadership of Dr. Peter Cushon and Shanine Pellequin, the resident representative, and

230
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:55,117
And also, we've got a new, beautiful, renovated car park.

231
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:59,280
I went to the dedication, and I understand... I'm excited to see that.

232
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,962
Yeah, I understand you... My neighborhood.

233
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:08,467
Your neighborhood, plus I've heard on Emily's podcast that you were... Are you a broad jumper or a javelin thrower?

234
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,889
Something up a car park, I remember.

235
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:11,910
I think it was the broad jumping.

236
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,971
Broad jumping, all right.

237
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:17,294
But that's going to be beautiful, and for people like myself, new pickleball courts.

238
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,674
Yeah.

239
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:19,395
I'm excited for that, too.

240
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:19,656
Yeah?

241
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,677
Yeah, like lots to look forward to.

242
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:28,823
So one question I like to ask candidates is if there's any advice that they've received that they'd want to pass on to the listeners.

243
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:32,185
Yes.

244
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:45,356
And the advice that I was given by some people that have also been in the city a long time is be the bridge between the old Medford and the new Medford.

245
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,918
And what I mean by that is

246
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:58,652
People that have grown up here have certain values, and they have a way of doing business, so to speak, and their lifestyle.

247
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:03,554
But we have to welcome the new residents that are coming in.

248
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:07,996
There's a reason Medford housing prices are going through the roof.

249
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:15,400
And it's because young professionals are moving here, two-family incomes, they can afford to pay

250
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,946
You know, the prices and pay the property taxes.

251
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:23,071
And they may have a different set of values.

252
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:24,873
They may have more progressive values.

253
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,376
And there's nothing wrong with that.

254
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:37,629
You have to be a bridge to welcome everybody into the community and get people to sit down and talk, because we're all friends and neighbors at the end of the day.

255
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:44,752
And even when this election is over, I mean, I still want to be able to go out and have a drink with any one of the candidates.

256
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:48,634
And I think all 21 people running for office this year are wonderful people.

257
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,651
You know, that's the advice I give.

258
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:56,394
Let's try to work together to make Medford a better place.

259
00:25:56,534 --> 00:25:57,574
It's been a great place.

260
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:02,358
Again, I've grown up here, my wife, my kids, two of my grandchildren.

261
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,821
And there's a lot of room for improvement.

262
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:10,904
But I think we're moving in the right direction.

263
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:12,165
Thank you.

264
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:17,329
And yes, I'm wondering if you have any closing remarks or anything, any kind of events that you want people to know about.

265
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:27,086
I would just respectfully ask the citizens of Medford to give me one of their seven votes.

266
00:26:27,806 --> 00:26:36,955
I think I will be a voice on the council that somebody has seen a lot in life.

267
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:53,571
whether it, you know, be my educational background, you know, in terms of I was an accountant, a lawyer, I've raised a family, I've been in the military, I've worked for the federal government, I've been involved with local

268
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:55,052
issues.

269
00:26:55,152 --> 00:27:02,255
I was on the committee to restudy the, uh, reuse of the old Medford High School on Forest Street.

270
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:09,237
I was appointed by, uh, the mayor to be on the Massport Community Advisory Committee.

271
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:20,421
I was, um, chairman of the Hormel Stadium Commission for four years, and now, uh, Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern appointed me to the Chevalier Theatre.

272
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:27,489
commission, which is integral to keeping our restaurants in business in the city of Medford.

273
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,232
And a fun place to see a concert, for sure.

274
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:31,273
Exactly.

275
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:34,016
We have one coming up, the Wurlitzer Society.

276
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:35,398
Oh yeah, the organ.

277
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,841
The organ, yeah, which I went to last year and it was wonderful.

278
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:39,008
Awesome.

279
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:40,290
Well then, thank you so much for your time.

280
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:40,770
Thank you.

281
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,131
Thank you for accommodating me.

282
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:49,919
Again, daytime is difficult because I get called to substitute teacher on to Catholic, which is where I was this morning.

283
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,582
Thank you, Danielle, and to Shelly as well.

284
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:53,303
Thank you.

285
00:28:03,251 --> 00:28:05,212
Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.

286

Never Bites.

293
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:37,010
Never Bites.

294
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,495
Good job.
