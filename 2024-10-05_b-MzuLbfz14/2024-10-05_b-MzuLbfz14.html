    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=22.505s">President</a>  seven present please rise.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=48.475s">City</a>  Council.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=49.156s">Announcements</a>  accolades, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=57.739s">celebrate</a>  Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and wish our burgeoning AAPI community a happy month. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=62.88s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=63.76s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=65.001s">The</a>  AAPI community in Medford is one of the fastest growing communities in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=71.782s">This</a>  is a wonderful opportunity to wish that community a happy month and also an important opportunity for us to bring up issues that are particularly pertinent to the community that our city council has been very <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=87.746s">proactive</a>  in addressing, and a lot of those solutions now lie with administration and in committees here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=98.251s">But</a>  I had the honor of going down to Boston representing our city at the big AAPI celebration there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=107.175s">And</a>  a lot of those leaders recognized that Medford was on the front lines of a lot of issues that were relevant or important to the AAPI community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=114.599s">So</a>  I think that's something that we can be proud of as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=117.501s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=118.962s">Any</a>  other Councilors wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=121.464s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng, as seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=125.107s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=202.126s">But</a>  a lot of folks don't know that Medford is home to a very rich, a very long standing Jewish community here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=212.172s">And</a>  they've contributed a lot to our development as a city and our growth and our city history. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=218.756s">And</a>  I wanted to take this time to celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=224.619s">And</a>  I know that our city has had a lot of work to do on antisemitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=231.703s">But</a>  we, again, have a proactive council. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=236.105s">Councilor</a>  Collins has been amazing on resolutions to deal with those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=241.107s">And</a>  I think that's something that we can celebrate this month, too.</p>

    <p>[Luis Santos]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=572.605s">Okay,</a>  I'm Luis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=575.446s">I'm</a>  one of the owner of Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=577.026s">I'm</a>  here with my partner tonight, Luciano. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=580.147s">The</a>  reason we're applying for this hours, it's because we've been there for 23 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=586.73s">And</a>  we have so many attendants from around the restaurants, from all the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=591.954s">Their</a>  service finish at 10 o'clock, most of the time on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=599.1s">And</a>  they call us many times to come with a group to celebrate birthday, people from church. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=607.027s">So</a>  if we take the reservation, if we see them like 10.30, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=611.362s">we</a>  got to serve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=612.803s">So</a>  what they want me to do now is like to 11 o'clock to kick everybody out, just trying to, you know, at least have the ability to if they, if they're there, no having dinner, like at 11 o'clock, I have, you know, if they're like go past 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=628.117s">So</a>  I have, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=629.59s">I</a>  want to have the ability to serve them until they're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=631.971s">I</a>  mean, the license we're applying is just to extend to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=636.453s">It's</a>  just to have it, because we're not going to stay there until one o'clock, unless there's an event or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=641.715s">But</a>  most of the time, it's going to be just to have the license, not to go past 11, because for now, we can only serve until 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=648.998s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Geraldo Andrade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=782.413s">Hi,</a>  my name is Geraldo Andrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=783.934s">I'm</a>  the owner of 376 Main Street, the convenience store right across the street from the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=789.096s">And</a>  I would like to speak in favor of them because they helped me improve my business by being there, you know, with the visibility of my business. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=798.021s">And</a>  they also keep their place nice and neat. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=799.902s">So</a>  I think they're both hard workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=802.843s">And</a>  they also <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=805.157s">there's</a>  a lot of employees, so they actually help contribute with the city for taxes and all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=810.218s">So,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=810.979s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=813.94s">We'll</a>  go to Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=816.02s">Are</a>  you speaking in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=817.301s">Okay,</a>  I will unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=822.862s">Good</a>  evening, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=824.483s">I</a>  just wanted to voice from the perspective of economic development that there is a benefit to the community to have <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=833.488s">additional</a>  meals tax, additional liquor tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=836.829s">From</a>  restaurants, we are excited to see a very thriving restaurant down in South Medford and the life that it brings to the square down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=845.651s">And</a>  I just wanted to voice that perspective on that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=849.892s">Thank</a>  you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=851.832s">We</a>  will go to Brant on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=854.113s">Brant,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=856.113s">Oops,</a>  I think I just muted you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=857.954s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=859.314s">There</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Brant Casavant]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=860.19s">Hi,</a>  my name is Brant Casavant. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=862.851s">I'm</a>  a resident at 15 Yale Street, so I'm quite close to Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=867.753s">I'm</a>  in support of Oasis being able to stay open till 1 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=870.934s">I</a>  think it's a great local business. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=872.675s">It's</a>  the center of a lot of diversity around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=875.436s">I've</a>  never had any complaints about them or their staff or their patrons, even though I live right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=881.999s">They</a>  have really good coffee and really good pastries, and it would be nice to have a place around here that stayed open till 1 o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=889.202s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=890.778s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=896.86s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=900.521s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=903.982s">Please</a>  come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=904.742s">You</a>  can line up or you can just come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=907.303s">You</a>  don't have to raise your hands.</p>

    <p>[Ann Fretts]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=918.625s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=919.206s">My</a>  name is Anne Fretz, and I'm a resident at 215 Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=922.569s">I've</a>  been there for 13 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=924.411s">And</a>  Boris, he's one of the trustees of the Lincoln-Kennedy condominium complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=929.376s">He's</a>  directly impacted by whatever happens at Oasis, happens next door to our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=935.283s">This</a>  is the area of Medford, South Medford, that is impacted by <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=941.615s">when</a>  their customers leave their area, when their staff leaves or arrives the area, they use Yale Street or Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=950.578s">They</a>  will depart the area through Dartmouth Street and Princeton Street or scooting down Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=959.3s">We</a>  hear everything that happens in the parking lot, which is used 95% by <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=965.257s">Oasis</a>  customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=967.099s">And</a>  as far as church going customers who were dining in the restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=971.425s">Most</a>  of the parking spaces in the lot are filled up by <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=975.79s">eight</a>  o'clock or 730 if there's an entertainment going on in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=980.133s">So</a>  there's really no place for a church group to be parking, so they would be illegally parking on the streets which is filling up the area, blocking our homes, and when they leave, they're honking their horns the decibel reaches 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=995.402s">DBS</a>  outside our windows, a scream will carry 200 yards at 100 decibels if they're screaming when they enter the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1003.168s">We</a>  have trespassers cutting through the parking lot to get to the other parking lot under our windows and they are arriving to start work at 5 30 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1015.818s">Even</a>  after staying open until I believe it was 12 45 one evening over and above the hours that they stay <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1026.022s">to</a>  stay open. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1027.263s">That</a>  was I think most recently on March 22nd, we had three noise disturbances because not everyone will leave the area at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1036.625s">So</a>  it's a dribble, constant noise hitting all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1040.987s">I'd</a>  like to read our prepared statement, just show you another photo of the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1048.029s">You</a>  can see that we have three story buildings surrounding the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1053.419s">Perhaps</a>  this is easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1054.4s">Is</a>  that better? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1057.963s">And</a>  you also have the same photos in the packets that I handed you, along with documentation of the emails and going back about five years in history. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1068.032s">And</a>  I'll start at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1071.214s">I've</a>  been a resident of Medford for the past 13 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1074.587s">My</a>  home overlooks Yale Street and the neighborhood parking lot, as well as our condominium complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1082.03s">When</a>  the parking lot opened on Yale Street in October, 2010, I realized it needed traffic and directional signs, trash barrels, trash pickup, and the like to function properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1093.355s">There</a>  was no indication the needed items were going to be supplied by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1098.057s">I</a>  asked many at City Hall who would maintain the lot, removing snow and caring for the well landscaped area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1104.44s">I</a>  was surprised to hear that an unwritten agreement required the new 50 condo owners, me being one of them, to be responsible for the care and feeding of the public lot, all of which was designed for the neighborhood use and Main Street businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1120.031s">Condo</a>  owners who were responsible for the lot were not allowed to park in it or on Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1126.649s">At</a>  that time there was no method home mention of any main street business owner or tenant being responsible for all of the maintenance of the 40 spaces, nor has there been any assumption of responsibility and or involvement in maintaining the lot or asking for support from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1145.245s">of</a>  any of the Main Street businesses as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1148.287s">My</a>  neighbor, Dave Propella, and I continue to remove the trash, discarded beer bottles, dog poop from people coming by, handles, and nips every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1159.136s">The</a>  lot is now full to capacity every day, with 95% of the spate used by Main Street owners, staff, and their customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1166.441s">Many</a>  of them are taking advantage of the lack of parking enforcement in the lot and on the street, blocking residents' driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1174.838s">bragging</a>  about not having to pay to park in the public parking lot because there's no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1180.683s">This</a>  is a 24 hour situation for all of us down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1184.952s">And</a>  again, the 100 residents of Lincoln Kennedy hear all of the voices, the screams, the backfiring engines, with the Ford 250 trucks having a decibel level of 100 when they backfire, and the horns are at 100 decibels as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1200.416s">There</a>  isn't a sound machine that exists on the market today that covers anything beyond 85 dBs. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1206.768s">I</a>  used to work at Boat, Brannigan Newman, the acoustic specialist, so I understand all this. <a

requested the installation of safety measures such as bollards and signs for the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1221.637s">We</a>  also contact the MPD to deal with disturbances or aberrant behavior and alert the DPW, like we did yesterday, and trash, snow, weeds, and animal or human waste, which we found yesterday, needs to be removed. <a

down the area and the public's perception of our neighborhood, and our condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1247.714s">The</a>  lot was renovated in fall of 2021 based on a plan I submitted in 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1254.419s">and</a>  again in 2021, I'm sorry, 2020 to Mayor Luongo-Cohen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1261.143s">Oasis</a>  owners were asked for the input on the plan, but they did not respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1265.146s">The</a>  city of Medford, the creator of the rules, city ordinances, licenses, and permits that organize our lives in Medford, has basically abandoned our neighborhood, our residential neighborhood, in favor of the success of one Main Street commercial for-profit business. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1280.336s">The</a>  city is leaving control of the conditions in our neighborhood and quality of our lives in the hands of voices owners to very nice guys who market a great and inexpensive product, while building a booming late night entertainment venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1295.783s">Unfortunately,</a>  Oasis patrons and the staff continue their parties and activities from the bar into our residential neighborhood where they continue to celebrate life past midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1307.171s">And</a>  that's with the 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1308.672s">closing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1309.913s">Abutters</a>  have always had noisy issues emanating from the Yale Street lot and have notified Oasis about every issue we have encountered. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1319.32s">and</a>  we've started ignoring them, but we still haven't had a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1323.022s">It's</a>  been exacerbated since middle of March, when the entertainment venues started ending at 1 a.m., 11.30, 12.30, or whenever. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1334.309s">They</a>  determined their own path. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1336.931s">Should</a>  Oasis be granted a special permit to operate until 1 a.m., the commercial customers will be in our residential zone until 2 a.m., with their staff waking us again at 5.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1348.799s">when</a>  they arrive to open the cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1351.542s">for</a>  the behavior of their customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1353.323s">Since</a>  2010 Oasis owners have stated they are not responsible for the behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1356.324s">Their</a>  customers are not culpable for the actions of their staff. <a

    <p>[Anita Dantonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1442.573s">Good</a>  evening needed Antonio 14 Yale Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1447.438s">I</a>  am in opposition to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1449.92s">You</a>  can have all your permits in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1453.203s">The</a>  law may be on your side, but there's an issue in its quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1458.529s">And</a>  as residents, we have been drawn into <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1462.445s">a</a>  commercial zone, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1464.826s">First,</a>  because there was a parking lot put right in the middle of our homes, which means that anybody coming from any business on Main Street who is parked in that lot has to cross in front of our homes in order to get to that lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1484.956s">On</a>  top of that, and that's a lot of foot traffic in itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1490.658s">There</a>  has been, there's another issue besides quality of life, which reflects that, and that is a total lack of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1501.125s">Parking,</a>  Board of Health, whatever, I mean, code enforcement, it is catch as catch can. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1511.131s">It's</a>  not consistent, it's not regular, so therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1517.375s">People</a>  completely ignore residential parking, park in front of homes, block driveways, and a majority of this comes from the restaurant, Oasis Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1530.718s">I</a>  don't care if it's from Bocelli's, Maze Cafe, where it's from. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1535.599s">If</a>  one of those establishments came and asked for a 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1539.44s">closing,</a>  I would be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1542.141s">I</a>  don't want that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1543.902s">They</a>  are intruding on a residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1546.403s">11</a>  p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1547.824s">is</a>  sufficient unless we're deciding that we want to turn Main Street into an entertainment zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1554.027s">I</a>  would like to ask about the church attendance at Oasis after services. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1563.631s">Is</a>  this seven days a week or is this on a Sunday? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1566.773s">Is</a>  this the primary reason as to why they want to stay open until 1 a.m.? ? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1572.456s">It's</a>  to me, and there are so many issues with this I've lived with it so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1579.261s">We've</a>  tried to be good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1582.358s">It's</a>  very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1584.839s">As</a>  I said, block driveways, you call the parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1590.62s">First</a>  of all, you don't get anyone on the phone, you get a voicemail. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1594.482s">They</a>  have a very, very minimal staff there, and they're supposed to cover the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1600.463s">We</a>  have a chronic problem on that first block of Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1606.205s">It</a>  also is a safety problem and this this is owing to what the restaurant attracts in the morning and afternoon, it's like a truck stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1615.828s">We</a>  have a lot of commercial vehicles that park. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1618.729s">And</a>  then in the evening you have another group of people, they also ignore the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1624.871s">I've</a>  worked with this for so long, without any <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1629.892s">any</a>  good result at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1631.673s">As</a>  a matter of fact, none. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1633.114s">There</a>  is no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1634.675s">That's</a>  if you can't cure the enforcement problem, then you shouldn't be extending hours to 1am. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1642.519s">Really,</a>  because it's, it's, it's very distressful I can say chapter and verse instances that have occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1651.443s">whether</a>  it's your nation, broad daylight, whether it's blocking driveways, whether it's it's nasty talk coming from patrons, when you tell them that it's a residential parking area, please go down to the parking lot, 40 car parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1670.435s">And</a>  this still continues completely ignore the signs, no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1675.858s">So</a>  now we're going to have this until 1am. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1679.504s">And</a>  what enforcement can you guarantee? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1682.667s">Can</a>  you tell me that there'll be somebody from parking department in Medford there to make sure no one is overstaying when they shouldn't overstay? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1693.074s">Will</a>  we have the police officers down there on a detail to see that people aren't driving drunk out of that lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1699.919s">I</a>  mean, there's a lot of dynamics with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1702.801s">And</a>  we can say, well, it's all legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1708.045s">But</a>  what is right, and what is quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1711.547s">The</a>  question comes down to do we as residents have a quality of life and peaceful enjoyment of our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1719.412s">We're</a>  just touching the surface with regard to the problems I have with a racist, believe me, whether it's working on getting them to close dumpsters, getting more dumpsters, cleaning up the alleyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1733.64s">I</a>  mean, it's just, it's beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1736.382s">We</a>  also have the, we have a bus stop that's non-existent anymore because it's used as a parking area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1743.285s">Today</a>  I went by, entirely encompassed with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1747.527s">Now,</a>  it can be the other, and let's, what about the other businesses on the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1752.43s">They</a>  don't have an opportunity to have people park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1755.351s">There's</a>  one particular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1757.232s">It's</a>  in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1758.093s">You</a>  go in and you buy something, you come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1761.094s">That</a>  business is, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1763.889s">the</a>  customers never get an opportunity to park on Main Street, never. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1769.094s">Very,</a>  very rarely. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1770.235s">And</a>  also when these cars are parking, they're not parking there for 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1775.625s">We</a>  have people who park there for an hour, two hours in front of your homes on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1781.309s">No</a>  enforcement, again.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1973.815s">I'm</a>  gonna go actually, I'm gonna go to Ron D on Zoom and then we'll come back to in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1982.15s">Ron.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Del Gesi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1983.671s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1984.531s">My</a>  name is Ron Del Gesi. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1986.391s">I'm</a>  a resident and owner of the property at 356-358 Main Street, and I'm a veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=1992.513s">And</a>  my family and I have owned this property since 1978, and we've seen the various shifts in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2000.456s">And</a>  to reiterate what prior speakers have said, we've seen a significant decrease in the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2008.018s">Specifically,</a>  we've seen a lot of parking transgressions. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2014.0s">In</a>  fact, let me state for the record that 356, 358 Main Street, as well as my neighbors at 360 and 362, we live between Wright Ave and Golden Ave, which is about 75 yards or 100 yards away from the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2028.385s">And</a>  we do not have resident parking only signs in front of our houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2035.347s">As</a>  a result, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2036.387s">We</a>  can't park on the side street because we don't have the resident permit, even though we've lived here for nearly 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2042.791s">And</a>  yet we have people from Oasis who park in front of our houses all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2048.234s">In</a>  fact, if you want, I can send you a photograph which I took yesterday morning of a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2053.59s">whose</a>  dashboard had a sign on it that says Oasis Steakhouse Driver. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2059.157s">And</a>  that was at 5.30 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2061.8s">And</a>  to correct some of the speakers, these people don't just show up at 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2066.025s">They're</a>  there at 4 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2068.728s">And</a>  again, they stay there all night, all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2071.731s">And</a>  it's really frustrating to even try to get out of my driveway when it's partially blocked, completely blocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2078.994s">And</a>  to add injury to all of this, when these people, whether they're patrons or staff, finally leave the restaurant, they're not quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2089.138s">As</a>  other people have indicated, they make a commotion, not all the time, but it's significant and frequent enough to be noticeable that there are loud arguments, loud discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2101.262s">doors</a>  opening and closing, and it's just not a very good quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2106.724s">And</a>  as far as setting the record straight, too, there were two prior speakers in favor of the petition who referred to Oasis being a Medford Square, which is absolutely incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2118.247s">This</a>  is South Medford, and as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2120.488s">D'Antonio</a>  said, it's at the bus stop, which has now become <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2125.689s">practically</a>  obsolete. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2127.39s">So</a>  we're talking about South Medford, not Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2130.672s">I</a>  wish the best in business opportunities for all businesses throughout Medford, but we, the residents, sacrifice a tremendous amount of quality of life and personal sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2143.578s">Furthermore,</a>  I noticed that the petition talks about wanting to extend the hours from Sunday through Saturday, which is rather a strange way of phrasing it because essentially they're talking about seven nights or seven days and nights a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2159.445s">I</a>  could understand if they said they want to extend it on the weekend, Saturday and Sunday, but saying Sunday through Saturday basically runs through every day of the week and then the cycle starts again on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2169.269s">So</a>  it makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2173.554s">I</a>  think that's all I would like to say because I can go on for hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2177.017s">But</a>  again, maybe one way to solve this at least for the residents here on Main Street would be to install some resident parking only signs and give us the opportunity to have a place to place our vehicles and also to give us some visitor passes when we have people visiting us, they also have no place to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2201.636s">So</a>  at a start, to eliminate the parking problem, at least city council should consider the area between Wright Ave and Golden Ave, install resident parking only signs, give us those resident permits, give us some visitor passes, and that would at least eliminate the abuse, the terrible abuse of parking, noise, commotion, and congestion that the Oasis Restaurant has brought over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2227.697s">And</a>  I appreciate the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2231.1s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Martinello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2243.948s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2244.328s">My</a>  name is John Martinello, right after Medford, Massachusetts, resident since 1967. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2252.753s">So</a>  I've been there a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2254.786s">And</a>  just wanted to, I'll probably reiterate what everybody said, so I'll try to be shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2261.087s">Yeah,</a>  this is a residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2265.208s">I</a>  just want to make it clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2266.388s">It's</a>  seven days a week, 11 to 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2271.769s">I</a>  wish it was like that when I was a teenager. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2274.269s">I</a>  mean, when I was younger, I wouldn't have to go to Faneuil Hall to party. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2278.75s">I</a>  mean, if I'm that age, guess where I'm going? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2280.93s">I'm</a>  going to Oasis and save the bus ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2286.644s">The</a>  other thing is, I guess the city council has to give this special permit only if it does not adverse the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2300.357s">But</a>  the parking, I live on Wright Avenue, and the parking, especially on the weekends, is completely unenforceable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2306.422s">And</a>  people are parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2310.337s">with</a>  no permits, you don't know who's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2312.579s">There's</a>  potholes on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2315.22s">I</a>  mean, I've took pictures today, there's potholes everywhere, which just enhanced the rambling of the commercial trucks that go pounding down that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2323.486s">And</a>  a lot of them come from the businesses up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2329.23s">Just</a>  a couple more quick notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2331.272s">Also</a>  11 to one, seven days a week, does that set a precedent? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2336.206s">for</a>  the rest of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2337.307s">Will</a>  all the other liquor license establishment come up and petition for that as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2344.472s">What</a>  clientele is coming at 11 to 1 p.m.? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2347.574s">I</a>  know the business owners and I respect business owners for their ability to make a profit and make a living. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2356.281s">But</a>  what clientele is coming at 11 to 1? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2358.783s">They</a>  suggested church people come at 11 to 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2361.324s">I</a>  would like to see the evidence if they can provide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2368.173s">Currently</a>  they're open 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2369.814s">and</a>  they want to go to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2370.754s">That's</a>  19 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2372.075s">I</a>  don't know what other business does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2376.597s">And</a>  just a couple more items. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2378.838s">The</a>  enforcement, which is not party to the special permit, but the enforcement on parking on Ride Ave is just non-existent. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2388.202s">I've</a>  had cars there park 12, 15 days with no tickets on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2394.665s">And</a>  also with respect to the business, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2398.335s">some</a>  of the other residents have mentioned that this particular business is creating a monopoly in the area, and that can only be suppressed by rules and city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2410.618s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Perella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2425.68s">Hi,</a>  my name's David Perrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2427.682s">I</a>  live at 16 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2429.443s">I've</a>  been a resident of Medford since 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2431.465s">Anne</a>  Fretz put the petition together, so I would like to read it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2441.262s">So</a>  dear city council members, we the undersigned concerned residents are writing this petition to strongly oppose the proposed extension of the operating hours of Oasis restaurant to 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2456.906s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm a little anxious here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2461.048s">We</a>  are deeply concerned about the negative impacts such an extension would have in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2466.298s">public</a>  safety is our top priority, and we fear that the late night crowds and activities could increase the risk of crime and accidents in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2475.685s">Furthermore,</a>  late night noise disruptions have been a major issue for residents who live near the restaurant and those who home surround the public parking lot where Oasis customers park. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2489.009s">The</a>  current operating hours until 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2491.492s">are</a>  already causing disturbances during the late night, and an extension until 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2496.137s">would</a>  only exacerbate the issue, with the disruptive activities in the parking lot continuing until 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2503.705s">We</a>  believe that everyone has the right to a peaceful sleep, and that this extension would be a serious threat to our well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2511.162s">Additionally,</a>  both Oasis customers and staff have shown a constant disregard for the abutters and residents in the area for the past decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2519.544s">And</a>  I can personally attest to that as a direct abutter of the restaurant and the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2527.186s">We</a>  have witnessed instances of Oasis patrons littering, parking violations, block driveways, trespassing, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2535.279s">staggering</a>  public urination and exhibition of general disruptive behavior, such as blasting music, honking horns, screaming and drivers blocking roads close to midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2546.646s">This</a>  is unacceptable and has already caused considerable consternation and frustration for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2553.61s">We</a>  therefore urge you to reject the proposal to extend the operating hours of Oasis Restaurant 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2560.072s">We</a>  believe that the negative impacts on public safety, noise disruptions, and residents' quality of life outweigh any potential benefits to Oasis owners and patrons by such a move. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2573.157s">We</a>  ask that you prioritize the well-being and safety of residents in the South Medford community over the interests of the restaurant owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2581.519s">Thank</a>  you for your attention to this matter.</p>

    <p>[David Perella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2589.629s">And</a>  if I could just add something about like parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2594.106s">If</a>  I work late and come home around 10 o'clock, I am unable to park in front of my own home, and I will have to circle my own neighborhood waiting for Oasis customers to exit, hoping that one of them is the patron who illegally parked in front of my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2610.897s">If</a>  you extend this to 1 a.m., now I'm gonna have to go park at a great distance from my own home, and I'll be parking illegally in that instance as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2621.323s">And</a>  I also have to say that there is a tremendous amount of food waste being dumped into that parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2628.787s">Oftentimes</a>  they'll take food from Oasis, eat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2632.049s">It</a>  often doesn't make its way into the barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2634.371s">It's</a>  on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2635.492s">I've</a>  got a dog that I have to worry about, but it has also dramatically increased the rodent population in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2643.697s">And</a>  oftentimes they're broken beer bottles, broken wine bottles. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2648.12s">Those</a>  bottles that aren't broken often contain urine. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2650.862s">And</a>  as Anne Fred said earlier, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2653.163s">and</a>  I go through that lot almost on a daily basis, removing these absolutely disgusting items. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2659.266s">And</a>  most recently, human feces was found. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2662.648s">So</a>  the problems are only getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2666.689s">So</a>  I truly urge you not to approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2670.351s">And</a>  I just really want you to consider that as residents, we have standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2676.174s">So</a>  I've heard that you have to approve this, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2682.068s">unless</a>  there is a compelling reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2684.289s">Well,</a>  there is a compelling reason, and that is every resident in South Medford who stands opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2690.131s">So</a>  please do not approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2692.572s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2693.432s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2693.712s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2696.513s">At</a>  this time, we're just gonna have people speak once at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2705.876s">They</a>  just need to raise their hand if they're on Zoom, so they can turn their camera on and wave, they can raise their hand, I'll see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2711.981s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Lorenzo Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2715.024s">Lorenzo</a>  Puccio, Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2718.386s">So</a>  I agree with what everyone behind me has said on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2723.25s">I've</a>  been there 30 years, and these two gentlemen are two of the nicest gentlemen that there are in our city as business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2731.537s">I</a>  know them personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2734.071s">The</a>  problem that we have is quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2738.312s">That's</a>  what's gonna be disrupted. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2739.552s">There's</a>  no such thing as giving a permit out until 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2743.873s">because</a>  that's a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2744.793s">That</a>  permit that you're giving out is gonna be till 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2748.514s">No</a>  one leaves at 1230 and they're out by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2752.715s">It</a>  doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2753.395s">I</a>  was in the restaurant business 22 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2755.635s">That</a>  doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2756.975s">Back</a>  in 2000 is the last time I was in front of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2760.82s">And</a>  in 2000, not this particular body, obviously, but the council that was here stopped a Chinese restaurant from opening where Oasis is located now, because the amount of people that they were gonna see was gonna be disruptive to the city and to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2777.21s">So</a>  that council stopped it back in 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2780.572s">Some</a>  people behind me will remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2782.653s">Some</a>  people that haven't lived there that long won't remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2786.704s">My</a>  other fear is what's going on with Pacelli right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2790.225s">They're</a>  selling, they're not selling, they're having problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2793.186s">What</a>  happens when someone moves in there and renovates? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2796.467s">What</a>  happens while they have that license? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2798.988s">I</a>  don't know what their seating capacity is. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2801.989s">I</a>  don't know what Pacelli seating capacity is, but now we just doubled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2805.991s">So</a>  now that parking lot of 40 cars cannot support both those restaurants at their seating capacity as it is now, people are complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2817.409s">As</a>  far as trash and litter, I can't attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2822.731s">Maybe</a>  some other people can. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2823.952s">I</a>  don't have that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2827.713s">In</a>  the last month, my driveway has turned into a port-a-party twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2831.195s">I</a>  got cameras in front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2834.196s">I</a>  can't point the finger at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2836.497s">But</a>  I know Bocelli's doesn't stay open late. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2839.298s">So</a>  those patrons are coming from somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2844.7s">I</a>  really want this council to consider <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2847.603s">that</a>  what everyone has said tonight is based on, I think Anita said it best, and that's enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2856.145s">We</a>  need enforcement from the city, whether it be parking, whether it be the police, and they got their hands full. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2863.026s">If</a>  enforcement is done properly, then that may help the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2868.527s">But</a>  I cannot approve, my bedroom is the first bedroom in front of that, is the closest to that exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2876.465s">and</a>  I cannot approve of people coming out of there up until two in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2883.291s">And</a>  with that, I have to go home and watch the Celtics lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2886.534s">So</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Larry Fretts]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2975.065s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2977.206s">My</a>  name is Larry Fretz. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2979.126s">I</a>  live at 215 Harvard Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2983.345s">First,</a>  I want to thank Anne for a great presentation, sort of outlining what we're faced here in this South Mefford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=2991.528s">I</a>  also wanted to add that Anne collected close to 60 signatures of folks on Yale Street and 215 for opposition to this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3005.714s">I</a>  think the bottom line to the problems we're having around the Yale Street lot and the impact oasis <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3013.787s">is</a>  having and exacerbating them could be addressed probably and mitigated to a certain degree if the police were able to surveil the area on a more frequent basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3026.875s">But</a>  I understand that the police have limited resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3031.177s">God</a>  bless Chief Buckley, he's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3033.739s">And</a>  more pressing issues than dealing with drunk, rowdy, and unruly customers who engage in public urination <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3041.948s">bowel</a>  movements, vomit, drug, and sexual activity in the L street lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3049.551s">Unfortunately,</a>  this lack of enforcement leaves this neighborhood to fend for itself unless some controls are put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3059.114s">And</a>  one of those controls is right in front of the city council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3063.216s">And</a>  that should not be, that should be not granting a 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3067.237s">closing</a>  to Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3069.792s">By</a>  the way, there is a precedent for restriction by a town on a restaurant opening at that hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3075.855s">Arlington</a>  passed a bylaw in 2019, allowing the restaurants or preventing the restaurants from 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3086.101s">closings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3087.402s">So</a>  tonight, I respectfully request the city council take a vote that will help homeowners in South Medford maintain their right to a quiet and secure neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3098.607s">I</a>  oppose this application and implore the city to reject it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3103.293s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3103.714s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3105.896s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition who has not already spoken? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3113.126s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the meeting is closed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3117.555s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3118.636s">Thank</a>  you to everybody who has shared their views on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3123.258s">Obviously,</a>  there's a lot of opinions and passion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3126.439s">I</a>  have a few thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3128.4s">Number</a>  one, the biggest complaints seem to be about enforcement, whether that's traffic enforcement or parking enforcement or code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3138.348s">we</a>  have received communications from parking staff saying that they really are imploring the mayor to increase the parking staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3145.811s">We've</a>  received, I think, recommendations from a couple of building commissioners and DPW directors in a row asking for more code enforcement staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3156.376s">And</a>  I'm sure that the police chief would say that he needs more support for traffic enforcement as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3162.659s">The</a>  City Council has zero authority to require enforcement of anything, zero authority to fund enforcement without the request of the mayor to fund those things, and I really strongly encourage, whether it's just related to this proposal or really anything you see in the city, to contact the mayor about those matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3183.494s">There's</a>  a couple things that we can do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3185.596s">Right</a>  now, we have a proposal in front of us for 11 to 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3189.039s">every</a>  day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3191.058s">the</a>  petitioner could, after hearing this discussion today, maybe come up to the podium and suggest an alternative that might meet their purposes, but not be all 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3202.784s">to</a>  1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3203.345s">every</a>  day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3203.765s">It</a>  could be maybe only till midnight, or only certain days of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3207.787s">I'm</a>  not gonna define what the petitioner may or may not be willing to propose. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3211.309s">They've</a>  put something in front of us as written, and that's what we have to consider, unless they were to come up and say otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3219.5s">I</a>  think there's a reasonable accommodation that can be reached between all parties to address the issues that everybody's raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3228.172s">But</a>  in general, when we talk about setting a precedent, we already have <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3232.573s">significant</a>  number of restaurants in this community that have permits to open from 11pm to 1am. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3239.976s">So</a>  the precedents already set that that is something that many, many, many restaurants have asked for and have been granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3247.199s">And</a>  I think for me as a Councilor, what I have to consider is <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3252.072s">Is</a>  there a compelling reason that if many other restaurants have been given that, and they're not just in Medford Square, they're not just in certain places, they're really some are in places that their neighbors would also say are residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3264.512s">why</a>  can't this one be granted as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3266.473s">So</a>  that's what I'm gonna be considering tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3269.054s">Certainly</a>  there are conditions that we could place on a permit if we were to approve it, like a 90 day review to get a report on noise complaints and code infractions and anything else that we have so that the questions that people have raised saying, well, this may happen if this permit is granted, we could actually collect that data, review it and consider the effects of this after a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3291.721s">That'd</a>  be certainly something I'm willing to entertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3294.182s">I'm</a>  going to pause there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3295.142s">I</a>  think there are a couple things that could happen right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3299.404s">We</a>  could either put some conditions on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3302.246s">We</a>  could have the petitioner say that there may be an alternative that's not as expansive as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3307.188s">Um,</a>  or I'm sure my fellow Councilors have some other ideas as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3311.87s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

um, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3321.2s">from</a>  consensus. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3322.061s">I</a>  mean, there's a lot of people that say that our friends at Oasis are hardworking people. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3327.705s">What</a>  I do hear is that there is quality of life issues that deal with someone in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3335.05s">I</a>  find it hard to believe that it's all Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3337.659s">I</a>  find it very difficult to believe that we can say this is all Oasis's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3342.642s">But</a>  I think again, I think that this is the Antonio brings the point that's very important here is the enforcement I had multiple neighbors call me this week about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3355.17s">And</a>  it didn't just start it started with Oasis but then it continued on about the lack of enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3362.333s">in</a>  the streets of South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3365.977s">And</a>  that's what I see that are issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3368.8s">But</a>  I do think that there are compromises. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3373.69s">As</a>  I did my study, I looked at the restaurants and the different bars that are open in the area, and there aren't too many that are open that are budding neighborhoods like Razo's or Bocelli's that are open till one o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3394.762s">So</a>  that's something we have to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3397.923s">But</a>  again, I think where we're talking about many people have come up and said that legally we have to really what my recommendation tonight so we table this until we have a committee the whole meeting then maybe we can what that happens we can ask legal representation to me with the council to give us some direction and what we can and what we can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3421.556s">And</a>  I'll give you some examples we. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3425.189s">We</a>  didn't approve a gas station from BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3430.254s">And</a>  we gave the wrong reasons why. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3432.455s">And</a>  then what happened was BJ's came back because we didn't have legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3436.939s">They</a>  sued us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3438.801s">They</a>  won. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3440.362s">We</a>  had to go back to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3441.744s">Now</a>  guess who's suing us? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3443.465s">The</a>  residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3445.047s">The</a>  residents are suing us because we're stuck in the middle because we don't have legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3449.51s">We</a>  haven't had a city solicitor in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3452.257s">So</a>  we're not lawyers, we're elected officials that are trying to do best for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3458.399s">So</a>  I know that we've got a report from our building department that our code enforcement officers are doing the best they can, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3471.444s">the</a>  size of the city that we are now and what's going on in the city, only having a few enforcement officers, it's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3479.968s">We</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3481.789s">Parking,</a>  we know that's a huge issue, huge concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3485.211s">I</a>  have family members that live on Princeton Street that call me all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3488.893s">They</a>  think because I'm on the city council, I must own a tow truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3492.615s">So</a>  I understand completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3495.776s">But</a>  again, this is a parking lot that is <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3501.272s">open</a>  to the community, and there are no limitations other than making sure commercial vehicles aren't parked in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3509.399s">So</a>  I, you know, is there something that the residents can talk with the owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3515.702s">If</a>  we table this and come back and say well, maybe there's something that you're looking at, maybe Friday, Saturday and Sunday till 12 o'clock if there are church groups that are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3524.966s">Maybe</a>  there's some kind of compromise that, you know, we'll can all work together to see what we can do what's best both for the business owner, and for the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3533.167s">You</a>  know, I've worked directly with a few people that are sitting in this auditorium about Oasis and their lack of cleanliness and they don't put the barrels out and the trash truck comes at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3545.491s">And</a>  to be honest with you, they've done a great job since we met with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3552.093s">I</a>  haven't heard the same complaints from different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3557.694s">It's</a>  maybe one or two of the same people that are complaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3561.557s">and</a>  maybe they have a right to, but the truth of the matter is they're doing the best they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3565.478s">You</a>  know, the alternative is imagine if they're not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3570.879s">We're</a>  seeing empty storefronts everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3574.479s">So</a>  I think that's what we're concerned about as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3577.16s">So</a>  trying to find that compromise, I think might be the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3581.02s">But</a>  again, I'm not saying we should or we shouldn't because legally we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3586.741s">So</a>  my recommendation truly is going to be to table this until we have a committee of the whole meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3592.427s">with</a>  city administration, with all the parties involved, our code enforcement team, our representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3609.436s">My</a>  motion, table this until we have a better understanding legally of where we can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3616.839s">We</a>  all have our thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3618.422s">We</a>  all have our thoughts if Oasis was maybe a couple blocks away where it didn't, but a home, homes, they would say no, they're thriving, we don't want Oasis to leave, we need to have them, give them anything they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3632.82s">Right,</a>  but then you have residents that are saying, listen, I mean, we had issues with, first it was, I remember the first phone call I got was the trucks are revving their engine in front of a window, keeping their engines running while they're running in to get something to eat in front of a resident's baby's bedroom window. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3650.128s">And</a>  we stopped that completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3651.748s">We</a>  ended up moving with the city and Oasis, we ended up bringing in planters, gigantic planters, so they couldn't park up on the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3659.992s">So</a>  that's just discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3662.293s">Maybe</a>  it's just a discussion we can have again, and see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3666.657s">Because</a>  I you know, and I'll do respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3669.54s">You</a>  don't have control of your clientele, but you do have control of your people that work for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3674.684s">And</a>  if you guys if we can all sit together and try to find a way that we can fix that, and help the neighbors and be part of the neighborhood community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3682.591s">And</a>  if it's something that we're bringing in the traffic enforcement saying, well, we need resident parking only. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3688.156s">the</a>  nights that we're going to that we would allow Oasis to have a certain extended hours of operations that we make sure that there those parking spaces are open for residents at 10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3699.871s">There's</a>  got to be something that we can work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3701.673s">But</a>  again, I'm only saying this as a way <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3705.938s">to</a>  a final answer that can help everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3708.699s">So</a>  I that's why Madam President, if I can, I'll make the motion that I feel we need to table this and move this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3716.162s">So</a>  we have all the representation at the table, including a legal representation that can guide us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3721.504s">And</a>  I hate to do it, by the way, I voted, I voted against everything that had to do with a representative for from KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3730.2s">that</a>  we're paying them hundreds and hundreds of dollars just by picking up the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3735.143s">I</a>  hate that we have to ask them, but because we don't have a city attorney in the city for a year, I think with this situation, I think it's warranted because either way, I don't wanna make a decision either favoring or being against without knowing the true ramifications legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3750.993s">So</a>  I hope you can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3752.594s">So</a>  that's why I make the motion that we table to a committee of the whole <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3756.576s">that,</a>  you know, we can even make it within the next 10 days if we can, that we asked the city to the mayor to have legal representation, be present to answer our questions and hopefully we can make a reasonable decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3770.947s">And</a>  maybe in that time, maybe the respected owners of Oasis who I feel that every time I've talked to them, they've been very, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3778.673s">They've</a>  been very, very welcoming and understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3781.237s">And</a>  we have people that are definitely committed in our South Medford community, that maybe there could be some kind of discussion that we can say, hey, let's find, let's find a common ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3790.69s">And</a>  then let's, let's revisit this when we can a community of the whole.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3794.277s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3795.118s">I</a>  want to make a few things clear from a process point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3797.739s">Just</a>  for Oasis, if you had adjustments to the permit, or if you had thoughts on adjustments to the permit you're seeking, and you can present those to us right now, it doesn't have to go to, process-wise, the Council will vote, but it doesn't have to go to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3812.229s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, your motion to table would end all debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3814.671s">So</a>  I would hold that motion to the end of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3817.553s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3818.713s">So</a>  we'll go through the Councilors who want to speak and then if the petitioner would like to speak again we'll go back to you, unless Councilors want to hear from the petitioner first, or, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3828.116s">That's</a>  curvy out.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3829.736s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3830.456s">So,</a>  that's the neighborhood I grew up in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3833.077s">I</a>  grew up on Princeton Street and when street, so we have a multiple multiple problems here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3838.679s">And,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3840.447s">The</a>  blame pie is pretty big here, and everybody's got to take a slice of the pie. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3845.01s">So</a>  we've established a $2 million parking department that doesn't tag any cars, which is issue number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3853.195s">I</a>  would think they'd clean up if they get on there on a Friday, Saturday night tagging cars and towing cars that don't belong there and shouldn't be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3862.58s">That's</a>  issue one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3863.501s">Beale</a>  Street, if I'm not mistaken, does have resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3867.95s">So</a>  again, that's a parking enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3871.334s">I</a>  will say our parking department, they work at night, they should be down there tagging cars, they should, and the police should be with them, towing cars that are parked in front of residents houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3882.005s">That's,</a>  that's the first, that's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3884.147s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3885.389s">You</a>  know, is this all Oasis' problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3889.553s">Yes,</a>  no, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3891.494s">There's</a>  Bocelli's that operates until 1 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3896.756s">I'm</a>  sure their customers park in there like everyone else does. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3903.558s">You</a>  have Bocelli's, you have Maze Cafe, they're all there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3913.462s">And</a>  things have changed over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3917.332s">Three,</a>  four years ago, you didn't have hundreds of delivery drivers going there, picking up food. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3923.694s">You</a>  didn't have Grubhub, Doordash, and all those other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3926.715s">Now</a>  those are the norm now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3929.616s">Not</a>  saying that I'm in favor of that, but our culture has changed over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3937.598s">People</a>  say, we want to blame COVID, we can blame whatever we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3944.0s">and</a>  these other businesses, they keep these restaurants going. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3949.827s">When</a>  times are tough, that was how they survived with takeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3954.112s">But</a>  I've worked with Oasis in the past, when we've had problems with the dumpsters and the parking, they've always been cooperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3965.044s">Maybe</a>  we establish hours for parking in the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3968.287s">Maybe</a>  we shut the parking lot down at a certain hour of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3972.811s">And</a>  any cars parked in there after one o'clock or something can get towed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3977.736s">So</a>  yeah, I think there is a compromise that can be reached if we sit down and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3984.502s">And</a>  as we said, do we have the right to vote now? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=3989.658s">When</a>  dozens of other restaurants in the city have the same permit that they're looking for, that'd be what we call an arbitrary and capricious decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4001.265s">Do</a>  we get sued like we got sued on other things? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4003.807s">So</a>  I think there's some legal issues that have to be brought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4007.73s">And</a>  I think the police department has to be called in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4010.291s">When</a>  the police department get called for a complaint or a noise complaint, they have to come down and they can't ignore the phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4016.675s">So</a>  again, they take a piece of the pie. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4019.537s">There's</a>  a lot of pieces of pie that go around there, and everybody has to own up to what has to be done to fix the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4026.061s">So</a>  like I say, I'm willing to work for a compromiser if that's what the patrons wants, but like I say, there's a lot of people that are gonna have to step up to make this work.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4037.847s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4039.548s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4041.61s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4042.631s">Thank</a>  you everybody who's been here about the petition or to speak your mind on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4046.513s">We</a>  appreciate all of your time and all of your perspectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4052.137s">To</a>  reiterate some of my other fellow Councilors synthesis of what we've heard so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4057.001s">We're</a>  hearing about parking enforcement, we're hearing about cleanliness code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4061.924s">I</a>  also heard about the prevalence of large trucks in an area that feels residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4066.902s">It</a>  makes sense to me that this is controversial because we do have a thriving business center, South Medford Square live right by there, right next to what is a residential area and I think we always get these friction points where residential meets commercial and residential is residential and commercial is commercial and we're trying to make sure that both can thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4086.809s">Vice</a>  President Bears spoke to this at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4089.511s">We</a>  so frequently as a council are talking about the many, many, many holes in our code enforcement that we see citywide, whether it is cleanliness or whether it is taking care of tree stumps, or whether it is responding to issues on see click fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4105.944s">Certainly</a>  we're aware of the same lack of capacity lack of effectiveness in our parking department as that, you know, takes its time to get up to speed, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4115.37s">I</a>  think that probably every resident, certainly everybody behind this rail, has just a laundry list of places where they don't see that consistent service that we need to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4125.957s">And,</a>  you know, the large trucks issue made me prick up my ears because I know that's an issue that, you know, falls under state jurisdiction as well as city jurisdiction in terms of how do we regulate these huge commercial trucks on our residential streets and how do we make sure that's fair for both users, the commercial drivers that <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4141.667s">to</a>  get around businesses that depend on them, but the residents that are trying to have a human sized existence on their residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4150.453s">All</a>  that being said, I think where we're at is how many of these systemic citywide and sometimes statewide issues are relaying at the feet of Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4162.061s">that's</a>  where I'm coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4163.562s">And</a>  I think that we need to be fair here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4165.783s">We</a>  need to be fair to the business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4167.264s">We</a>  also need to work very, very hard to make sure that residents are protected, their quality of life is protected as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4174.767s">I</a>  know that Councilor Scarpelli made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4177.808s">In</a>  the spirit of his motion, I'll make one that's slightly different, also for consideration for my fellow councilors.</p>

    <p>[Debbie McMillan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4184.231s">I</a>  think that if I suspend it,</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4190.473s">Yeah,</a>  we can only take Yeah, we can only take what he's holding back on his motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4194.534s">We'll</a>  take his motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4195.434s">First,</a>  we'll vote on it.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4196.494s">Certainly</a>  doesn't have just just to present a alternative proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4200.875s">And</a>  certainly Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate what you put forward in the spirit of having a discussion where we can see where we convene residents and enforcement staff from the city as well as the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4211.997s">An</a>  alternative proposal would be to just approve the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4216.558s">with</a>  a date certain for a committee of the whole over the summer after a 90 day review period where we do discuss what's working, how are things going, we convene parking enforcement, we convene code enforcement, we have a better sense of where those pain points are. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4229.061s">And</a>  again, this is potentially under a 90 day review process, we're able to go forward and issuing another extended license to another thriving business in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4237.342s">And</a>  we get the chance to say, let's hear from everybody about how it's going at a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4242.723s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4244.064s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4245.379s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4247.861s">It</a>  was helpful to hear from everyone both supporting and oppose and I got emails in both directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4253.845s">This</a>  week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4256.775s">So</a>  it's obviously, I think, a very difficult decision to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4261.237s">I</a>  think all the other councillors here can agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4265.719s">When</a>  I think about it, quality of life is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4271.221s">And</a>  it's important to pay attention to residents who are bringing up concerns that they might have with the establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4280.524s">But</a>  we also have to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4282.665s">in</a>  hearing those concerns, we have to hear what they actually are. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4285.307s">And</a>  from the concerns that I've noted down that you guys have come up and said, a lot of it, I think, there are ways to regulate the problem, ways to address the issue that isn't so wholesale and isn't really bringing the house down to make a renovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4310.335s">We,</a>  you know, I think there's there's a need for better signage in that lot and in the neighborhood, as to expectations, reminding. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4320.777s">people</a>  who frequent those businesses, as to what, what the rules are in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4326.8s">You</a>  can't defecate you can't urinate right in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4329.981s">We</a>  need better parking enforcement which other Councilors have already talked about, and better parking rules I know, Councilor care of yellow I liked that suggestion of looking at that lot in particular and seeing what we can do about that, right because it's the city own lot, we have control over it as a city not the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4348.511s">I</a>  hear the concerns about not being able to park in front of your homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4354.216s">I</a>  think that underscores the need that a lot of South Medford residents have been pushing for, for zoned-based parking in certain parts of South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4364.124s">And</a>  I think a lot of what we talked about today underscores the need for maybe strengthened ordinances, strengthened noise ordinances, strengthened code enforcement as well for those ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4376.986s">I</a>  it's, it's also when I think about this I think about a lot of the work that I do outside of city council work, which right now, a lot of it looks at laws and cases and how you how you make a strong case for against something, and I, it is I <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4393.855s">may</a>  be unfortunate, but it is impossible to prove, given that there are other businesses open in that in that neighborhood at the same time impossible to prove that oasis is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4405.37s">The</a>  problem is what you guys are saying, but it's impossible to make that connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4411.218s">And</a>  I don't want, as Councilor care of yellow mentioned I because it's impossible to prove that I don't want to be seen as taking a criticism arbitrary decision on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4423.822s">It's</a>  also we also have to keep in mind that the past, it's possible that because the businesses closes earlier than it needs to. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4432.505s">A</a>  lot of folks are congregating outside and doing things outside when if the business was open longer, they would have the ability to do that inside the business, where we have more control over the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4445.915s">We</a>  also have to, I understand the point about revenue that was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4451.018s">In</a>  this specific case, there's an opportunity cost with the revenue that applies here with restaurants and businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4462.251s">And</a>  it's not just the taxes that come from meals and liquor sold at Oasis, it's also the taxes that we would get <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4469.459s">from</a>  other businesses in South Medford Square thriving. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4473.481s">And</a>  we have to keep that in mind because we keep talking about revenue and the need to find ways to raise revenue, preferably without an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4481.586s">But</a>  look, I made a promise to the voters that I would try to find as many ways to raise revenue before we had to do an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4488.83s">And</a>  this is unfortunately one of those ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4491.191s">And</a>  that speaks to a bigger budget revenue situation that has been long and systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4498.595s">needs</a>  addressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4500.535s">But</a>  unfortunately, because of the tough situation that we're in revenue wise, we have to make some tough decisions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4509.037s">And</a>  with regards to the budget, I in the last week, we put out a survey about people's desires for Medford and the budget and over 20% of people did actually bring up the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4524.001s">the</a>  thought that businesses in Medford need to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4527.605s">And</a>  and I understand that that often comes in conflict with quality of living and as Councilor Collins mentioned a lot of our businesses are located very close to our residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4542.699s">I</a>  would support some kind of compromise to make sure that the businesses are surviving and that residents are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4549.644s">And</a>  so something like a 90 day review, I think would would be very helpful in that regard, and also calling upon our administration to do more work in that neighborhood to pay attention and to monitor it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4562.352s">I</a>  think that would be, I think that would be the way to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4567.782s">look,</a>  a lot of people want businesses to be open later as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4572.525s">A</a>  lot of people stay up late at night, people have different work schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4576.407s">We</a>  have a young and thriving population as well here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4578.748s">Councilor</a>  Knight, one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4585.332s">And</a>  so we need to address those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4587.413s">And</a>  look, I go back to the idea of regulate the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4593.265s">Regulate</a>  the problems, it would be unfair and unwise to it seemed, I think it would be unfair and unwise to tear down the whole thing.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4600.531s">Thank</a>  you guys are saying I apologize clearly this all the team has started so vice and vice president bears and I don't know if that meant you wanted to speak but we'll go to vice president first.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4611.999s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4612.34s">I</a>  just want to again be super clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4615.853s">We</a>  can't set the rules for the L Street parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4618.476s">We</a>  can't set the rules for resident parking on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4622.58s">We</a>  can't, we can't say who in corner houses gets what thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4627.785s">You</a>  know that's the traffic commission they have the authority to do that so we can talk all well and good about that but it's really not our purview and if you have issues with <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4635.133s">where</a>  you're what the resident parking rules are on your street or in the L street lot is the purview of the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4640.977s">Not</a>  only do we not appoint members of the Traffic Commission, we don't even confirm the mayor's appointments the members of the Traffic Commission parking, and I just want to reiterate this again we got a communication from the parking director they're bringing in $2 million, but they're actually only we're only spending a million on parking enforcement, and the mayor is using the other million to cover other things in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4661.009s">while</a>  the parking director is requesting more parking enforcement officers and is certainly raising the money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4666.513s">So</a>  if you have a question about parking enforcement, I really would encourage you to email the mayor and say, please use the money we're raising for parking revenue to enforce the parking rules in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4677.77s">just</a>  from pure procedural thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4679.05s">I</a>  would like to hear from the petitioner if they're willing to present an alternative, lesser proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4684.092s">I</a>  also think to Councilor Scarpelli's point, if we were to move forward on that, it wouldn't be a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4688.794s">It'd</a>  be a motion to continue the public hearing to a date certain and hold a committee of the whole before that date. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4694.015s">And</a>  that's just, we just, that's how we have to do it because it's a special permit process. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4697.776s">And</a>  if we don't follow those rules, nor if we don't act within 90 days, then we <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4702.798s">can't</a>  put any conditions.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4703.718s">We</a>  also could continue it to the next regular meeting and just legal counsel there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4707.24s">Yes,</a>  yeah, that's yeah, that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4710.421s">That's</a>  what I got some information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4713.402s">Yeah,</a>  so I would love to hear from the petitioner if they have maybe Councilor Knight and then we'll go to the petitioner.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4719.085s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4721.306s">You're</a>  muted.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4725.061s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4726.362s">I</a>  think we've certainly beat this issue to death. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4729.963s">Ultimately,</a>  the matter that's before us is whether or not we want to support and extend that Iowa's permit for Oasis, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4734.985s">That's</a>  the issue that's before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4736.506s">The</a>  other issues are enforcement issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4737.987s">Those</a>  issues fall under the purview of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4740.568s">So</a>  the question that comes before us right now is, do we want to support a thriving business in South Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4745.41s">All</a>  right, now, when I drive through South Medford, I see several businesses that are successful, and this is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4750.012s">I</a>  don't want to see them leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4751.768s">Um,</a>  I don't think that we can blame oasis for being the source of all the problems and all things wrong in yale street and harvard ave All right, I don't have a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4759.373s">I</a>  just don't think that that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4761.134s">All</a>  right We have the opening of a green line station that's going in over there the noise and the drama and the uh adverse effects that are going to come from that alone will triple or maybe quadruply outweigh what's going on in oasis uncomfortable support in the petition this evening <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4776.399s">Ultimately,</a>  you know, the council does have the right to put restrictions on it, I wouldn't have a problem putting restrictions on it to Thursday, Friday, Saturday evenings, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4784.386s">But</a>  I don't think we need to go down this road of making a mountain out of a molehill. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4787.929s">It's</a>  not that serious of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4789.251s">Ultimately,</a>  the question is whether or not we want to allow them to stay open for 120 minutes later than they usually do, or whether or not we want to put restrictions on those 120 minutes so that it's 90 or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4799.731s">I</a>  mean, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4800.772s">That's</a>  all that's before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4802.214s">So,</a>  you know, I think we're complicating an issue and we're really kind of turning this into a patronization at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4809.42s">But,</a>  you know, ultimately I'm comfortable voting on the paper immediately.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4814.225s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4815.286s">If</a>  we want to go back to the petitioner, if you want to come back up, if you have any, if you want any adjustments you want to offer or anything, talk through anything.</p>

    <p>[Luis Santos]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4828.406s">I</a>  respect all the residents here tonight.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4889.686s">We</a>  have to, I gave- I appreciate the respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4892.207s">I</a>  gave Councilor Scarpelli the courtesy.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4893.568s">I</a>  appreciate the respect Councilor Bears, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4895.468s">Would</a>  you like to keep your motion or would you?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4898.469s">Well,</a>  I just want to, I think that one of the biggest pieces, I appreciate the owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4903.651s">I</a>  think that's a great compromise, but I also think that there are, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4908.312s">bigger</a>  issues here that that the city needs to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4912.315s">So,</a>  you know, the traffic, the traffic issues, the, we have our special services department, they're all here and I know they work probably at hours a week, but they've been sitting here for the last three hours and having them understand the process <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4932.708s">and</a>  what their relationship with Oasis, so we know how you've been in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4938.913s">I</a>  think they're, you know, this isn't beating a dead horse at all in my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4942.016s">I</a>  think this is trying to get the best case forward for something that, again, I, as one Councilor, don't feel comfortable making until we have legal support. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4956.903s">Like,</a>  so again, I, you know, I would, I would still like to go to date certain for our next open meeting to extend it there that we can ask a representative legal representative, I think the owners of Oasis and here's the thing on the people that are against it and the people that are for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4978.655s">If</a>  we don't find a compromise, someone's gonna lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=4981.857s">So</a>  I think that we need to maybe find some, some common ground that maybe in two weeks we come back keep this extended for two weeks, and then put it first in the agenda, ask those questions and then vote on it, because I, you know, I, I feel that I can't speak for anybody, but I feel that the majority of the council is in favor of it, but I also think that this is an opportunity for us to meet with the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5005.79s">bring</a>  in the MPD, bring in the traffic, talk to Inspection Services, ask DPW about the upkeep and what's going on there and about signage for the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5016.322s">and</a>  permits for maybe the drivers that can park there until 12, and then close it and resident only that could park in there then tow. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5024.448s">So</a>  there's other things we can use this meeting for to find the best avenue for the community and self-medical, including Oasis, because this isn't going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5033.375s">If</a>  we give them the permit three days, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5037.078s">The</a>  self-med residents are gonna come back and say, Oasis is doing this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5039.941s">And</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5041.021s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5042.622s">But</a>  let's try to solve this instead of just pushing it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5045.583s">Let's</a>  wait a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5046.364s">Let's</a>  bring everybody in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5047.344s">Let's</a>  let's have the parties work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5049.945s">See</a>  what's best. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5050.865s">Come</a>  back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5051.446s">Let's</a>  put something thoughtful on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5053.406s">So</a>  we have to talk about it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5055.947s">Listen,</a>  I'm sure you don't want some of the emails you get from some of the people that email you every single week about issues in South Meffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5061.95s">We</a>  could sit everybody at a table to figure things out right now to get a better understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5067.112s">So</a>  I would welcome that, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5069.153s">If</a>  it's voted down, it's voted down. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5071.194s">But</a>  that would be my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5073.476s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5511.512s">23-315</a>  which I think we have next and if not that's what we're taking offered by Councilor Caraviello Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins, whereas hundreds of Massachusetts residents die or injured from incidents involving firearms every year, and whereas in Massachusetts an average of 16 children and teens die by guns every year of which 21% are suicide and 78% are homicides and <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5535.384s">Whereas</a>  the rate of death by gun homicide in Massachusetts is 18 times higher for black people than it is for white people, a vastly disproportionate threat of harm and whereas 38% of female intimate partner homicide victims in Massachusetts are killed with a gun and whereas Massachusetts police agencies reported more than 2800 firearms as lost or stolen to the National Crime Information Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5557.998s">from</a>  2016 to 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5559.96s">And</a>  whereas Massachusetts law establishes legal requirements for firearm storage in homes and vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5565.624s">And</a>  anytime the firearm is not carried by or under the control of the gun owner or other lawfully authorized user and whereas Massachusetts law contains criminal penalties for people who fail to securely stare store firearms as required by law and whereas gun violence costs Massachusetts 3.5 billion each year of which 85.4 million is paid by taxpayers and <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5587.785s">Whereas</a>  beyond the Massachusetts safe storage law, the American Academy of Pediatrics AP states that the best approach to keep children and teens safe is to secure firearms locked and loaded with ammunition separately and whereas 4.6 million children nationwide live in homes with at least one loaded and unlocked firearm and whereas <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5605.561s">The</a>  US Secret Service has found that 76% of school shooters under age 18 obtain their guns from the home of a parent or a close relative. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5612.863s">And</a>  whereas over 80% of children 18 or younger who died by firearm suicide use a firearm belonging to a family member. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5619.985s">And</a>  whereas raising awareness about secure firearm storage is one solution to helping reduce the risk of gun violence, particularly among children and teens due to suicides and unintentional shootings. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5629.468s">And</a>  whereas across the country, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5631.389s">lawmakers,</a>  community members and local leaders are working together to implement secure storage programs and whereas safety and well being of our community is a top priority of Medford and whereas we believe that most gun owners want to be responsible gun owners and whereas both gun owners and non gun owners have a role to play in keeping our community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5650.375s">be</a>  therefore resolved that the Medford City Council reaffirms its commitment to the safety, health and welfare of all of its residents, including through the promotion of the secure storage and handling of firearms, be it further resolved the Medford City Council request that the mayor implement a secure firearm storage program <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5665.937s">including</a>  the distribution of relevant educational brochures or materials about secure gun storage and state law regarding secure storage of firearms in Medford public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5675.246s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the Medford Police Department provide relevant educational materials pertaining to secure firearm storage, Massachusetts law regarding firearm storage and the risk of unsecured firearm storage when licensing new gun owners or renewing existing licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5691.995s">for</a>  the result of the Medford City Council request that the Medford Board of Health work with the mayor's office and Medford Police Department to assist with the dissemination of secure firearm storage materials throughout the community.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5704.525s">I</a>  will go to the- Thank you, Madam President for that dissertation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5711.811s">And</a>  I wanna thank my fellow councilors for helping to draft that ordinance up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5716.334s">So</a>  this is a group that I've gotten involved with earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5721.351s">With</a>  the privilege, there's been so many shootings this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5729.282s">It's</a>  just remarkable, not just Massachusetts, but throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5736.184s">This</a>  is not a, this group is not looking to take your guns away. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5741.19s">So</a>  I put this out on my websites that people hit me back with, you don't need this, you don't need the gun. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5747.358s">This</a>  is not an anti-gun group. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5749.32s">This</a>  group promotes gun safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5753.147s">protecting</a>  your gun, locking your gun, keeping your gun away from your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5757.309s">So</a>  understand, this is a huge problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5760.23s">You</a>  know, people go to other people's houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5763.771s">Do</a>  they have guns there? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5766.212s">Parents</a>  want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5767.893s">So</a>  I applaud this group for all the work they've done since I've started working with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5773.015s">And</a>  again, I've worked with the police with them to help put their literature for gun licenses, and I think the chief is trying to give them some free gun locks going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5783.361s">So</a>  I'll give my other councilor a chance to speak, but I applaud the work of this group, especially with the inuitable amount of deaths by guns in this country as of today.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5793.766s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5796.308s">Councilor</a>  Collins, Councilor Tseng, whatever you'd like to go next.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5800.39s">Thank</a>  you, President real. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5802.292s">Well</a>  first I want to thank the moms demand action community group for your stewardship of this resolution not just with us on the council with the school committee with various players in the mayor's administration the mayor herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5816.007s">really</a>  always wonderful to see a community group coalesce around a really important matter of community well being, especially with something an issue that the gravity of which really cannot be overstated. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5827.834s">So</a>  thank you so much for your leadership on this resolution and bringing it forward to many officials and partners throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5834.739s">Thank</a>  you to my fellow Councilors for working with this on me to bring it forward to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5840.262s">Um,</a>  this is a I know President moral. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5844.123s">We</a>  made her say a mouthful, but this is really a very simple resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5847.304s">Um,</a>  the safe storage program is something that many in the city have already committed to do something they're ready to do something that they're enthusiastic to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5857.828s">It's</a>  just a matter of distributing information on how to keep guns that already exist in homes safer in those homes that they're away from kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5866.19s">where</a>  they can do no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5867.412s">It's</a>  just about getting that information out to the community through communication channels that already exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5872.197s">So</a>  it's low cost, it's really effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5875.6s">I</a>  think when we read statistics like this about something so horrible, something that really defies words such as gun violence, unintentional gun violence, gun violence that occurs in the home, it can be sort of numbing to read those statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5889.754s">that</a>  I think something like this, the measures that the Moms Demand Action Chapter has been working on, the Be Smart Safety Program, it's such a simple and effective way to make sure that more violence is prevented in our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5902.442s">And</a>  so I'm really glad to be a part of this initiative and hope that we can continue to be a part of the implementation to make sure that the word gets out to as many Medford residents as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5912.548s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5913.996s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5914.877s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5915.477s">I'll</a>  try to keep it brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5917.959s">Moms</a>  Demand Action, I think we've lavished a lot of praise and all of it is deserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5923.523s">I</a>  grew up as someone who, you know, the school shootings were in the news all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5927.805s">I</a>  still remember Parkland. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5929.407s">I</a>  remember Sandy Hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5930.988s">I</a>  remember those days in the classrooms and meeting in the gym after. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5935.971s">We</a>  have heard about the news to talk about how <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5939.053s">students</a>  might protect ourselves, given the threat of gun violence, even beyond the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5945.38s">I</a>  mean, the resolution says it all, but, you know, something that touches young people a lot is mental health and suicide. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5952.667s">And</a>  the fact that most suicides with a gun are successful, but most <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5960.435s">who</a>  fail committing suicide don't ever return to that ever again. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5964.637s">And</a>  these are personal issues for young people here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5968.598s">And</a>  to have a group like Moms Demand Action that's so committed to raising awareness and building coalitions and coming to elected officials and trying to create something actionable for us, I think it's really touching. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5979.503s">And</a>  I'm very proud to be able to co-sponsor this with you guys, with my fellow Councilors, and to have you guys here with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5989.079s">I</a>  think I want to reiterate Councilor Collins point that these are simple steps that we can actually take in a municipality like Medford, and even, you know, we keep talking about how revenue limits us from things but this is, you know, it's simple it's actionable, and it's cheap, and something that is worth that time and investment by the city, because it's something so simple and so doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6010.66s">So,</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6013.049s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6014.41s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6015.211s">Again,</a>  moms demand action. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6018.295s">I</a>  remember a little organization when I was young that started up by their moms was a program called SADD, and it virtually eliminated drunk driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6027.845s">And</a>  it's something that, luckily, it's just second nature for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6033.29s">They</a>  just, we don't see that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6036.515s">as</a>  much as we used to. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6037.535s">So</a>  I think that, you know, being Councilor, being Councilor Tseng is one of his teachers, I remember going through those training sessions and bringing kids into the into the lockdown areas and going over this and watching how crazy it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6050.339s">And</a>  then here we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6051.819s">You</a>  know, my daughter's 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6053.12s">She's</a>  graduating. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6054.48s">And</a>  the whole process is second nature to her now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6057.541s">And</a>  it's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6058.301s">It's</a>  sad that they have to live this life this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6060.062s">But</a>  I appreciate when moms take take action like you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6064.603s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6065.323s">do</a>  just a little piece that makes such a big impact, because studies have shown a lot of gun violence death, especially at the youth level, comes from kids taking their parents' guns and playing with them, and self-inflicted, or taking them to school and hurting others. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6081.171s">So</a>  again, to reiterate what I said, thanks for bringing this forward, but keep the good fight going, and whatever we need, the council's behind you 1,000%, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6090.435s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6090.815s">Any</a>  other councilors wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6094.41s">I</a>  would just like to add, I wanna thank you all for being here, for staying so long, for making sure we get this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6100.092s">And</a>  I completely applaud all the work you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6103.174s">It's</a>  something I always wanna join. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6104.534s">I</a>  try to get there when I can, but I'm usually here, but I really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6109.756s">And</a>  I appreciate the work you're doing because far too many of us, if not all of us, have a story that this touches on. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6117.279s">My</a>  aunt died by suicide by way of gun. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6121.841s">And</a>  the work you are doing is so, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6124.771s">incredibly</a>  important to hopefully one by one take away those people that have that closeness to this issue because it's far too many and it's probably almost everyone at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6135.322s">So</a>  I really, I really thank you and I commend the work you're doing and keep on going, keep on fighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6139.646s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6141.949s">Anyone</a>  else?</p>

href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6186.509s">So</a>  I'm Aaron, I am a Medford resident, I'm a parent of a child in Metro public schools, and I'm the lead for the Medford local group for moms demand action for gun sense in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6199.369s">For</a>  those who don't know, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America is a grassroots movement of Americans advocating for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6210.592s">We</a>  have nearly 10 million supporters in the United States, a strong chapter in Massachusetts, and an amazing local group here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6219.154s">You</a>  can see all these lovely faces here, and that's just a little snippet of our group. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6226.577s">So</a>  on behalf of the local group, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6228.876s">I</a>  want to thank the Medford City Council for their consideration of this important resolution, and in particular, Councilor Collins, Councilor Tseng, and Councilor Caraviello for their ongoing collaboration support. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6241.663s">I</a>  also want to take this opportunity to thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn and Chief Buckley, and School Superintendent Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and Assistant Superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing, who have allowed us to work with them and their departments to spread this life-saving message of secure firearm storage <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6258.738s">through</a>  the appropriate channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6262.741s">Every</a>  day in the United States, 120 people are killed with guns and more than 200 are shot and wounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6271.307s">As</a>  of 2020, firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and teens. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6277.192s">This</a>  is a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6279.495s">We</a>  believe that Medford can and should take steps to do everything possible to reduce gun violence so that our city does not have to face the unimaginable pain that comes when community members, particularly children, are taken by gun violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6296.625s">When</a>  unauthorized children, teens, or adults gain access to unsecured firearms in homes or vehicles, we see tragedies such as suicides, unintentional shootings, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6307.655s">school</a>  shootings and homicides. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6310.596s">Secure</a>  storage or keeping guns unloaded and locked, ideally with the ammunition locked separately, is an evidence-based intervention to prevent tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6321.578s">Raising</a>  awareness of the benefits of secure firearm storage in our community by passing the secure storage resolution will save lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6334.099s">the</a>  Celtics game, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6337.78s">Massachusetts</a>  has strong secure storage laws in place, and it only benefits our community to make all Medford residents aware of the life-saving effects of secure firearm storage, and to ensure that all gun owners follow Massachusetts secure firearm storage laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6353.224s">Given</a>  the unprecedented surge in gun sales in 2020 and 2021, and the increase in applications for firearm licenses in communities <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6363.032s">all</a>  over Massachusetts, including in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6366.115s">It</a>  only makes sense that the city should invest in spreading awareness about the life saving benefits of secure storage in homes and vehicles, just as it does with any other public health issue communities face, such as substance abuse, disease prevention, mental health and fire safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6383.4s">Since</a>  our Moms Demand Action local group began advocating and working with city leaders about a year ago, Medford has become an important example of how a community can normalize a conversation around firearms and take steps to reduce gun violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6397.75s">We</a>  were the second community in Massachusetts to pass a secure storage notification resolution through the school committee that ensures that all parents and caregivers are notified annually about Massachusetts secure storage laws and how they save children's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6411.427s">as</a>  well as how to ask about the presence of unsecured firearms in the homes that their children visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6418.39s">We've</a>  been invited to spread the secure storage message by tabling at numerous events, including the Medford Police Department's National Night Out, which we will be at again this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6428.025s">We've</a>  already begun laying the groundwork for disseminating information to Medford firearm license holders about secure storage with the Medford Police Department, as Chief Buckley has agreed that our community can only benefit from receiving this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6441.893s">And</a>  we are honoring Gun Violence Prevention Awareness Day and Wear Orange weekend on Friday, June 2nd at 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6448.077s">at</a>  City Hall with a ceremony, including a mayoral proclamation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6451.719s">I</a>  hope we see you all there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6455.127s">Passing</a>  this resolution would continue to make Medford a leader in Massachusetts with proactive community-based responses to gun violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6462.153s">On</a>  behalf of the Medford Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America members, I urge you to vote in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6470.96s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6477.753s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, it looks like Councilor Knight is no longer on the call, so we will close vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6483.301s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice-President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6486.626s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6501.646s">I'm</a>  sure we're taking away valuable practice time.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6505.428s">23-318</a>  offered under suspension by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6507.91s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Medford High School Bowtech Robotics Team, which won the New England Regionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6514.134s">The</a>  Bowtech Robotics Team now moves on to the World Championships in Colorado. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6517.897s">The</a>  Bowtech Robotics Team beat Phillips Exeter, where over 50% of the students go on to attend Harvard University upon graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6524.281s">I</a>  did not know that, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6525.802s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6534.073s">I</a>  apologize that you had to sit here this long, and I hope you learned something about government tonight, and not just about robotics. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6540.08s">You</a>  have the little robots coming around here, they're going to vote pretty soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6546.308s">First</a>  of all, I want to, you know, everyone's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6549.231s">You</a>  know, this is a bright spot at our technical school, Israel Ballerstein. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6555.336s">It's</a>  a program that's grown in leaps and bounds and it gets better every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6560.32s">So</a>  I know you guys got to get home and do homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6563.203s">I</a>  want to give you a chance to come up and speak, anything you want to say, but I just want to congratulate you for the great work you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6571.92s">onward</a>  to the championship.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6599.312s">I'm</a>  Aaron Van Daniel. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6600.333s">I'm</a>  a sophomore. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6602.634s">I'm</a>  Scott Campbell, a sophomore.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6606.057s">I'm</a>  Matthew Harrison, I'm a junior. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6609.059s">Congratulations,</a>  and again, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6616.625s">The</a>  reason why I asked you to do this is twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6619.167s">When</a>  we have our athletes, after they win a championship, we ask them to come up and we recognize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6623.951s">When</a>  we have our leaders in the theater, our arts, we ask them to come up and identify them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6629.835s">So</a>  I think it's important that <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6631.837s">You</a>  started now a legacy and now it's a tradition that's going to carry on because I hear we're all into classman so we're all coming back next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6639.728s">So</a>  we have a dynasty at the vocational school so I will share something with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6646.097s">And</a>  I will start it off by the. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6648.961s">the</a>  trip to, I believe it's Colorado, we're in need of some funding, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6653.844s">I</a>  think, so I'm not going to say how much, but I'm going to start, I'm going to ask the community if we could find a way to help, just reach out to the high school or or the clerk to see if we can reach out to anybody who'd like to donate to help with their cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6667.771s">I'm</a>  going to donate, I'll be the first one to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6670.332s">I'll</a>  talk to Mr. Campbell, one of the parents, to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6673.173s">I</a>  know that, you know, to get the ball rolling, but <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6677.235s">you</a>  deserve to be in Colorado to represent the city of Medford and our schools and such an honor for you to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6684.481s">So</a>  congratulations.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6692.567s">So</a>  Councilor Tseng went to Harvard and I went to UMass and I like to see you, I think you beating Phillips Exeter is like UMass beating Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6701.433s">So</a>  now in the spirit of unity, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6706.334s">We</a>  all went to Medford High School, and we're really proud of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6708.795s">So</a>  I think that goes for both of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6710.436s">But</a>  just if you're considering programs when you're going to school, UMass has a great engineering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6717.7s">And</a>  maybe it's no Harvard, but it's pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6720.262s">So</a>  thanks, you guys.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6721.422s">To</a>  be fair, Harvard only started its engineering program a few years ago, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6726.165s">See?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=6727.266s">They'll</a>  catch up.</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7286.636s">I</a>  just want to make sure Madam Chair and members of the council Jack Englert criterion development partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7292.879s">I</a>  wanted to make sure that the PowerPoint is able to be shared with the screen that's happening from a zoom position.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7300.041s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7300.962s">Is</a>  Valerie set up as a co host? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7303.082s">Are</a>  you sharing that Valerie?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7311.922s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7317.506s">Okay,</a>  if we could share the first slide that'd be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7320.889s">I'm</a>  here tonight to ask the council to consider a rezoning of the property as described earlier it sits as an orphan piece really on the corner of Revere Beach Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7332.538s">and</a>  the Malden River. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7334.459s">It</a>  right now consists of what was I Heart Radio or the old KISS 108 building and also a parking lot kind of mixed together. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7342.183s">It's</a>  surrounded by property owned by the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7345.945s">They</a>  have certain plans for it, I'm sure, but we're not getting into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7349.007s">We're</a>  just focused on the site itself, which is in the northeast corner of what you're seeing on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7356.612s">A</a>  lot of improvements that could happen there will happen because the path that has been trying to connect River's Edge all the way around the point hasn't been able to happen partially because of the MBTA and having it cross the MBTA property, but also because of what exists here on the site that's in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7374.564s">given</a>  the nature of what's happening to the west of the site over at the corner at station landing, we thought it appropriate to bring MUZ Zone over to this parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7385.77s">We're</a>  working on the plans and we can go through some of the ideas that we have, but it's preliminary at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7391.793s">The</a>  point is that we're starting to meet with the community and speak with members of the Mr. River Watershed Association, some of the bike <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7402.019s">that</a>  are happening and the creation of this project would allow for the pedestrian connection as well as a bike connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7408.101s">And</a>  various things that we would like to talk with the community about further. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7413.623s">So</a>  if we want to go to the next slide just quickly, the parcel is a 4.5 acre piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7419.586s">Half</a>  of some of it is in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7421.367s">Some</a>  of his wetlands. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7423.007s">Our</a>  proposal is to take <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7425.608s">the</a>  property and build something outside of the wetland areas, not increase the amount of impervious in the second buffer zone and not have any impervious in the first buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7435.161s">The</a>  next slide is an idea of the scale of the footprint of the building parking underneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7443.822s">and</a>  the potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7444.522s">This</a>  is just one option that would exist under the MUZ zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7448.223s">The</a>  beauty of the MUZ zone is to provide some flexibility for different various things within the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7455.266s">We</a>  are a residential housing developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7457.626s">That's</a>  the primary purpose of our request. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7460.767s">However,</a>  there's also opportunity to have community space, bike space, covered shelter space along the path as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7470.475s">We</a>  have a couple of slides that are just quickly to show the nature and scale of what this could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7476.201s">Kind</a>  of standing on the front corner there, you can see it's a residential housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7480.245s">Project</a>  eight stories over one story of podium, light gauge steel. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7484.969s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7486.591s">We</a>  have a slide from the river that we tried to include it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7489.718s">I</a>  guess you can't see the sailboat anymore, but there was an opportunity to see the sailboat as the site sits along the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7496.961s">Again,</a>  these are preliminary massing studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7499.362s">This</a>  process is a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7501.683s">First</a>  step would be to understand the zoning, whether it could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7505.104s">Next</a>  step would start the site plan approval work. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7510.226s">That's</a>  really all I have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7512.467s">We</a>  can go back to maybe the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7515.062s">That's</a>  a quick sketch on the slide that shows the actual point or the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7523.969s">Back</a>  two more, right there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7526.071s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7526.812s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7527.412s">Vice</a>  President Harris.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7528.253s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7529.054s">Thank</a>  you for presenting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7531.095s">Just</a>  two quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7532.857s">One,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7536.386s">the</a>  city has the Wellington Air Rights RFI, I think that's out right now, which is even before an RFP, nevermind an actual plan, but it seems like you're designing this so at least in theory it could be integrated with the larger project proposal for the area?</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7551.739s">Absolutely,</a>  we're self-contained and not interfering with anything that could happen over the air rights piece.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7556.884s">And</a>  I'm second, I'm sure your lawyers are <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7561.202s">great,</a>  but I just wanted to note that given the transit oriented nature of this development, that the parking minimums would be significantly reduced and you could kind of maximize either commercial space in the podium or additional residential space. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7572.832s">And</a>  I think that would be a great benefit to the community.</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7575.555s">And</a>  we'd be interested in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7576.796s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7578.417s">And</a>  then finally, just are you proposing any affordable units above the inclusionary minimum?</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7583.782s">We're</a>  proposing right now 15% affordable.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7586.324s">Okay,</a>  that's our minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7587.265s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7587.846s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7588.637s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7589.998s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7591.099s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7592.18s">Thank</a>  you for the proposal this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7594.022s">You</a>  know, it's a piece of property that's <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7597.017s">underused</a>  right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7599.219s">It's</a>  out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7600.621s">So</a>  no matter what you put it, whether it's housing or commercial developments, it really doesn't really affect anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7608.849s">You're</a>  right on the train line. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7611.112s">I</a>  personally would prefer some housing, maybe, if that's what you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7615.616s">Because</a>  as you know, our housing stock is on the lower end. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7620.281s">But</a>  I would welcome a commercial project there also that would possibly tie in with something that could be going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7629.415s">Would</a>  you be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7632.787s">tie</a>  in under the bridge with the walking path that goes across the river there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7636.669s">I</a>  don't know if there's an access point there.</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7638.77s">It's</a>  an easy walk to the actual train station, and from there you could get on.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7641.951s">No,</a>  well, you know, across the street, where Modena is, they have a walking path there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7648.714s">I</a>  don't know, is there an access point there?</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7651.495s">There</a>  is, and the intent would be to continue that path across the property, across the MBTA property, and link it with the, what is it?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7658.097s">Yeah,</a>  I remember going there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7659.818s">Yeah,</a>  with, you know, with the path to go across river so I certainly welcome this project, whether it be commercial housing.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7667.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7668.083s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7675.043s">development</a>  is progressing method, but I'm just a little leery that this type of zone changing for individual parcels is what really affects our community in a negative way in the sense that, unfortunately, we don't have a true understanding of what a whole picture looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7697.467s">You</a>  know, when you look at neighboring communities and they said, we'll use, we'll use assembly row. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7702.688s">That</a>  was a whole vision that wrapped around. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7706.889s">What</a>  I don't feel comfortable doing is approving his zoning change right now for one building right now, and not knowing what the rest of the picture looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7715.991s">I</a>  was fortunate enough to start with Mayor Curtatone and working with him and seeing what he did when <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7721.892s">Oh</a>  geez, Ikea had the number one spot back in the day in assembly row, then all of a sudden the vision started changing and started conforming and they had to find a way to move Ikea. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7732.177s">My</a>  whole, my reservation with this is really making these spot changes in zoning to accommodate certain groups without truly understanding, and I know we have a long process to go, but that's probably one of the most dangerous <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7749.688s">intersections</a>  in the country, and the residents in the Wellington area that people seem to forget about, where you're gonna be bringing in, how many units is that right now?</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7759.672s">It's</a>  somewhere between 350.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7762.073s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7763.194s">Now</a>  imagine adding that much without understanding the true impact with the whole community there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7771.357s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7771.577s">So</a>  I think that's where my reservation comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7773.538s">So</a>  believe me, I love the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7776.559s">If</a>  I see if there was a comprehensive plan to see what it all would look like together, and that's what I'm sure in your profession, you see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7784.407s">And</a>  that's why you're here right now because we have such an outdated zoning format that you have to come up and ask for this ridiculous format so I just have to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7795.497s">I</a>  love the idea it looks beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7797.779s">I</a>  just right now I. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7800.022s">Um,</a>  again, that the understanding of what the true impact means the rest of the growth there and what impact it brings to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7811.353s">you</a>  know, the negative issues it brings to that Middlesex area, the Wilmington area, I couldn't support it unless, you know, we had our Office of Community Development and people sharing, I don't know if Alicia's on the line, just even understanding what the vision is. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7829.749s">I</a>  mean, again, that's, we call these, you know, what was the big thing back in the day is gateway communities, gateway entrances, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7836.535s">That's</a>  a gateway that's coming in from Everett Rivera. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7839.578s">That's</a>  a very important piece right there.</p>

    <p>[Jack Englert]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7841.279s">So,</a>  can I respond to short please think, because I agree with you, I think it is difficult to envision what would happen over a large piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7850.167s">I</a>  think the corner where national developments deal is is spots on somewhat right that was an museum sitting by itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7857.693s">And</a>  I think it proved to be fairly successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7860.136s">We're</a>  just taking the leap to try and stretch that across. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7862.8s">Now</a>  the MBTA is the intermediate parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7865.885s">And</a>  we need their, I don't know that you need their consent, but they certainly would weigh in on whether or not MUC works for them, I think to make the air rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7874.327s">work,</a>  which is part of what the city is trying to do, the MUZ would be the zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7879.71s">So</a>  it does make a lot of sense to pull it all the way across. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7882.732s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7883.833s">I</a>  wish I could control the MBTA piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7885.834s">I</a>  wish you could. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7887.174s">But</a>  I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7888.595s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7889.296s">But</a>  I am thinking that, you know, having one bookending the MUZ of the MBTA piece would be an impetus and perhaps a catalyst for making that MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7900.222s">Good</a>  point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7900.962s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7902.203s">And</a>  then, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7904.577s">remind</a>  folks that the motion would be to report to the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7908.622s">We</a>  do have Director Hunt on the line, so I don't know if you want to go to her after the councilor speaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7912.006s">So</a>  go ahead Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7915.523s">I</a>  would want to hear from Director Hunt, but I, in general, I think we are in a housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7920.524s">The</a>  best way to combat that crisis is to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7923.345s">We</a>  have a crisis, revenue crisis, where we need new growth, new development, and we, as a council, always talk about the need for new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7931.086s">I've</a>  lived in that neighborhood for most of my life, and I still spend a lot of time there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7936.428s">And</a>  something that we always want is more things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7939.228s">And</a>  to have that there, to have more of a community, more neighbors around, I think would be a <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7943.909s">and</a>  I think the biggest point in favor of this is the fact that it's next to the station, and that kind of transit oriented development, I think, will help us meet our housing and climate goals, but also create a better standard of living for people in the area.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7961.392s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7962.612s">We</a>  can go to Director Hunt if you want to perhaps help us paint a holistic picture of this proposal.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7970.694s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7973.03s">Good</a>  evening, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7974.932s">Can</a>  you confirm that you can hear me all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7976.974s">I'm</a>  having trouble with my headset.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7980.998s">Yeah,</a>  can we stop the screen share? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7985.383s">Great,</a>  and then, yeah, you're a little muffled, but we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7987.906s">All</a>  right, perhaps this is better. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7990.589s">Sorry,</a>  I've had trouble with my earbuds this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7995.233s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=7996.777s">So</a>  to speak to this in the big vision, so we are actually, we put out to bid an RFP to do a visioning, economic development study of this entire area, region, the Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8010.29s">We</a>  actually didn't get any consultants interested in doing that study. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8015.714s">And</a>  so we are reaching out to them and re-scoping to see what was not acceptable about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8022.427s">But</a>  this area is an area that we do foresee should be housing, should be mixed use as we saw with the RFI. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8033.869s">The</a>  reason we've actually encouraged them to come forward with this zoning change at this time is because when a developer wants to build something like this and the developer is coming forward and saying, and we want to give boat access and help with the <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8048.952s">the</a>  shared use path and we want to put in amenities for the community, we really want to work with them when they're ready to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8056.575s">And</a>  we said to them, you know, if you want to wait about a year or so, we think this area is likely to actually be rezoned in a way that would allow what you want to do, if not completely as of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8067.68s">And</a>  what we're looking at is to do some amount of residential density in this area as of right with if you then give us additional energy efficiency, additional <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8079.243s">affordable</a>  housing, then you'd be able to do additional density as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8083.187s">And</a>  that's where we think we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8084.789s">We're</a>  working on this with our MBTA consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8087.772s">And</a>  we said, if you want to wait like about a year, you probably wouldn't need to bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8092.536s">And</a>  they said, we would like to really get moving on this project now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8096.85s">And</a>  therefore, we said, well, the process to get this going ahead of us is to bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8102.738s">We</a>  are actually considering whether it would make sense for the city to propose that the MBTA parcel also be rezoned mud. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8113.382s">To</a>  be clear, the MBTA is not held to any zoning that we put on the parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8118.984s">So</a>  it would actually not impact their rights, but it could make the property more valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8124.367s">They</a>  might say, well, you know what, maybe we want to pull back from here because it's worth more to us as developed land than it is as parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8133.671s">It</a>  would assist with our air rights project. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8136.557s">Um,</a>  so that is something that we could consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8138.678s">We</a>  were, um, thinking of discussing with the planning board, whether we could actually have that full section be the MUD and not this Island by itself and the other Island on either side of MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8149.763s">Um,</a>  but the bottom line is we think this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8152.104s">We</a>  think this is the direction that this area is going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8155.325s">Um,</a>  and we wanted to be responsive to the developer's timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8159.827s">What</a>  we don't want to have happen is we say, wait a year until the zoning is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8165.367s">And</a>  then they say in a year, oh, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8168.009s">We've</a>  moved on to other parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8170.291s">So</a>  that's what we were trying to avoid by encouraging them actually to come forward with this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8174.715s">And</a>  hopefully I've answered all of your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8177.518s">Definitely</a>  let me know if there's anything else.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8181.701s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8181.881s">Hunt,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8183.123s">We</a>  appreciate all your hard work and we know you're super busy, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8186.767s">moving</a>  forward, I would love a conversation to share that vision with us so we can all celebrate in what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8196.23s">I</a>  think this is what the biggest concern we're having with the administration is understanding that obviously the zoning isn't going as quickly as we want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8206.233s">I</a>  appreciate the representative to your words. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8208.594s">I</a>  think it meant a lot to me, understanding more what you're saying as our leader in the office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8215.455s">I</a>  think that maybe if you could moving forward is, you know, share those ideas with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8221.997s">I</a>  think it would go a long way to at least moving my decisions forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8226.738s">And</a>  because that's the issue is we do need housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8229.659s">The</a>  issue is we do need the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8232.419s">We</a>  need the new money in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8233.72s">That's</a>  something we've always been, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8235.56s">crying</a>  out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8236.18s">But</a>  at the same time, I think understanding what the vision is, and understanding that we could be great partners in this, at least all of us, not just individual Councilors, but all of us to make sure that we're all celebrating in this and moving something like this forward, I think will be helpful in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8254.349s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8255.53s">So</a>  I would move, Madam President, that we move this to the next step.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8260.493s">I</a>  motion to refer to community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8262.994s">I</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8263.574s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8264.235s">Director</a>  Hunt, I see your hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8265.135s">Did</a>  you have anything to add or is it still up? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8268.037s">One</a>  more thing.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8269.237s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8272.079s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8272.739s">And</a>  respectfully, that's actually why I'm here this evening, is to share the office's thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8278.642s">It</a>  would have been premature to come <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8280.842s">in</a>  advance of them presenting their thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8283.724s">However,</a>  I met today with our MBTA community consultants around our zoning that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8290.309s">It</a>  is my expectation that I'm gonna ask for a committee as a whole, and I hate to do this, but in the summer, to talk about where we think we're going with that so that we would be prepared to vote in September or October on the MBTAs and communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8307.842s">And</a>  we've looked at the Green Line area <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8309.844s">And</a>  we've looked at the Wellington area and based on what the studies that we've had done with this consultant, it looks like this is the area that we need to look at for the comply with the state MBTA community law. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8321.869s">So</a>  thank you, but we'll be back.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8324.75s">If</a>  I can, for one Councilor, I'd rather you be a little premature and reach out to us for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8331.538s">I've</a>  worked with other communities and seen what they're doing, and there's a partnership there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8336.56s">I'm</a>  sure this was something that the city was working with, must be months now, because this doesn't pop up overnight, and you got it last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8345.723s">So</a>  my hope is only that you share these visions with us so we can help move things forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8353.706s">I</a>  don't think it's negative in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8355.266s">I</a>  don't try to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8356.227s">I'm</a>  not trying to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8357.347s">But</a>  if you can, just <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8360.736s">you</a>  know, be a little premature. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8361.776s">I'd</a>  rather you be a little premature because it would help us moving this forward a lot quicker and understanding it, at least a big picture and a better vision to it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8370.419s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8373.36s">I'll</a>  work with you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8375.021s">Summer</a>  meetings to make sure we can get it at a time when most, if not all Councilors can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8379.422s">So</a>  we have a motion from Vice President Bears to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8385.524s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8391.553s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8395.174s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8396.815s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8400.396s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8401.877s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8408.359s">We're</a>  gonna go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8411.08s">So</a>  we're taking public participation out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8412.881s">If</a>  you would like to speak for public participation, please come up to the podium, name and address record any topic that is under council purview.</p>

    <p>[Amy Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8425.957s">Hi,</a>  my name is Amy Tanaglia, and I'm from the building department City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8431.482s">I</a>  want to thank you all for letting me be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8434.245s">And</a>  I'm actually here to tell you the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8439.217s">I'm</a>  here on behalf of the clerks within the city of Medford who haven't had a raise in over four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8446.643s">I</a>  was here a few months ago and the situation has not changed at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8451.107s">Several</a>  union groups are currently in negotiations, but none as long as we have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8456.251s">We</a>  have invited you particularly to come to our negotiations and with everybody's busy schedules, you haven't been able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8465.823s">We</a>  understand that, but we would like to extend the invitation again for you to come and see what happens during our negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8474.251s">I'm</a>  going to go and skip to the pandemic that it happened to a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8484.368s">While</a>  the management was home and while department heads were able to stay home, it was the clerks that had to come to work every day to keep the city running. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8494.976s">While</a>  I respect the teachers and everything they do, and on a daily basis, they worked remotely for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8502.201s">They</a>  received a COVID bonus for three years consecutively. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8506.404s">We</a>  are being offered half of what they received and only a one-time payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8514.308s">Inflation</a>  has increased significantly over the last four years between rent, health insurance, medicine, food, utilities, gas, just the cost of living period. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8525.993s">We</a>  are the lowest paid women within the city, and we just cannot get the help that we deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8533.555s">We</a>  deserve to be respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8535.976s">We</a>  deserve to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8537.417s">And</a>  mostly we deserve to be shown that our contributions to this city are as important as management and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8548.48s">It</a>  has been proven time and again that women are not treated with the same respect as our male counterparts equality is non existent within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8561.383s">Fair</a>  and equal compensation does not exist for the female clerks here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8567.647s">We</a>  are the voices in the face of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8571.27s">We</a>  are front and center every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8574.272s">We</a>  are the backbone of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8577.674s">During</a>  contract negotiations, a few issues that had been agreed upon were actually dismissed when we had our last negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8589.787s">What</a>  what they are offering us is what everybody did receive back in the day, which is 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8597.876s">And</a>  the last time we got a raise was June 30 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8606.22s">The</a>  last time the city clerks received an increase in the longevity was in 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8613.842s">We</a>  are now requesting an increase every year from 2019 to 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8620.784s">When</a>  the contract expires and the city's counterproposal was on a one time increase for 2023 and any employee hired after 7123 will no longer be eligible <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8635.168s">to</a>  collect longevity payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8638.311s">Please</a>  keep in mind that these increases that we had negotiated negotiating have been given to other city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8646.659s">We</a>  haven't received the increase in our sick incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8649.882s">Since</a>  2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8650.262s">We</a>  agreed again on increases that the administration offered us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8657.388s">And</a>  during this last negotiation meeting, it was all taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8662.312s">We</a>  asked for five positions to be upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8665.653s">These</a>  five positions are the clerks who make the least money. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8670.393s">They</a>  counted with classifying one full-time senior clerk to be upgraded to principal clerk, and one part-time senior clerk to be part-time principal clerk, leaving behind three women who work as hard as everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8692.592s">I</a>  am requesting today that all of you make an effort to come to our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8698.895s">In</a>  the meantime, you have all stated that you are behind us 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8704.418s">Please</a>  show us your support by not passing the 2024 budget until we have been compensated equally and fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8714.863s">Thank</a>  you. <a

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8954.482s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8955.963s">Thank</a>  you, Amy, for coming up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8957.204s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8958.124s">You</a>  are the voice, you are the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8960.886s">And</a>  that makes these officers, not just you, but the other women that work in the department, you see my face when I come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8968.49s">Who's</a>  first face I see is yours, or yours, other faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8973.484s">While</a>  all those gentlemen are out there working in the fields, who's answering the phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8977.528s">Who's</a>  making the city look good? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8979.669s">Who's</a>  making the boss look good? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8981.511s">It's</a>  part of the reason I did not vote for the raises that the department gets. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8986.976s">I</a>  come from a school where the working people get paid first. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8991.948s">And</a>  that's the way it should be, whether you're a man or a woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8995.149s">The</a>  workers are what makes this building go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=8999.711s">You</a>  and all the women who work in this place, you're the one that makes the bar so good. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9003.352s">It</a>  makes the bottom of the head good. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9004.773s">You're</a>  the one that makes all these men and other women revolve around this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9012.748s">Four</a>  years without a raise is certainly unconscionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9016.789s">And</a>  not even to be respected to even be discussing a raise is even more unconscionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9023.792s">Cost</a>  of living has gone up 8%. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9026.493s">And</a>  they're offering you, what, 1%, 2%? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9029.514s">2%.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9030.294s">And</a>  that's not even counting all the back years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9033.275s">You</a>  haven't got anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9034.596s">And</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9035.416s">Teachers</a>  go up $1,500 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9038.497s">for</a>  a COVID bonus? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9040.098s">And</a>  what are you being offered for a COVID bonus while everybody else was home?</p>

    <p>[Amy Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9043.58s">Well,</a>  we've been offered a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9045.481s">One</a>  was 500, then they took it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9048.423s">Then</a>  they wouldn't put it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9049.844s">And</a>  this last negotiation, they put 750 for one year.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9053.666s">What</a>  makes you different than the teachers?</p>

    <p>[Amy Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9055.947s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9057.328s">You</a>  know, different than teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9058.588s">Are</a>  anybody else in this room? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9060.87s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9062.27s">You</a>  deserve something fair and equal that everyone else here, whether you're a man or a woman or whatever you are, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9068.047s">You</a>  should be treated the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9070.109s">There</a>  is no division here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9072.47s">I</a>  apologize, and I've supported you, everyone, from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9078.174s">And</a>  again, like I said, I hope you settle your contract quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9082.678s">And</a>  I know the dedication you and many other people have put into this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9087.681s">I</a>  applaud you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9089.843s">Many</a>  people that have probably gone on strike <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9093.031s">I'll</a>  quit and go on to another job. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9094.472s">I'm</a>  sure there's plenty of other jobs out there that you can take, probably making more money, but I do appreciate you saying your dedication and the other workers, their dedication to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9103.678s">But</a>  again, I will not support a raise for any department head, so the workers who are the cog of the city get paid first.</p>

    <p>[Amy Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9113.223s">I</a>  request on top of that, that the budget not be approved until she realizes that we need to get this settled.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9121.616s">You</a>  do need to get itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9124.079s">Just</a>  joining me up here, Kyle Heath, Fulton Spring Road, Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9128.165s">Sure,</a>  and we- DPW members.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9129.647s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9130.067s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9130.508s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9131.449s">Charles</a>  Stewart from Method, DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9132.891s">That</a>  was cut off.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9135.094s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9136.296s">Sorry,</a>  I was talking to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9137.758s">I</a>  don't- That's fine.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9139.976s">continue</a>  vice president bears like we still we have other folks want to speak but you know I was just Amy kind of no offense for cutting me off but I just kind of wanted to give you the give you the floor when you're making a passionate speech I just wanted to say a couple other things really quickly and then I'll defer to everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9156.0s">I</a>  hear you on the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9157.461s">We</a>  threatened it last year, and it was clear that after 45 days, according to state law, the budget goes into effect anyway, even if we don't vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9164.665s">So</a>  there may be something there, but she's waited us out on everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9168.087s">She'll</a>  wait us out on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9169.667s">So</a>  I hear the ask, and I respect the ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9174.63s">And</a>  I'll consider the ask, but at the end of the day, we threatened it over a multitude of issues last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9179.175s">And</a>  the law says 45 days after she submits the budget, if we have not voted to approve it, it goes into effect automatically, with no change from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9186.943s">So</a>  I hear you, it's absolutely morally wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9190.467s">Absolutely,</a>  I think, politically stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9194.691s">But</a>  the <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9198.31s">I'll</a>  put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9199.45s">There's</a>  some charter amendments that are that we're all considering later tonight that would actually give the city council real backbone if if the mayor lets them go forward, which, you know, we'll see if that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9210.272s">But</a>  either way, we're planning, I think, to put them on the ballot this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9213.013s">And</a>  I think it's something that the city should vote for, because the residents should vote for, because I think it would give this council actually a fighting chance to help in certain situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9221.275s">That's</a>  one path that I'm going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9224.015s">The</a>  second one, obviously, is change the negotiating partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9227.496s">and</a>  the city may have a chance to do that at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9230.739s">The</a>  third thing I'll say and again I don't a public officials you don't usually hear public officials say this and be I really hate to put it back on to you, but a work stoppage, a strike, something to force her to the table, even if we don't vote for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9248.62s">it'll</a>  go into effect after 45 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9250.581s">So</a>  it's not the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9252.022s">I</a>  understand that strikes are illegal in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9254.423s">We've</a>  seen a lot of public sector strikes over the last two years that have been highly effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9258.586s">I'll</a>  stand that picket line with you every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9261.087s">So,</a>  you know, I know that's a really hard ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9264.029s">And</a>  that's why I but I no one's brought it up yet here before and all these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9269.869s">I</a>  sit here incredibly frustrated constantly at our inability to actually have any real authority to get the administration to do pretty much anything that we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9277.794s">Nevermind</a>  just the contract issue but a million other things charter amendment path is one path, I'm trying to go down to balance things. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9285.519s">I</a>  think we try to advocate with with the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9290.102s">But</a>  the buck has to stop somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9292.985s">There's</a>  nothing in the law that we can stop really anything for any more time than 45 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9299.17s">But</a>  you guys could stop the whole city, because you're not just the face of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9302.713s">You're</a>  the feet of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9303.634s">You're</a>  the people who actually do all the work every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9305.696s">And</a>  if suddenly the city came to a screeching halt, it would have a pretty big effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9310.86s">So</a>  I understand that's a really hard decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9313.342s">I'm</a>  not a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9313.983s">I</a>  wouldn't be voting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9315.044s">But</a>  if you all voted to do it, I'd be with you.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9318.055s">Like</a>  you said, there's just no answers on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9322.098s">Every</a>  time, no matter where I am, I always get, oh, the DPW, what are they doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9325.901s">Why</a>  aren't they doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9326.681s">Why</a>  aren't they doing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9327.402s">But</a>  we're trying to get stuff done and we're just not getting answers ourselves to get equipment we need or different things where, like I say, smoking mirrors, we're fixing, putting a flower pot on a light pole instead of, we could be all fixing sidewalks and streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9342.792s">We're</a>  doing what? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9345.068s">We're</a>  not doing what should be done, but we're doing little things that people might see. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9348.189s">We</a>  really should be doing other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9349.969s">But</a>  not just, as I said, it's not just not giving us a nice raise, it's taking other things away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9357.712s">Everything</a>  has been raised up, whether it's food, clothing, no matter what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9361.693s">We</a>  are not only not getting respected with the raise, it's sorry your clothing allowance is being lowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9368.435s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9369.948s">We,</a>  you got a stipend for this, well now we're lowering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9372.609s">You</a>  get so many sick days, well now those are being lowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9374.99s">Vacation</a>  days, those are being lowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9376.41s">They're</a>  taking away from us what they're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9380.812s">And</a>  she said, during COVID, we were here day in and day out for COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9385.707s">We</a>  also asked for COVID money. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9387.648s">Anytime</a>  somebody at City Hall had COVID, who was the first call, DPW, come down here and sanitize. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9393.55s">Somebody</a>  at the fire station has COVID, come down here and sanitize, DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9397.312s">Someone</a>  at the police station, COVID, DPW, come down and sanitize. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9401.053s">Yeah,</a>  we asked for COVID bonus. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9402.254s">Sorry,</a>  you're not really an essential worker, so you're not getting COVID money. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9405.715s">Yep,</a>  we were here day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9408.337s">So</a>  it's just even sitting in negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9413.049s">there's</a>  no one from the mayor staff there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9416.411s">We're</a>  getting, we tell them one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9418.872s">So</a>  we're getting KP Law's lawyer to sit in on negotiations with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9423.975s">We</a>  asked them for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9425.075s">They</a>  tell us, yeah, I'm gonna have to go back and speak to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9429.197s">And</a>  then I'll come back with an answer for you because I can't negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9432.639s">Well,</a>  if you're in negotiations, shouldn't you be able to negotiate? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9436.621s">I'll</a>  go get an answer from mayor, then I'll come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9439.788s">What</a>  I think people are forgetting is that office across the hall, you're not affecting just me, not affecting just Amy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9447.01s">I</a>  have a seven-year-old and a four-year-old at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9449.191s">That's</a>  who you're affecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9450.972s">That's</a>  who I'm looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9452.592s">Do</a>  I really want to send the school here? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9454.013s">Do</a>  I really want to stay here? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9455.813s">I</a>  love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9457.294s">I'm</a>  not trying to make a killing in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9462.015s">In</a>  the morning, I get a park ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9463.796s">I'm</a>  coaching on that field at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9466.297s">I</a>  take pride in doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9468.374s">And</a>  what's happening is you're getting people that, just like me, that love this city, that want to make this city better, that are leaving this city, and you're getting outsiders that come in and work that don't care what the streets look like or what the fields look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9479.697s">They</a>  just want to get a paycheck and leave and go to whatever city or town they're from. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9484.718s">It's</a>  just, I'm just fed up with it because I love this city and things are really starting to change around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9492.861s">Not</a>  for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9494.001s">As</a>  we saw earlier, I know everyone's laughing and joking, but <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9498.482s">with</a>  no city solicitor people laughing in the audience of what's going on and just from across the hall with this, the mayor's losing the city, so we have a Councilor Tseng and we'll, we'll come back to you as well.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9512.436s">I'll</a>  be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9513.177s">Um,</a>  I, I think we we've all said before you know how important you guys are to us that <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9520.044s">You</a>  know it bears repeating but also, I know it's words and I you guys want action. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9524.569s">Um,</a>  I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9526.752s">I</a>  think the idea about using the budget season to negotiate it from our side, I think, you know, we'll try to do our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9534.46s">And</a>  I actually think that's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9536.923s">You</a>  know we do run into the limit that Councilor bears said about the 45 days but I do think that's a good idea for us to use our time and our podium here to do right by you guys, and you said it's he's a nice phrase but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9552.213s">You're</a>  right, it's not a right nice phrase right it's it's living for your family and <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9556.279s">for</a>  your situation too, and you're so brave for coming up and talking about that openly with us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9563.543s">But</a>  it's not a nice phrase. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9565.825s">I</a>  mean, it's not like you guys are gonna make bank after that small raise, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9570.388s">And</a>  we all know inflation's been out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9573.43s">We</a>  all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9575.331s">So</a>  to go out and say you're not an essential worker and blah, that's not right, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9582.455s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9584.116s">Um,</a>  well we'll take a look during the budget and see what how much we can, we'll try our best to advocate for the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9592.305s">The</a>  $25 million in free cash I just wanted to put out there I've said week and week, week in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9597.691s">Once</a>  that was announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9599.032s">I</a>  don't get why we're not spending that on you guys on investing in the people who actually love the city and work for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9604.578s">It</a>  doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9605.438s">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9606.239s">And,</a>  you know, we can talk about wanting to do X project and Y project because they're all needs, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9612.622s">But</a>  you guys are in need, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9614.303s">We</a>  need you guys to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9616.024s">And</a>  we need to do the basics well before we can do anything else on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9620.626s">And</a>  when we don't pay you guys, we can't do the basics well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9624.888s">So</a>  I would like to see, I mean, we'll have to sit down with the administration and get the whole picture about the budget, but I would like to see the administration spend that cash on this, because this is unsustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9638.56s">The</a>  situation is unsustainable for us, for her administration, for the city, for the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9644.966s">It's</a>  unsustainable for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9647.808s">And</a>  I think you very bravely, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9652.051s">talked</a>  about the gender aspect of things too. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9655.032s">That's</a>  huge to talk about because, you know, people always cry, people always scream and shout when someone brings it up, but it's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9662.654s">It's</a>  true, it happens in our workforce, in City Hall, it happens everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9667.875s">And</a>  so there has to be more that we do about it, not just about your pays and your budget, but to give women workers in City Hall a better way to bring up <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9679.037s">these</a>  challenges, these problems that we're facing, these disparities. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9684.86s">And</a>  so I know Councilor Morell, President Morell has been on the leading front of pushing for us to have a gender equity commission and we have some potential draft language for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9695.526s">And</a>  it'd be great if we could move forward on that to give you guys a channel to talk about that openly as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9702.33s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9702.59s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli and go back to you both.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9708.042s">Well,</a>  I just want to thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9709.363s">I</a>  feel like there's not a lot that I could add that would be additive because you've said so much very clearly, briefly about what you've been going through for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9719.387s">I</a>  don't think there's anything that I could add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9720.947s">That</a>  wouldn't just be rhetorical that we've said already. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9722.928s">And</a>  I know it's very clear, you know, it goes without saying, but you've said it, what you need is not more statements of support, but actual results. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9731.892s">And</a>  it's obviously demonstrably true that times are getting harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9736.516s">Cost</a>  of living is going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9737.737s">It's</a>  not just inflation, it's cost of living, it's cost of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9741.44s">I</a>  think we probably all feel this in our personal budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9745.904s">And</a>  it's, we've been hearing about this for months, if not more, but it still is just completely, it's unfathomable to me how little you're being offered compared to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9760.791s">the</a>  real value of that compensation compared to what it takes to live in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9766.355s">I</a>  don't get why we would make it so hard for people who want to serve their community to stay in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9772.901s">I</a>  don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9774.302s">Like</a>  you said, nobody gets rich doing public service, they do it because of <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9778.931s">some</a>  kind of you know wanting to invest in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9781.253s">Why</a>  are we making it hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9782.594s">I'm</a>  glad the Councilor Tseng brought up the, the $25 million in free cash that was certified last July that we heard about a couple months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9791.46s">And</a>  I said it then but when I heard about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9794.582s">I</a>  wasn't happy, I was disgusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9797.284s">It's</a>  like why are we sitting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9801.418s">As</a>  you said, you're the lowest paid workers in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9805.18s">So</a>  even if you were to get an 8% cost of living adjustment, I don't have the math brain that some other of my fellow Councilors do, but I don't think that would make a dent in $25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9817.164s">I</a>  want an explanation for why that isn't being allocated to bring up the baseline on the people who have needed it the most for the longest and haven't gotten anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9825.688s">To</a>  make an offer to workers negotiating and then rescind that offer, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9831.412s">That's</a>  a negotiating tactic that I've heard about in other contexts that I thought was, I'm not even sure what the word is, hostile, openly hostile. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9843.46s">When</a>  I hear about that going on between other negotiating partners, it's meant to be intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9850.565s">It's</a>  meant to be a show of force, show of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9854.387s">Why</a>  would we do that to our clerks? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9856.809s">I</a>  don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9859.931s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9860.772s">We</a>  appreciate you being transparent with us going through I think we obviously have plenty of options to think through in terms of how we can handle this especially as the opportunity of budget season comes before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=9872.502s">Thank</a>  you for continuing to invite us to your negotiating meetings and I hope that we can all stay in touch both inside and outside of this chamber, as things go on.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10100.109s">So</a>  what I fear, what we don't know, we don't know what the budget's gonna, I'm afraid of as bad as it is in city halls, bad as it is out in the streets and the roads and the parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10115.921s">We</a>  don't know where we are, but I will tell you, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10119.725s">in</a>  negotiations as a school team member, as in negotiations in a municipal department where I work as a city councilor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10130.037s">Fagli,</a>  I understand exactly what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10133.761s">And</a>  I'm willing to stand with you and say, hey, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10137.207s">Let's</a>  start off this budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10138.788s">Let's</a>  start this process off by saying, hey, if part of the budget process with the city council isn't making everybody whole and making sure everybody's on the path to make sure that they're supported and they're shown the respect they deserve, I'm willing to stand with you in any day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10158.22s">I've</a>  done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10159.46s">I'm</a>  willing to do that any day of the week with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10165.704s">But</a>  I will tell you, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10168.383s">Where,</a>  what I'm, what I have, my disappointment, my fear is that we don't know where the climate, financial climate is in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10179.847s">I</a>  know Councilor is saying, we would love to, I agree with you, let's use that 25 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10184.489s">But</a>  we have a resolution out asking, where did this 25 million come from?

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10568.748s">And</a>  thank you to the clerical department, everyone at City Hall, DPW, everyone teams is over 25, because what we're having to put up with lately is just crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10576.193s">And</a>  for all the work the city's getting done with what we're having to deal with across the hall, it's pretty remarkable to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10582.457s">So</a>  thank you guys.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10583.557s">I'm</a>  going to go back to Vice President Bears, then we'll go back to Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10587.32s">I'll</a>  be quick, because that was probably a better ending than what I'm going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10591.576s">Sometimes</a>  I think George and I are like vying for Councilor buzzkill. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10595.379s">And</a>  I'm not sure which one of us is worse, but maybe it's like a Jacqueline Hyde kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10599.643s">And</a>  you can pick which one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10602.545s">But</a>  two things here really, for me, they're just like really sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10613.414s">And</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10615.478s">It's</a>  money and fear, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10618.001s">At</a>  a certain point, we have to say, how much is it going to cost to give you what you deserve? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10622.848s">If</a>  George is right and we're screwed, it doesn't change how much it's going to cost us to give you what you deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10628.996s">It</a>  just means that we're not going to have as much money to do it, so we have to figure out how to raise that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10633.403s">maybe</a>  there is a bunch of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10635.224s">Maybe</a>  this free cash thing is a real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10637.345s">And</a>  maybe, so maybe the money really is there, but there's fear to tell us what the situation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10644.309s">And</a>  then, and this is the part where I'm counseling Buzzkill, there's fear on the part of the mayor to say, okay, it's going to cost $5 million, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10652.874s">Like</a>  she's always talking about all these contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10655.675s">We</a>  got to give everyone the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10657.456s">That's</a>  what equity looks like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10660.378s">Well,</a>  you're not getting what the teachers are getting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10664.098s">And</a>  even in that contract, the lowest paid workers in the school system, the paraprofessionals, they figured out a way to make the job better and give them like a real market adjustment and pay significant, not 2%, like 20%, 25, 30% for the lowest paid workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10678.328s">So</a>  at the very least, let's use that as a model, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10681.331s">Let's</a>  say that's the baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10682.672s">And</a>  for the lowest paid workers, can we give a real market rate adjustment? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10685.273s">Because</a>  I think we all know that 45, 50, 55,000 is not cutting it in Medford anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10692.284s">But</a>  then the question is, right, like, okay, we really don't have the money right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10696.609s">Do</a>  we really think that the people of Medford wouldn't vote to raise money to pay the city workers fairly? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10701.115s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10702.356s">And</a>  that's the fundamental question at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10705.019s">I</a>  hope we don't have to ask, but we have to be willing to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10709.336s">That's</a>  just where I come down on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10710.677s">I</a>  know that maybe isn't the most popular thing to say all the time, but I cannot think of a better thing to fund with an override than giving you guys fair pay and benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10721.226s">I</a>  don't think the solution, if we don't want to do that because we're afraid to ask, is to stonewall you and take away your longevity and take away your sick bank and take away whatever else. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10732.011s">you</a>  know, never going to get 100% agreement on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10734.693s">But</a>  I think we're probably most reasonable people listening to say that the way these negotiations have been going is not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10742.019s">And</a>  the answer here is, at the end of the day, it's a money question. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10744.562s">So</a>  how much is it going to cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10745.743s">And</a>  how are we going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10746.884s">And</a>  I just think if we could answer those, if the mayor could come up and answer those two questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10752.048s">Yeah,</a>  maybe it puts it back on the you know, I put it back on you, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10754.81s">I'm</a>  like, go on strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10756.604s">You</a>  know, that's really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10758.646s">We</a>  can put it back on the voters too and say, hey, this is how much it costs to have fully staffed departments or at least better staffed departments where people get fair pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10768.653s">And</a>  that's kind of what I would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10770.054s">So</a>  maybe that's something we can squeeze out during this budget season is at least getting an answer, how much is it going to cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10775.818s">And</a>  then asking, why aren't we going to do the thing we need to do to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10779.261s">So</a>  I hope we can get something. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10782.503s">But</a>  George said it at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10785.719s">We're</a>  dejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10787.22s">I'm</a>  sure you're a million times more dejected than us, because you're here 40 hours a week and not 10 to 20 hours a week, and it's your family's pay on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10796.562s">But</a>  we're dejected too, and it sucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10798.443s">So</a>  it's the worst kind of solidarity I can present, but I feel you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10804.152s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10805.272s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10808.633s">You</a>  were in here earlier when we talked about our budget wishes and our budget problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10814.014s">But</a>  the ultimate bottom line is, if you don't get your raise this year, next year is going to be even worse because all these federal programs and all this federal money are all gone after the share. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10826.456s">So</a>  all the smoke and mirrors that you talk about are going to be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10833.363s">You</a>  made a statement a little while ago about how you should be doing more important issues like planting flowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10842.812s">This</a>  is the reason our city hasn't gone anywhere, because the last three years, we were planting flowers and giving out cupcakes and cookies to people, instead of looking at Malden, Everett, Somerville, and look what they did during COVID and over the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10857.104s">What</a>  do we have to show for three years of work? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10860.267s">Nothing,</a>  nothing, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10863.55s">And</a>  you ask me, say Rick goes down to and brings you stuff, you don't wanna know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10870.635s">I</a>  worked with my father in the family business forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10874.598s">My</a>  father was the biggest jerk to work for. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10878.281s">And</a>  my friends that worked with my dad, he was the biggest jerk to work for. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10882.123s">But</a>  one thing he told me, always take care of your workers, because they're the ones who make your job and make you look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10889.308s">Because</a>  without them, you have no business. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10892.611s">That's</a>  why I do what I do for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10896.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=10896.453s">We</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11105.298s">Yeah,</a>  we tend not to read it into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11107.079s">I</a>  think just from a time perspective, but they absolutely are. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11110.842s">I</a>  can ask Adam to include them in the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11112.563s">So</a>  anything submitted written would then be included in the records as well.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11115.365s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to submit it and I don't want to go over all the stuff I know about these dysfunctional conditions.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11670.136s">She</a>  is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11671.317s">I</a>  don't know if she's, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11673.179s">still</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11673.819s">I</a>  can ask her to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11675.681s">I</a>  know, I was just going to say.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Horan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11680.964s">Cheryl,</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11683.265s">There</a>  I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11684.566s">Have</a>  a good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11686.527s">Yeah,</a>  so my name is Cheryl Horn, and I'm vice president of Green Automotive, and we are a transportation company. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11694.672s">We</a>  were displaced by the Assembly Road Project in Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11699.134s">and</a>  then consequently displaced by the Green Line extension, which brought us to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11704.555s">So</a>  now we're here and again, what Sean had said, we do social service contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11711.076s">We</a>  provide non-emergency medical transportation to some of the most vulnerable populations of Cambridge, Somerville, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11719.438s">And</a>  this would be a license to repair the vehicles that we have in our fleet.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11725.559s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11725.92s">And</a>  you're in favor of the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11727.0s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11729.168s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11730.93s">Anyone</a>  else would like to speak in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11732.391s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, I see your hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11733.872s">Would</a>  you like to speak in favor of this petition?</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11737.996s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Mrs. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11741.539s">I</a>  am in favor of this petition, and I wish Russ Rossi best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11745.863s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11747.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11748.145s">Anyone</a>  else who would like to speak in favor of this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11753.737s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11756.339s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11763.645s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11768.589s">Any</a>  discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11769.53s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11770.531s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11774.254s">Mrs.</a>  Herman asked for an auto repair license. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11776.896s">This</a>  is an auto body and repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11780.479s">We're</a>  doing both. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11782.165s">I</a>  believe they just need an auto repair license.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11784.328s">It's</a>  under the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11785.79s">It</a>  comes under the same grouping. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11788.514s">It's</a>  one application.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11791.659s">So</a>  there will be no body shop in there?</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11794.103s">As</a>  far as I'm concerned, there will not be a body shop.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11803.723s">Thank</a>  you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11808.205s">I</a>  just want you to know for one Councilor, whenever you're standing in front of us, there's a sense of legitimacy and honor when you're here so I appreciate when you're representing any client so appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11822.668s">Yeah,</a>  and I but again, I think that my hobby is watching City Council so it really doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11827.797s">Sorry</a>  about that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11835.375s">So</a>  I, you know, you've been here, you were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11837.816s">I</a>  mean, our biggest issues is making sure that we make the right decisions legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11842.659s">And</a>  I think that understanding that this process and what it's intended for is what, you know, getting phone calls from people asking, you know, what is this for another auto body place? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11853.985s">And</a>  I think that having that clarity, just making that part of the record, if we could, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11858.387s">that</a>  this would be only an auto repair, and the license will stay with, it won't carry on to any, the new owner, that'll be identified just for this owner, and that if it's, she moves on, that the permit would die with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11877.611s">So</a>  if that's legal, I can't believe I'm gonna ask your opinion as a legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11883.452s">But</a>  I don't want to hold anything up.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11885.574s">The</a>  license states with the petitioner, not with the property.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11888.516s">Right,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11889.017s">So</a>  we want to make sure with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11890.018s">And</a>  then I know that the fire chief did put down that, this is a confusion piece, the legal piece that I have, no obvious violations observed. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11900.446s">But</a>  then he leaves a note, this is not ready for final inspection yet, 424. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11908.317s">Do</a>  you know what that is?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11909.878s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11910.879s">Cheryl</a>  had raised her hand so I don't know if you want to address any of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11913.841s">The</a>  two questions maybe about the auto body, the body, or as well as the not ready for final inspection yet.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Horan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11921.146s">Sure,</a>  so can you hear me, you can hear me now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11923.428s">Um,</a>  so there will not be any auto body. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11928.544s">you</a>  know, taking place any service like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11930.546s">It's</a>  just it's completely automotive repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11934.268s">And</a>  with regards to the inspection, the only reason why we're not ready for the inspection yet is because we're waiting for a transformer from National Grid, which has been the most outrageous procedure that we've ever had to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11951.619s">We</a>  petitioned in October and <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11954.385s">They</a>  still don't have a transformer for us, but they've told us that it will be in next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11958.868s">So,</a>  you know, hopefully we'll be able to get all the final inspections at that point, because we can't do anything final until they can power everything up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11967.773s">But</a>  everything is, like Sean said, 99% complete.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11973.35s">Okay,</a>  so I know that I appreciate that for the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11975.992s">That</a>  was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11976.513s">But</a>  I have been getting phone calls from representatives of National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11981.497s">And</a>  I guess there's some sort of is the city engineer on online? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11989.203s">Okay,</a>  so I know there was there was concerns about, you know, the National Grid <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=11996.433s">what</a>  they're putting in for service and approval isn't what's to the acceptance of our new engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12006.46s">And</a>  I don't know if they're falling into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12008.881s">So</a>  that's a question I was gonna ask.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12010.842s">I</a>  think they're scheduled, I think Cheryl can correct me, but I think they are scheduled to go out there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12014.925s">So</a>  I- So, because it hasn't been, it hasn't been in front of us, right?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12020.389s">Right,</a>  so they haven't come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12021.89s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12022.53s">So</a>  that's,</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12026.718s">If</a>  you can, I know I don't have an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12029.962s">I</a>  don't have any update based on what anything else that I told you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12035.848s">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12036.469s">So</a>  it's not coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12037.59s">It'd</a>  have to come in front of his body. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12038.931s">I</a>  have no, I have no further updates on that one because. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12042.29s">That's</a>  why I just, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12046.671s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, I didn't wanna put you in the spot, but I hate that we're holding businesses up, not just this one, but with national grid that maybe, I mean, it's not gonna help sway me in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12057.634s">I'm</a>  gonna see everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12058.534s">So</a>  I would move forward approval as stated with those pieces in writing that making sure that it's just a auto mechanic shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12069.416s">And</a>  obviously the, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12072.918s">that</a>  the permit stays with, that disappears with the... With the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12079.602s">Thank</a>  you so much, Mr. Beaton.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12081.384s">So</a>  we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve with the conditions that it is auto repair only and the license, the permit stays with the petitioner.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12092.792s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12093.853s">Madam</a>  President, if I can make a comment, and this is no disrespect to you or your clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12099.597s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12100.238s">Mrs.</a>  Horan made a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12103.641s">The</a>  reason for coming to Medford is because she was at Assembly Square and they got pushed out for much better developments, probably getting 10 times the amount of taxes that Mr. Horan was paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12116.162s">And</a>  we come over to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12118.027s">and</a>  we're going to get nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12120.548s">We're</a>  going to get a small return on taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12122.79s">So</a>  I hope on Thursday we're having a meeting to discuss this is what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12127.692s">People</a>  are getting pushed out of Somerville, a business like this buys a nice piece of land that we should be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12133.935s">It</a>  should have been something a lot better than this and no disrespect to your client, but Somerville gets 10 times the tax revenue and what do we get? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12144.381s">free</a>  lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12149.003s">We</a>  get a garage, paying minimal commercial taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12153.365s">So</a>  I hope on Thursday when we have our meeting, the people come, this is what I'm trying to drill home. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12160.308s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12160.989s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12162.049s">If</a>  I may, Madam President, I would also just note that <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12165.056s">They</a>  may be in the same situation in a few years here in Medford, that area is prime location and is in our comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12173.103s">No,</a>  I'm just saying our comprehensive plan, if suddenly that lands worth four or five, six times what they paid and invested into it, they may be moving yet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12181.149s">So</a>  just wanna put that out there.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12184.652s">So</a>  we have the motion from Councilor Scarpelli as seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12189.757s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll with those conditions.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12198.832s">So</a>  two resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12200.833s">Oh,</a>  sorry, I'm ready for your roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12204.615s">So</a>  yeah, if you want to call it all.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12226.057s">Uh,</a>  uh, 60 in front of zero, the negative one absent motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12229.9s">Thank</a>  you everyone.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12272.045s">And</a>  again, that's the questions people were asking that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12274.426s">you</a>  know, with the private way, physical both ways now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12279.889s">Massive</a>  amount of traffic that's rolling in their roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12283.992s">These</a>  are the questions they're asking.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12286.733s">So</a>  what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12287.554s">And</a>  we can talk about it in two weeks.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12290.296s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Bears to table to the next regular meeting, Q3-313 and Q3-314, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12297.78s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=12298.401s">Aye.</a> </p>
