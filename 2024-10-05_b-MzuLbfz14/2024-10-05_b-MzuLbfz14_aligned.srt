00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:11,483
Meeting of the Medford City Council May 23 2023 is called to order Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:15,267
He is on zoom.

3
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:18,250
He may have had to leave and come back and he's not.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,132
I mean, I can see him.

5
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:25,390
President seven present please rise.

6
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:48,815
City Council.

7
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:50,177
Announcements accolades,

8
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,820
celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month and wish our burgeoning AAPI community a happy month.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,520
Councilor Seng.

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,161
Thank you.

11
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:08,882
The AAPI community in Medford is one of the fastest growing communities in our city.

12
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:26,246
This is a wonderful opportunity to wish that community a happy month and also an important opportunity for us to bring up issues that are particularly pertinent to the community that our city council has been very

13
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:37,851
proactive in addressing, and a lot of those solutions now lie with administration and in committees here.

14
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:46,935
But I had the honor of going down to Boston representing our city at the big AAPI celebration there.

15
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:54,579
And a lot of those leaders recognized that Medford was on the front lines of a lot of issues that were relevant or important to the AAPI community.

16
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,680
So I think that's something that we can be proud of as well.

17
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,282
Thank you, Councillor Seng.

18
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,183

25
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,923
He's not.

26
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:25,084

79
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:31,071
But a lot of folks don't know that Medford is home to a very rich, a very long standing Jewish community here in Medford.

80
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:38,575
And they've contributed a lot to our development as a city and our growth and our city history.

81
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:43,238
And I wanted to take this time to celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month as well.

82
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:50,602
And I know that our city has had a lot of work to do on antisemitism.

83
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:55,565
But we, again, have a proactive council.

84
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:59,786
Councilor Collins has been amazing on resolutions to deal with those problems.

85
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,368
And I think that's something that we can celebrate this month, too.

86
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:06,149
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

87
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,631

106
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:17,784
Subcommittee on ordinances and rules on May 9 2023, I will propose amendments to the charter, I will go to Vice President bears.

107
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:19,145
Thank you, Madam President.

108
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:25,108
In this meeting and I'll speak to the May 16 meeting as well and we can vote on those at the same time, since we're roll calling tonight.

109
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:35,732
We discussed the three targeted proposed charter amendments to the city charter that the council has been discussing for the last really almost last two months.

110
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:46,415
Those targeted charter amendments would be to have a better balance of power regarding budgetary authority and require council confirmation of mayoral appointments to

111
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:48,056
to the proposed charter amendments.

112
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:49,737
We have those for our consideration tonight.

113
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,738
This is now the process where

114
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:13,094
we'll be taking up those amendments in a public hearing.

115
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:14,635
There can be changes proposed.

116
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:18,758
We can hear from members of the public once again for I believe what would be the fifth time.

117
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:33,368
And then if the council so approves those proposed amendments, they would go to the mayor and the mayor would, if she approves, be able to then submit those to the attorney general for consideration on the November ballot where voters would vote on these proposed changes to the city charter.

118
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:38,012
With that, I would move approval on both reports of committees.

119
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,951
Thank you, vice-president Behrs.

120

And just name and address for the record, please.

158
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,485
Okay, I'm Luis.

159
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:36,766
I'm one of the owner of Oasis.

160
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,486
I'm here with my partner tonight, Luciano.

161
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:45,409
The reason we're applying for this hours, it's because we've been there for 23 years.

162
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,253
And we have so many attendants from around the restaurants, from all the church.

163
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:58,480
Their service finish at 10 o'clock, most of the time on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

164
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:06,326
And they call us many times to come with a group to celebrate birthday, people from church.

165
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:09,849
So if we take the reservation, if we see them like 10.30,

166
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,263
we got to serve them.

167
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:27,136
So what they want me to do now is like to 11 o'clock to kick everybody out, just trying to, you know, at least have the ability to if they, if they're there, no having dinner, like at 11 o'clock, I have, you know, if they're like go past 11.

168
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:28,998
So I have, you know,

169
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,951
I want to have the ability to serve them until they're done.

170
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:35,693
I mean, the license we're applying is just to extend to one.

171
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:41,275
It's just to have it, because we're not going to stay there until one o'clock, unless there's an event or something.

172
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:48,118
But most of the time, it's going to be just to have the license, not to go past 11, because for now, we can only serve until 11.

173
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:49,178
Great.

174
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:49,839
Thank you.

175
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,120
Are there questions from the council at this time before we open up the public hearing?

176
00:10:55,448 --> 00:11:01,475
Seeing none, as this is a public hearing, we will open up first for people in favor of the petition.

177
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,557
So anyone in favor of the petition?

178
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,039
I would assume you're in favor?

179
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,162
You are in favor of the petition?

180
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:09,123
Great, thank you so much.

181
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,528
Anyone else who would like to speak in favor, you can step aside or sit down while we continue.

182
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:13,828
Thank you.

183
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:16,901
Anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the petition?

184
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:17,982
Mr. Navar?

185
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:21,285
William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

186
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:30,234
I should hope that the council could address people's concerns so that the special permit can go forward and South Medford Square could have a late night dining option for people.

187
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:35,479
I've been caught in a situation where I have to run pretty quickly to get to Oasis before it closes before.

188
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,360
It's kind of frustrating.

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,341
Thanks.

190
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:38,182
Thank you.

191
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:45,256
Is there anyone's anyone else either in person or on zoom, please raise your hand who would like to speak in favor of the petition.

192
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:55,562
Okay, and we also did get one email as well in favor for to speak in favor.

193
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:56,182
Okay.

194
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:00,204
I will also know we do have Commissioner.

195
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:02,005
Do you want to speak in favor?

196
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,707
I'm sure please come up and just name and address for the record, please.

197
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:09,978
Good evening, everybody.

198
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,420
My name is Harrison, Summit Street, Metfit.

199
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,542
I know Oasis says that they're open.

200
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,663
So I've seen all the improvements.

201
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:18,783
They've been doing it.

202
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:24,327
So I don't see a problem, because they always keep up the place clean, neat.

203
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:31,771
And I've never seen a problem there with regards to liquor or noises or anything.

204
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,793
Maybe sometimes when people leave, talking a little louder, but it's normal.

205
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,615
And I'm in favor to, you know,

206
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,113
to apply for a little extension.

207
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:42,594
I think it's worth it.

208
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:43,354
Great.

209
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:45,235
Thank you.

210
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:47,317
And I do see Director Hunt.

211
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:52,360
And just so I could note too, we do have Commissioner Forte on the line too, should the council have questions later.

212
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,581
Someone else.

213
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:54,181
Oh, yep.

214
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:55,362
You can just come right up.

215
00:12:55,402 --> 00:13:00,005
If you want to speak in favor, you can come right up and make a line and then we'll go on Zoom as well.

216
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,914
Hi, my name is Geraldo Andrade.

217
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:08,456
I'm the owner of 376 Main Street, the convenience store right across the street from the restaurant.

218
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:17,561
And I would like to speak in favor of them because they helped me improve my business by being there, you know, with the visibility of my business.

219
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:19,882
And they also keep their place nice and neat.

220
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:22,143
So I think they're both hard workers.

221
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,464
And they also

222
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:30,198
there's a lot of employees, so they actually help contribute with the city for taxes and all that stuff.

223
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:30,959
So, yes.

224
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,159
Great, thank you.

225
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
We'll go to Director Hunt.

226
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,281
Are you speaking in favor?

227
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,341
Okay, I will unmute you.

228
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:44,062
Good evening, Councillors.

229
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:52,565
I just wanted to voice from the perspective of economic development that there is a benefit to the community to have

230
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:55,769
additional meals tax, additional liquor tax.

231
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:05,571
From restaurants, we are excited to see a very thriving restaurant down in South Medford and the life that it brings to the square down there.

232
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:08,612
And I just wanted to voice that perspective on that.

233
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,692
Thank you, Director Hunt.

234
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,893
We will go to Brant on Zoom.

235
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:16,093
Brant, name and address for the record, please.

236
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:17,093
Oops, I think I just muted you.

237
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:18,214
Sorry.

238
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:19,574
There we go.

239
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,631
Hi, my name is Brant Casavant.

240
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:26,893
I'm a resident at 15 Yale Street, so I'm quite close to Oasis.

241
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:30,914
I'm in support of Oasis being able to stay open till 1 AM.

242
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,635
I think it's a great local business.

243
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,676
It's the center of a lot of diversity around here.

244
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:41,979
I've never had any complaints about them or their staff or their patrons, even though I live right around the corner.

245
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:47,661
They have really good coffee and really good pastries, and it would be nice to have a place around here that stayed open till 1 o'clock.

246
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:49,482
Thank you.

247
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:53,999
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

248
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,420
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

249
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:03,382
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this paper?

250
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:04,482
Please come up.

251
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,283
You can line up or you can just come up.

252
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,243
You don't have to raise your hands.

253
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,106
Good evening.

254
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:22,549
My name is Anne Fretz, and I'm a resident at 215 Harvard Street.

255
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:23,831
I've been there for 13 years.

256
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:29,356
And Boris, he's one of the trustees of the Lincoln-Kennedy condominium complex.

257
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:34,502
He's directly impacted by whatever happens at Oasis, happens next door to our neighborhood.

258
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:40,028
This is the area of Medford, South Medford, that is impacted by

259
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:49,958
when their customers leave their area, when their staff leaves or arrives the area, they use Yale Street or Harvard Street.

260
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:58,460
They will depart the area through Dartmouth Street and Princeton Street or scooting down Yale Street.

261
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,262
We hear everything that happens in the parking lot, which is used 95% by

262
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,358
Oasis customers.

263
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,724
And as far as church going customers who were dining in the restaurants.

264
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:15,069
Most of the parking spaces in the lot are filled up by

265
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,692
eight o'clock or 730 if there's an entertainment going on in that area.

266
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:34,061
So there's really no place for a church group to be parking, so they would be illegally parking on the streets which is filling up the area, blocking our homes, and when they leave, they're honking their horns the decibel reaches 100.

267
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:42,548
DBS outside our windows, a scream will carry 200 yards at 100 decibels if they're screaming when they enter the area.

268
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:54,597
We have trespassers cutting through the parking lot to get to the other parking lot under our windows and they are arriving to start work at 5 30 in the morning.

269
00:16:55,818 --> 00:17:03,645
Even after staying open until I believe it was 12 45 one evening over and above the hours that they stay

270
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:06,763
to stay open.

271
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:16,285
That was I think most recently on March 22nd, we had three noise disturbances because not everyone will leave the area at once.

272
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,086
So it's a dribble, constant noise hitting all of us.

273
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:27,909
I'd like to read our prepared statement, just show you another photo of the area.

274
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:32,570
You can see that we have three story buildings surrounding the lot.

275
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,380
Perhaps this is easier.

276
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,981
Is that better?

277
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:47,251
And you also have the same photos in the packets that I handed you, along with documentation of the emails and going back about five years in history.

278
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:49,113
And I'll start at the beginning.

279
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:53,536
I've been a resident of Medford for the past 13 years.

280
00:17:54,587 --> 00:18:01,190
My home overlooks Yale Street and the neighborhood parking lot, as well as our condominium complex.

281
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:13,155
When the parking lot opened on Yale Street in October, 2010, I realized it needed traffic and directional signs, trash barrels, trash pickup, and the like to function properly.

282
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:17,237
There was no indication the needed items were going to be supplied by the city.

283
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:23,780
I asked many at City Hall who would maintain the lot, removing snow and caring for the well landscaped area.

284
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:39,430
I was surprised to hear that an unwritten agreement required the new 50 condo owners, me being one of them, to be responsible for the care and feeding of the public lot, all of which was designed for the neighborhood use and Main Street businesses.

285
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:45,174
Condo owners who were responsible for the lot were not allowed to park in it or on Yale Street.

286
00:18:46,649 --> 00:19:02,803
At that time there was no method home mention of any main street business owner or tenant being responsible for all of the maintenance of the 40 spaces, nor has there been any assumption of responsibility and or involvement in maintaining the lot or asking for support from the city.

287
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,767
of any of the Main Street businesses as of today.

288
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:18,395
My neighbor, Dave Propella, and I continue to remove the trash, discarded beer bottles, dog poop from people coming by, handles, and nips every day.

289
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:25,781
The lot is now full to capacity every day, with 95% of the spate used by Main Street owners, staff, and their customers.

290
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:32,706
Many of them are taking advantage of the lack of parking enforcement in the lot and on the street, blocking residents' driveways.

291
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:40,202
bragging about not having to pay to park in the public parking lot because there's no enforcement.

292
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:43,565
This is a 24 hour situation for all of us down there.

293
00:19:44,952 --> 00:20:00,056
And again, the 100 residents of Lincoln Kennedy hear all of the voices, the screams, the backfiring engines, with the Ford 250 trucks having a decibel level of 100 when they backfire, and the horns are at 100 decibels as well.

294
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,757
There isn't a sound machine that exists on the market today that covers anything beyond 85 dBs.

295
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:10,390
I used to work at Boat, Brannigan Newman, the acoustic specialist, so I understand all this.

296
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:16,194
It's becoming incumbent upon the residents to have adequate safety lighting installed.

297
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:21,117
We requested the installation of safety measures such as bollards and signs for the traffic commission.

298
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:34,685
We also contact the MPD to deal with disturbances or aberrant behavior and alert the DPW, like we did yesterday, and trash, snow, weeds, and animal or human waste, which we found yesterday, needs to be removed.

299
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:37,527
Dave and I, and Anita also lead the lot.

300
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:46,914
The lot deteriorated from 2011 to 2020 dragging down the area and the public's perception of our neighborhood, and our condos.

301
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,676
The lot was renovated in fall of 2021 based on a plan I submitted in 2012.

302
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:00,643
and again in 2021, I'm sorry, 2020 to Mayor Luongo-Cohen.

303
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:04,466
Oasis owners were asked for the input on the plan, but they did not respond.

304
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:19,556
The city of Medford, the creator of the rules, city ordinances, licenses, and permits that organize our lives in Medford, has basically abandoned our neighborhood, our residential neighborhood, in favor of the success of one Main Street commercial for-profit business.

305
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:35,123
The city is leaving control of the conditions in our neighborhood and quality of our lives in the hands of voices owners to very nice guys who market a great and inexpensive product, while building a booming late night entertainment venue.

306
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:46,831
Unfortunately, Oasis patrons and the staff continue their parties and activities from the bar into our residential neighborhood where they continue to celebrate life past midnight.

307
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:48,612
And that's with the 11 p.m.

308
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,113
closing.

309
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:58,459
Abutters have always had noisy issues emanating from the Yale Street lot and have notified Oasis about every issue we have encountered.

310
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,422
and we've started ignoring them, but we still haven't had a response.

311
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:13,789
It's been exacerbated since middle of March, when the entertainment venues started ending at 1 a.m., 11.30, 12.30, or whenever.

312
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:16,131
They determined their own path.

313
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:26,937
Should Oasis be granted a special permit to operate until 1 a.m., the commercial customers will be in our residential zone until 2 a.m., with their staff waking us again at 5.30 a.m.

314
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,355
when they arrive to open the cafe.

315
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,303
for the behavior of their customers.

316
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:36,264
Since 2010 Oasis owners have stated they are not responsible for the behavior.

317
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:39,805
Their customers are not culpable for the actions of their staff.

318
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:44,627
During 2023 Oasis management disregarded the 11 P.m.

319
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:48,169
licensed operating hours remaining open past 11.

320
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:50,270
Past midnight past 12 30.

321
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,351
If I could just interrupt you briefly, I'm going to hold you, um,

322
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:15,060
We've asked the city to respond, to meet with us, to discuss these issues, and we haven't heard much other than, we're sorry, your sleep has been disrupted, but we want to see our businesses thrive.

323
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,623
And I also would like to add that the abutters contribute between $350,000 to $400,000 to the city of Metro between our property taxes and excise taxes.

324
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:35,340
while we see the taxes from drinks, meals, and property taxes for Oasis at around 35 to 40,000 a year.

325
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:37,044
Thank you for your time.

326
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:37,505
Thank you.

327
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,162
Yeah, I'm just going to reiterate.

328
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:44,025
So the council has rules of five minutes per agenda item for public speaking public comments.

329
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,566
It's something I usually waive because we don't have a ton of people here.

330
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:49,408
We have a lot of people here tonight who want to speak on a lot of different things.

331
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:52,029
So I'm just letting people know I'm going to hold them to that tonight.

332
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:58,393
So we want to continue anyone else who would like to speak in opposition, please come right up to the podium.

333
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:06,577
Good evening needed Antonio 14 Yale Street, Medford.

334
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:08,939
I am in opposition to this.

335
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,222
You can have all your permits in order.

336
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:17,688
The law may be on your side, but there's an issue in its quality of life.

337
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:21,331
And as residents, we have been drawn into

338
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,246
a commercial zone, frankly.

339
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:41,714
First, because there was a parking lot put right in the middle of our homes, which means that anybody coming from any business on Main Street who is parked in that lot has to cross in front of our homes in order to get to that lot.

340
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:49,298
On top of that, and that's a lot of foot traffic in itself,

341
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:59,784
There has been, there's another issue besides quality of life, which reflects that, and that is a total lack of enforcement.

342
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:10,391
Parking, Board of Health, whatever, I mean, code enforcement, it is catch as catch can.

343
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:16,435
It's not consistent, it's not regular, so therefore,

344
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:30,098
People completely ignore residential parking, park in front of homes, block driveways, and a majority of this comes from the restaurant, Oasis Restaurant.

345
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:35,339
I don't care if it's from Bocelli's, Maze Cafe, where it's from.

346
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,380
If one of those establishments came and asked for a 1 a.m.

347
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,341
closing, I would be here.

348
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,502
I don't want that to happen.

349
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:46,383
They are intruding on a residential area.

350
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:47,644
11 p.m.

351
00:25:47,824 --> 00:25:53,326
is sufficient unless we're deciding that we want to turn Main Street into an entertainment zone.

352
00:25:54,027 --> 00:26:03,091
I would like to ask about the church attendance at Oasis after services.

353
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:06,753
Is this seven days a week or is this on a Sunday?

354
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,495
Is this the primary reason as to why they want to stay open until 1 a.m.? ?

355
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:18,880
It's to me, and there are so many issues with this I've lived with it so long.

356
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:20,802
We've tried to be good neighbors.

357
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:23,438
It's very difficult.

358
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,680
As I said, block driveways, you call the parking department.

359
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,701
First of all, you don't get anyone on the phone, you get a voicemail.

360
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:40,083
They have a very, very minimal staff there, and they're supposed to cover the city.

361
00:26:40,463 --> 00:26:45,385
We have a chronic problem on that first block of Yale Street.

362
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:55,408
It also is a safety problem and this this is owing to what the restaurant attracts in the morning and afternoon, it's like a truck stop.

363
00:26:55,828 --> 00:26:58,009
We have a lot of commercial vehicles that park.

364
00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:03,250
And then in the evening you have another group of people, they also ignore the signs.

365
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:09,172
I've worked with this for so long, without any

366
00:27:09,892 --> 00:27:11,473
any good result at all.

367
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,814
As a matter of fact, none.

368
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:14,314
There is no enforcement.

369
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:22,018
That's if you can't cure the enforcement problem, then you shouldn't be extending hours to 1am.

370
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:30,483
Really, because it's, it's, it's very distressful I can say chapter and verse instances that have occurred.

371
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:49,935
whether it's your nation, broad daylight, whether it's blocking driveways, whether it's it's nasty talk coming from patrons, when you tell them that it's a residential parking area, please go down to the parking lot, 40 car parking lot.

372
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:55,658
And this still continues completely ignore the signs, no enforcement.

373
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,399
So now we're going to have this until 1am.

374
00:27:59,504 --> 00:28:02,006
And what enforcement can you guarantee?

375
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:12,734
Can you tell me that there'll be somebody from parking department in Medford there to make sure no one is overstaying when they shouldn't overstay?

376
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:19,539
Will we have the police officers down there on a detail to see that people aren't driving drunk out of that lot?

377
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,381
I mean, there's a lot of dynamics with this.

378
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,984
And we can say, well, it's all legal.

379
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,607
But what is right, and what is quality of life.

380
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:38,992
The question comes down to do we as residents have a quality of life and peaceful enjoyment of our homes.

381
00:28:39,412 --> 00:28:52,940
We're just touching the surface with regard to the problems I have with a racist, believe me, whether it's working on getting them to close dumpsters, getting more dumpsters, cleaning up the alleyway.

382
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,941
I mean, it's just, it's beyond.

383
00:28:56,382 --> 00:29:01,984
We also have the, we have a bus stop that's non-existent anymore because it's used as a parking area.

384
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:06,707
Today I went by, entirely encompassed with cars.

385
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:11,769
Now, it can be the other, and let's, what about the other businesses on the street?

386
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,311
They don't have an opportunity to have people park there.

387
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,792
There's one particular business.

388
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:17,912
It's in and out.

389
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:20,314
You go in and you buy something, you come out.

390
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,555
That business is,

391
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:27,873
the customers never get an opportunity to park on Main Street, never.

392
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,215
Very, very rarely.

393
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:34,599
And also when these cars are parking, they're not parking there for 10 minutes.

394
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:41,089
We have people who park there for an hour, two hours in front of your homes on Main Street.

395
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:42,470
No enforcement, again.

396
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,511
We're at our five minutes, so you have any last thoughts?

397
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:45,051
Well, thank you.

398
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:48,494
I hope that you consider the quality of life for the residents.

399
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:52,737
I think they were enough here to give you testimony as to what's been going on.

400
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:55,979
And it's not the rosy picture that's been painted, believe me.

401
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:58,761
And we live right abutting the restaurant.

402
00:29:58,881 --> 00:29:59,701
Thank you very much.

403
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,242
Thank you.

404
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:04,725
Anyone else would like to speak in opposition of the special permit being sought?

405
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:10,453
Name and address for the record, please.

406
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:13,495
I am John Femino.

407
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,675
I live at 40 Princeton Street in Medford.

408
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,517
So General Oasis is an excellent restaurant.

409
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,197
I'm glad they're part of our neighborhood.

410
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:29,140
As one of the persons for our extension mentioned, the patrons can be quite noisy when they leave.

411
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,502
And they actually park in the parking lot everybody's kind of mentioned.

412
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:37,203
That's directly in, it's like two blocks from my house.

413
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:48,188
Um, so these funnel these residents or these patrons funnel right into a residential neighborhood and they're leaving Oasis and generally quite loud as they say their goodbyes in the parking lot after a few drinks.

414
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:56,594
Even with current hours, patrons often be found heading to their cars well past 1130 and due to the one way they funnel straight into a residential neighborhood.

415
00:30:57,574 --> 00:31:05,039
So currently it's quite a nice and quiet neighborhood and I think these extended hours will negatively impact the quality of life for the residents there.

416
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,220
Thank you.

417
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,611
Anyone else who would like to speak in opposition?

418
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:16,654
Name and address for the record, please.

419
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:18,715
Sandy Bodner, 21 Yale Street.

420
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:20,115
So I live across from the parking lot.

421
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:21,636
I've been living there 20 years.

422
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:26,918
I do want to say that I think Oasis has been, personally, I think they've been very good neighbors.

423
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,200
I think Luciano is a delightful person.

424
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,521
I think their food is very good.

425
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:35,862
I know half the people there and I don't even go there that often.

426
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:37,163
I mean, they're a very warm group.

427
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:40,717
So I live across the street from the parking lot.

428
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:56,087
I was one of the people who was very much in favor of keeping the parking lot when the school went condo, because I thought that it was a great service to have these really fabulous restaurants.

429
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:01,689
And so we have this huge parking lot.

430
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:05,790
And I was very worried about the 1 a.m.

431
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:08,391
I have to be honest, I think that's too late.

432
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:19,856
And I don't understand why you need seven days a week that late if you're talking about church customers on the weekend.

433
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:26,058
But if there was a slight accommodation to be made for them to be a little bit later,

434
00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:29,357
I mean, maybe that wouldn't for me.

435
00:32:29,377 --> 00:32:31,039
I mean, I'm right there.

436
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:34,202
They don't wake me up at one o'clock in the morning, I'm worried they'll come out late.

437
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:37,245
My bedroom faces the street.

438
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:42,169
But I don't, I haven't seen anything disruptive.

439
00:32:43,871 --> 00:32:46,793
And I just wonder if a small accommodation can be made for them.

440
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,235
But I think 1am is too much.

441
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:48,875
Thank you.

442
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:49,716
Thank you.

443
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:58,612
I'm gonna go actually, I'm gonna go to Ron D on Zoom and then we'll come back to in person.

444
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,910
Ron.

445
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:04,471
Yes, thank you.

446
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:05,891
My name is Ron Del Gesi.

447
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:11,753
I'm a resident and owner of the property at 356-358 Main Street, and I'm a veteran.

448
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:19,976
And my family and I have owned this property since 1978, and we've seen the various shifts in the neighborhood.

449
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:26,718
And to reiterate what prior speakers have said, we've seen a significant decrease in the quality of life.

450
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:32,900
Specifically, we've seen a lot of parking transgressions.

451
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:47,964
In fact, let me state for the record that 356, 358 Main Street, as well as my neighbors at 360 and 362, we live between Wright Ave and Golden Ave, which is about 75 yards or 100 yards away from the restaurant.

452
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:54,787
And we do not have resident parking only signs in front of our houses.

453
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:55,987
As a result,

454
00:33:56,387 --> 00:34:02,191
We can't park on the side street because we don't have the resident permit, even though we've lived here for nearly 50 years.

455
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:08,034
And yet we have people from Oasis who park in front of our houses all day long.

456
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:13,137
In fact, if you want, I can send you a photograph which I took yesterday morning of a car.

457
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,876
whose dashboard had a sign on it that says Oasis Steakhouse Driver.

458
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,319
And that was at 5.30 in the morning.

459
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,965
And to correct some of the speakers, these people don't just show up at 5.30.

460
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:28,327
They're there at 4 o'clock in the morning.

461
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:31,271
And again, they stay there all night, all day.

462
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:38,454
And it's really frustrating to even try to get out of my driveway when it's partially blocked, completely blocked.

463
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:48,998
And to add injury to all of this, when these people, whether they're patrons or staff, finally leave the restaurant, they're not quiet.

464
00:34:49,138 --> 00:35:00,902
As other people have indicated, they make a commotion, not all the time, but it's significant and frequent enough to be noticeable that there are loud arguments, loud discussions.

465
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:06,083
doors opening and closing, and it's just not a very good quality of life.

466
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:17,967
And as far as setting the record straight, too, there were two prior speakers in favor of the petition who referred to Oasis being a Medford Square, which is absolutely incorrect.

467
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,468
This is South Medford, and as Ms.

468
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:24,849
D'Antonio said, it's at the bus stop, which has now become

469
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:26,950
practically obsolete.

470
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,091
So we're talking about South Medford, not Medford Square.

471
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:42,118
I wish the best in business opportunities for all businesses throughout Medford, but we, the residents, sacrifice a tremendous amount of quality of life and personal sacrifice.

472
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:58,525
Furthermore, I noticed that the petition talks about wanting to extend the hours from Sunday through Saturday, which is rather a strange way of phrasing it because essentially they're talking about seven nights or seven days and nights a week.

473
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:08,869
I could understand if they said they want to extend it on the weekend, Saturday and Sunday, but saying Sunday through Saturday basically runs through every day of the week and then the cycle starts again on Sunday.

474
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,530
So it makes no sense.

475
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:16,797
I think that's all I would like to say because I can go on for hours.

476
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:41,176
But again, maybe one way to solve this at least for the residents here on Main Street would be to install some resident parking only signs and give us the opportunity to have a place to place our vehicles and also to give us some visitor passes when we have people visiting us, they also have no place to park.

477
00:36:41,636 --> 00:37:06,997
So at a start, to eliminate the parking problem, at least city council should consider the area between Wright Ave and Golden Ave, install resident parking only signs, give us those resident permits, give us some visitor passes, and that would at least eliminate the abuse, the terrible abuse of parking, noise, commotion, and congestion that the Oasis Restaurant has brought over the years.

478
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:10,480
And I appreciate the opportunity.

479
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,480
Thank you.

480
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,121
Thank you.

481
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:15,583
Anyone else would like to speak in opposition?

482
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:23,928
Name and address for the record, please.

483
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:24,308
Good evening.

484
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:32,373
My name is John Martinello, right after Medford, Massachusetts, resident since 1967.

485
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:33,614
So I've been there a while.

486
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:41,067
And just wanted to, I'll probably reiterate what everybody said, so I'll try to be shorter.

487
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:45,188
Yeah, this is a residential area.

488
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,268
I just want to make it clear.

489
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:50,209
It's seven days a week, 11 to 1 p.m.

490
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,129
I wish it was like that when I was a teenager.

491
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:58,130
I mean, when I was younger, I wouldn't have to go to Faneuil Hall to party.

492
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,830
I mean, if I'm that age, guess where I'm going?

493
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,891
I'm going to Oasis and save the bus ride.

494
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:18,215
The other thing is, I guess the city council has to give this special permit only if it does not adverse the neighborhood.

495
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:25,521
But the parking, I live on Wright Avenue, and the parking, especially on the weekends, is completely unenforceable.

496
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:29,065
And people are parking there.

497
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:31,958
with no permits, you don't know who's there.

498
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,600
There's potholes on that street.

499
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:42,946
I mean, I've took pictures today, there's potholes everywhere, which just enhanced the rambling of the commercial trucks that go pounding down that street.

500
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:45,708
And a lot of them come from the businesses up the street.

501
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,072
Just a couple more quick notes.

502
00:38:51,272 --> 00:38:54,594
Also 11 to one, seven days a week, does that set a precedent?

503
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:57,027
for the rest of the city?

504
00:38:57,307 --> 00:39:02,631
Will all the other liquor license establishment come up and petition for that as well?

505
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:07,434
What clientele is coming at 11 to 1 p.m.?

506
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:15,220
I know the business owners and I respect business owners for their ability to make a profit and make a living.

507
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:18,162
But what clientele is coming at 11 to 1?

508
00:39:18,783 --> 00:39:20,764
They suggested church people come at 11 to 1.

509
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:24,026
I would like to see the evidence if they can provide it.

510
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,634
Currently they're open 6 a.m.

511
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:30,714
and they want to go to one.

512
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:31,915
That's 19 hours a day.

513
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:35,236
I don't know what other business does that.

514
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:38,778
And just a couple more items.

515
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:47,842
The enforcement, which is not party to the special permit, but the enforcement on parking on Ride Ave is just non-existent.

516
00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:52,644
I've had cars there park 12, 15 days with no tickets on them.

517
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:56,926
And also with respect to the business,

518
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:10,298
some of the other residents have mentioned that this particular business is creating a monopoly in the area, and that can only be suppressed by rules and city council.

519
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:10,938
Thank you.

520
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:11,879
Thank you.

521
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,180
Anyone else would like to speak in opposition, either in person or on Zoom?

522
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,762
I'm sorry, I think this gentleman was coming up first.

523
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,961
Hi, my name's David Perrella.

524
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:29,083
I live at 16 Yale Street.

525
00:40:29,443 --> 00:40:31,325
I've been a resident of Medford since 1970.

526
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:38,311
Anne Fretz put the petition together, so I would like to read it here.

527
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:55,646
So dear city council members, we the undersigned concerned residents are writing this petition to strongly oppose the proposed extension of the operating hours of Oasis restaurant to 1 a.m.

528
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:58,447
I'm sorry, I'm a little anxious here.

529
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:05,429
We are deeply concerned about the negative impacts such an extension would have in our community.

530
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:14,604
public safety is our top priority, and we fear that the late night crowds and activities could increase the risk of crime and accidents in the area.

531
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:26,393
Furthermore, late night noise disruptions have been a major issue for residents who live near the restaurant and those who home surround the public parking lot where Oasis customers park.

532
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:31,452
The current operating hours until 11 p.m.

533
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:36,117
are already causing disturbances during the late night, and an extension until 1 a.m.

534
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:42,584
would only exacerbate the issue, with the disruptive activities in the parking lot continuing until 2 a.m.

535
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:50,192
We believe that everyone has the right to a peaceful sleep, and that this extension would be a serious threat to our well-being.

536
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:58,584
Additionally, both Oasis customers and staff have shown a constant disregard for the abutters and residents in the area for the past decade.

537
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:04,765
And I can personally attest to that as a direct abutter of the restaurant and the parking lot.

538
00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:14,668
We have witnessed instances of Oasis patrons littering, parking violations, block driveways, trespassing,

539
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:26,066
staggering public urination and exhibition of general disruptive behavior, such as blasting music, honking horns, screaming and drivers blocking roads close to midnight.

540
00:42:26,646 --> 00:42:32,510
This is unacceptable and has already caused considerable consternation and frustration for residents.

541
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:39,272
We therefore urge you to reject the proposal to extend the operating hours of Oasis Restaurant 1 a.m.

542
00:42:40,072 --> 00:42:52,476
We believe that the negative impacts on public safety, noise disruptions, and residents' quality of life outweigh any potential benefits to Oasis owners and patrons by such a move.

543
00:42:53,157 --> 00:43:00,939
We ask that you prioritize the well-being and safety of residents in the South Medford community over the interests of the restaurant owners.

544
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,180
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

545
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:03,964
Thank you.

546
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:05,966
Thank you, sir.

547
00:43:06,006 --> 00:43:07,667
Anyone else who would like to speak in opposition?

548
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:12,351
And if I could just add something about like parking.

549
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:30,276
If I work late and come home around 10 o'clock, I am unable to park in front of my own home, and I will have to circle my own neighborhood waiting for Oasis customers to exit, hoping that one of them is the patron who illegally parked in front of my home.

550
00:43:30,897 --> 00:43:40,242
If you extend this to 1 a.m., now I'm gonna have to go park at a great distance from my own home, and I'll be parking illegally in that instance as well.

551
00:43:41,323 --> 00:43:48,100
And I also have to say that there is a tremendous amount of food waste being dumped into that parking lot.

552
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:51,349
Oftentimes they'll take food from Oasis, eat it.

553
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:54,311
It often doesn't make its way into the barrel.

554
00:43:54,371 --> 00:43:55,311
It's on the street.

555
00:43:55,492 --> 00:44:01,756
I've got a dog that I have to worry about, but it has also dramatically increased the rodent population in South Medford.

556
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:07,280
And oftentimes they're broken beer bottles, broken wine bottles.

557
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,682
Those bottles that aren't broken often contain urine.

558
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:12,263
And as Anne Fred said earlier,

559
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:18,586
and I go through that lot almost on a daily basis, removing these absolutely disgusting items.

560
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:21,867
And most recently, human feces was found.

561
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:25,729
So the problems are only getting worse.

562
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:29,391
So I truly urge you not to approve this.

563
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:35,473
And I just really want you to consider that as residents, we have standing.

564
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:41,196
So I've heard that you have to approve this,

565
00:44:42,068 --> 00:44:43,789
unless there is a compelling reason.

566
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:50,091
Well, there is a compelling reason, and that is every resident in South Medford who stands opposed to this.

567
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,912
So please do not approve this.

568
00:44:52,572 --> 00:44:52,972
Thank you.

569
00:44:53,432 --> 00:44:53,692
Thank you.

570
00:44:53,712 --> 00:44:56,493
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition?

571
00:44:56,513 --> 00:45:00,695
At this time, we're just gonna have people speak once at this time.

572
00:45:05,876 --> 00:45:11,961
They just need to raise their hand if they're on Zoom, so they can turn their camera on and wave, they can raise their hand, I'll see them.

573
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:14,843
Name and address of the record, please.

574
00:45:15,024 --> 00:45:16,905
Lorenzo Puccio, Yale Street.

575
00:45:18,386 --> 00:45:22,810
So I agree with what everyone behind me has said on both sides.

576
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:31,137
I've been there 30 years, and these two gentlemen are two of the nicest gentlemen that there are in our city as business owners.

577
00:45:31,537 --> 00:45:32,378
I know them personally.

578
00:45:34,071 --> 00:45:37,072
The problem that we have is quality of life.

579
00:45:38,312 --> 00:45:39,532
That's what's gonna be disrupted.

580
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:43,053
There's no such thing as giving a permit out until 1 a.m.

581
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:44,693
because that's a lie.

582
00:45:44,793 --> 00:45:47,193
That permit that you're giving out is gonna be till 2 a.m.

583
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:52,234
No one leaves at 1230 and they're out by one.

584
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:53,355
It doesn't happen.

585
00:45:53,395 --> 00:45:55,095
I was in the restaurant business 22 years.

586
00:45:55,635 --> 00:45:56,395
That doesn't happen.

587
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:59,796
Back in 2000 is the last time I was in front of this body.

588
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:16,349
And in 2000, not this particular body, obviously, but the council that was here stopped a Chinese restaurant from opening where Oasis is located now, because the amount of people that they were gonna see was gonna be disruptive to the city and to the neighborhood.

589
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,951
So that council stopped it back in 2000.

590
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,233
Some people behind me will remember that.

591
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:25,575
Some people that haven't lived there that long won't remember that.

592
00:46:26,704 --> 00:46:29,405
My other fear is what's going on with Pacelli right now.

593
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:32,566
They're selling, they're not selling, they're having problems.

594
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:35,547
What happens when someone moves in there and renovates?

595
00:46:36,467 --> 00:46:38,488
What happens while they have that license?

596
00:46:38,988 --> 00:46:40,729
I don't know what their seating capacity is.

597
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:44,870
I don't know what Pacelli seating capacity is, but now we just doubled it.

598
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:55,254
So now that parking lot of 40 cars cannot support both those restaurants at their seating capacity as it is now, people are complaining.

599
00:46:57,409 --> 00:47:02,511
As far as trash and litter, I can't attest to that.

600
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:03,932
Maybe some other people can.

601
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:06,153
I don't have that problem.

602
00:47:07,713 --> 00:47:11,175
In the last month, my driveway has turned into a port-a-party twice.

603
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,435
I got cameras in front of the house.

604
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:15,616
I can't point the finger at them.

605
00:47:16,497 --> 00:47:18,437
But I know Bocelli's doesn't stay open late.

606
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:21,399
So those patrons are coming from somewhere.

607
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,501
I really want this council to consider

608
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:34,324
that what everyone has said tonight is based on, I think Anita said it best, and that's enforcement.

609
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:42,106
We need enforcement from the city, whether it be parking, whether it be the police, and they got their hands full.

610
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:47,707
If enforcement is done properly, then that may help the situation.

611
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:55,088
But I cannot approve, my bedroom is the first bedroom in front of that, is the closest to that exit.

612
00:47:56,465 --> 00:48:01,229
and I cannot approve of people coming out of there up until two in the morning.

613
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:06,454
And with that, I have to go home and watch the Celtics lose.

614
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:07,675
So thank you for your time.

615
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:15,241
We're gonna go to Debbie on Zoom and then Larry, I see you, we'll go to you next.

616
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:18,404
Debbie, I will unmute you.

617
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:18,464
Hi.

618
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,309
I'm Debbie McMillan.

619
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:27,231
I live at 215 Harvard Street.

620
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:34,777
And I believe that the extended hours will have a negative impact on the quality of life.

621
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:43,784
We're currently experiencing and have experienced noise issues late at night due to the traffic.

622
00:48:46,105 --> 00:48:49,148
If the hours are extended, we're talking about

623
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:54,911
you know, one o'clock, two o'clock in the morning, being awakened by the noise.

624
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,872
It's a residential area.

625
00:48:58,112 --> 00:48:59,493
It is South Medford.

626
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:01,353
It is not Medford Square.

627
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:02,974
11 p.m.

628
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:06,415
should be late enough for the restaurant to be open.

629
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:14,197
And if you do approve this, it's setting a precedent for the other restaurants that are in that area.

630
00:49:15,017 --> 00:49:17,418
So I request that you don't approve this

631
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,802
and respect the fact that it is a residential neighborhood, and we should have some quality of life.

632
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:25,622
Thank you.

633
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:28,023
Thank you.

634
00:49:29,023 --> 00:49:31,084
Going to Larry on Zoom.

635
00:49:31,524 --> 00:49:33,064
Name and address for the record, please.

636
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:35,045
Unmute you.

637
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:36,145
There you go.

638
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:38,746
My name is Larry Fretz.

639
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:42,247
I live at 215 Harvard Street in Medford.

640
00:49:43,345 --> 00:49:50,588
First, I want to thank Anne for a great presentation, sort of outlining what we're faced here in this South Mefford.

641
00:49:51,528 --> 00:50:04,154
I also wanted to add that Anne collected close to 60 signatures of folks on Yale Street and 215 for opposition to this proposal.

642
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:12,037
I think the bottom line to the problems we're having around the Yale Street lot and the impact oasis

643
00:50:13,787 --> 00:50:25,154
is having and exacerbating them could be addressed probably and mitigated to a certain degree if the police were able to surveil the area on a more frequent basis.

644
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:30,197
But I understand that the police have limited resources.

645
00:50:31,177 --> 00:50:32,838
God bless Chief Buckley, he's great.

646
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:41,223
And more pressing issues than dealing with drunk, rowdy, and unruly customers who engage in public urination

647
00:50:41,948 --> 00:50:47,250
bowel movements, vomit, drug, and sexual activity in the L street lot.

648
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:57,994
Unfortunately, this lack of enforcement leaves this neighborhood to fend for itself unless some controls are put in place.

649
00:50:59,114 --> 00:51:02,216
And one of those controls is right in front of the city council tonight.

650
00:51:03,216 --> 00:51:07,137
And that should not be, that should be not granting a 1 a.m.

651
00:51:07,237 --> 00:51:08,398
closing to Oasis.

652
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:15,255
By the way, there is a precedent for restriction by a town on a restaurant opening at that hour.

653
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:24,981
Arlington passed a bylaw in 2019, allowing the restaurants or preventing the restaurants from 1 a.m.

654
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:26,582
closings.

655
00:51:27,402 --> 00:51:37,668
So tonight, I respectfully request the city council take a vote that will help homeowners in South Medford maintain their right to a quiet and secure neighborhood.

656
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:43,013
I oppose this application and implore the city to reject it as well.

657
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:43,694
Thank you.

658
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:45,236
Thank you.

659
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:48,780
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition who has not already spoken?

660
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:55,749
Seeing none, this portion of the meeting is closed.

661
00:51:57,555 --> 00:51:58,395
Thank you, Madam President.

662
00:51:58,636 --> 00:52:02,998
Thank you to everybody who has shared their views on this matter.

663
00:52:03,258 --> 00:52:06,119
Obviously, there's a lot of opinions and passion about it.

664
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,340
I have a few thoughts.

665
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:16,924
Number one, the biggest complaints seem to be about enforcement, whether that's traffic enforcement or parking enforcement or code enforcement.

666
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:25,731
we have received communications from parking staff saying that they really are imploring the mayor to increase the parking staff.

667
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:34,855
We've received, I think, recommendations from a couple of building commissioners and DPW directors in a row asking for more code enforcement staff.

668
00:52:36,376 --> 00:52:41,638
And I'm sure that the police chief would say that he needs more support for traffic enforcement as well.

669
00:52:42,659 --> 00:53:00,372
The City Council has zero authority to require enforcement of anything, zero authority to fund enforcement without the request of the mayor to fund those things, and I really strongly encourage, whether it's just related to this proposal or really anything you see in the city, to contact the mayor about those matters.

670
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:05,556
There's a couple things that we can do here.

671
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:08,999
Right now, we have a proposal in front of us for 11 to 1 a.m.

672
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:09,379
every day.

673
00:53:11,058 --> 00:53:22,744
the petitioner could, after hearing this discussion today, maybe come up to the podium and suggest an alternative that might meet their purposes, but not be all 11 p.m.

674
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:23,285
to 1 a.m.

675
00:53:23,345 --> 00:53:23,745
every day.

676
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:27,727
It could be maybe only till midnight, or only certain days of the week.

677
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,229
I'm not gonna define what the petitioner may or may not be willing to propose.

678
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:35,971
They've put something in front of us as written, and that's what we have to consider, unless they were to come up and say otherwise.

679
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:47,511
I think there's a reasonable accommodation that can be reached between all parties to address the issues that everybody's raised.

680
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:51,377
But in general, when we talk about setting a precedent, we already have

681
00:53:52,573 --> 00:53:59,116
significant number of restaurants in this community that have permits to open from 11pm to 1am.

682
00:53:59,976 --> 00:54:06,418
So the precedents already set that that is something that many, many, many restaurants have asked for and have been granted.

683
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,540
And I think for me as a counselor, what I have to consider is

684
00:54:12,072 --> 00:54:23,190
Is there a compelling reason that if many other restaurants have been given that, and they're not just in Medford Square, they're not just in certain places, they're really some are in places that their neighbors would also say are residential areas.

685
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,373
why can't this one be granted as well?

686
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:28,894
So that's what I'm gonna be considering tonight.

687
00:54:29,054 --> 00:54:51,681
Certainly there are conditions that we could place on a permit if we were to approve it, like a 90 day review to get a report on noise complaints and code infractions and anything else that we have so that the questions that people have raised saying, well, this may happen if this permit is granted, we could actually collect that data, review it and consider the effects of this after a certain period of time.

688
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,582
That'd be certainly something I'm willing to entertain.

689
00:54:54,182 --> 00:54:55,062
I'm going to pause there.

690
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:58,864
I think there are a couple things that could happen right now.

691
00:54:59,404 --> 00:55:02,085
We could either put some conditions on it.

692
00:55:02,246 --> 00:55:07,168
We could have the petitioner say that there may be an alternative that's not as expansive as this.

693
00:55:07,188 --> 00:55:11,750
Um, or I'm sure my fellow counselors have some other ideas as well.

694
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,210
So thank you, Madam President.

695
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:15,071
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

696
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:15,851
Thank you, Madam President.

697
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:17,772
First of all, what I'm hearing is, um,

698
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,981
from consensus.

699
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:26,724
I mean, there's a lot of people that say that our friends at Oasis are hardworking people.

700
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:34,410
What I do hear is that there is quality of life issues that deal with someone in the community.

701
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,852
I find it hard to believe that it's all Oasis.

702
00:55:37,659 --> 00:55:41,281
I find it very difficult to believe that we can say this is all Oasis's fault.

703
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:53,349
But I think again, I think that this is the Antonio brings the point that's very important here is the enforcement I had multiple neighbors call me this week about this issue.

704
00:55:55,170 --> 00:56:00,674
And it didn't just start it started with Oasis but then it continued on about the lack of enforcement.

705
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,475
in the streets of South Medford.

706
00:56:05,977 --> 00:56:08,700
And that's what I see that are issues.

707
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,064
But I do think that there are compromises.

708
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:34,702
As I did my study, I looked at the restaurants and the different bars that are open in the area, and there aren't too many that are open that are budding neighborhoods like Razo's or Bocelli's that are open till one o'clock.

709
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:36,563
So that's something we have to wait.

710
00:56:37,923 --> 00:57:00,235
But again, I think where we're talking about many people have come up and said that legally we have to really what my recommendation tonight so we table this until we have a committee the whole meeting then maybe we can what that happens we can ask legal representation to me with the council to give us some direction and what we can and what we can't do.

711
00:57:01,556 --> 00:57:03,037
And I'll give you some examples we.

712
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:08,992
We didn't approve a gas station from BJ's.

713
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:11,715
And we gave the wrong reasons why.

714
00:57:12,455 --> 00:57:16,439
And then what happened was BJ's came back because we didn't have legal representation.

715
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:17,560
They sued us.

716
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:19,221
They won.

717
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:21,463
We had to go back to court.

718
00:57:21,744 --> 00:57:22,785
Now guess who's suing us?

719
00:57:23,465 --> 00:57:23,986
The residents.

720
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:29,230
The residents are suing us because we're stuck in the middle because we don't have legal representation.

721
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,912
We haven't had a city solicitor in a year.

722
00:57:32,257 --> 00:57:37,719
So we're not lawyers, we're elected officials that are trying to do best for our residents.

723
00:57:38,399 --> 00:57:50,804
So I know that we've got a report from our building department that our code enforcement officers are doing the best they can, unfortunately.

724
00:57:51,444 --> 00:57:59,508
the size of the city that we are now and what's going on in the city, only having a few enforcement officers, it's very difficult.

725
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:00,489
We know that.

726
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:04,691
Parking, we know that's a huge issue, huge concern.

727
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:08,853
I have family members that live on Princeton Street that call me all the time.

728
00:58:08,893 --> 00:58:11,894
They think because I'm on the city council, I must own a tow truck.

729
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:14,176
So I understand completely.

730
00:58:15,776 --> 00:58:20,399
But again, this is a parking lot that is

731
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:28,698
open to the community, and there are no limitations other than making sure commercial vehicles aren't parked in there.

732
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:34,662
So I, you know, is there something that the residents can talk with the owners.

733
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:44,366
If we table this and come back and say well, maybe there's something that you're looking at, maybe Friday, Saturday and Sunday till 12 o'clock if there are church groups that are coming in.

734
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:52,290
Maybe there's some kind of compromise that, you know, we'll can all work together to see what we can do what's best both for the business owner, and for the residents.

735
00:58:53,167 --> 00:59:05,391
You know, I've worked directly with a few people that are sitting in this auditorium about Oasis and their lack of cleanliness and they don't put the barrels out and the trash truck comes at this time.

736
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:10,472
And to be honest with you, they've done a great job since we met with them.

737
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:16,274
I haven't heard the same complaints from different people.

738
00:59:17,694 --> 00:59:19,975
It's maybe one or two of the same people that are complaining.

739
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:25,458
and maybe they have a right to, but the truth of the matter is they're doing the best they can.

740
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:30,859
You know, the alternative is imagine if they're not there.

741
00:59:30,879 --> 00:59:34,199
We're seeing empty storefronts everywhere.

742
00:59:34,479 --> 00:59:36,520
So I think that's what we're concerned about as well.

743
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,640
So trying to find that compromise, I think might be the way to go.

744
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,701
But again, I'm not saying we should or we shouldn't because legally we don't know.

745
00:59:46,741 --> 00:59:51,042
So my recommendation truly is going to be to table this until we have a committee of the whole meeting

746
00:59:52,427 --> 01:00:01,692
with city administration, with all the parties involved, our code enforcement team, our representation.

747
01:00:09,436 --> 01:00:16,799
My motion, table this until we have a better understanding legally of where we can go.

748
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:17,620
We all have our thoughts.

749
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:31,662
We all have our thoughts if Oasis was maybe a couple blocks away where it didn't, but a home, homes, they would say no, they're thriving, we don't want Oasis to leave, we need to have them, give them anything they want.

750
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:49,727
Right, but then you have residents that are saying, listen, I mean, we had issues with, first it was, I remember the first phone call I got was the trucks are revving their engine in front of a window, keeping their engines running while they're running in to get something to eat in front of a resident's baby's bedroom window.

751
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:51,388
And we stopped that completely.

752
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:59,532
We ended up moving with the city and Oasis, we ended up bringing in planters, gigantic planters, so they couldn't park up on the curb.

753
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:01,473
So that's just discussion.

754
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:05,756
Maybe it's just a discussion we can have again, and see what we can do.

755
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:08,579
Because I you know, and I'll do respect.

756
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:14,044
You don't have control of your clientele, but you do have control of your people that work for you.

757
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:22,131
And if you guys if we can all sit together and try to find a way that we can fix that, and help the neighbors and be part of the neighborhood community.

758
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:27,415
And if it's something that we're bringing in the traffic enforcement saying, well, we need resident parking only.

759
01:01:28,156 --> 01:01:39,370
the nights that we're going to that we would allow Oasis to have a certain extended hours of operations that we make sure that there those parking spaces are open for residents at 10 o'clock.

760
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:41,633
There's got to be something that we can work with.

761
01:01:41,673 --> 01:01:44,817
But again, I'm only saying this as a way

762
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:48,199
to a final answer that can help everybody here.

763
01:01:48,699 --> 01:01:55,282
So I that's why Madam President, if I can, I'll make the motion that I feel we need to table this and move this.

764
01:01:56,162 --> 01:02:00,884
So we have all the representation at the table, including a legal representation that can guide us.

765
01:02:01,504 --> 01:02:09,067
And I hate to do it, by the way, I voted, I voted against everything that had to do with a representative for from KP law.

766
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,703
that we're paying them hundreds and hundreds of dollars just by picking up the phone.

767
01:02:15,143 --> 01:02:30,933
I hate that we have to ask them, but because we don't have a city attorney in the city for a year, I think with this situation, I think it's warranted because either way, I don't wanna make a decision either favoring or being against without knowing the true ramifications legally.

768
01:02:30,993 --> 01:02:32,554
So I hope you can understand that.

769
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:35,636
So that's why I make the motion that we table to a committee of the whole

770
01:02:36,576 --> 01:02:50,667
that, you know, we can even make it within the next 10 days if we can, that we asked the city to the mayor to have legal representation, be present to answer our questions and hopefully we can make a reasonable decision.

771
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:58,233
And maybe in that time, maybe the respected owners of Oasis who I feel that every time I've talked to them, they've been very, very good.

772
01:02:58,673 --> 01:03:00,656
They've been very, very welcoming and understanding.

773
01:03:01,237 --> 01:03:10,350
And we have people that are definitely committed in our South Memphis community, that maybe there could be some kind of discussion that we can say, hey, let's find, let's find a common ground.

774
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,495
And then let's, let's revisit this when we can a community of the whole.

775
01:03:14,277 --> 01:03:15,098
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

776
01:03:15,118 --> 01:03:17,659
I want to make a few things clear from a process point of view.

777
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:31,709
Just for Oasis, if you had adjustments to the permit, or if you had thoughts on adjustments to the permit you're seeking, and you can present those to us right now, it doesn't have to go to, process-wise, the Council will vote, but it doesn't have to go to Committee of the Whole.

778
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:34,471
Councilor Scarpelli, your motion to table would end all debate.

779
01:03:34,671 --> 01:03:37,073
So I would hold that motion to the end of the meeting.

780
01:03:37,553 --> 01:03:37,873
Thank you.

781
01:03:38,713 --> 01:03:47,496
So we'll go through the counselors who want to speak and then if the petitioner would like to speak again we'll go back to you, unless counselors want to hear from the petitioner first, or, okay.

782
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:48,856
That's curvy out.

783
01:03:49,736 --> 01:03:50,436
Thank you, Madam President.

784
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:52,977
So, that's the neighborhood I grew up in.

785
01:03:53,077 --> 01:03:58,079
I grew up on Princeton Street and when street, so we have a multiple multiple problems here.

786
01:03:58,679 --> 01:03:59,359
And, you know,

787
01:04:00,447 --> 01:04:04,429
The blame pie is pretty big here, and everybody's got to take a slice of the pie.

788
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:11,934
So we've established a $2 million parking department that doesn't tag any cars, which is issue number one.

789
01:04:13,195 --> 01:04:22,520
I would think they'd clean up if they get on there on a Friday, Saturday night tagging cars and towing cars that don't belong there and shouldn't be there.

790
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:23,241
That's issue one.

791
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:26,763
Beale Street, if I'm not mistaken, does have resident parking.

792
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:30,513
So again, that's a parking enforcement issue.

793
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:41,024
I will say our parking department, they work at night, they should be down there tagging cars, they should, and the police should be with them, towing cars that are parked in front of residents houses.

794
01:04:42,005 --> 01:04:43,467
That's, that's the first, that's the thing.

795
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:45,369
I agree with Councilor Scott Pelley.

796
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:48,092
You know, is this all Oasis' problem?

797
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,434
Yes, no, maybe.

798
01:04:51,494 --> 01:04:55,395
There's Bocelli's that operates until 1 o'clock in the morning.

799
01:04:56,756 --> 01:05:02,338
I'm sure their customers park in there like everyone else does.

800
01:05:03,558 --> 01:05:13,342
You have Bocelli's, you have Maze Cafe, they're all there.

801
01:05:13,462 --> 01:05:14,743
And things have changed over the years.

802
01:05:17,332 --> 01:05:22,794
Three, four years ago, you didn't have hundreds of delivery drivers going there, picking up food.

803
01:05:23,694 --> 01:05:26,355
You didn't have Grubhub, Doordash, and all those other things.

804
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:28,595
Now those are the norm now.

805
01:05:29,616 --> 01:05:37,578
Not saying that I'm in favor of that, but our culture has changed over the years.

806
01:05:37,598 --> 01:05:40,879
People say, we want to blame COVID, we can blame whatever we want.

807
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,685
and these other businesses, they keep these restaurants going.

808
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:53,311
When times are tough, that was how they survived with takeout.

809
01:05:54,112 --> 01:06:03,163
But I've worked with Oasis in the past, when we've had problems with the dumpsters and the parking, they've always been cooperative.

810
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:08,047
Maybe we establish hours for parking in the parking lot.

811
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:12,231
Maybe we shut the parking lot down at a certain hour of the night.

812
01:06:12,811 --> 01:06:16,695
And any cars parked in there after one o'clock or something can get towed away.

813
01:06:17,736 --> 01:06:23,161
So yeah, I think there is a compromise that can be reached if we sit down and talk.

814
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:28,666
And as we said, do we have the right to vote now?

815
01:06:29,658 --> 01:06:39,785
When dozens of other restaurants in the city have the same permit that they're looking for, that'd be what we call an arbitrary and capricious decision.

816
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:43,147
Do we get sued like we got sued on other things?

817
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:47,650
So I think there's some legal issues that have to be brought out.

818
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:50,011
And I think the police department has to be called in.

819
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:55,715
When the police department get called for a complaint or a noise complaint, they have to come down and they can't ignore the phone calls.

820
01:06:56,675 --> 01:06:59,136
So again, they take a piece of the pie.

821
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:05,700
There's a lot of pieces of pie that go around there, and everybody has to own up to what has to be done to fix the problem.

822
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:17,827
So like I say, I'm willing to work for a compromiser if that's what the patrons wants, but like I say, there's a lot of people that are gonna have to step up to make this work.

823
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,448
Thank you.

824
01:07:19,548 --> 01:07:20,209
Councilor Collins.

825
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:22,571
Thank you, President Merlin.

826
01:07:22,631 --> 01:07:26,493
Thank you everybody who's been here about the petition or to speak your mind on it.

827
01:07:26,513 --> 01:07:29,756
We appreciate all of your time and all of your perspectives.

828
01:07:32,137 --> 01:07:36,060
To reiterate some of my other fellow counselors synthesis of what we've heard so far.

829
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:41,464
We're hearing about parking enforcement, we're hearing about cleanliness code enforcement.

830
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:45,807
I also heard about the prevalence of large trucks in an area that feels residential.

831
01:07:46,902 --> 01:08:04,368
It makes sense to me that this is controversial because we do have a thriving business center, South Medford Square live right by there, right next to what is a residential area and I think we always get these friction points where residential meets commercial and residential is residential and commercial is commercial and we're trying to make sure that both can thrive.

832
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:09,151
Vice President bears spoke to this at the top.

833
01:08:09,511 --> 01:08:25,063
We so frequently as a council are talking about the many, many, many holes in our code enforcement that we see citywide, whether it is cleanliness or whether it is taking care of tree stumps, or whether it is responding to issues on see click fix.

834
01:08:25,944 --> 01:08:34,390
Certainly we're aware of the same lack of capacity lack of effectiveness in our parking department as that, you know, takes its time to get up to speed, so to speak.

835
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:44,276
I think that probably every resident, certainly everybody behind this rail, has just a laundry list of places where they don't see that consistent service that we need to see.

836
01:08:45,957 --> 01:09:01,467
And, you know, the large trucks issue made me prick up my ears because I know that's an issue that, you know, falls under state jurisdiction as well as city jurisdiction in terms of how do we regulate these huge commercial trucks on our residential streets and how do we make sure that's fair for both users, the commercial drivers that

837
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:09,773
to get around businesses that depend on them, but the residents that are trying to have a human sized existence on their residential areas.

838
01:09:10,453 --> 01:09:20,260
All that being said, I think where we're at is how many of these systemic citywide and sometimes statewide issues are relaying at the feet of Oasis.

839
01:09:22,061 --> 01:09:23,402
that's where I'm coming down.

840
01:09:23,562 --> 01:09:25,543
And I think that we need to be fair here.

841
01:09:25,783 --> 01:09:27,224
We need to be fair to the business owner.

842
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:33,826
We also need to work very, very hard to make sure that residents are protected, their quality of life is protected as much as possible.

843
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,888
I know that Councilor Scarpelli made a motion.

844
01:09:37,808 --> 01:09:43,910
In the spirit of his motion, I'll make one that's slightly different, also for consideration for my fellow councilors.

845
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:45,711
I think that if I suspend it,

846
01:09:50,473 --> 01:09:53,654
Yeah, we can only take Yeah, we can only take what he's holding back on his motion.

847
01:09:54,534 --> 01:09:55,354
We'll take his motion.

848
01:09:55,434 --> 01:09:56,254
First, we'll vote on it.

849
01:09:56,494 --> 01:10:00,835
Certainly doesn't have just just to present a alternative proposal.

850
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:11,317
And certainly Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate what you put forward in the spirit of having a discussion where we can see where we convene residents and enforcement staff from the city as well as the business owners.

851
01:10:11,997 --> 01:10:15,878
An alternative proposal would be to just approve the license.

852
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:29,041
with a date certain for a committee of the whole over the summer after a 90 day review period where we do discuss what's working, how are things going, we convene parking enforcement, we convene code enforcement, we have a better sense of where those pain points are.

853
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:37,322
And again, this is potentially under a 90 day review process, we're able to go forward and issuing another extended license to another thriving business in the city.

854
01:10:37,342 --> 01:10:42,703
And we get the chance to say, let's hear from everybody about how it's going at a date certain.

855
01:10:42,723 --> 01:10:43,684
Thank you.

856
01:10:44,064 --> 01:10:44,304
Thank you.

857
01:10:45,379 --> 01:10:46,960
Thank you, President Morrell.

858
01:10:47,861 --> 01:10:53,284
It was helpful to hear from everyone both supporting and oppose and I got emails in both directions.

859
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:54,645
This week as well.

860
01:10:56,775 --> 01:11:01,197
So it's obviously, I think, a very difficult decision to make.

861
01:11:01,237 --> 01:11:04,138
I think all the other councillors here can agree with that.

862
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:10,840
When I think about it, quality of life is super important.

863
01:11:11,221 --> 01:11:20,464
And it's important to pay attention to residents who are bringing up concerns that they might have with the establishment.

864
01:11:20,524 --> 01:11:21,385
But we also have to

865
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:25,247
in hearing those concerns, we have to hear what they actually are.

866
01:11:25,307 --> 01:11:48,025
And from the concerns that I've noted down that you guys have come up and said, a lot of it, I think, there are ways to regulate the problem, ways to address the issue that isn't so wholesale and isn't really bringing the house down to make a renovation.

867
01:11:50,335 --> 01:11:59,120
We, you know, I think there's there's a need for better signage in that lot and in the neighborhood, as to expectations, reminding.

868
01:12:00,777 --> 01:12:06,020
people who frequent those businesses, as to what, what the rules are in the city.

869
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,401
You can't defecate you can't urinate right in public.

870
01:12:09,981 --> 01:12:26,169
We need better parking enforcement which other counselors have already talked about, and better parking rules I know, Councilor care of yellow I liked that suggestion of looking at that lot in particular and seeing what we can do about that, right because it's the city own lot, we have control over it as a city not the council.

871
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:34,055
I hear the concerns about not being able to park in front of your homes.

872
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:42,943
I think that underscores the need that a lot of South Medford residents have been pushing for, for zoned-based parking in certain parts of South Medford.

873
01:12:44,124 --> 01:12:54,792
And I think a lot of what we talked about today underscores the need for maybe strengthened ordinances, strengthened noise ordinances, strengthened code enforcement as well for those ordinances.

874
01:12:56,986 --> 01:13:12,611
I it's, it's also when I think about this I think about a lot of the work that I do outside of city council work, which right now, a lot of it looks at laws and cases and how you how you make a strong case for against something, and I, it is I

875
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:25,010
may be unfortunate, but it is impossible to prove, given that there are other businesses open in that in that neighborhood at the same time impossible to prove that oasis is the problem.

876
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:29,756
The problem is what you guys are saying, but it's impossible to make that connection.

877
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:42,442
And I don't want, as Councillor care of yellow mentioned I because it's impossible to prove that I don't want to be seen as taking a criticism arbitrary decision on this issue.

878
01:13:43,822 --> 01:13:50,744
It's also we also have to keep in mind that the past, it's possible that because the businesses closes earlier than it needs to.

879
01:13:52,505 --> 01:14:04,313
A lot of folks are congregating outside and doing things outside when if the business was open longer, they would have the ability to do that inside the business, where we have more control over the noise.

880
01:14:05,915 --> 01:14:09,197
We also have to, I understand the point about revenue that was made.

881
01:14:11,018 --> 01:14:21,250
In this specific case, there's an opportunity cost with the revenue that applies here with restaurants and businesses.

882
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:29,039
And it's not just the taxes that come from meals and liquor sold at Oasis, it's also the taxes that we would get

883
01:14:29,459 --> 01:14:32,221
from other businesses in South Medford Square thriving.

884
01:14:33,481 --> 01:14:41,546
And we have to keep that in mind because we keep talking about revenue and the need to find ways to raise revenue, preferably without an override.

885
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:48,730
But look, I made a promise to the voters that I would try to find as many ways to raise revenue before we had to do an override.

886
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:51,031
And this is unfortunately one of those ways.

887
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:57,434
And that speaks to a bigger budget revenue situation that has been long and systemic.

888
01:14:58,595 --> 01:14:59,355
needs addressing.

889
01:15:00,535 --> 01:15:06,457
But unfortunately, because of the tough situation that we're in revenue wise, we have to make some tough decisions as well.

890
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:22,601
And with regards to the budget, I in the last week, we put out a survey about people's desires for Medford and the budget and over 20% of people did actually bring up the need.

891
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:26,764
the thought that businesses in Medford need to thrive.

892
01:15:27,605 --> 01:15:39,676
And and I understand that that often comes in conflict with quality of living and as Councilor Collins mentioned a lot of our businesses are located very close to our residences.

893
01:15:42,699 --> 01:15:49,283
I would support some kind of compromise to make sure that the businesses are surviving and that residents are heard.

894
01:15:49,644 --> 01:16:01,111
And so something like a 90 day review, I think would would be very helpful in that regard, and also calling upon our administration to do more work in that neighborhood to pay attention and to monitor it.

895
01:16:02,352 --> 01:16:05,994
I think that would be, I think that would be the way to address that.

896
01:16:07,782 --> 01:16:12,004
look, a lot of people want businesses to be open later as well.

897
01:16:12,525 --> 01:16:15,667
A lot of people stay up late at night, people have different work schedules.

898
01:16:16,407 --> 01:16:18,728
We have a young and thriving population as well here.

899
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:25,012
Councilor Knight, one moment.

900
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:27,173
And so we need to address those needs.

901
01:16:27,413 --> 01:16:30,655
And look, I go back to the idea of regulate the problems.

902
01:16:33,265 --> 01:16:40,010
Regulate the problems, it would be unfair and unwise to it seemed, I think it would be unfair and unwise to tear down the whole thing.

903
01:16:40,531 --> 01:16:51,259
Thank you guys are saying I apologize clearly this all the team has started so vice and vice president bears and I don't know if that meant you wanted to speak but we'll go to vice president first.

904
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:52,220
Thanks.

905
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,781
I just want to again be super clear.

906
01:16:55,853 --> 01:16:57,955
We can't set the rules for the L Street parking lot.

907
01:16:58,476 --> 01:17:01,899
We can't set the rules for resident parking on Main Street.

908
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,604
We can't, we can't say who in corner houses gets what thing.

909
01:17:07,785 --> 01:17:14,492
You know that's the traffic commission they have the authority to do that so we can talk all well and good about that but it's really not our purview and if you have issues with

910
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:20,236
where you're what the resident parking rules are on your street or in the L street lot is the purview of the Traffic Commission.

911
01:17:20,977 --> 01:17:40,249
Not only do we not appoint members of the Traffic Commission, we don't even confirm the mayor's appointments the members of the Traffic Commission parking, and I just want to reiterate this again we got a communication from the parking director they're bringing in $2 million, but they're actually only we're only spending a million on parking enforcement, and the mayor is using the other million to cover other things in the general fund.

912
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:46,393
while the parking director is requesting more parking enforcement officers and is certainly raising the money to do it.

913
01:17:46,513 --> 01:17:55,520
So if you have a question about parking enforcement, I really would encourage you to email the mayor and say, please use the money we're raising for parking revenue to enforce the parking rules in the city.

914
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,030
just from pure procedural thing.

915
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:04,072
I would like to hear from the petitioner if they're willing to present an alternative, lesser proposal.

916
01:18:04,092 --> 01:18:08,774
I also think to Councillor Scarpelli's point, if we were to move forward on that, it wouldn't be a motion to table.

917
01:18:08,794 --> 01:18:13,755
It'd be a motion to continue the public hearing to a date certain and hold a committee of the whole before that date.

918
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:17,756
And that's just, we just, that's how we have to do it because it's a special permit process.

919
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:22,138
And if we don't follow those rules, nor if we don't act within 90 days, then we

920
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:23,698
can't put any conditions.

921
01:18:23,718 --> 01:18:27,160
We also could continue it to the next regular meeting and just legal counsel there.

922
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,301
Yes, yeah, that's yeah, that's right.

923
01:18:30,421 --> 01:18:32,422
That's what I got some information on that.

924
01:18:33,402 --> 01:18:38,385
Yeah, so I would love to hear from the petitioner if they have maybe Councilor Knight and then we'll go to the petitioner.

925
01:18:39,085 --> 01:18:39,565
Councilor Knight.

926
01:18:41,306 --> 01:18:41,706
You're muted.

927
01:18:45,061 --> 01:18:46,282
Madam President, thank you very much.

928
01:18:46,362 --> 01:18:49,163
I think we've certainly beat this issue to death.

929
01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:54,585
Ultimately, the matter that's before us is whether or not we want to support and extend that Iowa's permit for Oasis, all right?

930
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:56,466
That's the issue that's before this council.

931
01:18:56,506 --> 01:18:57,947
The other issues are enforcement issues.

932
01:18:57,987 --> 01:19:00,007
Those issues fall under the purview of the administration.

933
01:19:00,568 --> 01:19:04,869
So the question that comes before us right now is, do we want to support a thriving business in South Medford?

934
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:09,511
All right, now, when I drive through South Medford, I see several businesses that are successful, and this is one of them.

935
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:10,872
I don't want to see them leave.

936
01:19:11,768 --> 01:19:19,333
Um, I don't think that we can blame oasis for being the source of all the problems and all things wrong in yale street and harvard ave All right, I don't have a street.

937
01:19:19,373 --> 01:19:20,634
I just don't think that that's possible.

938
01:19:21,134 --> 01:19:34,963
All right We have the opening of a green line station that's going in over there the noise and the drama and the uh adverse effects that are going to come from that alone will triple or maybe quadruply outweigh what's going on in oasis uncomfortable support in the petition this evening

939
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:44,346
Ultimately, you know, the council does have the right to put restrictions on it, I wouldn't have a problem putting restrictions on it to Thursday, Friday, Saturday evenings, something like that.

940
01:19:44,386 --> 01:19:47,889
But I don't think we need to go down this road of making a mountain out of a molehill.

941
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:49,211
It's not that serious of an issue.

942
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:57,559
Ultimately, the question is whether or not we want to allow them to stay open for 120 minutes later than they usually do, or whether or not we want to put restrictions on those 120 minutes so that it's 90 or less.

943
01:19:59,731 --> 01:20:00,632
I mean, that's it.

944
01:20:00,772 --> 01:20:02,113
That's all that's before us right now.

945
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:09,040
So, you know, I think we're complicating an issue and we're really kind of turning this into a patronization at this point.

946
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,723
But, you know, ultimately I'm comfortable voting on the paper immediately.

947
01:20:14,225 --> 01:20:14,905
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

948
01:20:15,286 --> 01:20:22,372
If we want to go back to the petitioner, if you want to come back up, if you have any, if you want any adjustments you want to offer or anything, talk through anything.

949
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:30,846
I respect all the residents here tonight.

950
01:20:31,006 --> 01:20:33,067
Just wait one moment, your mic's gonna turn on.

951
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:33,827
They'll turn it on.

952
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:35,427
There you go.

953
01:20:36,447 --> 01:20:38,428
Yeah, I respect all the residents here tonight.

954
01:20:39,108 --> 01:20:41,608
And I think you had a great idea.

955
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,929
We don't need the license to 1 a.m.

956
01:20:44,269 --> 01:20:50,230
So they're getting too nervous that we're gonna be in 2-1 and people are gonna be walking out of there by 2 a.m.

957
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:51,390
We don't need this.

958
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:56,191
If we get like Wednesday night, we advertise like free birthday cake.

959
01:20:57,376 --> 01:20:58,616
spend money to advertise that.

960
01:20:59,177 --> 01:21:03,758
So if I could have like Wednesday night to 11 or midnight, and then Friday and Saturday, that's it.

961
01:21:04,378 --> 01:21:09,219
So the show you're saying Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, that's it should be like, we're happy.

962
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,240
We're all good because we're not going to stay in 21.

963
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:17,722
I think the license has special hours to go from 11 to one I thought was the you had to go like to one but uh,

964
01:21:18,323 --> 01:21:19,063
We don't need two one.

965
01:21:19,203 --> 01:21:20,484
We're not gonna stay in two one.

966
01:21:21,264 --> 01:21:24,105
This wasn't our idea since the beginning.

967
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:24,845
Thank you.

968
01:21:24,865 --> 01:21:29,566
Madam President, motion to adopt the gentleman's suggestion as a restriction on the permit.

969
01:21:29,686 --> 01:21:32,107
We have to, I gave- I appreciate the respect.

970
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:33,548
I gave Councilor Scarpelli the courtesy.

971
01:21:33,568 --> 01:21:35,448
I appreciate the respect Councilor Baez, thank you.

972
01:21:35,468 --> 01:21:38,289
Would you like to keep your motion or would you?

973
01:21:38,469 --> 01:21:43,291
Well, I just want to, I think that one of the biggest pieces, I appreciate the owner.

974
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:46,792
I think that's a great compromise, but I also think that there are,

975
01:21:48,312 --> 01:21:52,014
bigger issues here that that the city needs to address.

976
01:21:52,315 --> 01:22:11,447
So, you know, the traffic, the traffic issues, the, we have our special services department, they're all here and I know they work probably at hours a week, but they've been sitting here for the last three hours and having them understand the process

977
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:18,873
and what their relationship with Oasis, so we know how you've been in the past.

978
01:22:18,913 --> 01:22:21,956
I think they're, you know, this isn't beating a dead horse at all in my eyes.

979
01:22:22,016 --> 01:22:34,807
I think this is trying to get the best case forward for something that, again, I, as one counselor, don't feel comfortable making until we have legal support.

980
01:22:36,903 --> 01:22:57,855
Like, so again, I, you know, I would, I would still like to go to date certain for our next open meeting to extend it there that we can ask a representative legal representative, I think the owners of Oasis and here's the thing on the people that are against it and the people that are for it.

981
01:22:58,655 --> 01:23:01,057
If we don't find a compromise, someone's gonna lose.

982
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:25,150
So I think that we need to maybe find some, some common ground that maybe in two weeks we come back keep this extended for two weeks, and then put it first in the agenda, ask those questions and then vote on it, because I, you know, I, I feel that I can't speak for anybody, but I feel that the majority of the council is in favor of it, but I also think that this is an opportunity for us to meet with the administration,

983
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:35,758
bring in the MPD, bring in the traffic, talk to Inspection Services, ask DPW about the upkeep and what's going on there and about signage for the parking lot.

984
01:23:36,322 --> 01:23:44,188
and permits for maybe the drivers that can park there until 12, and then close it and resident only that could park in there then tow.

985
01:23:44,448 --> 01:23:52,855
So there's other things we can use this meeting for to find the best avenue for the community and self-medical, including Oasis, because this isn't going away.

986
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:55,957
If we give them the permit three days, guess what?

987
01:23:57,078 --> 01:23:59,921
The self-med residents are gonna come back and say, Oasis is doing this again.

988
01:23:59,941 --> 01:24:00,881
And is it?

989
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:01,362
I don't know.

990
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:05,163
But let's try to solve this instead of just pushing it through.

991
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:06,324
Let's wait a week.

992
01:24:06,364 --> 01:24:07,304
Let's bring everybody in.

993
01:24:07,344 --> 01:24:09,905
Let's let's have the parties work together.

994
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:10,485
See what's best.

995
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:11,426
Come back to us.

996
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,026
Let's put something thoughtful on the table.

997
01:24:13,406 --> 01:24:15,167
So we have to talk about it again.

998
01:24:15,947 --> 01:24:21,610
Listen, I'm sure you don't want some of the emails you get from some of the people that email you every single week about issues in South Meffin.

999
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:26,432
We could sit everybody at a table to figure things out right now to get a better understanding.

1000
01:24:27,112 --> 01:24:29,113
So I would welcome that, Madam President.

1001
01:24:29,153 --> 01:24:30,894
If it's voted down, it's voted down.

1002
01:24:31,194 --> 01:24:32,895
But that would be my motion.

1003
01:24:33,476 --> 01:24:33,796
Thank you.

1004
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:34,196
Thank you.

1005
01:24:34,216 --> 01:24:36,637
We have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to table.

1006
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:37,718
Thank you.

1007
01:24:37,778 --> 01:24:38,118
Thank you.

1008
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:38,358
Thank you.

1009
01:24:38,398 --> 01:24:44,562
We have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to table to leave the hearing open, table to a date certain that date being our next regular meeting.

1010
01:24:44,582 --> 01:24:45,342
Our next regular meeting.

1011
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:52,466
Continued to a date certain that being our next regular meeting, which is June 6th.

1012
01:24:52,486 --> 01:24:52,867
Great.

1013
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:57,363
Do I have a second on that motion?

1014
01:24:57,483 --> 01:25:01,285
I'll second that motion.

1015
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:02,845
Seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1016
01:25:03,245 --> 01:25:04,666
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1017
01:25:10,748 --> 01:25:11,648
Vice President Paris.

1018
01:25:12,588 --> 01:25:12,728
No.

1019
01:25:12,748 --> 01:25:15,869
Councilor Carviello.

1020
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:16,029
Yes.

1021
01:25:16,049 --> 01:25:18,750
Councilor Collins.

1022
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,390
No.

1023
01:25:20,691 --> 01:25:22,651
Councilor Layton.

1024
01:25:24,172 --> 01:25:24,432
Yes.

1025
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:31,361
Yes.

1026
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:31,741
No.

1027
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:38,043
Four on the negative, three in the affirmative, three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

1028
01:25:38,784 --> 01:25:41,804
Do I have, I know I had a motion from Councilor, I had a motion from Councilor Collins, but.

1029
01:25:42,525 --> 01:25:53,508
I'll make a motion that we grant his motion, grant the petitioner's request for the 12 o'clock

1030
01:25:54,272 --> 01:25:57,514
with a with a with a 30 day and 60 day review.

1031
01:26:01,876 --> 01:26:15,022
So the motion from Councilor Carvajal to grant the permit request to midnight on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday night for the for the request, and that we also schedule a meeting with the proper departments to

1032
01:26:16,989 --> 01:26:23,012
figure out how to heal all these problems, especially between the police, parking, and inspection departments.

1033
01:26:23,272 --> 01:26:24,612
Point of information, Madam President.

1034
01:26:24,933 --> 01:26:26,533
Are we sure legally we're fine?

1035
01:26:26,993 --> 01:26:29,555
And again, I don't know if legally we're fine with this either.

1036
01:26:29,675 --> 01:26:29,955
Okay.

1037
01:26:31,215 --> 01:26:33,916
That's not warm and fuzzy for me, but thank you.

1038
01:26:34,056 --> 01:26:38,278
I believe the legal issue happens if we look, if we deny the permit, not if we approve it.

1039
01:26:38,858 --> 01:26:39,199
Oh, okay.

1040
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:42,040
Ask the people, ask the people, the neighbors at BJ's.

1041
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,541
Yeah, but the good advice we got there.

1042
01:26:48,925 --> 01:26:51,608
Madam President.

1043
01:26:52,228 --> 01:27:02,418
Madam President, can we make this pending a legal opinion to make sure that we're voting correctly on this?

1044
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:05,321
I don't know if we can, sorry, Mr. Clerk.

1045
01:27:08,526 --> 01:27:13,049
I'm not sure whether you can grant a permanent pending legal review of the permit.

1046
01:27:13,109 --> 01:27:14,811
I don't know the answer to the question.

1047
01:27:14,891 --> 01:27:16,212
I say, well, this is the issue.

1048
01:27:16,252 --> 01:27:17,753
We have no legal counsel here.

1049
01:27:18,153 --> 01:27:20,395
So we're all sitting here spinning our wheels.

1050
01:27:20,595 --> 01:27:21,616
We don't know if we're spinning it right.

1051
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:25,238
I motion to reconsider the last vote.

1052
01:27:25,398 --> 01:27:26,499
Motion from Vice Mayor.

1053
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:31,043
He was on the winning side, even though it was the wrong side.

1054
01:27:31,063 --> 01:27:33,925
I didn't know my mic was off, sorry.

1055
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:37,808
I couldn't understand you, Councilor Knight.

1056
01:27:39,047 --> 01:27:41,228
I didn't know I was unmuted, I'm sorry.

1057
01:27:41,348 --> 01:27:41,608
Okay.

1058
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:43,308
Thank you.

1059
01:27:43,748 --> 01:27:50,210
So a motion from Vice President Behrs to reconsider the previous motion.

1060
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:55,151
Second by... You have a second.

1061
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:55,811
Second.

1062
01:27:57,491 --> 01:28:00,992
Second by Councilor Sang.

1063
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:03,133
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to reconsider.

1064
01:28:09,593 --> 01:28:10,634
We have other compromises, no.

1065
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:32,312
No, four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

1066
01:28:33,353 --> 01:28:36,236
So now we are voting to reconsider.

1067
01:28:36,496 --> 01:28:39,339
Yeah, I mean, I'm just not gonna sit here and debate procedure with everybody.

1068
01:28:39,559 --> 01:28:40,940
We can do it in two weeks, it's fine.

1069
01:28:42,181 --> 01:28:42,762
Second.

1070
01:28:44,303 --> 01:28:50,029
Do I need a re-second if we're reconsidering something that was already seconded?

1071
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:52,932
We'll take one.

1072
01:28:54,758 --> 01:29:06,512
From the original motion from Councilor Scarpelli to leave the public hearing open to a date certain June 6th, our next regular meeting, where we will invite legal counsel to attend.

1073
01:29:09,035 --> 01:29:12,559
Seconded by Councilor Carville.

1074
01:29:12,599 --> 01:29:13,621
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1075
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:29,852
Yes.

1076
01:29:29,892 --> 01:29:30,112
Yes.

1077
01:29:30,252 --> 01:29:30,573
Yes.

1078
01:29:31,754 --> 01:29:31,954
Yes.

1079
01:29:31,994 --> 01:29:32,094
Yes.

1080
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:51,156
Yes, I'm in the affirms during the night of the public hearing is continued to a date certain our next regular meeting where there will be legal counsel present.

1081
01:29:51,736 --> 01:29:53,758
Do you want to speak then or do you have something?

1082
01:29:53,798 --> 01:29:55,159
No, I just would like to say something.

1083
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,802
My name is Anthony D'Antonio 24 Hicks Avenue.

1084
01:29:59,563 --> 01:30:04,027
And I have to say through the chair, I'm a little bit disappointed with councilor Singh and councilor Collins.

1085
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:10,993
They bloated about how wonderful they're going to do this and that and everything for the residents of South Medford.

1086
01:30:11,313 --> 01:30:12,234
And then when the boat came,

1087
01:30:13,017 --> 01:30:15,559
You decided you don't want to do the right thing, okay?

1088
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:17,700
Yack, yack, yack, yack.

1089
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:19,161
It amounted to nothing.

1090
01:30:20,062 --> 01:30:20,482
Thank you.

1091
01:30:20,942 --> 01:30:22,443
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

1092
01:30:22,863 --> 01:30:23,524
Absolutely nuts.

1093
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:29,388
I just want to note that, although I don't really agree with the approach taken, the gentleman is free to say that as the Supreme Court has upheld.

1094
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:32,150
You can come and say what you like about the council.

1095
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:32,630
So thank you.

1096
01:30:33,335 --> 01:30:34,236
the State Supreme Court.

1097
01:30:34,636 --> 01:30:35,196
Counselor Seng.

1098
01:30:35,456 --> 01:30:42,241
I think we've explained why we voted this way and we are in support of the various compromises that have been offered, right?

1099
01:30:42,261 --> 01:30:45,463
This is what happens when we allow debate after the vote gets taken.

1100
01:30:46,283 --> 01:30:48,284
Thank you.

1101
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:50,946
The paper has been disposed of.

1102
01:30:51,726 --> 01:30:52,687
Going on, choose.

1103
01:30:52,707 --> 01:30:54,368
People who have been waiting very patiently.

1104
01:30:54,888 --> 01:30:58,010
We've learned a lot about permits.

1105
01:30:58,190 --> 01:31:02,113
And if you're wondering, it's probably going to be open 11 to 12 Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

1106
01:31:02,472 --> 01:31:04,963
But, if there is.

1107
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:09,244
The paper has been disposed of.

1108
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:10,445
There is no more comment on it.

1109
01:31:10,525 --> 01:31:13,247
There is no more comment on it.

1110
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:17,189
We're taking paper.

1111
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:18,931
We're taking paper.

1112
01:31:20,092 --> 01:31:21,372
I'm working on it, Councilor Knight.

1113
01:31:21,533 --> 01:31:25,355
Thank you for adding to the fray.

1114
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:28,978
22-315, if there is anyone who knows how to be patient, it is all these moms in the front.

1115
01:31:29,018 --> 01:31:29,979
So thank you very much. 23.

1116
01:31:35,722 --> 01:31:41,944
And I should say, our dear robotics team, I am so sorry we both get to you, but also if you want to go home, you totally, yeah, you're going to be next.

1117
01:31:42,204 --> 01:31:44,945
You are absolutely next.

1118
01:31:45,025 --> 01:31:46,806
I also understand if you are tired and want to go home.

1119
01:31:49,266 --> 01:31:49,767
So, okay.

1120
01:31:51,512 --> 01:32:12,763
23 dash 315 which I think we have next and if not that's what we're taking offered by Councilor Carvio counselor saying and Councilor Collins, whereas hundreds of Massachusetts residents die or injured from incidents involving firearms every year, and whereas in Massachusetts an average of 16 children and teens die by guns every year of which 21% are suicide and 78% are homicides and

1121
01:32:15,384 --> 01:32:37,537
Whereas the rate of death by gun homicide in Massachusetts is 18 times higher for black people than it is for white people, a vastly disproportionate threat of harm and whereas 38% of female intimate partner homicide victims in Massachusetts are killed with a gun and whereas Massachusetts police agencies reported more than 2800 firearms as lost or stolen to the National Crime Information Center.

1122
01:32:37,998 --> 01:32:39,739
from 2016 to 2021.

1123
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:45,124
And whereas Massachusetts law establishes legal requirements for firearm storage in homes and vehicles.

1124
01:32:45,624 --> 01:33:05,440
And anytime the firearm is not carried by or under the control of the gun owner or other lawfully authorized user and whereas Massachusetts law contains criminal penalties for people who fail to securely stare store firearms as required by law and whereas gun violence costs Massachusetts 3.5 billion each year of which 85.4 million is paid by taxpayers and

1125
01:33:07,785 --> 01:33:25,121
Whereas beyond the Massachusetts safe storage law, the American Academy of Pediatrics AP states that the best approach to keep children and teens safe is to secure firearms locked and loaded with ammunition separately and whereas 4.6 million children nationwide live in homes with at least one loaded and unlocked firearm and whereas

1126
01:33:25,561 --> 01:33:32,683
The US Secret Service has found that 76% of school shooters under age 18 obtain their guns from the home of a parent or a close relative.

1127
01:33:32,863 --> 01:33:39,405
And whereas over 80% of children 18 or younger who died by firearm suicide use a firearm belonging to a family member.

1128
01:33:39,985 --> 01:33:49,268
And whereas raising awareness about secure firearm storage is one solution to helping reduce the risk of gun violence, particularly among children and teens due to suicides and unintentional shootings.

1129
01:33:49,468 --> 01:33:50,889
And whereas across the country,

1130
01:33:51,389 --> 01:34:09,900
lawmakers, community members and local leaders are working together to implement secure storage programs and whereas safety and well being of our community is a top priority of Medford and whereas we believe that most gun owners want to be responsible gun owners and whereas both gun owners and non gun owners have a role to play in keeping our community safe.

1131
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:25,487
be therefore resolved that the Medford City Council reaffirms its commitment to the safety, health and welfare of all of its residents, including through the promotion of the secure storage and handling of firearms, be it further resolved the Medford City Council request that the mayor implement a secure firearm storage program

1132
01:34:25,937 --> 01:34:34,745
including the distribution of relevant educational brochures or materials about secure gun storage and state law regarding secure storage of firearms in Medford public buildings.

1133
01:34:35,246 --> 01:34:50,900
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the Medford Police Department provide relevant educational materials pertaining to secure firearm storage, Massachusetts law regarding firearm storage and the risk of unsecured firearm storage when licensing new gun owners or renewing existing licenses.

1134
01:34:51,995 --> 01:35:02,123
for the result of the Medford City Council request that the Medford Board of Health work with the mayor's office and Medford Police Department to assist with the dissemination of secure firearm storage materials throughout the community.

1135
01:35:04,525 --> 01:35:11,410
I will go to the- Thank you, Madam President for that dissertation.

1136
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:16,034
And I wanna thank my fellow councilors for helping to draft that ordinance up.

1137
01:35:16,334 --> 01:35:19,116
So this is a group that I've gotten involved with earlier this year.

1138
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:27,660
With the privilege, there's been so many shootings this year.

1139
01:35:29,282 --> 01:35:33,548
It's just remarkable, not just Massachusetts, but throughout the country.

1140
01:35:36,184 --> 01:35:40,750
This is not a, this group is not looking to take your guns away.

1141
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:47,078
So I put this out on my websites that people hit me back with, you don't need this, you don't need the gun.

1142
01:35:47,358 --> 01:35:48,760
This is not an anti-gun group.

1143
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,364
This group promotes gun safety.

1144
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:56,929
protecting your gun, locking your gun, keeping your gun away from your children.

1145
01:35:57,309 --> 01:35:59,470
So understand, this is a huge problem.

1146
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:02,511
You know, people go to other people's houses.

1147
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:05,872
Do they have guns there?

1148
01:36:06,212 --> 01:36:07,033
Parents want to know.

1149
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:12,095
So I applaud this group for all the work they've done since I've started working with them.

1150
01:36:13,015 --> 01:36:23,341
And again, I've worked with the police with them to help put their literature for gun licenses, and I think the chief is trying to give them some free gun locks going forward.

1151
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:33,746
So I'll give my other councilor a chance to speak, but I applaud the work of this group, especially with the inuitable amount of deaths by guns in this country as of today.

1152
01:36:33,766 --> 01:36:35,147
Thank you.

1153
01:36:36,308 --> 01:36:38,089
Councilor Collins, Councilor Seng, whatever you'd like to go next.

1154
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:41,211
Thank you, President real.

1155
01:36:42,292 --> 01:36:54,265
Well first I want to thank the moms demand action community group for your stewardship of this resolution not just with us on the council with the school committee with various players in the mayor's administration the mayor herself.

1156
01:36:56,007 --> 01:37:07,794
really always wonderful to see a community group coalesce around a really important matter of community well being, especially with something an issue that the gravity of which really cannot be overstated.

1157
01:37:07,834 --> 01:37:14,158
So thank you so much for your leadership on this resolution and bringing it forward to many officials and partners throughout the community.

1158
01:37:14,739 --> 01:37:19,362
Thank you to my fellow counselors for working with this on me to bring it forward to the council.

1159
01:37:20,262 --> 01:37:24,083
Um, this is a I know President moral.

1160
01:37:24,123 --> 01:37:27,284
We made her say a mouthful, but this is really a very simple resolution.

1161
01:37:27,304 --> 01:37:37,748
Um, the safe storage program is something that many in the city have already committed to do something they're ready to do something that they're enthusiastic to do.

1162
01:37:37,828 --> 01:37:45,430
It's just a matter of distributing information on how to keep guns that already exist in homes safer in those homes that they're away from kids.

1163
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:47,332
where they can do no harm.

1164
01:37:47,412 --> 01:37:51,756
It's just about getting that information out to the community through communication channels that already exist.

1165
01:37:52,197 --> 01:37:54,299
So it's low cost, it's really effective.

1166
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:08,934
I think when we read statistics like this about something so horrible, something that really defies words such as gun violence, unintentional gun violence, gun violence that occurs in the home, it can be sort of numbing to read those statistics.

1167
01:38:09,754 --> 01:38:22,402
that I think something like this, the measures that the Moms Demand Action Chapter has been working on, the Be Smart Safety Program, it's such a simple and effective way to make sure that more violence is prevented in our communities.

1168
01:38:22,442 --> 01:38:32,468
And so I'm really glad to be a part of this initiative and hope that we can continue to be a part of the implementation to make sure that the word gets out to as many Medford residents as possible.

1169
01:38:32,548 --> 01:38:32,808
Thank you.

1170
01:38:33,996 --> 01:38:34,737
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1171
01:38:34,877 --> 01:38:35,257
Thank you.

1172
01:38:35,477 --> 01:38:36,718
I'll try to keep it brief.

1173
01:38:37,959 --> 01:38:42,542
Moms Demand Action, I think we've lavished a lot of praise and all of it is deserved.

1174
01:38:43,523 --> 01:38:47,785
I grew up as someone who, you know, the school shootings were in the news all the time.

1175
01:38:47,805 --> 01:38:48,986
I still remember Parkland.

1176
01:38:49,407 --> 01:38:50,387
I remember Sandy Hook.

1177
01:38:50,988 --> 01:38:55,351
I remember those days in the classrooms and meeting in the gym after.

1178
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:57,952
We have heard about the news to talk about how

1179
01:38:59,053 --> 01:39:05,179
students might protect ourselves, given the threat of gun violence, even beyond the schools.

1180
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:12,587
I mean, the resolution says it all, but, you know, something that touches young people a lot is mental health and suicide.

1181
01:39:12,667 --> 01:39:18,974
And the fact that most suicides with a gun are successful, but most

1182
01:39:20,435 --> 01:39:24,617
who fail committing suicide don't ever return to that ever again.

1183
01:39:24,637 --> 01:39:28,498
And these are personal issues for young people here in Medford.

1184
01:39:28,598 --> 01:39:39,303
And to have a group like Moms Demand Action that's so committed to raising awareness and building coalitions and coming to elected officials and trying to create something actionable for us, I think it's really touching.

1185
01:39:39,503 --> 01:39:46,446
And I'm very proud to be able to co-sponsor this with you guys, with my fellow counselors, and to have you guys here with us tonight.

1186
01:39:49,079 --> 01:40:10,459
I think I want to reiterate Councillor Collins point that these are simple steps that we can actually take in a municipality like Medford, and even, you know, we keep talking about how revenue limits us from things but this is, you know, it's simple it's actionable, and it's cheap, and something that is worth that time and investment by the city, because it's something so simple and so doable.

1187
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:11,761
So, thank you so much.

1188
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:14,390
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1189
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:15,171
Thank you, Madam President.

1190
01:40:15,211 --> 01:40:17,774
Again, moms demand action.

1191
01:40:18,295 --> 01:40:27,464
I remember a little organization when I was young that started up by their moms was a program called SADD, and it virtually eliminated drunk driving.

1192
01:40:27,845 --> 01:40:32,550
And it's something that, luckily, it's just second nature for our kids.

1193
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:34,972
They just, we don't see that anymore.

1194
01:40:36,515 --> 01:40:37,435
as much as we used to.

1195
01:40:37,535 --> 01:40:50,319
So I think that, you know, being counselor, being counselor saying is one of his teachers, I remember going through those training sessions and bringing kids into the into the lockdown areas and going over this and watching how crazy it is.

1196
01:40:50,339 --> 01:40:51,339
And then here we are today.

1197
01:40:51,819 --> 01:40:52,660
You know, my daughter's 18.

1198
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,980
She's graduating.

1199
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,081
And the whole process is second nature to her now.

1200
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:58,081
And it's sad.

1201
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:00,022
It's sad that they have to live this life this way.

1202
01:41:00,062 --> 01:41:04,003
But I appreciate when moms take take action like you have.

1203
01:41:04,603 --> 01:41:04,703
And

1204
01:41:05,323 --> 01:41:21,111
do just a little piece that makes such a big impact, because studies have shown a lot of gun violence death, especially at the youth level, comes from kids taking their parents' guns and playing with them, and self-inflicted, or taking them to school and hurting others.

1205
01:41:21,171 --> 01:41:30,155
So again, to reiterate what I said, thanks for bringing this forward, but keep the good fight going, and whatever we need, the council's behind you 1,000%, so thank you.

1206
01:41:30,435 --> 01:41:30,735
Thank you.

1207
01:41:30,815 --> 01:41:32,016
Any other councilors wish to speak?

1208
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:39,832
I would just like to add, I wanna thank you all for being here, for staying so long, for making sure we get this on the agenda.

1209
01:41:40,092 --> 01:41:43,114
And I completely applaud all the work you do.

1210
01:41:43,174 --> 01:41:44,394
It's something I always wanna join.

1211
01:41:44,534 --> 01:41:49,596
I try to get there when I can, but I'm usually here, but I really appreciate it.

1212
01:41:49,756 --> 01:41:57,099
And I appreciate the work you're doing because far too many of us, if not all of us, have a story that this touches on.

1213
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:01,141
My aunt died by suicide by way of gun.

1214
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:03,982
And the work you are doing is so,

1215
01:42:04,771 --> 01:42:14,942
incredibly important to hopefully one by one take away those people that have that closeness to this issue because it's far too many and it's probably almost everyone at this point.

1216
01:42:15,322 --> 01:42:19,486
So I really, I really thank you and I commend the work you're doing and keep on going, keep on fighting.

1217
01:42:19,646 --> 01:42:20,167
So thank you.

1218
01:42:21,949 --> 01:42:22,369
Anyone else?

1219
01:42:26,867 --> 01:42:29,028
mostly for the time that you've all been here.

1220
01:42:29,048 --> 01:42:33,230
I wasn't gonna say anything, but I'll just be short and sweet and say that I think this is a great resolution.

1221
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:36,051
My only thing is what more can we do beyond this?

1222
01:42:36,451 --> 01:42:38,132
And I have your back on it a thousand percent.

1223
01:42:38,292 --> 01:42:38,952
So thank you.

1224
01:42:39,532 --> 01:42:39,872
Thank you.

1225
01:42:41,453 --> 01:42:42,333
Would anyone like to speak?

1226
01:42:42,353 --> 01:42:48,516
Name and address for the record, please.

1227
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:51,117
Erin Dowd.

1228
01:42:51,497 --> 01:42:53,338
I'm at 15A Austin Terrace.

1229
01:42:54,739 --> 01:42:58,262
And Council morale, I just want to say I'm so sorry for your loss of your aunt.

1230
01:42:58,642 --> 01:43:00,183
They hear a lot of stories like that.

1231
01:43:00,343 --> 01:43:03,226
And every one in every one of them matters.

1232
01:43:03,366 --> 01:43:06,068
So thank you.

1233
01:43:06,509 --> 01:43:18,379
So I'm Aaron, I am a Medford resident, I'm a parent of a child in Metro public schools, and I'm the lead for the Medford local group for moms demand action for gun sense in America.

1234
01:43:19,369 --> 01:43:30,072
For those who don't know, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America is a grassroots movement of Americans advocating for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence.

1235
01:43:30,592 --> 01:43:38,614
We have nearly 10 million supporters in the United States, a strong chapter in Massachusetts, and an amazing local group here in our community.

1236
01:43:39,154 --> 01:43:45,216
You can see all these lovely faces here, and that's just a little snippet of our group.

1237
01:43:46,577 --> 01:43:48,117
So on behalf of the local group,

1238
01:43:48,876 --> 01:44:01,023
I want to thank the Medford City Council for their consideration of this important resolution, and in particular, Councilor Collins, Councilor Seng, and Councilor Caraviello for their ongoing collaboration support.

1239
01:44:01,663 --> 01:44:18,173
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Mayor Lungo Kern and Chief Buckley, and School Superintendent Dr. Edward Vincent, and Assistant Superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing, who have allowed us to work with them and their departments to spread this life-saving message of secure firearm storage

1240
01:44:18,738 --> 01:44:20,099
through the appropriate channels.

1241
01:44:22,741 --> 01:44:30,046
Every day in the United States, 120 people are killed with guns and more than 200 are shot and wounded.

1242
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:36,431
As of 2020, firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and teens.

1243
01:44:37,192 --> 01:44:38,793
This is a public health crisis.

1244
01:44:39,495 --> 01:44:54,984
We believe that Medford can and should take steps to do everything possible to reduce gun violence so that our city does not have to face the unimaginable pain that comes when community members, particularly children, are taken by gun violence.

1245
01:44:56,625 --> 01:45:07,051
When unauthorized children, teens, or adults gain access to unsecured firearms in homes or vehicles, we see tragedies such as suicides, unintentional shootings,

1246
01:45:07,655 --> 01:45:09,475
school shootings and homicides.

1247
01:45:10,596 --> 01:45:20,138
Secure storage or keeping guns unloaded and locked, ideally with the ammunition locked separately, is an evidence-based intervention to prevent tragedy.

1248
01:45:21,578 --> 01:45:29,920
Raising awareness of the benefits of secure firearm storage in our community by passing the secure storage resolution will save lives.

1249
01:45:34,099 --> 01:45:37,740
the Celtics game, I guess.

1250
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:52,464
Massachusetts has strong secure storage laws in place, and it only benefits our community to make all Medford residents aware of the life-saving effects of secure firearm storage, and to ensure that all gun owners follow Massachusetts secure firearm storage laws.

1251
01:45:53,224 --> 01:46:02,387
Given the unprecedented surge in gun sales in 2020 and 2021, and the increase in applications for firearm licenses in communities

1252
01:46:03,032 --> 01:46:05,515
all over Massachusetts, including in Medford.

1253
01:46:06,115 --> 01:46:21,972
It only makes sense that the city should invest in spreading awareness about the life saving benefits of secure storage in homes and vehicles, just as it does with any other public health issue communities face, such as substance abuse, disease prevention, mental health and fire safety.

1254
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:37,070
Since our Moms Demand Action local group began advocating and working with city leaders about a year ago, Medford has become an important example of how a community can normalize a conversation around firearms and take steps to reduce gun violence.

1255
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:50,880
We were the second community in Massachusetts to pass a secure storage notification resolution through the school committee that ensures that all parents and caregivers are notified annually about Massachusetts secure storage laws and how they save children's lives.

1256
01:46:51,427 --> 01:46:57,290
as well as how to ask about the presence of unsecured firearms in the homes that their children visit.

1257
01:46:58,390 --> 01:47:07,535
We've been invited to spread the secure storage message by tabling at numerous events, including the Medford Police Department's National Night Out, which we will be at again this summer.

1258
01:47:08,025 --> 01:47:21,033
We've already begun laying the groundwork for disseminating information to Medford firearm license holders about secure storage with the Medford Police Department, as Chief Buckley has agreed that our community can only benefit from receiving this information.

1259
01:47:21,893 --> 01:47:28,057
And we are honoring Gun Violence Prevention Awareness Day and Wear Orange weekend on Friday, June 2nd at 10 a.m.

1260
01:47:28,077 --> 01:47:31,659
at City Hall with a ceremony, including a mayoral proclamation.

1261
01:47:31,719 --> 01:47:33,200
I hope we see you all there.

1262
01:47:35,127 --> 01:47:41,973
Passing this resolution would continue to make Medford a leader in Massachusetts with proactive community-based responses to gun violence.

1263
01:47:42,153 --> 01:47:50,099
On behalf of the Medford Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America members, I urge you to vote in favor of this resolution.

1264
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,240
Thank you.

1265
01:47:57,753 --> 01:48:02,820
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, it looks like Councilor Knight is no longer on the call, so we will close vote.

1266
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:06,566
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice-President Behrs.

1267
01:48:06,626 --> 01:48:07,367
All those in favor?

1268
01:48:07,587 --> 01:48:07,747
Aye.

1269
01:48:08,028 --> 01:48:08,709
All those opposed?

1270
01:48:08,749 --> 01:48:09,570
The motion passes.

1271
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:10,151
Thank you all.

1272
01:48:10,912 --> 01:48:11,192
Thank you.

1273
01:48:17,483 --> 01:48:18,244
to our robotics team.

1274
01:48:18,264 --> 01:48:21,426
This is meant to be a reward, not a punishment, so I apologize.

1275
01:48:21,646 --> 01:48:25,408
I'm sure we're taking away valuable practice time.

1276
01:48:25,428 --> 01:48:27,750
23-318 offered under suspension by Councilor Carviello.

1277
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:34,074
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Medford High School Bowtech Robotics Team, which won the New England Regionals.

1278
01:48:34,134 --> 01:48:37,557
The Bowtech Robotics Team now moves on to the World Championships in Colorado.

1279
01:48:37,897 --> 01:48:44,261
The Bowtech Robotics Team beat Phillips Exeter, where over 50% of the students go on to attend Harvard University upon graduation.

1280
01:48:44,281 --> 01:48:45,542
I did not know that, Councilor Carviello.

1281
01:48:45,802 --> 01:48:46,463
Thank you, Madam President.

1282
01:48:54,073 --> 01:48:59,980
I apologize that you had to sit here this long, and I hope you learned something about government tonight, and not just about robotics.

1283
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:05,407
You have the little robots coming around here, they're going to vote pretty soon.

1284
01:49:06,308 --> 01:49:08,610
First of all, I want to, you know, everyone's, you know,

1285
01:49:09,231 --> 01:49:15,256
You know, this is a bright spot at our technical school, Israel Ballerstein.

1286
01:49:15,336 --> 01:49:20,300
It's a program that's grown in leaps and bounds and it gets better every year.

1287
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,183
So I know you guys got to get home and do homework.

1288
01:49:23,203 --> 01:49:29,548
I want to give you a chance to come up and speak, anything you want to say, but I just want to congratulate you for the great work you've done.

1289
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,541
onward to the championship.

1290
01:49:35,542 --> 01:49:37,402
Thank you.

1291
01:49:38,103 --> 01:49:41,084
If we can, can each of the members that are here, can you come to the podium?

1292
01:49:41,804 --> 01:49:46,727
If you can, I know that we don't want to, if you, I think everybody should know who they are.

1293
01:49:47,287 --> 01:49:51,469
And if you just give your name and the year that you are currently in right now.

1294
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:55,190
I'm Noah Gibson.

1295
01:49:55,390 --> 01:49:56,051
I'm a junior.

1296
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:56,831
Excellent.

1297
01:49:59,312 --> 01:50:00,253
I'm Aaron Van Daniel.

1298
01:50:00,333 --> 01:50:00,953
I'm a sophomore.

1299
01:50:02,634 --> 01:50:04,095
I'm Scott Campbell, a sophomore.

1300
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:08,999
I'm Matthew Harrison, I'm a junior.

1301
01:50:09,059 --> 01:50:15,384
Congratulations, and again, that's great.

1302
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:19,127
The reason why I asked you to do this is twofold.

1303
01:50:19,167 --> 01:50:23,831
When we have our athletes, after they win a championship, we ask them to come up and we recognize them.

1304
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:29,815
When we have our leaders in the theater, our arts, we ask them to come up and identify them.

1305
01:50:29,835 --> 01:50:30,936
So I think it's important that

1306
01:50:31,837 --> 01:50:39,368
You started now a legacy and now it's a tradition that's going to carry on because I hear we're all into classman so we're all coming back next year.

1307
01:50:39,728 --> 01:50:44,976
So we have a dynasty at the vocational school so I will share something with you.

1308
01:50:46,097 --> 01:50:48,080
And I will start it off by the.

1309
01:50:48,961 --> 01:50:53,343
the trip to, I believe it's Colorado, we're in need of some funding, correct?

1310
01:50:53,844 --> 01:51:07,470
I think, so I'm not going to say how much, but I'm going to start, I'm going to ask the community if we could find a way to help, just reach out to the high school or or the clerk to see if we can reach out to anybody who'd like to donate to help with their cause.

1311
01:51:07,771 --> 01:51:10,312
I'm going to donate, I'll be the first one to donate.

1312
01:51:10,332 --> 01:51:13,093
I'll talk to Mr. Campbell, one of the parents, to help out.

1313
01:51:13,173 --> 01:51:15,995
I know that, you know, to get the ball rolling, but

1314
01:51:17,235 --> 01:51:24,461
you deserve to be in Colorado to represent the city of Medford and our schools and such an honor for you to do that.

1315
01:51:24,481 --> 01:51:25,381
So congratulations.

1316
01:51:26,622 --> 01:51:31,846
Thank you.

1317
01:51:32,567 --> 01:51:40,652
So Councillor Seng went to Harvard and I went to UMass and I like to see you, I think you beating Phillips Exeter is like UMass beating Harvard.

1318
01:51:41,433 --> 01:51:44,956
So now in the spirit of unity,

1319
01:51:46,334 --> 01:51:48,475
We all went to Medford High School, and we're really proud of you.

1320
01:51:48,795 --> 01:51:50,356
So I think that goes for both of us.

1321
01:51:50,436 --> 01:51:57,680
But just if you're considering programs when you're going to school, UMass has a great engineering program.

1322
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:00,162
And maybe it's no Harvard, but it's pretty good.

1323
01:52:00,262 --> 01:52:01,102
So thanks, you guys.

1324
01:52:01,422 --> 01:52:05,745
To be fair, Harvard only started its engineering program a few years ago, so.

1325
01:52:06,165 --> 01:52:07,226
See?

1326
01:52:07,266 --> 01:52:07,906
They'll catch up.

1327
01:52:08,006 --> 01:52:09,067
I mean, not to throw a third.

1328
01:52:09,107 --> 01:52:12,248
I work at MIT, so if anyone wants to.

1329
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:12,989
There's a winner here.

1330
01:52:15,122 --> 01:52:18,552
I don't do anything like that, but I can say hi when you're there.

1331
01:52:18,572 --> 01:52:21,299
Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

1332
01:52:23,855 --> 01:52:26,396
I wanted to thank you guys for being here so late.

1333
01:52:26,717 --> 01:52:30,818
Um, wasn't in our plans but I appreciate your tenacity.

1334
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:37,581
Um, you guys are really putting Medford on the map and we're really proud of you guys so know that you have the support of our community.

1335
01:52:37,921 --> 01:52:45,784
Um, anyone watching tonight please donate with the fundraiser that counselors are probably mentioned, and yeah, we'll get you guys to Colorado.

1336
01:52:55,086 --> 01:52:59,730
just congratulations once more and we're all so incredibly proud and fortunate to have you in Medford.

1337
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:05,716
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

1338
01:53:06,116 --> 01:53:07,137
All those opposed?

1339
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:07,838
Motion passes.

1340
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:11,101
Now for our fourth most patient group of the night.

1341
01:53:12,262 --> 01:53:17,467
Or you're all equally patient, but actually you might be the most, sorry, you're the most patient group of the night because you've been waiting the longest.

1342
01:53:17,527 --> 01:53:18,768
So three, one, seven.

1343
01:53:29,736 --> 01:53:35,800
23-317, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, food truck permitting.

1344
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:44,867
Dear President Morrell and members of the city council, on behalf of the below entity, I respectfully submit to the Medford City Council the following requests for a food truck permit in the city of Medford.

1345
01:53:44,907 --> 01:53:49,630
In addition to city council approval, vendors are required to adhere to health department food safety requirements.

1346
01:53:50,933 --> 01:53:53,334
The Federation of Italian American Organizations.

1347
01:53:53,414 --> 01:53:56,335
Dates and times, June 4th, 2023, 11 to six.

1348
01:53:56,695 --> 01:53:58,096
Location, Condon Chell.

1349
01:53:58,116 --> 01:54:00,656
And then Italian Feast of the Republic.

1350
01:54:00,796 --> 01:54:04,778
About the event, Cool Cow Ice Cream would be a vendor at the Republic Italian Festival.

1351
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:12,341
Danny Puccio from the Federation of Italian American Organizations and John Michelli from Cool Cow Ice Cream will be in attendance to answer any questions.

1352
01:54:12,381 --> 01:54:14,001
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1353
01:54:14,361 --> 01:54:16,102
Sincerely, Brian Longo Kern, Mayor.

1354
01:54:17,038 --> 01:54:18,299
Do you wanna have folks come up?

1355
01:54:18,659 --> 01:54:20,720
I did, I know Mr. Puccio is here.

1356
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,582
I know that, let him speak, but I think this is an amazing event, so.

1357
01:54:27,923 --> 01:54:30,024
Hi, Danny Puccio, Fellsway West.

1358
01:54:30,844 --> 01:54:31,445
Please.

1359
01:54:31,845 --> 01:54:36,047
So John Michelli from Cool Cow could not come tonight.

1360
01:54:36,147 --> 01:54:37,728
It was his daughter's dance recital.

1361
01:54:38,508 --> 01:54:40,789
So I will be representing him.

1362
01:54:41,409 --> 01:54:42,450
His truck is...

1363
01:54:44,011 --> 01:54:45,472
It's a regular ice cream truck.

1364
01:54:45,553 --> 01:54:47,434
It's all pre-packaged ice cream.

1365
01:54:47,474 --> 01:54:50,537
There's no soft serve or anything of that nature.

1366
01:54:50,557 --> 01:54:55,101
And that's pretty much it on Kool Kyle.

1367
01:54:56,220 --> 01:55:02,224
As far as the event, I'm sure you've all received an invitation and it would be great if you could attend.

1368
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:15,692
It's an event that historically has been done in the city of Boston, and they had reached out to me for assistance in this event and I kindly asked them if they could move it to the city of Medford.

1369
01:55:16,458 --> 01:55:20,119
I think it would be a great thing for the city, for the community, bring people together.

1370
01:55:20,139 --> 01:55:25,381
We're gonna have a performance by the Medford High School National Championship Color Guard.

1371
01:55:25,441 --> 01:55:26,801
They're gonna be doing their performance.

1372
01:55:27,962 --> 01:55:32,803
And we're also gonna have the children of the Italian programs in the public schools.

1373
01:55:33,343 --> 01:55:37,165
They're gonna be doing the national anthems of Italy and the United States.

1374
01:55:38,005 --> 01:55:41,326
There's gonna be entertainment, food for everyone.

1375
01:55:42,466 --> 01:55:43,567
So it's gonna be a great day.

1376
01:55:45,936 --> 01:55:45,996
you.

1377
01:55:46,016 --> 01:55:46,656
Thank you very much.

1378
01:55:46,716 --> 01:55:47,356
Councilor if I can.

1379
01:55:47,657 --> 01:55:48,517
First of all, Miss Butcher.

1380
01:55:48,537 --> 01:55:49,217
Thank you so much.

1381
01:55:49,277 --> 01:55:58,000
I think that, um, there's still a little undertone of disgruntled Italian Americans in the city method for reasons I won't bring forward.

1382
01:55:58,060 --> 01:56:06,943
But these are the events that bring everybody back and put everybody in the right frame of mind, and we really appreciate you taking the forefront and

1383
01:56:14,606 --> 01:56:19,112
It's wonderful, you know, with this wonderful event.

1384
01:56:19,132 --> 01:56:27,103
So I move approval with the food truck and ask my colleagues to support as well.

1385
01:56:27,143 --> 01:56:27,503
Thank you.

1386
01:56:29,527 --> 01:56:36,910
I just wanted to say I'm really excited for the event and I live in pretty close there and I've been telling my neighbors about it and everyone's really excited.

1387
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:39,490
Thank you so much.

1388
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:42,491
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1389
01:56:42,532 --> 01:56:43,172
All those in favor?

1390
01:56:43,192 --> 01:56:43,512
Aye.

1391
01:56:43,852 --> 01:56:44,572
All those opposed?

1392
01:56:44,632 --> 01:56:45,392
Motion passes.

1393
01:56:45,433 --> 01:56:49,114
Madam President, while we're under suspension, motion to take 23- Thank you so much.

1394
01:56:49,134 --> 01:56:50,554
Motion to take 23-311 and 23-312 and public participation.

1395
01:56:56,038 --> 01:56:59,140
I just at this point, we might as well get everybody else out.

1396
01:56:59,160 --> 01:56:59,660
They're all here.

1397
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:01,962
Someone should sleep.

1398
01:57:01,982 --> 01:57:03,062
All right.

1399
01:57:03,082 --> 01:57:03,102
23-311

1400
01:57:10,564 --> 01:57:20,913
Petition for a common butler's license by Kenilbert Hill, 40 Penniman Circle, Stoughton, Mass, 02702, for LaBaguette Bakery at 428 Salem Street, Medford, Mass, 02155.

1401
01:57:23,375 --> 01:57:27,298
I will go to Pastor Scarpelli, the chair of our licensing subcommittee.

1402
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:33,823
Do we have the petitioner on the line for LaBaguette Bakery or in person?

1403
01:57:33,923 --> 01:57:35,745
Oh, sure, please come up to the podium.

1404
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,904
Hi, just name and address for the record.

1405
01:57:43,924 --> 01:57:45,805
And if you want to tell us a little bit about the business.

1406
01:57:47,026 --> 01:57:47,826
My name is canal.

1407
01:57:48,126 --> 01:57:50,067
Oh, the sauce lab I get bakery.

1408
01:57:50,987 --> 01:57:57,671
We do fresh baguette bread, chocolate croissant, what kind of pastry patties.

1409
01:57:59,732 --> 01:58:00,392
That's all we do.

1410
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:01,473
Great.

1411
01:58:01,653 --> 01:58:02,153
Thank you.

1412
01:58:02,413 --> 01:58:03,574
I do see everything.

1413
01:58:03,674 --> 01:58:03,734
Yes.

1414
01:58:10,315 --> 01:58:12,756
How many employees do you have?

1415
01:58:13,636 --> 01:58:14,977
Three.

1416
01:58:15,097 --> 01:58:16,057
How many is it?

1417
01:58:16,177 --> 01:58:18,598
Five million, I would say.

1418
01:58:18,638 --> 01:58:18,818
Okay.

1419
01:58:18,878 --> 01:58:20,759
And hours of operation?

1420
01:58:20,839 --> 01:58:21,759
Seven to eight.

1421
01:58:21,779 --> 01:58:23,360
I'm sorry, seven to seven.

1422
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:25,161
Okay, so everything falls in line.

1423
01:58:25,321 --> 01:58:27,062
I think that this is great.

1424
01:58:27,082 --> 01:58:31,743
We're bringing new cultures, new businesses to our community, especially Salmon Street.

1425
01:58:32,464 --> 01:58:35,605
I've heard some people are very excited.

1426
01:58:42,074 --> 01:58:43,656
Thank you, any questions from the council?

1427
01:58:45,377 --> 01:58:49,922
Seeing none, we have a motion to approve from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1428
01:58:50,542 --> 01:58:51,283
All those in favor?

1429
01:58:52,284 --> 01:58:53,045
All those opposed?

1430
01:58:53,285 --> 01:58:54,486
Motion passes.

1431
01:58:54,546 --> 01:58:55,187
Congratulations.

1432
01:58:56,368 --> 01:59:00,152
All right, now we're going to 23-312.

1433
01:59:04,703 --> 01:59:27,720
petition for zoning map change to a mixed use zone 99 Revere Beach Parkway Medford map seven block five last 21 and 22 members of the city council, none or none or McClellan and fish LLP represent CPC land acquisition company LLC applicant and the petitioners as here and after define pursuant to MGL 40 a section five the applicant and petitioners

1434
01:59:28,898 --> 01:59:41,581
request that the City Council rezone the real property located at 99 Revere Beach Parkway, known as the property as shown on the attached map with meets and bounds description from the current industrial eye zone to a mixed use museum.

1435
01:59:41,601 --> 01:59:54,285
So, the property consists of two parcels map seven block five last 21 and 22 which are currently owned by LAZ books, your lots LLC and I heart media and entertainment, Inc petitioners both of which consent to the petition.

1436
01:59:54,905 --> 02:00:02,312
The property consists of 4.51 acres and is bounded by the Malden River to the east and by a rear beach parkway to the north to the south and west.

1437
02:00:02,332 --> 02:00:07,056
The property abuts the Wellington Station parking lot, followed by Wellington Station immediately to the west.

1438
02:00:07,717 --> 02:00:12,401
We have enclosed a context plan showing the location of the property relative to the surrounding area.

1439
02:00:12,441 --> 02:00:19,928
The property is currently within the industrial zoning district, though the property immediately to the west of Wellington Station station landing is zoned MUZ.

1440
02:00:20,617 --> 02:00:25,199
If rezoned to the MUZ district, the applicant proposes to redevelop the property for multifamily housing.

1441
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:37,003
The applicant's proposed redevelopment of the site, which includes the construction of the community path along the Malden River, thus creating public access, I apologize, thus creating public access where none exist today.

1442
02:00:37,523 --> 02:00:44,765
Although at the conceptual stage, other public amenities contemplated for the site include a bike service station with bike wash, a community room, and a covered pavilion.

1443
02:00:45,005 --> 02:00:49,247
Once rezoned to the MUZ, the applicant's proposed redevelopment will still be subject to the site plan

1444
02:00:49,727 --> 02:00:50,948
by the Community Development Board.

1445
02:00:51,288 --> 02:00:57,892
We look forward to discussing the applicant's vision for the site further with you and are happy to provide any additional information you require.

1446
02:00:57,932 --> 02:00:59,413
Very truly yours, Valerie Moore.

1447
02:00:59,653 --> 02:01:11,960
As the council knows, there's a procedural approach guided by state law for when we receive petitions for zoning changes, but I know we do have the petitioner on the line who would like to give a brief presentation before we... Okay.

1448
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:16,323
A brief presentation to this proposed zoning change.

1449
02:01:16,403 --> 02:01:17,824
So I see we have

1450
02:01:18,393 --> 02:01:18,913
attorney more.

1451
02:01:18,993 --> 02:01:22,134
And I don't know if there's anyone else who would like to Oh, we have people in person.

1452
02:01:22,154 --> 02:01:22,395
Great.

1453
02:01:22,415 --> 02:01:23,175
Sorry, I'm looking down.

1454
02:01:24,155 --> 02:01:26,056
So we'll start in person if that makes sense.

1455
02:01:26,096 --> 02:01:26,616
Okay, sure.

1456
02:01:26,636 --> 02:01:32,398
I just want to make sure Madam Chair and members of the council Jack Englert criterion development partners.

1457
02:01:32,879 --> 02:01:40,021
I wanted to make sure that the PowerPoint is able to be shared with the screen that's happening from a zoom position.

1458
02:01:40,041 --> 02:01:40,722
Okay.

1459
02:01:40,962 --> 02:01:43,002
Is Valerie set up as a co host?

1460
02:01:43,082 --> 02:01:44,383
Are you sharing that Valerie?

1461
02:01:45,596 --> 02:01:47,638
I think Liam McDonough might be the share.

1462
02:01:47,898 --> 02:01:49,320
I'm assigning work to people.

1463
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:51,902
Okay, so yeah just to see how much on it.

1464
02:01:51,922 --> 02:01:57,166
Yep.

1465
02:01:57,506 --> 02:02:00,849
Okay, if we could share the first slide that'd be helpful.

1466
02:02:00,889 --> 02:02:11,698
I'm here tonight to ask the council to consider a rezoning of the property as described earlier it sits as an orphan piece really on the corner of Revere Beach Parkway.

1467
02:02:12,538 --> 02:02:13,459
and the Malden River.

1468
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:21,983
It right now consists of what was I Heart Radio or the old KISS 108 building and also a parking lot kind of mixed together.

1469
02:02:22,183 --> 02:02:25,025
It's surrounded by property owned by the MBTA.

1470
02:02:25,945 --> 02:02:28,967
They have certain plans for it, I'm sure, but we're not getting into that.

1471
02:02:29,007 --> 02:02:35,010
We're just focused on the site itself, which is in the northeast corner of what you're seeing on the screen.

1472
02:02:36,612 --> 02:02:53,924
A lot of improvements that could happen there will happen because the path that has been trying to connect River's Edge all the way around the point hasn't been able to happen partially because of the MBTA and having it cross the MBTA property, but also because of what exists here on the site that's in question.

1473
02:02:54,564 --> 02:03:05,670
given the nature of what's happening to the west of the site over at the corner at station landing, we thought it appropriate to bring MUZ Zone over to this parcel.

1474
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:11,233
We're working on the plans and we can go through some of the ideas that we have, but it's preliminary at this point.

1475
02:03:11,793 --> 02:03:20,618
The point is that we're starting to meet with the community and speak with members of the Mr. River Watershed Association, some of the bike

1476
02:03:22,019 --> 02:03:28,081
that are happening and the creation of this project would allow for the pedestrian connection as well as a bike connection.

1477
02:03:28,101 --> 02:03:32,763
And various things that we would like to talk with the community about further.

1478
02:03:33,623 --> 02:03:39,566
So if we want to go to the next slide just quickly, the parcel is a 4.5 acre piece.

1479
02:03:39,586 --> 02:03:41,327
Half of some of it is in the water.

1480
02:03:41,367 --> 02:03:42,487
Some of his wetlands.

1481
02:03:43,007 --> 02:03:44,328
Our proposal is to take

1482
02:03:45,608 --> 02:03:54,560
the property and build something outside of the wetland areas, not increase the amount of impervious in the second buffer zone and not have any impervious in the first buffer zone.

1483
02:03:55,161 --> 02:04:02,812
The next slide is an idea of the scale of the footprint of the building parking underneath.

1484
02:04:03,822 --> 02:04:04,482
and the potential.

1485
02:04:04,522 --> 02:04:08,063
This is just one option that would exist under the MUZ zone.

1486
02:04:08,223 --> 02:04:15,226
The beauty of the MUZ zone is to provide some flexibility for different various things within the site.

1487
02:04:15,266 --> 02:04:17,586
We are a residential housing developer.

1488
02:04:17,626 --> 02:04:20,707
That's the primary purpose of our request.

1489
02:04:20,767 --> 02:04:28,410
However, there's also opportunity to have community space, bike space, covered shelter space along the path as well.

1490
02:04:30,475 --> 02:04:35,900
We have a couple of slides that are just quickly to show the nature and scale of what this could be.

1491
02:04:36,201 --> 02:04:39,564
Kind of standing on the front corner there, you can see it's a residential housing.

1492
02:04:40,245 --> 02:04:44,509
Project eight stories over one story of podium, light gauge steel.

1493
02:04:44,969 --> 02:04:45,930
Next slide.

1494
02:04:46,591 --> 02:04:48,793
We have a slide from the river that we tried to include it.

1495
02:04:49,718 --> 02:04:56,501
I guess you can't see the sailboat anymore, but there was an opportunity to see the sailboat as the site sits along the river.

1496
02:04:56,961 --> 02:04:59,062
Again, these are preliminary massing studies.

1497
02:04:59,362 --> 02:05:01,043
This process is a long process.

1498
02:05:01,683 --> 02:05:04,624
First step would be to understand the zoning, whether it could happen.

1499
02:05:05,104 --> 02:05:08,826
Next step would start the site plan approval work.

1500
02:05:10,226 --> 02:05:12,407
That's really all I have tonight.

1501
02:05:12,467 --> 02:05:14,048
We can go back to maybe the slide.

1502
02:05:15,062 --> 02:05:22,148
That's a quick sketch on the slide that shows the actual point or the whole area.

1503
02:05:23,969 --> 02:05:25,110
Back two more, right there.

1504
02:05:26,071 --> 02:05:26,432
Thank you.

1505
02:05:26,812 --> 02:05:27,132
Thank you.

1506
02:05:27,412 --> 02:05:28,033
Vice President Harris.

1507
02:05:28,253 --> 02:05:29,034
Thank you, Madam President.

1508
02:05:29,054 --> 02:05:30,415
Thank you for presenting this.

1509
02:05:31,095 --> 02:05:32,617
Just two quick questions.

1510
02:05:32,857 --> 02:05:32,937
One,

1511
02:05:36,386 --> 02:05:51,459
the city has the Wellington Air Rights RFI, I think that's out right now, which is even before an RFP, nevermind an actual plan, but it seems like you're designing this so at least in theory it could be integrated with the larger project proposal for the area?

1512
02:05:51,739 --> 02:05:56,623
Absolutely, we're self-contained and not interfering with anything that could happen over the air rights piece.

1513
02:05:56,884 --> 02:05:59,466
And I'm second, I'm sure your lawyers are

1514
02:06:01,202 --> 02:06:12,812
great, but I just wanted to note that given the transit oriented nature of this development, that the parking minimums would be significantly reduced and you could kind of maximize either commercial space in the podium or additional residential space.

1515
02:06:12,832 --> 02:06:14,894
And I think that would be a great benefit to the community.

1516
02:06:15,555 --> 02:06:16,696
And we'd be interested in that.

1517
02:06:16,796 --> 02:06:17,697
Absolutely.

1518
02:06:18,417 --> 02:06:23,342
And then finally, just are you proposing any affordable units above the inclusionary minimum?

1519
02:06:23,782 --> 02:06:26,144
We're proposing right now 15% affordable.

1520
02:06:26,324 --> 02:06:27,245
Okay, that's our minimum.

1521
02:06:27,265 --> 02:06:27,786
All right.

1522
02:06:27,846 --> 02:06:28,106
Thank you.

1523
02:06:28,637 --> 02:06:28,937
Thank you.

1524
02:06:29,998 --> 02:06:31,059
Councilor Carvillo.

1525
02:06:31,099 --> 02:06:32,140
Thank you, Madam President.

1526
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:33,982
Thank you for the proposal this evening.

1527
02:06:34,022 --> 02:06:35,904
You know, it's a piece of property that's

1528
02:06:37,017 --> 02:06:37,878
underused right now.

1529
02:06:39,219 --> 02:06:40,601
It's out of the way.

1530
02:06:40,621 --> 02:06:48,829
So no matter what you put it, whether it's housing or commercial developments, it really doesn't really affect anybody.

1531
02:06:48,849 --> 02:06:49,850
You're right on the train line.

1532
02:06:51,112 --> 02:06:55,276
I personally would prefer some housing, maybe, if that's what you want to do.

1533
02:06:55,616 --> 02:06:58,980
Because as you know, our housing stock is on the lower end.

1534
02:07:00,281 --> 02:07:09,175
But I would welcome a commercial project there also that would possibly tie in with something that could be going on over there.

1535
02:07:09,415 --> 02:07:10,317
Would you be able to

1536
02:07:12,787 --> 02:07:16,649
tie in under the bridge with the walking path that goes across the river there.

1537
02:07:16,669 --> 02:07:18,530
I don't know if there's an access point there.

1538
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:21,931
It's an easy walk to the actual train station, and from there you could get on.

1539
02:07:21,951 --> 02:07:28,333
No, well, you know, across the street, where Modena is, they have a walking path there.

1540
02:07:28,714 --> 02:07:31,375
I don't know, is there an access point there?

1541
02:07:31,495 --> 02:07:38,077
There is, and the intent would be to continue that path across the property, across the MBTA property, and link it with the, what is it?

1542
02:07:38,097 --> 02:07:39,478
Yeah, I remember going there.

1543
02:07:39,818 --> 02:07:47,323
Yeah, with, you know, with the path to go across river so I certainly welcome this project, whether it be commercial housing.

1544
02:07:47,823 --> 02:07:48,063
Thank you.

1545
02:07:48,083 --> 02:07:48,383
Thank you.

1546
02:07:55,043 --> 02:08:16,866
development is progressing method, but I'm just a little leery that this type of zone changing for individual parcels is what really affects our community in a negative way in the sense that, unfortunately, we don't have a true understanding of what a whole picture looks like.

1547
02:08:17,467 --> 02:08:22,048
You know, when you look at neighboring communities and they said, we'll use, we'll use assembly row.

1548
02:08:22,688 --> 02:08:25,069
That was a whole vision that wrapped around.

1549
02:08:26,889 --> 02:08:34,671
What I don't feel comfortable doing is approving his zoning change right now for one building right now, and not knowing what the rest of the picture looks like.

1550
02:08:35,991 --> 02:08:41,372
I was fortunate enough to start with Mayor Curtatone and working with him and seeing what he did when

1551
02:08:41,892 --> 02:08:51,676
Oh geez, Ikea had the number one spot back in the day in assembly row, then all of a sudden the vision started changing and started conforming and they had to find a way to move Ikea.

1552
02:08:52,177 --> 02:09:08,504
My whole, my reservation with this is really making these spot changes in zoning to accommodate certain groups without truly understanding, and I know we have a long process to go, but that's probably one of the most dangerous

1553
02:09:09,688 --> 02:09:19,112
intersections in the country, and the residents in the Wellington area that people seem to forget about, where you're gonna be bringing in, how many units is that right now?

1554
02:09:19,672 --> 02:09:21,153
It's somewhere between 350.

1555
02:09:21,633 --> 02:09:21,153
350.

1556
02:09:22,073 --> 02:09:22,653
Yeah.

1557
02:09:23,194 --> 02:09:31,037
Now imagine adding that much without understanding the true impact with the whole community there.

1558
02:09:31,357 --> 02:09:31,537
Yeah.

1559
02:09:31,577 --> 02:09:33,478
So I think that's where my reservation comes in.

1560
02:09:33,538 --> 02:09:35,279
So believe me, I love the idea.

1561
02:09:36,559 --> 02:09:43,846
If I see if there was a comprehensive plan to see what it all would look like together, and that's what I'm sure in your profession, you see that.

1562
02:09:44,407 --> 02:09:55,117
And that's why you're here right now because we have such an outdated zoning format that you have to come up and ask for this ridiculous format so I just have to be honest with you.

1563
02:09:55,497 --> 02:09:57,279
I love the idea it looks beautiful.

1564
02:09:57,779 --> 02:09:58,560
I just right now I.

1565
02:10:00,022 --> 02:10:09,021
Um, again, that the understanding of what the true impact means the rest of the growth there and what impact it brings to, um,

1566
02:10:11,353 --> 02:10:29,209
you know, the negative issues it brings to that Middlesex area, the Wilmington area, I couldn't support it unless, you know, we had our Office of Community Development and people sharing, I don't know if Alicia's on the line, just even understanding what the vision is.

1567
02:10:29,749 --> 02:10:36,115
I mean, again, that's, we call these, you know, what was the big thing back in the day is gateway communities, gateway entrances, right?

1568
02:10:36,535 --> 02:10:38,997
That's a gateway that's coming in from Everett Rivera.

1569
02:10:39,578 --> 02:10:41,219
That's a very important piece right there.

1570
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:49,566
So, can I respond to short please think, because I agree with you, I think it is difficult to envision what would happen over a large piece.

1571
02:10:50,167 --> 02:10:57,093
I think the corner where national developments deal is is spots on somewhat right that was an museum sitting by itself.

1572
02:10:57,693 --> 02:10:59,655
And I think it proved to be fairly successful.

1573
02:11:00,136 --> 02:11:02,760
We're just taking the leap to try and stretch that across.

1574
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:05,344
Now the MBTA is the intermediate parcel.

1575
02:11:05,885 --> 02:11:13,437
And we need their, I don't know that you need their consent, but they certainly would weigh in on whether or not MUC works for them, I think to make the air rights.

1576
02:11:14,327 --> 02:11:19,590
work, which is part of what the city is trying to do, the MUZ would be the zone.

1577
02:11:19,710 --> 02:11:22,672
So it does make a lot of sense to pull it all the way across.

1578
02:11:22,732 --> 02:11:23,432
I agree with you.

1579
02:11:23,833 --> 02:11:25,794
I wish I could control the MBTA piece.

1580
02:11:25,834 --> 02:11:27,074
I wish you could.

1581
02:11:27,174 --> 02:11:28,015
But I can't.

1582
02:11:28,595 --> 02:11:28,795
Yeah.

1583
02:11:29,296 --> 02:11:40,082
But I am thinking that, you know, having one bookending the MUZ of the MBTA piece would be an impetus and perhaps a catalyst for making that MBTA.

1584
02:11:40,222 --> 02:11:40,942
Good point.

1585
02:11:40,962 --> 02:11:41,303
Thank you.

1586
02:11:42,203 --> 02:11:42,803
And then, thank you.

1587
02:11:44,577 --> 02:11:47,941
remind folks that the motion would be to report to the CD board.

1588
02:11:48,622 --> 02:11:51,886
We do have Director Hunt on the line, so I don't know if you want to go to her after the councilor speaks.

1589
02:11:52,006 --> 02:11:53,568
So go ahead Councilor Sang.

1590
02:11:55,523 --> 02:12:00,144
I would want to hear from Director Hunt, but I, in general, I think we are in a housing crisis.

1591
02:12:00,524 --> 02:12:02,765
The best way to combat that crisis is to build.

1592
02:12:03,345 --> 02:12:10,306
We have a crisis, revenue crisis, where we need new growth, new development, and we, as a council, always talk about the need for new growth.

1593
02:12:11,086 --> 02:12:15,667
I've lived in that neighborhood for most of my life, and I still spend a lot of time there.

1594
02:12:16,428 --> 02:12:18,768
And something that we always want is more things to do.

1595
02:12:19,228 --> 02:12:23,309
And to have that there, to have more of a community, more neighbors around, I think would be a

1596
02:12:23,909 --> 02:12:39,832
and I think the biggest point in favor of this is the fact that it's next to the station, and that kind of transit oriented development, I think, will help us meet our housing and climate goals, but also create a better standard of living for people in the area.

1597
02:12:41,392 --> 02:12:41,712
Thank you.

1598
02:12:42,612 --> 02:12:50,674
We can go to Director Hunt if you want to perhaps help us paint a holistic picture of this proposal.

1599
02:12:50,694 --> 02:12:51,434
That's great.

1600
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:54,652
Good evening, Madam President.

1601
02:12:54,932 --> 02:12:56,914
Can you confirm that you can hear me all right?

1602
02:12:56,974 --> 02:12:58,316
I'm having trouble with my headset.

1603
02:12:59,056 --> 02:13:00,758
Can we stop the screen share?

1604
02:13:00,998 --> 02:13:02,560
Yeah, can we stop the screen share?

1605
02:13:05,383 --> 02:13:07,886
Great, and then, yeah, you're a little muffled, but we can hear you.

1606
02:13:07,906 --> 02:13:10,208
All right, perhaps this is better.

1607
02:13:10,589 --> 02:13:13,612
Sorry, I've had trouble with my earbuds this evening.

1608
02:13:15,233 --> 02:13:15,594
Thank you.

1609
02:13:16,777 --> 02:13:29,068
So to speak to this in the big vision, so we are actually, we put out to bid an RFP to do a visioning, economic development study of this entire area, region, the Wellington Circle.

1610
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:35,634
We actually didn't get any consultants interested in doing that study.

1611
02:13:35,714 --> 02:13:41,740
And so we are reaching out to them and re-scoping to see what was not acceptable about that.

1612
02:13:42,427 --> 02:13:50,989
But this area is an area that we do foresee should be housing, should be mixed use as we saw with the RFI.

1613
02:13:53,869 --> 02:14:08,492
The reason we've actually encouraged them to come forward with this zoning change at this time is because when a developer wants to build something like this and the developer is coming forward and saying, and we want to give boat access and help with the

1614
02:14:08,952 --> 02:14:15,995
the shared use path and we want to put in amenities for the community, we really want to work with them when they're ready to build.

1615
02:14:16,575 --> 02:14:27,279
And we said to them, you know, if you want to wait about a year or so, we think this area is likely to actually be rezoned in a way that would allow what you want to do, if not completely as of right.

1616
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:38,484
And what we're looking at is to do some amount of residential density in this area as of right with if you then give us additional energy efficiency, additional

1617
02:14:39,243 --> 02:14:42,847
affordable housing, then you'd be able to do additional density as well.

1618
02:14:43,187 --> 02:14:44,669
And that's where we think we're going.

1619
02:14:44,789 --> 02:14:47,271
We're working on this with our MBTA consultant.

1620
02:14:47,772 --> 02:14:52,456
And we said, if you want to wait like about a year, you probably wouldn't need to bring this forward.

1621
02:14:52,536 --> 02:14:56,000
And they said, we would like to really get moving on this project now.

1622
02:14:56,850 --> 02:15:01,917
And therefore, we said, well, the process to get this going ahead of us is to bring this forward.

1623
02:15:02,738 --> 02:15:11,209
We are actually considering whether it would make sense for the city to propose that the MBTA parcel also be rezoned mud.

1624
02:15:13,382 --> 02:15:18,584
To be clear, the MBTA is not held to any zoning that we put on the parcel.

1625
02:15:18,984 --> 02:15:24,267
So it would actually not impact their rights, but it could make the property more valuable.

1626
02:15:24,367 --> 02:15:32,611
They might say, well, you know what, maybe we want to pull back from here because it's worth more to us as developed land than it is as parking lot.

1627
02:15:33,671 --> 02:15:35,892
It would assist with our air rights project.

1628
02:15:36,557 --> 02:15:38,618
Um, so that is something that we could consider.

1629
02:15:38,678 --> 02:15:49,182
We were, um, thinking of discussing with the planning board, whether we could actually have that full section be the MUD and not this Island by itself and the other Island on either side of MBTA.

1630
02:15:49,763 --> 02:15:52,084
Um, but the bottom line is we think this is a great idea.

1631
02:15:52,104 --> 02:15:54,685
We think this is the direction that this area is going in.

1632
02:15:55,325 --> 02:15:59,547
Um, and we wanted to be responsive to the developer's timeline.

1633
02:15:59,827 --> 02:16:04,789
What we don't want to have happen is we say, wait a year until the zoning is done.

1634
02:16:05,367 --> 02:16:07,969
And then they say in a year, oh, you know what?

1635
02:16:08,009 --> 02:16:09,591
We've moved on to other parcels.

1636
02:16:10,291 --> 02:16:14,395
So that's what we were trying to avoid by encouraging them actually to come forward with this now.

1637
02:16:14,715 --> 02:16:16,997
And hopefully I've answered all of your questions.

1638
02:16:17,518 --> 02:16:19,499
Definitely let me know if there's anything else.

1639
02:16:21,701 --> 02:16:21,841
Ms.

1640
02:16:21,881 --> 02:16:23,083
Hunt, thank you so much.

1641
02:16:23,123 --> 02:16:25,425
We appreciate all your hard work and we know you're super busy,

1642
02:16:26,767 --> 02:16:36,170
moving forward, I would love a conversation to share that vision with us so we can all celebrate in what we're trying to do.

1643
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:44,633
I think this is what the biggest concern we're having with the administration is understanding that obviously the zoning isn't going as quickly as we want it.

1644
02:16:46,233 --> 02:16:48,534
I appreciate the representative to your words.

1645
02:16:48,594 --> 02:16:54,935
I think it meant a lot to me, understanding more what you're saying as our leader in the office of community development.

1646
02:16:55,455 --> 02:17:01,497
I think that maybe if you could moving forward is, you know, share those ideas with us.

1647
02:17:01,997 --> 02:17:06,358
I think it would go a long way to at least moving my decisions forward.

1648
02:17:06,738 --> 02:17:09,619
And because that's the issue is we do need housing.

1649
02:17:09,659 --> 02:17:12,399
The issue is we do need the development.

1650
02:17:12,419 --> 02:17:13,640
We need the new money in Medford.

1651
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:15,060
That's something we've always been,

1652
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:16,060
crying out.

1653
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:34,329
But at the same time, I think understanding what the vision is, and understanding that we could be great partners in this, at least all of us, not just individual counselors, but all of us to make sure that we're all celebrating in this and moving something like this forward, I think will be helpful in the future.

1654
02:17:34,349 --> 02:17:34,850
So thank you.

1655
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:40,393
So I would move, Madam President, that we move this to the next step.

1656
02:17:40,493 --> 02:17:42,934
I motion to refer to community development.

1657
02:17:42,994 --> 02:17:43,534
I second.

1658
02:17:43,574 --> 02:17:44,195
Thank you.

1659
02:17:44,235 --> 02:17:45,115
Director Hunt, I see your hand up.

1660
02:17:45,135 --> 02:17:47,296
Did you have anything to add or is it still up?

1661
02:17:48,037 --> 02:17:48,937
One more thing.

1662
02:17:49,237 --> 02:17:49,817
There you go.

1663
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:52,579
Thank you.

1664
02:17:52,739 --> 02:17:58,502
And respectfully, that's actually why I'm here this evening, is to share the office's thoughts on this.

1665
02:17:58,642 --> 02:18:00,263
It would have been premature to come

1666
02:18:00,842 --> 02:18:03,344
in advance of them presenting their thing.

1667
02:18:03,724 --> 02:18:10,289
However, I met today with our MBTA community consultants around our zoning that we need to do.

1668
02:18:10,309 --> 02:18:27,702
It is my expectation that I'm gonna ask for a committee as a whole, and I hate to do this, but in the summer, to talk about where we think we're going with that so that we would be prepared to vote in September or October on the MBTAs and communities.

1669
02:18:27,842 --> 02:18:29,343
And we've looked at the Green Line area

1670
02:18:29,844 --> 02:18:41,468
And we've looked at the Wellington area and based on what the studies that we've had done with this consultant, it looks like this is the area that we need to look at for the comply with the state MBTA community law.

1671
02:18:41,869 --> 02:18:43,569
So thank you, but we'll be back.

1672
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:50,492
If I can, for one counselor, I'd rather you be a little premature and reach out to us for the fact that

1673
02:18:51,538 --> 02:18:56,180
I've worked with other communities and seen what they're doing, and there's a partnership there.

1674
02:18:56,560 --> 02:19:05,663
I'm sure this was something that the city was working with, must be months now, because this doesn't pop up overnight, and you got it last night.

1675
02:19:05,723 --> 02:19:13,226
So my hope is only that you share these visions with us so we can help move things forward.

1676
02:19:13,706 --> 02:19:15,246
I don't think it's negative in any way.

1677
02:19:15,266 --> 02:19:16,187
I don't try to be.

1678
02:19:16,227 --> 02:19:16,987
I'm not trying to be.

1679
02:19:17,347 --> 02:19:19,508
But if you can, just

1680
02:19:20,736 --> 02:19:21,756
you know, be a little premature.

1681
02:19:21,776 --> 02:19:30,399
I'd rather you be a little premature because it would help us moving this forward a lot quicker and understanding it, at least a big picture and a better vision to it.

1682
02:19:30,419 --> 02:19:32,460
So thank you.

1683
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:34,220
I'll work with you on that.

1684
02:19:35,021 --> 02:19:39,402
Summer meetings to make sure we can get it at a time when most, if not all counselors can attend.

1685
02:19:39,422 --> 02:19:45,484
So we have a motion from Vice President Behrs to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1686
02:19:45,524 --> 02:19:46,565
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1687
02:19:51,553 --> 02:19:51,853
Yes.

1688
02:19:55,174 --> 02:19:56,775
Yes.

1689
02:19:56,815 --> 02:19:57,175
Yes.

1690
02:20:00,396 --> 02:20:01,837
Yes.

1691
02:20:01,877 --> 02:20:02,837
Yes.

1692
02:20:02,957 --> 02:20:03,157
Yes.

1693
02:20:03,398 --> 02:20:06,219
Six in the infernos here in the negative one absolute motion passes.

1694
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:06,759
Thank you.

1695
02:20:06,819 --> 02:20:07,579
Thank you very much.

1696
02:20:08,359 --> 02:20:09,800
We're gonna go to public participation.

1697
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:12,841
So we're taking public participation out of order.

1698
02:20:12,881 --> 02:20:20,124
If you would like to speak for public participation, please come up to the podium, name and address record any topic that is under council purview.

1699
02:20:25,957 --> 02:20:31,462
Hi, my name is Amy Tanaglia, and I'm from the building department City Hall.

1700
02:20:31,482 --> 02:20:34,225
I want to thank you all for letting me be here.

1701
02:20:34,245 --> 02:20:37,668
And I'm actually here to tell you the truth.

1702
02:20:39,217 --> 02:20:45,982
I'm here on behalf of the clerks within the city of Medford who haven't had a raise in over four years.

1703
02:20:46,643 --> 02:20:50,266
I was here a few months ago and the situation has not changed at all.

1704
02:20:51,107 --> 02:20:56,231
Several union groups are currently in negotiations, but none as long as we have been.

1705
02:20:56,251 --> 02:21:05,238
We have invited you particularly to come to our negotiations and with everybody's busy schedules, you haven't been able to attend.

1706
02:21:05,823 --> 02:21:14,231
We understand that, but we would like to extend the invitation again for you to come and see what happens during our negotiations.

1707
02:21:14,251 --> 02:21:22,259
I'm going to go and skip to the pandemic that it happened to a couple of years ago.

1708
02:21:24,368 --> 02:21:34,035
While the management was home and while department heads were able to stay home, it was the clerks that had to come to work every day to keep the city running.

1709
02:21:34,976 --> 02:21:41,460
While I respect the teachers and everything they do, and on a daily basis, they worked remotely for a year.

1710
02:21:42,201 --> 02:21:46,384
They received a COVID bonus for three years consecutively.

1711
02:21:46,404 --> 02:21:52,909
We are being offered half of what they received and only a one-time payment.

1712
02:21:54,308 --> 02:22:04,958
Inflation has increased significantly over the last four years between rent, health insurance, medicine, food, utilities, gas, just the cost of living period.

1713
02:22:05,993 --> 02:22:12,855
We are the lowest paid women within the city, and we just cannot get the help that we deserve.

1714
02:22:13,555 --> 02:22:15,256
We deserve to be respected.

1715
02:22:15,976 --> 02:22:17,397
We deserve to be heard.

1716
02:22:17,417 --> 02:22:26,820
And mostly we deserve to be shown that our contributions to this city are as important as management and the administration.

1717
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:40,505
It has been proven time and again that women are not treated with the same respect as our male counterparts equality is non existent within the city of Medford.

1718
02:22:41,383 --> 02:22:46,747
Fair and equal compensation does not exist for the female clerks here.

1719
02:22:47,647 --> 02:22:50,369
We are the voices in the face of the city.

1720
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:53,491
We are front and center every day.

1721
02:22:54,272 --> 02:22:56,774
We are the backbone of this city.

1722
02:22:57,674 --> 02:23:08,142
During contract negotiations, a few issues that had been agreed upon were actually dismissed when we had our last negotiation.

1723
02:23:09,787 --> 02:23:17,836
What what they are offering us is what everybody did receive back in the day, which is 2%.

1724
02:23:17,876 --> 02:23:22,341
And the last time we got a raise was June 30 2019.

1725
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:33,262
The last time the city clerks received an increase in the longevity was in 2017.

1726
02:23:33,842 --> 02:23:40,044
We are now requesting an increase every year from 2019 to 2021.

1727
02:23:40,784 --> 02:23:50,627
When the contract expires and the city's counterproposal was on a one time increase for 2023 and any employee hired after 7123 will no longer be eligible

1728
02:23:55,168 --> 02:23:56,970
to collect longevity payments.

1729
02:23:58,311 --> 02:24:06,178
Please keep in mind that these increases that we had negotiated negotiating have been given to other city employees.

1730
02:24:06,659 --> 02:24:09,461
We haven't received the increase in our sick incentive.

1731
02:24:09,882 --> 02:24:10,122
Since 2016.

1732
02:24:10,262 --> 02:24:16,768
We agreed again on increases that the administration offered us.

1733
02:24:17,388 --> 02:24:20,892
And during this last negotiation meeting, it was all taken away.

1734
02:24:22,312 --> 02:24:25,213
We asked for five positions to be upgraded.

1735
02:24:25,653 --> 02:24:29,113
These five positions are the clerks who make the least money.

1736
02:24:30,393 --> 02:24:49,257
They counted with classifying one full-time senior clerk to be upgraded to principal clerk, and one part-time senior clerk to be part-time principal clerk, leaving behind three women who work as hard as everyone else.

1737
02:24:52,592 --> 02:24:58,075
I am requesting today that all of you make an effort to come to our meetings.

1738
02:24:58,895 --> 02:25:02,657
In the meantime, you have all stated that you are behind us 100%.

1739
02:25:04,418 --> 02:25:13,763
Please show us your support by not passing the 2024 budget until we have been compensated equally and fairly.

1740
02:25:14,863 --> 02:25:15,284
Thank you.

1741
02:25:15,684 --> 02:25:15,964
Thank you.

1742
02:25:22,387 --> 02:25:23,170
This is embarrassing.

1743
02:25:23,852 --> 02:25:24,595
Thank you Madam President.

1744
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:27,063
Yeah when I heard that

1745
02:25:28,297 --> 02:25:34,500
that's just added shame to a shameful situation.

1746
02:25:34,520 --> 02:25:38,763
I did try to come to a negotiation a few weeks ago.

1747
02:25:38,783 --> 02:25:39,863
I was denied entry.

1748
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:44,346
Um by the mediator and told I could come back in the future.

1749
02:25:44,366 --> 02:25:45,987
I spoke with Mr South.

1750
02:25:46,727 --> 02:25:47,528
So I'll try again.

1751
02:25:47,868 --> 02:25:48,988
But I wanted to be there.

1752
02:25:49,229 --> 02:25:49,949
I wanted to be there.

1753
02:25:49,969 --> 02:25:52,550
I wanted to see it and I wasn't allowed to, um.

1754
02:25:53,451 --> 02:25:54,131
And that was very

1755
02:25:57,710 --> 02:26:04,118
Yeah, I don't know what else to say about that one, but Steve invited me and I showed up and the mediator said, no, you can't come in.

1756
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:14,765
I don't know if everybody really gets the point that for me to be here at this time, you have no idea what this is shaking for me to be here.

1757
02:26:15,245 --> 02:26:16,366
I work a second job.

1758
02:26:16,426 --> 02:26:18,147
I have to be there at five in the morning.

1759
02:26:19,087 --> 02:26:20,628
This is our livelihoods.

1760
02:26:21,509 --> 02:26:24,671
This is what's going to get us into the future.

1761
02:26:24,691 --> 02:26:28,033
I mean, I have people coming to me every day, almost crying.

1762
02:26:28,373 --> 02:26:30,434
They can't afford to live in Medford anymore.

1763
02:26:30,894 --> 02:26:32,155
They can't afford their bills.

1764
02:26:32,235 --> 02:26:34,377
It's the same thing over and over.

1765
02:26:35,097 --> 02:26:38,339
And yet we are left behind time and again.

1766
02:26:38,759 --> 02:26:40,160
It's been over four years.

1767
02:26:40,741 --> 02:26:42,282
When is enough enough?

1768
02:26:42,922 --> 02:26:45,944
When can somebody anybody step in and help us?

1769
02:26:47,745 --> 02:26:52,568
You know, I know everybody's tired, you want to go home, but please try to understand where I'm coming from.

1770
02:26:53,168 --> 02:26:54,909
I'm not doing this just for my benefit.

1771
02:26:54,989 --> 02:26:57,071
I have other women that I'm fighting for.

1772
02:26:58,167 --> 02:27:05,589
They come in every day, they give you the best that they can, and we just get turned away time and again.

1773
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:10,291
What do we have to do, become men in order to get what we need?

1774
02:27:10,311 --> 02:27:12,952
I mean, they've proven it time and again.

1775
02:27:12,972 --> 02:27:15,253
I mean, let's just say what we see out there.

1776
02:27:15,853 --> 02:27:18,814
I mean, people can get angry that I'm saying that, but it's the truth.

1777
02:27:20,674 --> 02:27:22,055
You know, I'm a woman.

1778
02:27:23,142 --> 02:27:24,123
I'm in my 50s.

1779
02:27:24,703 --> 02:27:25,623
I'm not going anywhere.

1780
02:27:25,643 --> 02:27:29,025
I've been here 22 years, but I need to survive.

1781
02:27:29,926 --> 02:27:31,166
And that's all I'm asking for.

1782
02:27:31,306 --> 02:27:34,388
I do not begrudge anybody else that gets a raise.

1783
02:27:34,488 --> 02:27:37,450
Good luck, more power to you, everybody needs to live.

1784
02:27:38,270 --> 02:27:41,712
But please, we are the lowest paid.

1785
02:27:43,713 --> 02:27:45,954
And it's just a slap in the face.

1786
02:27:45,974 --> 02:27:49,736
I came here every day during the COVID.

1787
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:51,177
Every day.

1788
02:27:52,251 --> 02:27:53,272
Where was my management?

1789
02:27:53,732 --> 02:27:54,012
Home.

1790
02:27:55,173 --> 02:27:56,374
Where was the administration?

1791
02:27:56,674 --> 02:27:57,014
Home.

1792
02:27:57,675 --> 02:27:58,335
And where was I?

1793
02:27:58,636 --> 02:27:59,857
I had to be here.

1794
02:27:59,897 --> 02:28:00,777
There was no choice.

1795
02:28:01,458 --> 02:28:02,879
There was no working from home.

1796
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:06,061
When is enough enough?

1797
02:28:06,682 --> 02:28:10,825
When do my, everything I've done for this city, I am so proud of this city.

1798
02:28:11,125 --> 02:28:12,206
I wanted to work here.

1799
02:28:12,486 --> 02:28:13,507
I am working here.

1800
02:28:14,487 --> 02:28:20,452
And you guys just, they just keep, I don't know, disappointing me, disrespecting me.

1801
02:28:21,515 --> 02:28:22,355
We need help.

1802
02:28:23,196 --> 02:28:24,296
We need help now.

1803
02:28:25,636 --> 02:28:26,997
Not another year from now.

1804
02:28:27,357 --> 02:28:29,357
And this is exactly what's gonna happen.

1805
02:28:30,438 --> 02:28:31,558
It's going to go on.

1806
02:28:31,898 --> 02:28:37,480
By the time this gets fixed, we are again, two years out of our next one.

1807
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:40,141
I mean, this is ridiculous.

1808
02:28:40,761 --> 02:28:42,421
How is this allowed to go on?

1809
02:28:44,762 --> 02:28:45,062
How?

1810
02:28:47,563 --> 02:28:51,084
Can you look me, anybody look me in the eye and tell me that this is right?

1811
02:28:54,957 --> 02:28:55,217
Right.

1812
02:28:55,937 --> 02:28:57,918
I have family to feed.

1813
02:28:57,938 --> 02:28:59,860
I have bills to pay.

1814
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:02,541
And honestly, I can't do it.

1815
02:29:03,782 --> 02:29:06,684
I cannot do it on the salary I'm making here.

1816
02:29:09,766 --> 02:29:10,807
So what can we do about it?

1817
02:29:12,021 --> 02:29:14,302
You know, Councilor Caravella wants to speak.

1818
02:29:14,482 --> 02:29:15,463
Thank you, Madam President.

1819
02:29:15,963 --> 02:29:17,184
Thank you, Amy, for coming up here.

1820
02:29:17,204 --> 02:29:17,504
You're right.

1821
02:29:18,124 --> 02:29:20,085
You are the voice, you are the face.

1822
02:29:20,886 --> 02:29:26,989
And that makes these officers, not just you, but the other women that work in the department, you see my face when I come in.

1823
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:31,432
Who's first face I see is yours, or yours, other faces.

1824
02:29:33,484 --> 02:29:37,227
While all those gentlemen are out there working in the fields, who's answering the phone?

1825
02:29:37,528 --> 02:29:39,649
Who's making the city look good?

1826
02:29:39,669 --> 02:29:41,411
Who's making the boss look good?

1827
02:29:41,511 --> 02:29:45,795
It's part of the reason I did not vote for the raises that the department gets.

1828
02:29:46,976 --> 02:29:51,000
I come from a school where the working people get paid first.

1829
02:29:51,948 --> 02:29:54,309
And that's the way it should be, whether you're a man or a woman.

1830
02:29:55,149 --> 02:29:57,790
The workers are what makes this building go around.

1831
02:29:59,711 --> 02:30:03,112
You and all the women who work in this place, you're the one that makes the bar so good.

1832
02:30:03,352 --> 02:30:04,492
It makes the bottom of the head good.

1833
02:30:04,773 --> 02:30:09,914
You're the one that makes all these men and other women revolve around this thing.

1834
02:30:12,748 --> 02:30:16,089
Four years without a raise is certainly unconscionable.

1835
02:30:16,789 --> 02:30:22,592
And not even to be respected to even be discussing a raise is even more unconscionable.

1836
02:30:23,792 --> 02:30:26,433
Cost of living has gone up 8%.

1837
02:30:26,493 --> 02:30:27,553
And they're offering you, what, 1%, 2%?

1838
02:30:28,334 --> 02:30:27,553
2%, 1%.

1839
02:30:29,514 --> 02:30:33,255
2%.

1840
02:30:30,294 --> 02:30:33,255
And that's not even counting all the back years.

1841
02:30:33,275 --> 02:30:34,216
You haven't got anything.

1842
02:30:34,596 --> 02:30:35,136
And you're right.

1843
02:30:35,416 --> 02:30:36,496
Teachers go up $1,500 a year.

1844
02:30:38,497 --> 02:30:39,378
for a COVID bonus?

1845
02:30:40,098 --> 02:30:43,120
And what are you being offered for a COVID bonus while everybody else was home?

1846
02:30:43,580 --> 02:30:45,361
Well, we've been offered a few things.

1847
02:30:45,481 --> 02:30:47,262
One was 500, then they took it away.

1848
02:30:48,423 --> 02:30:49,463
Then they wouldn't put it back.

1849
02:30:49,844 --> 02:30:52,925
And this last negotiation, they put 750 for one year.

1850
02:30:53,666 --> 02:30:55,467
What makes you different than the teachers?

1851
02:30:55,947 --> 02:30:56,467
Thank you.

1852
02:30:57,328 --> 02:30:58,248
You know, different than teachers.

1853
02:30:58,588 --> 02:31:00,810
Are anybody else in this room?

1854
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:01,990
I don't think so.

1855
02:31:02,270 --> 02:31:06,813
You deserve something fair and equal that everyone else here, whether you're a man or a woman or whatever you are,

1856
02:31:08,047 --> 02:31:09,788
You should be treated the same.

1857
02:31:10,109 --> 02:31:11,149
There is no division here.

1858
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:16,433
I apologize, and I've supported you, everyone, from day one.

1859
02:31:18,174 --> 02:31:22,097
And again, like I said, I hope you settle your contract quick.

1860
02:31:22,678 --> 02:31:27,161
And I know the dedication you and many other people have put into this city.

1861
02:31:27,681 --> 02:31:28,702
I applaud you.

1862
02:31:29,843 --> 02:31:31,324
Many people that have probably gone on strike

1863
02:31:33,031 --> 02:31:34,432
I'll quit and go on to another job.

1864
02:31:34,472 --> 02:31:43,658
I'm sure there's plenty of other jobs out there that you can take, probably making more money, but I do appreciate you saying your dedication and the other workers, their dedication to the community.

1865
02:31:43,678 --> 02:31:52,543
But again, I will not support a raise for any department head, so the workers who are the cog of the city get paid first.

1866
02:31:53,223 --> 02:32:01,228
I request on top of that, that the budget not be approved until she realizes that we need to get this settled.

1867
02:32:01,616 --> 02:32:02,698
You do need to get itself.

1868
02:32:04,079 --> 02:32:07,524
Just joining me up here, Kyle Heath, Fulton Spring Road, Method.

1869
02:32:08,165 --> 02:32:09,607
Sure, and we- DPW members.

1870
02:32:09,647 --> 02:32:09,827
Yeah.

1871
02:32:10,067 --> 02:32:10,268
Yeah.

1872
02:32:10,508 --> 02:32:11,429
Okay, thank you.

1873
02:32:11,449 --> 02:32:12,871
Charles Stewart from Method, DPW.

1874
02:32:12,891 --> 02:32:14,153
That was cut off.

1875
02:32:15,094 --> 02:32:15,935
Yeah.

1876
02:32:16,296 --> 02:32:17,177
Sorry, I was talking to you.

1877
02:32:17,758 --> 02:32:19,160
I don't- That's fine.

1878
02:32:19,976 --> 02:32:34,698
continue vice president bears like we still we have other folks want to speak but you know I was just Amy kind of no offense for cutting me off but I just kind of wanted to give you the give you the floor when you're making a passionate speech I just wanted to say a couple other things really quickly and then I'll defer to everybody else.

1879
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,021
I hear you on the request.

1880
02:32:37,461 --> 02:32:43,824
We threatened it last year, and it was clear that after 45 days, according to state law, the budget goes into effect anyway, even if we don't vote for it.

1881
02:32:44,665 --> 02:32:48,067
So there may be something there, but she's waited us out on everything else.

1882
02:32:48,087 --> 02:32:48,987
She'll wait us out on that.

1883
02:32:49,667 --> 02:32:52,729
So I hear the ask, and I respect the ask.

1884
02:32:54,630 --> 02:32:59,135
And I'll consider the ask, but at the end of the day, we threatened it over a multitude of issues last year.

1885
02:32:59,175 --> 02:33:06,883
And the law says 45 days after she submits the budget, if we have not voted to approve it, it goes into effect automatically, with no change from us.

1886
02:33:06,943 --> 02:33:10,286
So I hear you, it's absolutely morally wrong.

1887
02:33:10,467 --> 02:33:13,249
Absolutely, I think, politically stupid.

1888
02:33:14,691 --> 02:33:15,011
But the

1889
02:33:18,310 --> 02:33:19,010
I'll put it this way.

1890
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:29,092
There's some charter amendments that are that we're all considering later tonight that would actually give the city council real backbone if if the mayor lets them go forward, which, you know, we'll see if that happens.

1891
02:33:30,272 --> 02:33:32,973
But either way, we're planning, I think, to put them on the ballot this fall.

1892
02:33:33,013 --> 02:33:40,635
And I think it's something that the city should vote for, because the residents should vote for, because I think it would give this council actually a fighting chance to help in certain situations.

1893
02:33:41,275 --> 02:33:43,295
That's one path that I'm going down.

1894
02:33:44,015 --> 02:33:47,136
The second one, obviously, is change the negotiating partner.

1895
02:33:47,496 --> 02:33:49,939
and the city may have a chance to do that at some point.

1896
02:33:50,739 --> 02:34:07,657
The third thing I'll say and again I don't a public officials you don't usually hear public officials say this and be I really hate to put it back on to you, but a work stoppage, a strike, something to force her to the table, even if we don't vote for the budget.

1897
02:34:08,620 --> 02:34:10,341
it'll go into effect after 45 days.

1898
02:34:10,581 --> 02:34:11,802
So it's not the same thing.

1899
02:34:12,022 --> 02:34:14,343
I understand that strikes are illegal in Massachusetts.

1900
02:34:14,423 --> 02:34:18,026
We've seen a lot of public sector strikes over the last two years that have been highly effective.

1901
02:34:18,586 --> 02:34:20,047
I'll stand that picket line with you every day.

1902
02:34:21,087 --> 02:34:23,709
So, you know, I know that's a really hard ask.

1903
02:34:24,029 --> 02:34:28,512
And that's why I but I no one's brought it up yet here before and all these conversations.

1904
02:34:29,869 --> 02:34:37,154
I sit here incredibly frustrated constantly at our inability to actually have any real authority to get the administration to do pretty much anything that we want.

1905
02:34:37,794 --> 02:34:44,659
Nevermind just the contract issue but a million other things charter amendment path is one path, I'm trying to go down to balance things.

1906
02:34:45,519 --> 02:34:48,421
I think we try to advocate with with the mayor's office.

1907
02:34:50,102 --> 02:34:52,424
But the buck has to stop somewhere.

1908
02:34:52,985 --> 02:34:57,969
There's nothing in the law that we can stop really anything for any more time than 45 days.

1909
02:34:59,170 --> 02:35:01,972
But you guys could stop the whole city, because you're not just the face of it.

1910
02:35:02,713 --> 02:35:03,554
You're the feet of the city.

1911
02:35:03,634 --> 02:35:05,675
You're the people who actually do all the work every day.

1912
02:35:05,696 --> 02:35:10,740
And if suddenly the city came to a screeching halt, it would have a pretty big effect.

1913
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:13,202
So I understand that's a really hard decision.

1914
02:35:13,342 --> 02:35:13,943
I'm not a member.

1915
02:35:13,983 --> 02:35:14,863
I wouldn't be voting on it.

1916
02:35:15,044 --> 02:35:16,725
But if you all voted to do it, I'd be with you.

1917
02:35:18,055 --> 02:35:19,856
Like you said, there's just no answers on anything.

1918
02:35:22,098 --> 02:35:25,861
Every time, no matter where I am, I always get, oh, the DPW, what are they doing?

1919
02:35:25,901 --> 02:35:26,661
Why aren't they doing this?

1920
02:35:26,681 --> 02:35:27,362
Why aren't they doing that?

1921
02:35:27,402 --> 02:35:41,472
But we're trying to get stuff done and we're just not getting answers ourselves to get equipment we need or different things where, like I say, smoking mirrors, we're fixing, putting a flower pot on a light pole instead of, we could be all fixing sidewalks and streets.

1922
02:35:42,792 --> 02:35:43,273
We're doing what?

1923
02:35:45,068 --> 02:35:47,609
We're not doing what should be done, but we're doing little things that people might see.

1924
02:35:48,189 --> 02:35:49,369
We really should be doing other things.

1925
02:35:49,969 --> 02:35:57,452
But not just, as I said, it's not just not giving us a nice raise, it's taking other things away from us.

1926
02:35:57,712 --> 02:36:00,572
Everything has been raised up, whether it's food, clothing, no matter what it is.

1927
02:36:01,693 --> 02:36:07,894
We are not only not getting respected with the raise, it's sorry your clothing allowance is being lowered.

1928
02:36:08,435 --> 02:36:08,795
Sorry.

1929
02:36:09,948 --> 02:36:12,289
We, you got a stipend for this, well now we're lowering that.

1930
02:36:12,609 --> 02:36:14,950
You get so many sick days, well now those are being lowered.

1931
02:36:14,990 --> 02:36:16,390
Vacation days, those are being lowered.

1932
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:19,291
They're taking away from us what they're trying to do.

1933
02:36:20,812 --> 02:36:24,613
And she said, during COVID, we were here day in and day out for COVID.

1934
02:36:25,707 --> 02:36:27,128
We also asked for COVID money.

1935
02:36:27,648 --> 02:36:32,690
Anytime somebody at City Hall had COVID, who was the first call, DPW, come down here and sanitize.

1936
02:36:33,550 --> 02:36:36,792
Somebody at the fire station has COVID, come down here and sanitize, DPW.

1937
02:36:37,312 --> 02:36:41,013
Someone at the police station, COVID, DPW, come down and sanitize.

1938
02:36:41,053 --> 02:36:42,174
Yeah, we asked for COVID bonus.

1939
02:36:42,254 --> 02:36:45,235
Sorry, you're not really an essential worker, so you're not getting COVID money.

1940
02:36:45,715 --> 02:36:47,296
Yep, we were here day in and day out.

1941
02:36:48,337 --> 02:36:51,458
So it's just even sitting in negotiations.

1942
02:36:53,049 --> 02:36:56,331
there's no one from the mayor staff there, right?

1943
02:36:56,411 --> 02:36:58,692
We're getting, we tell them one thing.

1944
02:36:58,872 --> 02:37:02,834
So we're getting KP Law's lawyer to sit in on negotiations with us.

1945
02:37:03,975 --> 02:37:05,035
We asked them for something.

1946
02:37:05,075 --> 02:37:08,957
They tell us, yeah, I'm gonna have to go back and speak to the mayor.

1947
02:37:09,197 --> 02:37:12,359
And then I'll come back with an answer for you because I can't negotiate.

1948
02:37:12,639 --> 02:37:16,061
Well, if you're in negotiations, shouldn't you be able to negotiate?

1949
02:37:16,621 --> 02:37:18,182
I'll go get an answer from mayor, then I'll come back.

1950
02:37:19,788 --> 02:37:26,650
What I think people are forgetting is that office across the hall, you're not affecting just me, not affecting just Amy.

1951
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:28,651
I have a seven-year-old and a four-year-old at home.

1952
02:37:29,191 --> 02:37:30,071
That's who you're affecting.

1953
02:37:30,972 --> 02:37:31,852
That's who I'm looking at.

1954
02:37:32,592 --> 02:37:33,853
Do I really want to send the school here?

1955
02:37:34,013 --> 02:37:35,273
Do I really want to stay here?

1956
02:37:35,813 --> 02:37:36,513
I love this city.

1957
02:37:37,294 --> 02:37:40,375
I'm not trying to make a killing in money.

1958
02:37:42,015 --> 02:37:43,316
In the morning, I get a park ready.

1959
02:37:43,796 --> 02:37:45,336
I'm coaching on that field at night.

1960
02:37:46,297 --> 02:37:47,457
I take pride in doing it.

1961
02:37:48,374 --> 02:37:59,657
And what's happening is you're getting people that, just like me, that love this city, that want to make this city better, that are leaving this city, and you're getting outsiders that come in and work that don't care what the streets look like or what the fields look like.

1962
02:37:59,697 --> 02:38:04,698
They just want to get a paycheck and leave and go to whatever city or town they're from.

1963
02:38:04,718 --> 02:38:11,520
It's just, I'm just fed up with it because I love this city and things are really starting to change around here.

1964
02:38:12,861 --> 02:38:13,421
Not for the better.

1965
02:38:14,001 --> 02:38:17,182
As we saw earlier, I know everyone's laughing and joking, but

1966
02:38:18,482 --> 02:38:32,156
with no city solicitor people laughing in the audience of what's going on and just from across the hall with this, the mayor's losing the city, so we have a counselor saying and we'll, we'll come back to you as well.

1967
02:38:32,436 --> 02:38:32,917
I'll be quick.

1968
02:38:33,177 --> 02:38:39,243
Um, I, I think we we've all said before you know how important you guys are to us that

1969
02:38:40,044 --> 02:38:44,549
You know it bears repeating but also, I know it's words and I you guys want action.

1970
02:38:44,569 --> 02:38:46,331
Um, I do.

1971
02:38:46,752 --> 02:38:54,000
I think the idea about using the budget season to negotiate it from our side, I think, you know, we'll try to do our best.

1972
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:55,682
And I actually think that's a good idea.

1973
02:38:56,923 --> 02:39:11,772
You know we do run into the limit that counselor bears said about the 45 days but I do think that's a good idea for us to use our time and our podium here to do right by you guys, and you said it's he's a nice phrase but it's not.

1974
02:39:12,213 --> 02:39:15,695
You're right, it's not a right nice phrase right it's it's living for your family and

1975
02:39:16,279 --> 02:39:23,123
for your situation too, and you're so brave for coming up and talking about that openly with us as well.

1976
02:39:23,543 --> 02:39:25,765
But it's not a nice phrase.

1977
02:39:25,825 --> 02:39:29,887
I mean, it's not like you guys are gonna make bank after that small raise, right?

1978
02:39:30,388 --> 02:39:33,049
And we all know inflation's been out of control.

1979
02:39:33,430 --> 02:39:34,050
We all know that.

1980
02:39:35,331 --> 02:39:42,035
So to go out and say you're not an essential worker and blah, that's not right, right?

1981
02:39:42,455 --> 02:39:42,895
And so,

1982
02:39:44,116 --> 02:39:50,363
Um, well we'll take a look during the budget and see what how much we can, we'll try our best to advocate for the most.

1983
02:39:52,305 --> 02:39:57,350
The $25 million in free cash I just wanted to put out there I've said week and week, week in and week out.

1984
02:39:57,691 --> 02:39:58,492
Once that was announced.

1985
02:39:59,032 --> 02:40:04,218
I don't get why we're not spending that on you guys on investing in the people who actually love the city and work for the city.

1986
02:40:04,578 --> 02:40:05,318
It doesn't make sense.

1987
02:40:05,438 --> 02:40:05,999
It's not right.

1988
02:40:06,239 --> 02:40:12,582
And, you know, we can talk about wanting to do X project and Y project because they're all needs, right?

1989
02:40:12,622 --> 02:40:14,183
But you guys are in need, too.

1990
02:40:14,303 --> 02:40:15,463
We need you guys to function.

1991
02:40:16,024 --> 02:40:20,506
And we need to do the basics well before we can do anything else on top of that.

1992
02:40:20,626 --> 02:40:23,167
And when we don't pay you guys, we can't do the basics well.

1993
02:40:24,888 --> 02:40:38,360
So I would like to see, I mean, we'll have to sit down with the administration and get the whole picture about the budget, but I would like to see the administration spend that cash on this, because this is unsustainable.

1994
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:44,846
The situation is unsustainable for us, for her administration, for the city, for the residents.

1995
02:40:44,966 --> 02:40:47,328
It's unsustainable for all of us.

1996
02:40:47,808 --> 02:40:50,270
And I think you very bravely,

1997
02:40:52,051 --> 02:40:54,072
talked about the gender aspect of things too.

1998
02:40:55,032 --> 02:41:01,973
That's huge to talk about because, you know, people always cry, people always scream and shout when someone brings it up, but it's true.

1999
02:41:02,654 --> 02:41:06,594
It's true, it happens in our workforce, in City Hall, it happens everywhere.

2000
02:41:07,875 --> 02:41:18,577
And so there has to be more that we do about it, not just about your pays and your budget, but to give women workers in City Hall a better way to bring up

2001
02:41:19,037 --> 02:41:23,760
these challenges, these problems that we're facing, these disparities.

2002
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:35,386
And so I know Councilor Morrell, President Morrell has been on the leading front of pushing for us to have a gender equity commission and we have some potential draft language for it.

2003
02:41:35,526 --> 02:41:40,549
And it'd be great if we could move forward on that to give you guys a channel to talk about that openly as well.

2004
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:42,570
Thank you.

2005
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:45,592
We'll go to Councilor Collins, Councilor Capelli and go back to you both.

2006
02:41:48,042 --> 02:41:49,343
Well, I just want to thank you for being here.

2007
02:41:49,363 --> 02:41:58,646
I feel like there's not a lot that I could add that would be additive because you've said so much very clearly, briefly about what you've been going through for many, many years.

2008
02:41:59,387 --> 02:42:00,907
I don't think there's anything that I could add to that.

2009
02:42:00,947 --> 02:42:02,888
That wouldn't just be rhetorical that we've said already.

2010
02:42:02,928 --> 02:42:10,912
And I know it's very clear, you know, it goes without saying, but you've said it, what you need is not more statements of support, but actual results.

2011
02:42:11,892 --> 02:42:15,896
And it's obviously demonstrably true that times are getting harder.

2012
02:42:16,516 --> 02:42:17,697
Cost of living is going up.

2013
02:42:17,737 --> 02:42:21,420
It's not just inflation, it's cost of living, it's cost of everything.

2014
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:24,623
I think we probably all feel this in our personal budgets.

2015
02:42:25,904 --> 02:42:38,355
And it's, we've been hearing about this for months, if not more, but it still is just completely, it's unfathomable to me how little you're being offered compared to

2016
02:42:40,791 --> 02:42:45,154
the real value of that compensation compared to what it takes to live in this city.

2017
02:42:46,355 --> 02:42:52,721
I don't get why we would make it so hard for people who want to serve their community to stay in this community.

2018
02:42:52,901 --> 02:42:53,362
I don't get it.

2019
02:42:54,302 --> 02:42:57,926
Like you said, nobody gets rich doing public service, they do it because of

2020
02:42:58,931 --> 02:43:00,772
some kind of you know wanting to invest in the community.

2021
02:43:01,253 --> 02:43:02,293
Why are we making it hard.

2022
02:43:02,594 --> 02:43:10,219
I'm glad the counselor saying brought up the, the $25 million in free cash that was certified last July that we heard about a couple months ago.

2023
02:43:11,460 --> 02:43:13,922
And I said it then but when I heard about that.

2024
02:43:14,582 --> 02:43:17,264
I wasn't happy, I was disgusted.

2025
02:43:17,284 --> 02:43:19,146
It's like why are we sitting on this.

2026
02:43:21,418 --> 02:43:24,679
As you said, you're the lowest paid workers in City Hall.

2027
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:34,984
So even if you were to get an 8% cost of living adjustment, I don't have the math brain that some other of my fellow counselors do, but I don't think that would make a dent in $25 million.

2028
02:43:37,164 --> 02:43:44,467
I want an explanation for why that isn't being allocated to bring up the baseline on the people who have needed it the most for the longest and haven't gotten anything.

2029
02:43:45,688 --> 02:43:50,190
To make an offer to workers negotiating and then rescind that offer,

2030
02:43:51,412 --> 02:44:03,440
That's a negotiating tactic that I've heard about in other contexts that I thought was, I'm not even sure what the word is, hostile, openly hostile.

2031
02:44:03,460 --> 02:44:10,505
When I hear about that going on between other negotiating partners, it's meant to be intimidating.

2032
02:44:10,565 --> 02:44:12,506
It's meant to be a show of force, show of power.

2033
02:44:14,387 --> 02:44:16,529
Why would we do that to our clerks?

2034
02:44:16,809 --> 02:44:17,229
I don't get it.

2035
02:44:19,931 --> 02:44:20,752
Thank you for being here.

2036
02:44:20,772 --> 02:44:31,101
We appreciate you being transparent with us going through I think we obviously have plenty of options to think through in terms of how we can handle this especially as the opportunity of budget season comes before us.

2037
02:44:32,502 --> 02:44:39,469
Thank you for continuing to invite us to your negotiating meetings and I hope that we can all stay in touch both inside and outside of this chamber, as things go on.

2038
02:44:40,490 --> 02:44:41,250
Thank you.

2039
02:44:45,854 --> 02:44:58,797
As a former negotiating member of contract as a teacher and a active member of a negotiating team municipality, that is absolutely appalling what I just heard.

2040
02:45:00,098 --> 02:45:06,979
That just tells you, and it should be a shot across this community, of where we are in the leadership of this community.

2041
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:12,901
Now it's sad because we're gonna get phone calls tomorrow saying, what are you doing?

2042
02:45:12,941 --> 02:45:13,781
This isn't political.

2043
02:45:15,189 --> 02:45:17,050
I keep telling people we don't have a newspaper.

2044
02:45:17,550 --> 02:45:19,690
We don't have an avenue to share what's going on.

2045
02:45:20,050 --> 02:45:21,431
This is the only forum right now.

2046
02:45:23,251 --> 02:45:25,112
If you were here earlier that six o'clock meeting.

2047
02:45:26,692 --> 02:45:32,814
It was it was our council's wish list go over the budget, our hopes and budget for the budget.

2048
02:45:34,015 --> 02:45:40,717
And I was so demoralized as I got went through that mental process to see what I needed.

2049
02:45:41,817 --> 02:45:41,897
And

2050
02:45:44,090 --> 02:45:45,791
It's you're always overlooked.

2051
02:45:46,912 --> 02:45:49,333
You're saying that you're not getting paid, but I want to ask you a question.

2052
02:45:50,974 --> 02:45:52,735
You have plenty of staff in your offices, right?

2053
02:45:52,755 --> 02:45:53,476
Absolutely.

2054
02:45:53,576 --> 02:45:54,997
No, you don't, right?

2055
02:45:55,497 --> 02:45:59,920
There's abundance of employees that are DPW and your secretarial team way understaffed.

2056
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:06,604
So you're not only are you not getting paid what you deserve, you're doing the job of two to three people.

2057
02:46:07,364 --> 02:46:09,485
And here's the funny, here's the funny piece cause I can see it.

2058
02:46:10,426 --> 02:46:10,526
Um,

2059
02:46:11,789 --> 02:46:13,990
We vote no on the budget.

2060
02:46:14,150 --> 02:46:15,210
In 45 days, they have to pass it.

2061
02:46:15,230 --> 02:46:16,730
They have to run on a different budget.

2062
02:46:17,030 --> 02:46:20,031
Guess who'll have to do all the work to get the new budget prepared?

2063
02:46:20,051 --> 02:46:22,052
The secretaries.

2064
02:46:23,192 --> 02:46:23,512
I know.

2065
02:46:23,832 --> 02:46:26,953
That's what's so moronic.

2066
02:46:27,013 --> 02:46:27,593
It's scary.

2067
02:46:27,653 --> 02:46:33,975
But I, for one, as a union member and part of a municipal team,

2068
02:46:35,483 --> 02:46:42,069
I have not voted for any money paper, let alone increases for the administration.

2069
02:46:42,970 --> 02:46:45,633
Have they gone back to the administration, taken down salaries?

2070
02:46:46,473 --> 02:46:48,455
Have they done that to the administration staff?

2071
02:46:48,475 --> 02:46:50,998
Because they're okay.

2072
02:46:52,099 --> 02:46:53,100
I mean, for the ones that are there.

2073
02:46:55,383 --> 02:46:59,584
So I just find this very, very frightening that people have to understand.

2074
02:47:00,044 --> 02:47:03,766
In a normal negotiation, you have a representative from the city.

2075
02:47:04,646 --> 02:47:08,887
And a lot of times when you're at a crossroads, then your mayor steps in.

2076
02:47:09,928 --> 02:47:23,392
A lot of times when I sat in negotiation, you had city solicitor who would come in, the representative from HR or your HR director, department head, who's in administration, working with each individual unit.

2077
02:47:24,864 --> 02:47:26,445
and you find that common balance.

2078
02:47:26,526 --> 02:47:36,314
You look and negotiate for trading language for percentage, trading longevity for other options.

2079
02:47:36,575 --> 02:47:37,676
And this is how you work it.

2080
02:47:38,657 --> 02:47:42,460
What my frustration that I need to share with all of you is this.

2081
02:47:43,901 --> 02:47:45,283
We truly don't know

2082
02:47:46,413 --> 02:47:48,974
the financial outlook of our community in a few weeks.

2083
02:47:49,494 --> 02:47:50,555
We don't know where we are.

2084
02:47:50,595 --> 02:47:52,976
We haven't seen any projections.

2085
02:47:53,016 --> 02:47:54,717
We haven't seen any pre-budget stuff.

2086
02:47:55,037 --> 02:47:56,038
We haven't seen anything.

2087
02:47:56,138 --> 02:47:57,998
All we hear are rumors.

2088
02:47:58,619 --> 02:48:05,122
We hear that the school committee got probably one of the biggest budget pieces in the community, the biggest.

2089
02:48:06,322 --> 02:48:11,645
We were told that they got a letter, the school committee got a letter saying that we're looking at huge cuts and layoffs.

2090
02:48:13,984 --> 02:48:18,327
So the teachers called me and says, well, is this why we got what we got for percentage so they can cut everybody?

2091
02:48:20,109 --> 02:48:34,880
So what I fear, what we don't know, we don't know what the budget's gonna, I'm afraid of as bad as it is in city halls, bad as it is out in the streets and the roads and the parks.

2092
02:48:35,921 --> 02:48:38,063
We don't know where we are, but I will tell you,

2093
02:48:39,725 --> 02:48:49,997
in negotiations as a school team member, as in negotiations in a municipal department where I work as a city councilor, Ms.

2094
02:48:50,037 --> 02:48:52,700
Fagli, I understand exactly what you're talking about.

2095
02:48:53,761 --> 02:48:56,124
And I'm willing to stand with you and say, hey,

2096
02:48:57,207 --> 02:48:58,748
Let's start off this budget meeting.

2097
02:48:58,788 --> 02:49:18,200
Let's start this process off by saying, hey, if part of the budget process with the city council isn't making everybody whole and making sure everybody's on the path to make sure that they're supported and they're shown the respect they deserve, I'm willing to stand with you in any day.

2098
02:49:18,220 --> 02:49:18,700
I've done that.

2099
02:49:19,460 --> 02:49:23,243
I'm willing to do that any day of the week with all of you.

2100
02:49:25,704 --> 02:49:26,765
But I will tell you,

2101
02:49:28,383 --> 02:49:38,887
Where, what I'm, what I have, my disappointment, my fear is that we don't know where the climate, financial climate is in this community.

2102
02:49:39,847 --> 02:49:43,948
I know Councilor is saying, we would love to, I agree with you, let's use that 25 million.

2103
02:49:44,489 --> 02:49:48,410
But we have a resolution out asking, where did this 25 million come from?

2104
02:49:49,170 --> 02:49:50,131
No one's told us yet.

2105
02:49:51,491 --> 02:49:52,031
We don't know.

2106
02:49:52,051 --> 02:49:56,313
And the fact that they have KP Law and everything,

2107
02:49:57,741 --> 02:50:09,425
issues at the school department, handling personnel issues, school department, handling negotiations here, fighting for taking away 40B projects and development in the city.

2108
02:50:10,546 --> 02:50:11,186
We're a mess.

2109
02:50:12,987 --> 02:50:14,227
This isn't a political ploy.

2110
02:50:14,627 --> 02:50:17,728
This is me venting and talking with you.

2111
02:50:17,788 --> 02:50:19,549
So the city, how do we move forward?

2112
02:50:19,669 --> 02:50:20,750
I hate talking like this.

2113
02:50:21,070 --> 02:50:22,050
I hate being negative.

2114
02:50:22,690 --> 02:50:26,952
I want solutions, but I'm telling you, your frustration is our frustration.

2115
02:50:28,481 --> 02:50:30,121
We tried to hold a meeting with the mayor.

2116
02:50:30,481 --> 02:50:45,644
Council President worked her tail off to make sure that she worked with the school committee so we can sit down before this budget season to talk about what's happening at the high school, security issues, future budget concerns, other issues that we need to talk to so we can sit down in a room and work together.

2117
02:50:46,644 --> 02:50:48,885
We got word back that the mayor didn't want to meet with us.

2118
02:50:50,685 --> 02:50:54,206
We got word that the mayor didn't want to meet with us because she was afraid of the dialogue.

2119
02:50:55,346 --> 02:50:56,526
She's the mayor of the community.

2120
02:50:58,586 --> 02:51:00,007
And it's funny, know what I'm hearing from people?

2121
02:51:00,368 --> 02:51:01,809
You know the only way you can reach out, George?

2122
02:51:02,329 --> 02:51:03,590
Start a Facebook post.

2123
02:51:04,171 --> 02:51:05,792
Let's start a Facebook newspaper.

2124
02:51:06,273 --> 02:51:20,585
And that's whatever she puts out, you know, with Run Like Girls or any of the programs or whatever fluff that's going out there, the signings and the ribbon cuttings, let's put it to what's really affecting Medford.

2125
02:51:21,226 --> 02:51:25,669
Because I'm afraid, July 1, I'm afraid July 1,

2126
02:51:27,537 --> 02:51:32,218
We're going to be talking to parents about classroom sizes being too big.

2127
02:51:32,579 --> 02:51:37,300
We're going to be talking about special needs parents of their children that can't have the services they need.

2128
02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:42,262
We're going to talk about the three DPW workers in the parks that have to cut down to two.

2129
02:51:43,182 --> 02:51:46,583
We're going to have to talk about the 80 police officers that they have to cut down to 75.

2130
02:51:46,903 --> 02:51:48,864
That's my fear.

2131
02:51:48,964 --> 02:51:49,224
Why?

2132
02:51:49,244 --> 02:51:50,864
No one's dispelled that.

2133
02:51:51,385 --> 02:51:52,205
No one's told us.

2134
02:51:55,381 --> 02:52:02,803
The only time we have anybody from the administration here is the chief of staff to call us bullies and tell us that, you know, sticking up from here.

2135
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:04,263
You're wrong, she's great.

2136
02:52:06,023 --> 02:52:07,864
In the meantime, we're falling apart.

2137
02:52:09,704 --> 02:52:10,825
We're falling apart.

2138
02:52:11,925 --> 02:52:13,165
You saw just what happened today.

2139
02:52:14,425 --> 02:52:17,466
We had questions with legalities that should have been taken care of in five minutes.

2140
02:52:17,506 --> 02:52:19,046
If we had someone, it would have been done.

2141
02:52:19,366 --> 02:52:20,947
We haven't had a city attorney for a year.

2142
02:52:21,965 --> 02:52:27,048
And I know what the dialogue is from the main, the administrator's office, is that it's very competitive.

2143
02:52:28,329 --> 02:52:35,374
Just so I've talked to, I've talked to eight city solicitors sitting at a table at a memorial.

2144
02:52:35,934 --> 02:52:41,578
And I asked them, jokingly, hey, come to Medford, we'll get your top dollars.

2145
02:52:42,478 --> 02:52:47,481
And they were like, George, not if you gave us the key to the city, that place is a mess.

2146
02:52:49,182 --> 02:52:51,224
So it's not just here, it's everywhere.

2147
02:52:52,475 --> 02:52:57,860
So long story short, I don't care that I'm venting anymore.

2148
02:52:58,961 --> 02:53:00,963
At least I get some sort of satisfaction.

2149
02:53:01,263 --> 02:53:05,047
I get yelled at when I get home by my wife, but I'm telling you, we appreciate what you do.

2150
02:53:05,647 --> 02:53:08,510
And we're gonna support whatever you ask me to do, I'm gonna do.

2151
02:53:09,651 --> 02:53:12,133
Because I'm at that point, if you're frustrated, I'm frustrated.

2152
02:53:13,774 --> 02:53:14,715
I grew up in the city.

2153
02:53:15,715 --> 02:53:16,776
I did everything I can.

2154
02:53:16,816 --> 02:53:18,778
I got four jobs and bought a house in the city.

2155
02:53:19,138 --> 02:53:23,201
I did whatever I could do to stay in the city, to make my kids go to the public schools in the city.

2156
02:53:25,843 --> 02:53:29,946
I've gone through McGlynn and Burke and now Longo Kern.

2157
02:53:30,667 --> 02:53:31,608
This is a mess.

2158
02:53:34,790 --> 02:53:42,777
And to hear the dialogue that her mission is to clean up city hall, holy cow, if that's cleaning up, I'm frightened to see what's next.

2159
02:53:44,447 --> 02:53:47,248
But again, I apologize, Madam President.

2160
02:53:47,748 --> 02:53:50,229
These are tirades that I'm getting sick and tired of myself.

2161
02:53:50,489 --> 02:53:52,570
When I say it, my ears hurt.

2162
02:53:54,070 --> 02:53:56,731
But it has to be said, because you know why?

2163
02:53:57,311 --> 02:54:03,653
Because the regular person that all they have is this evening to watch us talk, they don't truly understand what's going on in the city.

2164
02:54:04,133 --> 02:54:04,693
They don't know.

2165
02:54:04,713 --> 02:54:05,594
Well, that's it.

2166
02:54:05,634 --> 02:54:09,035
We don't wanna be up here all the time, but people need to see what's actually going on.

2167
02:54:09,175 --> 02:54:09,915
And I appreciate it.

2168
02:54:10,235 --> 02:54:28,008
You know, and it's, as you said, with the bullying, they're saying it's coming from this side, but I think it's the other way around because I'm sure there's a lot of other DPW members here, local 25 members that wanted to come for this night or that night of a rally or come speak, but they're afraid that for their job after that, something might happen to them.

2169
02:54:28,808 --> 02:54:30,730
I'm afraid speaking up here that something might happen to me.

2170
02:54:31,650 --> 02:54:36,454
Who knows what might happen at work now, but, and I shouldn't have to be like that, but you guys are all witnesses.

2171
02:54:36,514 --> 02:54:36,974
Something happens.

2172
02:54:39,935 --> 02:54:57,500
It seems like that's just what keeps happening To thank you guys for everything you do Georgia everything we need you're always there for us Zach It's national DBW week Has anyone seen a post from the mayor thanking the DBW?

2173
02:54:58,200 --> 02:54:58,720
I haven't seen it.

2174
02:54:58,740 --> 02:55:07,482
I haven't seen anything Now you'll probably see one because everything's reactive instead of proactive from across the hall but

2175
02:55:08,595 --> 02:55:19,040
It's the little things that we're not getting appreciated, not just with a raise or things like that, but I've seen the mayor twice come down to the DBW yard in the four years I've been there.

2176
02:55:19,841 --> 02:55:22,142
And once was the four years she's been here.

2177
02:55:22,502 --> 02:55:24,363
Once was to tell us she fired our commissioner.

2178
02:55:26,624 --> 02:55:27,645
That was it.

2179
02:55:28,065 --> 02:55:28,846
You know who comes down there?

2180
02:55:29,726 --> 02:55:32,007
Rick, George, Adam, Gene, Zach.

2181
02:55:33,428 --> 02:55:34,228
Rick comes down there.

2182
02:55:35,289 --> 02:55:37,250
We could be there for days on end plowing.

2183
02:55:38,401 --> 02:55:39,983
where it comes down there shows appreciation.

2184
02:55:40,023 --> 02:55:43,586
Do you see it posted anywhere that it is down there bringing us Chinese food subs, you name it?

2185
02:55:44,427 --> 02:55:49,552
No, but the mayor came down once brought us ramen noodle that was posted all over social media.

2186
02:55:51,774 --> 02:55:52,575
So I thank you guys.

2187
02:55:52,615 --> 02:55:58,100
I'm sorry, we got to keep doing this, but the people have to hear what's going on in the city because it's bad.

2188
02:55:59,641 --> 02:56:00,042
It's bad.

2189
02:56:00,242 --> 02:56:00,642
It's bad.

2190
02:56:03,585 --> 02:56:08,308
And I know it's not why you're here, but thank you as always, but also thank you during DPW week.

2191
02:56:08,748 --> 02:56:16,053
And thank you to the clerical department, everyone at City Hall, DPW, everyone teams is over 25, because what we're having to put up with lately is just crazy.

2192
02:56:16,193 --> 02:56:22,297
And for all the work the city's getting done with what we're having to deal with across the hall, it's pretty remarkable to me.

2193
02:56:22,457 --> 02:56:23,237
So thank you guys.

2194
02:56:23,557 --> 02:56:26,639
I'm going to go back to Vice President Behrs, then we'll go back to Councilor Carvalho.

2195
02:56:27,320 --> 02:56:29,541
I'll be quick, because that was probably a better ending than what I'm going to say.

2196
02:56:31,576 --> 02:56:34,919
Sometimes I think George and I are like vying for counselor buzzkill.

2197
02:56:35,379 --> 02:56:39,062
And I'm not sure which one of us is worse, but maybe it's like a Jacqueline Hyde kind of thing.

2198
02:56:39,643 --> 02:56:40,664
And you can pick which one.

2199
02:56:42,545 --> 02:56:53,074
But two things here really, for me, they're just like really sick.

2200
02:56:53,414 --> 02:56:53,755
And again,

2201
02:56:55,478 --> 02:56:57,120
It's money and fear, right?

2202
02:56:58,001 --> 02:57:01,366
At a certain point, we have to say, how much is it going to cost to give you what you deserve?

2203
02:57:02,848 --> 02:57:08,936
If George is right and we're screwed, it doesn't change how much it's going to cost us to give you what you deserve.

2204
02:57:08,996 --> 02:57:12,300
It just means that we're not going to have as much money to do it, so we have to figure out how to raise that money.

2205
02:57:13,403 --> 02:57:15,204
maybe there is a bunch of money.

2206
02:57:15,224 --> 02:57:16,925
Maybe this free cash thing is a real thing.

2207
02:57:17,345 --> 02:57:23,308
And maybe, so maybe the money really is there, but there's fear to tell us what the situation is.

2208
02:57:24,309 --> 02:57:32,774
And then, and this is the part where I'm counseling Buzzkill, there's fear on the part of the mayor to say, okay, it's going to cost $5 million, right?

2209
02:57:32,874 --> 02:57:34,995
Like she's always talking about all these contracts.

2210
02:57:35,675 --> 02:57:36,876
We got to give everyone the same thing.

2211
02:57:37,456 --> 02:57:39,717
That's what equity looks like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2212
02:57:40,378 --> 02:57:42,419
Well, you're not getting what the teachers are getting, right?

2213
02:57:44,098 --> 02:57:57,248
And even in that contract, the lowest paid workers in the school system, the paraprofessionals, they figured out a way to make the job better and give them like a real market adjustment and pay significant, not 2%, like 20%, 25, 30% for the lowest paid workers.

2214
02:57:58,328 --> 02:58:00,530
So at the very least, let's use that as a model, right?

2215
02:58:01,331 --> 02:58:02,551
Let's say that's the baseline.

2216
02:58:02,672 --> 02:58:05,253
And for the lowest paid workers, can we give a real market rate adjustment?

2217
02:58:05,273 --> 02:58:07,555
Because I think we all know that 45, 50, 55,000 is not cutting it in Medford anymore.

2218
02:58:12,284 --> 02:58:15,828
But then the question is, right, like, okay, we really don't have the money right now.

2219
02:58:16,609 --> 02:58:20,894
Do we really think that the people of Medford wouldn't vote to raise money to pay the city workers fairly?

2220
02:58:21,115 --> 02:58:21,395
I don't.

2221
02:58:22,356 --> 02:58:24,318
And that's the fundamental question at the end of the day.

2222
02:58:25,019 --> 02:58:28,443
I hope we don't have to ask, but we have to be willing to ask.

2223
02:58:29,336 --> 02:58:30,617
That's just where I come down on it.

2224
02:58:30,677 --> 02:58:41,206
I know that maybe isn't the most popular thing to say all the time, but I cannot think of a better thing to fund with an override than giving you guys fair pay and benefits.

2225
02:58:41,226 --> 02:58:50,874
I don't think the solution, if we don't want to do that because we're afraid to ask, is to stonewall you and take away your longevity and take away your sick bank and take away whatever else.

2226
02:58:52,011 --> 02:58:54,293
you know, never going to get 100% agreement on anything.

2227
02:58:54,693 --> 02:59:00,878
But I think we're probably most reasonable people listening to say that the way these negotiations have been going is not fair.

2228
02:59:02,019 --> 02:59:04,542
And the answer here is, at the end of the day, it's a money question.

2229
02:59:04,562 --> 02:59:05,663
So how much is it going to cost?

2230
02:59:05,743 --> 02:59:06,743
And how are we going to pay for it?

2231
02:59:06,884 --> 02:59:10,407
And I just think if we could answer those, if the mayor could come up and answer those two questions?

2232
02:59:12,048 --> 02:59:14,790
Yeah, maybe it puts it back on the you know, I put it back on you, right?

2233
02:59:14,810 --> 02:59:15,551
I'm like, go on strike.

2234
02:59:16,604 --> 02:59:17,965
You know, that's really hard.

2235
02:59:18,646 --> 02:59:27,652
We can put it back on the voters too and say, hey, this is how much it costs to have fully staffed departments or at least better staffed departments where people get fair pay.

2236
02:59:28,653 --> 02:59:30,014
And that's kind of what I would like to see.

2237
02:59:30,054 --> 02:59:35,298
So maybe that's something we can squeeze out during this budget season is at least getting an answer, how much is it going to cost?

2238
02:59:35,818 --> 02:59:38,901
And then asking, why aren't we going to do the thing we need to do to pay for it?

2239
02:59:39,261 --> 02:59:41,983
So I hope we can get something.

2240
02:59:42,503 --> 02:59:43,784
But George said it at 6 p.m.

2241
02:59:45,719 --> 02:59:46,379
We're dejected.

2242
02:59:47,220 --> 02:59:55,822
I'm sure you're a million times more dejected than us, because you're here 40 hours a week and not 10 to 20 hours a week, and it's your family's pay on the line.

2243
02:59:56,562 --> 02:59:58,403
But we're dejected too, and it sucks.

2244
02:59:58,443 --> 03:00:02,184
So it's the worst kind of solidarity I can present, but I feel you.

2245
03:00:04,152 --> 03:00:04,672
Councilor Kerrio.

2246
03:00:05,272 --> 03:00:08,613
Thank you, Madam President.

2247
03:00:08,633 --> 03:00:13,994
You were in here earlier when we talked about our budget wishes and our budget problems.

2248
03:00:14,014 --> 03:00:25,856
But the ultimate bottom line is, if you don't get your raise this year, next year is going to be even worse because all these federal programs and all this federal money are all gone after the share.

2249
03:00:26,456 --> 03:00:30,137
So all the smoke and mirrors that you talk about are going to be gone.

2250
03:00:33,363 --> 03:00:40,797
You made a statement a little while ago about how you should be doing more important issues like planting flowers.

2251
03:00:42,812 --> 03:00:56,404
This is the reason our city hasn't gone anywhere, because the last three years, we were planting flowers and giving out cupcakes and cookies to people, instead of looking at Malden, Everett, Somerville, and look what they did during COVID and over the last three years.

2252
03:00:57,104 --> 03:00:59,827
What do we have to show for three years of work?

2253
03:01:00,267 --> 03:01:02,749
Nothing, nothing, okay?

2254
03:01:03,550 --> 03:01:09,375
And you ask me, say Rick goes down to and brings you stuff, you don't wanna know why?

2255
03:01:10,635 --> 03:01:14,238
I worked with my father in the family business forever.

2256
03:01:14,598 --> 03:01:16,439
My father was the biggest jerk to work for.

2257
03:01:18,281 --> 03:01:21,823
And my friends that worked with my dad, he was the biggest jerk to work for.

2258
03:01:22,123 --> 03:01:29,088
But one thing he told me, always take care of your workers, because they're the ones who make your job and make you look good.

2259
03:01:29,308 --> 03:01:31,690
Because without them, you have no business.

2260
03:01:32,611 --> 03:01:33,952
That's why I do what I do for you guys.

2261
03:01:36,093 --> 03:01:36,413
Thank you.

2262
03:01:36,453 --> 03:01:36,994
We appreciate it.

2263
03:01:38,698 --> 03:01:39,818
and the Celtics are winning, so.

2264
03:01:40,439 --> 03:01:40,719
Great.

2265
03:01:41,999 --> 03:01:42,379
Thank you both.

2266
03:01:42,459 --> 03:01:43,119
Is there anything?

2267
03:01:43,139 --> 03:01:58,664
I have nothing to add other than what's already been said, but I absolutely will take to heart and will do everything I can in my power as president to see that we can get you this in this budget, because you absolutely deserve it.

2268
03:01:58,865 --> 03:01:59,885
It goes without saying.

2269
03:02:00,025 --> 03:02:00,925
So thank you for being here.

2270
03:02:01,325 --> 03:02:01,665
Thank you.

2271
03:02:03,486 --> 03:02:03,966
Thank you.

2272
03:02:04,086 --> 03:02:04,426
Thank you.

2273
03:02:05,947 --> 03:02:06,327
Anyone else?

2274
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:13,581
Anyone else for public participation?

2275
03:02:19,425 --> 03:02:20,425
All right.

2276
03:02:20,946 --> 03:02:24,748
Seeing none, going, we like to do regular order of business.

2277
03:02:26,169 --> 03:02:32,173
On the motion of vice and bears for her to regular order of business seconded by Mr. Carbello, all those in favor.

2278
03:02:32,873 --> 03:02:34,595
All those opposed.

2279
03:02:34,635 --> 03:02:36,676
Where we are, we've been so all over the place.

2280
03:02:40,568 --> 03:02:41,448
Okay.

2281
03:02:42,189 --> 03:02:46,010
Hearings 23-097, legal notice, city clerk.

2282
03:02:46,130 --> 03:02:49,112
Motion to suspend the reading in favor of a short summary.

2283
03:02:50,012 --> 03:02:51,913
Motion, can you do that?

2284
03:02:52,153 --> 03:02:53,174
Sure.

2285
03:02:53,774 --> 03:02:54,454
Like it's your paper.

2286
03:02:55,334 --> 03:03:00,617
On the motion of vices and bears to suspend the reading in favor of a short summary, seconded by Councilor Svang.

2287
03:03:00,657 --> 03:03:01,357
All those in favor?

2288
03:03:01,417 --> 03:03:02,378
All those opposed?

2289
03:03:02,418 --> 03:03:04,138
Motion passes, vices and bears.

2290
03:03:04,178 --> 03:03:05,019
Thank you, Madam President.

2291
03:03:05,059 --> 03:03:10,161
This first proposed amendment would give the City Council the ability to employ staff and also advisory legal counsel.

2292
03:03:11,401 --> 03:03:14,922
this is a public hearing, so you'll have to follow the public hearing procedures in just a moment.

2293
03:03:15,762 --> 03:03:19,223
My suggestion for all of these, we've received some legal comments.

2294
03:03:19,323 --> 03:03:29,925
My suggestion is going to be that after you open the public hearing, we continue the public hearing to our next regular meeting on June 6th, which is what was recommended by Council.

2295
03:03:29,945 --> 03:03:31,866
I asked this question last week, thinking this might happen.

2296
03:03:33,346 --> 03:03:43,931
So continue the public hearing to the June 6th regular meeting and also incorporate the proposed language changes from legal counsel in advance of that meeting.

2297
03:03:44,451 --> 03:03:44,631
Thank you.

2298
03:03:44,651 --> 03:03:45,511
This is embarrassing.

2299
03:03:45,871 --> 03:03:46,632
I would also agree.

2300
03:03:46,652 --> 03:03:53,935
And just the fact that is, as this is a public hearing, and it's rather late in the night, I think it's a good idea on that grounds as well.

2301
03:03:54,055 --> 03:03:58,276
So any councilors like to speak before I open the public hearing?

2302
03:04:00,857 --> 03:04:01,097
hearing.

2303
03:04:01,157 --> 03:04:03,758
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper?

2304
03:04:06,039 --> 03:04:08,880
Do I go around like speaking favor as a member of the public?

2305
03:04:09,700 --> 03:04:10,581
I'm happy to.

2306
03:04:11,981 --> 03:04:12,241
We could.

2307
03:04:12,742 --> 03:04:13,442
Okay, it's open.

2308
03:04:13,482 --> 03:04:15,223
So we could do that next meeting.

2309
03:04:15,603 --> 03:04:15,843
Okay.

2310
03:04:16,143 --> 03:04:16,763
Yeah, sure.

2311
03:04:17,424 --> 03:04:18,064
Please.

2312
03:04:21,345 --> 03:04:23,506
Yeah, Matthew page Lieberman 15 Canal Street.

2313
03:04:24,635 --> 03:04:35,061
So I mean, I'm glad that this has been brought forward one of them, particularly about this council's ability to have many kind of role in the appointment of commission members.

2314
03:04:36,102 --> 03:04:45,047
I have been opposed to it since the beginning for reasons I do not want to get into now, but I have kind of changed my position on that.

2315
03:04:45,067 --> 03:04:49,610
I have a lot of experience from watching these commissions and the problems they have.

2316
03:04:50,630 --> 03:04:54,895
And I just want to submit my stuff written rather than going through it all.

2317
03:04:55,255 --> 03:04:58,238
And I just want to know if that would be possible over this week.

2318
03:04:58,278 --> 03:05:04,745
We don't generally do written testimony, and I just want to do that, and I want to know if I should just send it to Adam.

2319
03:05:05,298 --> 03:05:07,039
Yeah, we tend not to read it into the record.

2320
03:05:07,079 --> 03:05:10,662
I think just from a time perspective, but they absolutely are.

2321
03:05:10,842 --> 03:05:12,543
I can ask Adam to include them in the record.

2322
03:05:12,563 --> 03:05:15,165
So anything submitted written would then be included in the records as well.

2323
03:05:15,365 --> 03:05:20,248
Yeah, I just want to submit it and I don't want to go over all the stuff I know about these dysfunctional conditions.

2324
03:05:20,508 --> 03:05:20,728
Right.

2325
03:05:21,549 --> 03:05:21,889
Thank you.

2326
03:05:21,909 --> 03:05:22,630
Thank you.

2327
03:05:23,030 --> 03:05:25,732
Is there anyone else would like to speak in favor of the petition at this time?

2328
03:05:29,204 --> 03:05:32,349
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed, subject to reopening.

2329
03:05:33,351 --> 03:05:36,096
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition to the paper at this time?

2330
03:05:40,449 --> 03:05:43,871
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed and subject to reopening.

2331
03:05:44,051 --> 03:05:51,296
So we have a motion from Vice President Behrs for, I'm just making sure since we have three of these, this is 23-097.

2332
03:05:51,356 --> 03:05:54,979
To keep the public hearing open to a date certain in our next regular meeting.

2333
03:05:55,239 --> 03:06:01,483
Continue the public hearing to our next regular meeting and incorporate the suggested language changes from legal counsel.

2334
03:06:03,784 --> 03:06:04,465
Yeah, Mr. Clerk.

2335
03:06:10,255 --> 03:06:18,237
So the motion of vices and bears a second by councilor Carbinello, please call the roll.

2336
03:06:18,377 --> 03:06:18,597
Yes.

2337
03:06:19,598 --> 03:06:19,978
Yes.

2338
03:06:21,018 --> 03:06:21,618
Yes.

2339
03:06:22,679 --> 03:06:24,219
Yes.

2340
03:06:24,359 --> 03:06:24,579
Yes.

2341
03:06:24,779 --> 03:06:26,780
Six and the affirmative zero and the negative one absent.

2342
03:06:27,860 --> 03:06:29,561
Going to two, three to zero nine eight.

2343
03:06:30,661 --> 03:06:33,822
You'll notice the clerk's office notice of a public hearing Medford city council.

2344
03:06:35,075 --> 03:06:38,696
The Bedford City Council will hold a motion to suspend for a short summary.

2345
03:06:38,716 --> 03:06:44,257
Okay, on the motion of Vice President Behrs to suspend in favor of short summary of paper 23-098, seconded by Councilor Seng.

2346
03:06:44,317 --> 03:06:45,057
All those in favor?

2347
03:06:45,677 --> 03:06:46,257
All those opposed?

2348
03:06:46,317 --> 03:06:46,857
Motion passes.

2349
03:06:46,917 --> 03:06:48,137
Vice President Behrs.

2350
03:06:48,297 --> 03:06:49,137
Thank you, Madam President.

2351
03:06:49,177 --> 03:06:51,038
This is the second of the three charter amendments.

2352
03:06:51,078 --> 03:06:58,059
This would create by charter a specific process for the creation and approval of the municipal budget.

2353
03:06:58,239 --> 03:07:02,620
And I would again, after you open the public hearing, I would move to, I'll make the motion.

2354
03:07:02,960 --> 03:07:03,260
Thank you.

2355
03:07:04,531 --> 03:07:04,971
All right.

2356
03:07:05,952 --> 03:07:06,772
Public hearing is open.

2357
03:07:06,832 --> 03:07:09,653
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

2358
03:07:13,454 --> 03:07:18,076
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed, subject to reopening.

2359
03:07:19,436 --> 03:07:22,398
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this paper?

2360
03:07:25,579 --> 03:07:29,040
Seeing none, this portion of this public hearing is closed, subject to reopening.

2361
03:07:30,910 --> 03:07:31,190
motion.

2362
03:07:31,450 --> 03:07:32,191
Thank you, Madam President.

2363
03:07:32,211 --> 03:07:39,235
I would move to continue this public hearing to the June 6th regular meeting and incorporate the language changes suggested by legal counsel.

2364
03:07:40,015 --> 03:07:47,219
The motion of vice is embarrassed to continue this public hearing to the June 6th regular meeting and incorporate the suggestions by legal counsel, seconded by Councilor Carriello.

2365
03:07:47,940 --> 03:07:49,561
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

2366
03:07:49,601 --> 03:07:49,821
Yes.

2367
03:07:50,601 --> 03:07:50,841
Yes.

2368
03:07:51,302 --> 03:07:51,522
Yes.

2369
03:07:51,562 --> 03:07:51,662
Yes.

2370
03:07:59,270 --> 03:08:04,593
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

2371
03:08:04,613 --> 03:08:07,975
23-099, legal notice, city clerk's office notice of a public hearing, Medford City Council.

2372
03:08:08,955 --> 03:08:14,438
The Medford City Council will hold a public hearing in the Howard F. Alderman Memorial Chambers at Medford City Hall.

2373
03:08:14,458 --> 03:08:16,439
85, George P. Hassett, Your Honor.

2374
03:08:16,459 --> 03:08:19,321
Madam President, motion to suspend the reading in favor of a summary.

2375
03:08:19,381 --> 03:08:23,363
Motion of Vice President Behrs to suspend the reading in favor of a summary, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2376
03:08:23,443 --> 03:08:24,043
All those in favor?

2377
03:08:24,063 --> 03:08:25,104
All those opposed?

2378
03:08:25,164 --> 03:08:25,844
Motion passes.

2379
03:08:25,864 --> 03:08:26,705
Vice President Behrs.

2380
03:08:27,010 --> 03:08:28,131
Thank you, Madam President.

2381
03:08:28,571 --> 03:08:29,992
This is the third of the three amendments.

2382
03:08:30,012 --> 03:08:38,257
This is the one regarding changes to the charter regarding requiring council confirmation of appointees to the merit of municipal boards, committees, and commissions.

2383
03:08:39,197 --> 03:08:39,998
Thank you, Vice President Farris.

2384
03:08:41,059 --> 03:08:42,960
As this is a public hearing, we open the public hearing.

2385
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:46,242
Anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

2386
03:08:49,324 --> 03:08:49,844
Seeing none.

2387
03:08:49,864 --> 03:08:51,345
Oh, sorry.

2388
03:08:54,248 --> 03:08:57,531
So I just realized this is the one that I was referring to earlier.

2389
03:08:57,851 --> 03:08:59,652
As long as the same rules apply, that's perfect.

2390
03:08:59,732 --> 03:08:59,993
Yes.

2391
03:09:02,715 --> 03:09:09,080
Seeing no other people wanting to speak in favor, this portion of the public hearing is closed, subject to reopening.

2392
03:09:09,100 --> 03:09:11,021
Oops, sorry.

2393
03:09:11,061 --> 03:09:14,184
Mr. Garrity, is this in favor or opposition?

2394
03:09:14,224 --> 03:09:15,425
I didn't, I just caught your hand.

2395
03:09:15,445 --> 03:09:21,109
I would just like to add a point of information.

2396
03:09:22,757 --> 03:09:32,461
I hope that the listening audience is not confused by these amendments since the charter commission is also in the progress of setting up similar rules.

2397
03:09:33,321 --> 03:09:47,326
I would hope that there's some discussion as there will not be conflict between what the charter commission will be presenting to the council and what is being presented to this time so that we're not having dual competing amendments to the city charter.

2398
03:09:49,407 --> 03:09:50,307
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

2399
03:09:51,144 --> 03:09:51,985
Hi, Paul.

2400
03:09:52,305 --> 03:09:53,326
Thank you, Madam President.

2401
03:09:54,267 --> 03:10:00,512
We did get a letter of official comment from the Charter Study Committee saying they were taking no position on these, and we entered that into the record.

2402
03:10:00,532 --> 03:10:03,455
We're actually going through two completely different processes.

2403
03:10:03,515 --> 03:10:17,287
This is Chapter 43B, Section 10, which allows targeted amendments that don't affect the scope of terms, terms of office, length of terms of office, number of people on any

2404
03:10:18,528 --> 03:10:20,029
you know, school committee or City Council.

2405
03:10:20,349 --> 03:10:28,195
This only allows changes to essentially the powers of the various municipal bodies.

2406
03:10:29,816 --> 03:10:35,239
This process is again targeted and can occur this year quickly and would go into effect in January 2024.

2407
03:10:35,319 --> 03:10:39,042
The Charter Study Committee appointed by the mayor is looking at

2408
03:10:39,762 --> 03:10:55,116
making recommendations that would be proposed to the council that would need to be enacted by the legislature through special act, and that would not happen until 2026 or 2028, but any recommendation by the Charter Study Committee could overrule or change these charter amendments.

2409
03:10:56,557 --> 03:11:00,440
they could propose to change these after, if they were to pass, they could propose to change them.

2410
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:06,604
So we've been pretty clear in our, this is our fifth public meeting on the matter that these are two completely different processes.

2411
03:11:06,684 --> 03:11:12,108
And we were very intent on getting the direct input of the Charter Study Committee so as to avoid any confusion.

2412
03:11:13,889 --> 03:11:14,530
Thank you.

2413
03:11:14,670 --> 03:11:16,171
We're in a little interim space.

2414
03:11:16,231 --> 03:11:19,393
So going to opposition, is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this paper?

2415
03:11:22,432 --> 03:11:26,115
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed, subject to reopening.

2416
03:11:26,135 --> 03:11:28,997
Do I have the same motion?

2417
03:11:29,057 --> 03:11:37,344
Yes, motion to continue the public hearing to our June 6th regular meeting and to incorporate suggested language by legal counsel.

2418
03:11:37,484 --> 03:11:38,085
Second.

2419
03:11:38,305 --> 03:11:38,585
Thank you.

2420
03:11:38,605 --> 03:11:45,911
On the motion of Vice President Farris to continue the public hearing to our June 6th regular meeting and also incorporate the suggestions from legal counsel, seconded by Councilor Carvalho.

2421
03:11:45,951 --> 03:11:47,032
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2422
03:11:57,857 --> 03:12:16,307
Yes, six in the infirmary zero in the negative one absent the motion passes to three dash 286 legal notice the Medford notice of a public hearing the Medford City Council will hold a public hearing and the Howard F Alden chambers at Bedford City Hall at five George B has to drive Medford and via zoom on Tuesday, May 23 2023 at 7pm a link to be posted no later than Friday, May 19 2023 on a petition from Cheryl Horan.

2425
03:12:54,927 --> 03:13:00,350
I believe we have Mr. Began here turning vegan to give us a summary of the petition before us.

2426
03:13:00,756 --> 03:13:05,420
Yes, thank you, Madam President, Sean Began, Zero Governors of Medford, Massachusetts.

2427
03:13:05,500 --> 03:13:07,162
I'm here on behalf of Green Automotive, Inc.

2428
03:13:08,303 --> 03:13:10,025
Green Automotive, Inc.

2429
03:13:10,185 --> 03:13:17,051
is looking for a auto repair license to repair, essentially, their own stable vehicles.

2430
03:13:17,131 --> 03:13:22,857
They provide transportation services, non-emergency medical services.

2431
03:13:23,197 --> 03:13:25,399
They have contracts with social service agencies.

2432
03:13:26,520 --> 03:13:28,823
They bought this piece of property back in 2021.

2433
03:13:28,963 --> 03:13:29,844
It was an empty lot.

2434
03:13:33,794 --> 03:13:34,894
it's actually three empty lots.

2435
03:13:35,674 --> 03:13:40,115
They've significantly improved it with a new structure, 2,700 square foot structure.

2436
03:13:41,316 --> 03:13:50,798
They're basically 99% finished and complete and looking to open very shortly as soon as they get a utility pole put in and some electricity.

2437
03:13:51,558 --> 03:13:58,159
So we're looking for a license such that they can operate and repair their own vehicles.

2438
03:13:58,499 --> 03:13:58,779
Thank you.

2439
03:13:59,199 --> 03:13:59,459
Thank you.

2440
03:14:00,119 --> 03:14:02,280
Before I open the public hearing, are there any questions from councillors?

2441
03:14:03,885 --> 03:14:09,207
I don't know if you want to wait a bit for Councilor Carvillo to come back.

2442
03:14:09,928 --> 03:14:10,048
Okay.

2443
03:14:11,048 --> 03:14:11,228
Great.

2444
03:14:11,268 --> 03:14:13,909
As this is a public hearing, I'll open up the first part of the public hearing.

2445
03:14:13,929 --> 03:14:16,911
Are there any member, any people who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

2446
03:14:16,931 --> 03:14:19,091
You would be one.

2447
03:14:19,812 --> 03:14:21,212
I mean, Attorney Beebe, you would be one.

2448
03:14:21,572 --> 03:14:22,133
Just saying.

2449
03:14:22,293 --> 03:14:23,953
You're in favor.

2450
03:14:24,314 --> 03:14:24,534
Thank you.

2451
03:14:24,554 --> 03:14:27,655
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

2452
03:14:28,796 --> 03:14:30,096
Cheryl Horan may be on.

2453
03:14:30,136 --> 03:14:30,976
She is on.

2454
03:14:31,317 --> 03:14:32,097
I don't know if she's,

2455
03:14:33,179 --> 03:14:33,799
still there.

2456
03:14:33,819 --> 03:14:35,200
I can ask her to unmute.

2457
03:14:35,681 --> 03:14:40,003
I know, I was just going to say.

2458
03:14:40,964 --> 03:14:41,684
Cheryl, are you?

2459
03:14:43,265 --> 03:14:43,826
There I am.

2460
03:14:44,566 --> 03:14:45,307
Have a good evening.

2461
03:14:46,527 --> 03:14:54,552
Yeah, so my name is Cheryl Horn, and I'm vice president of Green Automotive, and we are a transportation company.

2462
03:14:54,672 --> 03:14:58,495
We were displaced by the Assembly Road Project in Somerville,

2463
03:14:59,134 --> 03:15:04,215
and then consequently displaced by the Green Line extension, which brought us to Medford.

2464
03:15:04,555 --> 03:15:10,896
So now we're here and again, what Sean had said, we do social service contracts.

2465
03:15:11,076 --> 03:15:18,758
We provide non-emergency medical transportation to some of the most vulnerable populations of Cambridge, Somerville, Medford.

2466
03:15:19,438 --> 03:15:23,999
And this would be a license to repair the vehicles that we have in our fleet.

2467
03:15:25,559 --> 03:15:25,860
Thank you.

2468
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:26,980
And you're in favor of the petition?

2469
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:27,080
I am.

2470
03:15:29,168 --> 03:15:30,709
Great, thank you.

2471
03:15:30,930 --> 03:15:32,271
Anyone else would like to speak in favor?

2472
03:15:32,391 --> 03:15:33,832
Mr. Castagnetti, I see your hand up.

2473
03:15:33,872 --> 03:15:35,914
Would you like to speak in favor of this petition?

2474
03:15:37,996 --> 03:15:40,478
Yes, thank you, Mrs. President.

2475
03:15:41,539 --> 03:15:45,423
I am in favor of this petition, and I wish Russ Rossi best of luck.

2476
03:15:45,863 --> 03:15:46,243
Thank you.

2477
03:15:47,144 --> 03:15:47,485
Thank you.

2478
03:15:48,145 --> 03:15:50,687
Anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

2479
03:15:53,737 --> 03:15:56,299
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

2480
03:15:56,339 --> 03:15:59,222
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this petition?

2481
03:16:03,645 --> 03:16:08,509
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

2482
03:16:08,589 --> 03:16:09,510
Any discussion from the council?

2483
03:16:09,530 --> 03:16:10,511
Councilor Carviello.

2484
03:16:10,531 --> 03:16:11,552
Thank you, Madam President.

2485
03:16:14,254 --> 03:16:16,876
Mrs. Herman asked for an auto repair license.

2486
03:16:16,896 --> 03:16:19,718
This is an auto body and repair.

2487
03:16:20,479 --> 03:16:21,059
We're doing both.

2488
03:16:22,165 --> 03:16:24,268
I believe they just need an auto repair license.

2489
03:16:24,328 --> 03:16:25,770
It's under the same.

2490
03:16:25,790 --> 03:16:28,454
It comes under the same grouping.

2491
03:16:28,514 --> 03:16:30,417
It's one application.

2492
03:16:31,659 --> 03:16:33,362
So there will be no body shop in there?

2493
03:16:34,103 --> 03:16:36,686
As far as I'm concerned, there will not be a body shop.

2494
03:16:43,723 --> 03:16:47,545
Thank you for being here tonight.

2495
03:16:48,205 --> 03:17:01,191
I just want you to know for one counselor, whenever you're standing in front of us, there's a sense of legitimacy and honor when you're here so I appreciate when you're representing any client so appreciate that.

2496
03:17:02,668 --> 03:17:07,757
Yeah, and I but again, I think that my hobby is watching City Council so it really doesn't matter.

2497
03:17:07,797 --> 03:17:08,298
Sorry about that.

2498
03:17:15,375 --> 03:17:17,796
So I, you know, you've been here, you were here.

2499
03:17:17,816 --> 03:17:21,438
I mean, our biggest issues is making sure that we make the right decisions legally.

2500
03:17:22,659 --> 03:17:33,945
And I think that understanding that this process and what it's intended for is what, you know, getting phone calls from people asking, you know, what is this for another auto body place?

2501
03:17:33,985 --> 03:17:37,767
And I think that having that clarity, just making that part of the record, if we could,

2502
03:17:38,387 --> 03:17:57,291
that this would be only an auto repair, and the license will stay with, it won't carry on to any, the new owner, that'll be identified just for this owner, and that if it's, she moves on, that the permit would die with that.

2503
03:17:57,611 --> 03:18:02,352
So if that's legal, I can't believe I'm gonna ask your opinion as a legal.

2504
03:18:03,452 --> 03:18:05,534
But I don't want to hold anything up.

2505
03:18:05,574 --> 03:18:08,436
The license states with the petitioner, not with the property.

2506
03:18:08,516 --> 03:18:08,997
Right, okay.

2507
03:18:09,017 --> 03:18:09,998
So we want to make sure with that.

2508
03:18:10,018 --> 03:18:19,705
And then I know that the fire chief did put down that, this is a confusion piece, the legal piece that I have, no obvious violations observed.

2509
03:18:20,446 --> 03:18:25,830
But then he leaves a note, this is not ready for final inspection yet, 424.

2510
03:18:28,317 --> 03:18:29,518
Do you know what that is?

2511
03:18:29,878 --> 03:18:30,459
I do.

2512
03:18:30,879 --> 03:18:33,160
Cheryl had raised her hand so I don't know if you want to address any of it.

2513
03:18:33,841 --> 03:18:39,485
The two questions maybe about the auto body, the body, or as well as the not ready for final inspection yet.

2514
03:18:41,146 --> 03:18:42,928
Sure, so can you hear me, you can hear me now.

2515
03:18:43,428 --> 03:18:45,589
Um, so there will not be any auto body.

2516
03:18:48,544 --> 03:18:50,486
you know, taking place any service like that.

2517
03:18:50,546 --> 03:18:53,387
It's just it's completely automotive repair.

2518
03:18:54,268 --> 03:19:09,978
And with regards to the inspection, the only reason why we're not ready for the inspection yet is because we're waiting for a transformer from National Grid, which has been the most outrageous procedure that we've ever had to go through.

2519
03:19:11,619 --> 03:19:13,059
We petitioned in October and

2520
03:19:14,385 --> 03:19:18,728
They still don't have a transformer for us, but they've told us that it will be in next week.

2521
03:19:18,868 --> 03:19:27,653
So, you know, hopefully we'll be able to get all the final inspections at that point, because we can't do anything final until they can power everything up.

2522
03:19:27,773 --> 03:19:30,335
But everything is, like Sean said, 99% complete.

2523
03:19:33,350 --> 03:19:35,972
Okay, so I know that I appreciate that for the information.

2524
03:19:35,992 --> 03:19:36,473
That was great.

2525
03:19:36,513 --> 03:19:40,996
But I have been getting phone calls from representatives of National Grid.

2526
03:19:41,497 --> 03:19:46,180
And I guess there's some sort of is the city engineer on online?

2527
03:19:49,203 --> 03:19:55,148
Okay, so I know there was there was concerns about, you know, the National Grid

2528
03:19:56,433 --> 03:20:05,619
what they're putting in for service and approval isn't what's to the acceptance of our new engineer.

2529
03:20:06,460 --> 03:20:08,821
And I don't know if they're falling into that.

2530
03:20:08,881 --> 03:20:10,822
So that's a question I was gonna ask.

2531
03:20:10,842 --> 03:20:14,825
I think they're scheduled, I think Cheryl can correct me, but I think they are scheduled to go out there now.

2532
03:20:14,925 --> 03:20:19,028
So I- So, because it hasn't been, it hasn't been in front of us, right?

2533
03:20:20,389 --> 03:20:21,529
Right, so they haven't come to us.

2534
03:20:21,890 --> 03:20:22,110
Yeah.

2535
03:20:22,530 --> 03:20:23,471
So that's,

2536
03:20:26,718 --> 03:20:29,882
If you can, I know I don't have an update.

2537
03:20:29,962 --> 03:20:35,608
I don't have any update based on what anything else that I told you.

2538
03:20:35,848 --> 03:20:36,449
Yeah, right.

2539
03:20:36,469 --> 03:20:37,130
So it's not coming.

2540
03:20:37,590 --> 03:20:38,831
It'd have to come in front of his body.

2541
03:20:38,931 --> 03:20:41,374
I have no, I have no further updates on that one because.

2542
03:20:42,290 --> 03:20:44,871
That's why I just, thank you.

2543
03:20:46,671 --> 03:20:57,614
Mr. Clerk, I didn't wanna put you in the spot, but I hate that we're holding businesses up, not just this one, but with national grid that maybe, I mean, it's not gonna help sway me in any way.

2544
03:20:57,634 --> 03:20:58,454
I'm gonna see everything.

2545
03:20:58,534 --> 03:21:09,156
So I would move forward approval as stated with those pieces in writing that making sure that it's just a auto mechanic shop.

2546
03:21:09,416 --> 03:21:11,397
And obviously the,

2547
03:21:12,918 --> 03:21:19,562
that the permit stays with, that disappears with the... With the petitioner.

2548
03:21:19,602 --> 03:21:21,204
Thank you so much, Mr. Beaton.

2549
03:21:21,384 --> 03:21:32,392
So we have a motion from Councillor Scarpelli to approve with the conditions that it is auto repair only and the license, the permit stays with the petitioner.

2550
03:21:32,792 --> 03:21:33,833
Councillor Kerrio.

2551
03:21:33,853 --> 03:21:39,377
Madam President, if I can make a comment, and this is no disrespect to you or your clients.

2552
03:21:39,597 --> 03:21:40,178
Sure.

2553
03:21:40,238 --> 03:21:41,339
Mrs. Horan made a comment.

2554
03:21:43,641 --> 03:21:55,521
The reason for coming to Medford is because she was at Assembly Square and they got pushed out for much better developments, probably getting 10 times the amount of taxes that Mr. Horan was paying.

2555
03:21:56,162 --> 03:21:57,104
And we come over to Medford.

2556
03:21:58,027 --> 03:22:00,268
and we're going to get nothing.

2557
03:22:00,548 --> 03:22:02,549
We're going to get a small return on taxes.

2558
03:22:02,790 --> 03:22:07,332
So I hope on Thursday we're having a meeting to discuss this is what's happening.

2559
03:22:07,692 --> 03:22:13,655
People are getting pushed out of Somerville, a business like this buys a nice piece of land that we should be getting.

2560
03:22:13,935 --> 03:22:22,600
It should have been something a lot better than this and no disrespect to your client, but Somerville gets 10 times the tax revenue and what do we get?

2561
03:22:24,381 --> 03:22:24,841
free lots.

2562
03:22:29,003 --> 03:22:33,305
We get a garage, paying minimal commercial taxes.

2563
03:22:33,365 --> 03:22:39,588
So I hope on Thursday when we have our meeting, the people come, this is what I'm trying to drill home.

2564
03:22:40,308 --> 03:22:40,628
Thank you.

2565
03:22:40,989 --> 03:22:41,229
Thank you.

2566
03:22:42,049 --> 03:22:43,730
If I may, Madam President, I would also just note that

2567
03:22:45,056 --> 03:22:53,083
They may be in the same situation in a few years here in Medford, that area is prime location and is in our comprehensive plan.

2568
03:22:53,103 --> 03:23:01,029
No, I'm just saying our comprehensive plan, if suddenly that lands worth four or five, six times what they paid and invested into it, they may be moving yet again.

2569
03:23:01,149 --> 03:23:03,572
So just wanna put that out there.

2570
03:23:04,652 --> 03:23:09,717
So we have the motion from Councilor Scarpelli as seconded by Councilor Collins.

2571
03:23:09,757 --> 03:23:13,180
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll with those conditions.

2572
03:23:18,832 --> 03:23:20,133
So two resolutions.

2573
03:23:20,833 --> 03:23:24,575
Oh, sorry, I'm ready for your roll call.

2574
03:23:24,615 --> 03:23:26,236
So yeah, if you want to call it all.

2575
03:23:26,776 --> 03:23:26,856
Yes.

2576
03:23:46,057 --> 03:23:49,600
Uh, uh, 60 in front of zero, the negative one absent motion passes.

2577
03:23:49,900 --> 03:23:50,601
Thank you everyone.

2578
03:23:50,641 --> 03:23:51,781
