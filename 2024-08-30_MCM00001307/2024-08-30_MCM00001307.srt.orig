1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:04,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're going to open the meeting regular, then we're going to go into executive session.

2
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:09,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need a. I'll do the roll call.

3
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:12,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be on any 2nd.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need to read the.

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:19,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Agenda yeah, let me do that.

6
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,107
[SPEAKER_06]: That would actually be helpful to go to.

7
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Too many agendas.

8
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:45,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Pursuant to general law chapter 30A, section 21A3 to discuss tragedy relating to pending litigation known as Rifa et al.

9
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: versus Caldera ZBA et al., Massachusetts Land Court, case number 23 MISC 000657JSVR,

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,633
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair clears that discussing the matter in an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the litigating session of the board.

11
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:06,616
[SPEAKER_06]: A vote regarding whether to go in an executive session is expected and votes may occur during the executive session.

12
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll do a roll call for members.

13
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Caldera.

14
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:23,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we get to the roll call, Mike just needs to go on the record and say that it is his declaration that discussing this in open session would have a

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,741
[SPEAKER_14]: detrimental effect on the litigating position of the board.

16
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,822
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't even taken a roll call.

17
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:30,363
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not.

18
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:32,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

19
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,665
[SPEAKER_14]: I got kicked off and kicked back in and I thought you were voting on the actual, my apologies.

20
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:37,386
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.

21
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:40,367
[SPEAKER_14]: My computer kicked me off and kicked me back in.

22
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:41,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

23
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:44,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to defer the chair to you for this as well?

24
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, I see no need.

25
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

26
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:51,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so roll call, uh, Mike Caldera.

27
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Turani?

29
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

30
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris D'Avetta?

31
00:01:58,846 --> 00:01:59,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That is him here.

32
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:02,090
[SPEAKER_06]: He is on, but he may still be.

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

34
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:05,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chris.

35
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:06,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie Thompson, present.

36
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we need a motion for executive session or do we just go into executive session?

37
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:21,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so now that you're the chair, you would be the 1 and makes the declaration.

38
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe correct.

39
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:22,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Robin.

40
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:29,335
[SPEAKER_14]: So, 1st, Jamie, as the chair will make a declaration that the board is going to go into executive session.

41
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:49,281
[SPEAKER_14]: pursuant to General Law Chapter 30A, Section 21A3, to discuss the case of REFA versus the Zoning Board of Appeals, which is Land Court Number 23, MISC 00657, because Jamie, as the chair, has declared that discussing the matter in open session will have a detrimental effect on the litigating position of the board.

42
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,082
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you'd like, Jamie, you can say, I agree.

43
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that is my declaration.

44
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:55,083
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the purpose of the executive session.

45
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

46
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:59,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is the purpose of the executive session for tonight.

47
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay and then you can entertain a motion and somebody can just say so moved.

48
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:09,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to enter executive session.

49
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,921
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you just need a roll call vote.

50
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it need a second though?

51
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, you need a second.

52
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:18,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

53
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:20,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Jim.

54
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:21,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Caldera?

55
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:22,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

56
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:25,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Tarani?

57
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:26,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

58
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:27,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris D'Avetta?

59
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:28,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

60
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:30,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie Thompson.

61
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,494
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

62
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:42,536
[SPEAKER_14]: So, oh, and before we go in, just to announce that the board is not coming back, you're having a separate meeting after this, correct?

63
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:43,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

64
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:51,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so the board will not come back to the open session after the executive session, you're going to convene a wholly separate meeting and continue on tonight, but in a different meeting.

65
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,318
[SPEAKER_14]: So technically not coming back to this.

66
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:58,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically, it's the same zoom meeting, we're just gonna

67
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,484
[SPEAKER_06]: reopen the new meeting at 6.30.

68
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:03,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so it's a different agenda.

69
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Same zoom for anybody that's watching.

70
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:06,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

71
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:07,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.

72
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:08,647
[SPEAKER_14]: So the board will be back on the zoom at 6.30.

73
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:10,308
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's technically a different meeting.

74
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:13,769
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that works for anybody watching.

75
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we taking any of these out of order?

76
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:19,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we just going to order?

77
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:21,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're all fine.

78
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:22,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 86 will be quick.

79
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:26,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Recording in progress.

80
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:27,275
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

81
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone, apologies for the delay.

82
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:50,675
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an executive session that we needed to finish up for some other event or related matters, but we're starting now, so we can get started.

83
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I think since this is a new meeting, we should probably do a roll call again.

84
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, correct.

85
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

86
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,760
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the August 29th session of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

87
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

88
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:04,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Caldera?

89
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:05,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

90
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim trying president Christie about a president and Jamie Thompson.

91
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:20,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis if we could start with the first case.

92
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:25,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure 86 upstreet case number a dash 2024 to 17 continued from July 2520 24.

93
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:40,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant and owner, Amy and Andrew Weber, to install an addition to 86 Suffolk Street within the front yard setback on Suffolk Street and the rear yard setback, which is not allowed per the City of Memphis Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

94
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And do we have a representative for the applicant?

95
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:48,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Amy and Andrew Weber here.

96
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:49,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

97
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:51,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Amy and Andrew.

98
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:52,974
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to go ahead.

99
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, absolutely.

100
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having us back again.

101
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,793
[SPEAKER_09]: We, I don't think I can share.

102
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:05,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll hold on a second.

103
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:14,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to have someone else, Dennis, I believe we emailed the updated file or happy to share it.

104
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Co-House, perfect.

105
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,045
[SPEAKER_06]: You can share right now.

106
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:22,768
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so here is the updated correct plot plan.

107
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:32,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And so as we talked about last month, we're looking to put an addition onto the existing dwelling.

108
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:38,961
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a one floor addition that we're looking to do with a very small proposed open porch just on the corner.

109
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:42,704
[SPEAKER_09]: And so where we're looking and asking for the,

110
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,156
[SPEAKER_09]: The variance is along the proposed addition, our rear setback here.

111
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:54,380
[SPEAKER_09]: We're extending a existing nonconformity.

112
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not making it any worse.

113
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:01,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically 9.3 feet, so the difference of 0.7 feet there.

114
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:06,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the confusion was last time, apologies again for submitting the wrong forms.

115
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:12,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Initially, we had a slightly bigger jet out here, but we've reduced the size of the project.

116
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:17,675
[SPEAKER_09]: So the setback here initially looked like it was going to be under the 15 feet limit.

117
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:24,896
[SPEAKER_09]: But as you can see here now, it's actually 20.3 is the closest that we'll get to Suffolk Street on the front setback.

118
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:34,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully that should satisfy the requirements and mean that we're only asking for the rear setback here.

119
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:38,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions about that?

120
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:42,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much for the explanation.

121
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Board, anybody have any questions for the applicant?

122
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I don't have any questions there.

123
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have, Mike, go ahead.

124
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:14,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we may have discussed this in the last meeting, but I just want to make sure I'm understanding the case correctly.

125
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:28,962
[SPEAKER_15]: So the hardship here is that the lot is unusual in shape, and given the position of your existing house, it limits the

126
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,902
[SPEAKER_15]: the different places where you even could do an extension.

127
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,685
[SPEAKER_15]: So you need the relief for that reason.

128
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:45,470
[SPEAKER_15]: The natural way to extend is, I guess, down the way the plan is oriented.

129
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:48,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that's why you need that, right?

130
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, exactly.

131
00:08:50,456 --> 00:09:03,567
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a very unique shaped lot in that we have two front yard setbacks on either side, Suffolk Street here and then Wyman up at the top here of how the page is oriented.

132
00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:14,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this also over here is really the only green open space that we have where our kids play outside.

133
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,216
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a swing set there.

134
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,697
[SPEAKER_09]: We have family time out there.

135
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So that limits where we can really put the addition on.

136
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:29,747
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the natural place is to come along here and again, extend the existing nonconformity, but not make it any worse.

137
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:31,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

138
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:35,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mike.

139
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Building pressure.

140
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:51,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dennis can you clarify the agenda isn't there, this is a special permit or a variance if it's a special permits in the hardship standard would not apply.

141
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:56,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to clarify that.

142
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:03,830
[SPEAKER_06]: On mute.

143
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was just a special permit.

144
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:06,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm just trying to.

145
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:12,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's substantially not more detrimental though currently exists more so than a specific hardship requirement.

146
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an extension existing nonconforming.

147
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:21,819
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's because the side yards already existing nonconforming?

148
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:22,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

149
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

150
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, technically that's the back, the back, the rear setback there, because that's the front that we use and the front door is here on Suffolk.

151
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a classic example of an extension of a pre-existing non-conforming.

152
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:41,263
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already non-conforming and they're not making it any more non-conforming.

153
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:43,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just extending the line down further.

154
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:45,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

155
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:45,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

156
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,185
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's intensifying because it's going from 15.3 to 9.3 or 9.3 inches.

157
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:49,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

158
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,606
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's 9.3 the whole way.

159
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:53,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that 15.3 is to where area is being raised.

160
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,233
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

161
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:07,315
[SPEAKER_11]: That 15.3 is misleading.

162
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:08,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:10,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

164
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:23,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Commissioner.

165
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the board or from the city?

166
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any public comment?

167
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,500
[SPEAKER_04]: For public comment, just raise your hand on Zoom.

168
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:48,123
[SPEAKER_04]: You can email Dennis at dmcdougall at Medford.

169
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to get your email address memorized, Dennis.

170
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It is in the chat, but it's D McDougal with two L's at medford-ma.gov.

171
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:07,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't we just short your email to DMACC?

172
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:14,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we could, as long as Dennis McDonald gets DMICC.

173
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:18,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be, that would make our lives probably either easier or more confusing.

174
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure which.

175
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any hands raised on Zoom.

176
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:26,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any,

177
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:33,296
[SPEAKER_04]: The one in the video, Dennis, do you have any email or did we receive any other public comment prior to the meeting?

178
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,681
[SPEAKER_06]: No emails and no prior public comment.

179
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:44,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

180
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:47,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

181
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:49,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.

182
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:49,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim?

183
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:50,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim?

184
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:54,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

185
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:55,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike?

186
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:56,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

187
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris.

188
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:06,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie I. So, we are in deliberation any discussion from the board on the site.

189
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:18,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, understanding what the correction that the commissioner pointed out, this would be a special permit, not a variance.

190
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:28,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike?

191
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:32,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it seems like a really nice project.

192
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:35,757
[SPEAKER_15]: It's extending an existing non-conformity.

193
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:38,661
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not making it any

194
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:46,525
[SPEAKER_15]: bigger, it's not encroaching on the neighboring property anymore.

195
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:49,928
[SPEAKER_15]: So it seems like a pretty modest change.

196
00:13:50,109 --> 00:14:02,201
[SPEAKER_15]: And while it's not necessary to demonstrate it for the sake of a special permit here, it clearly is an unusual shaped lot.

197
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:10,696
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm not really seeing good alternatives to extending in this direction.

198
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:16,118
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, from my perspective, I'm not seeing a detriment to the public good.

199
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:19,119
[SPEAKER_15]: If we were to allow this, it seems like a nice project.

200
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.

201
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other discussion from the board?

202
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,289
[SPEAKER_05]: My feelings are the same as well.

203
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,930
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

204
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jim.

205
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair awaits a motion.

206
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:53,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I will motion to approve the special permit for 86 Suffolk Street.

207
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second that.

208
00:14:59,256 --> 00:14:59,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, gentlemen.

209
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:00,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

210
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris D'Avena.

211
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:02,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

212
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Torani?

213
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

214
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:07,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Caldara?

215
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:07,834
Aye.

216
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie Thompson?

217
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:09,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

218
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:14,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everybody, appreciate you did the additional work you did on this.

219
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a special permit.

220
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:19,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you very much.

221
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

222
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:21,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Very quickly.

223
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:31,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sorry, I talked over you just the I'll get you the decision shortly.

224
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:35,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping to have it pre written in case this has happened, but I just couldn't get it done.

225
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:37,778
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll try and get it to you sometime.

226
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty straightforward one.

227
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:46,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably next week, hopefully fingers crossed, you know, I and then once you get the permanent hand, then there's a 20 days appeals period.

228
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:55,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once that is done, you know, well, sort of walk through the process, but involves going to the city clerk's office and registry and then you can get your

229
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Permit, sorry.

230
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:04,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Minor corrections, not once they get the permit in hand, it's once they get the decision, then it goes to the 21 day.

231
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:11,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't issue a permit until after the decision has gone through its 21 day appeal period and has been recorded at the registry.

232
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you bring a copy of that to us.

233
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:17,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're 30 days out from me being able to issue a permit.

234
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that you can't submit the paperwork.

235
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I simply can't issue it for about 30 days.

236
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:23,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

237
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:25,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was pretty much my question.

238
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:33,361
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like we wait for this appeals period and then take the special permit to the clerk and the registry of deeds or those.

239
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:51,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk will give you, clerk will give you a notice that 21 day appeal period has expired and you can take your copy as well as that to the registry, the Middlesex, South Middlesex, they will stamp it and then that's the proof we have that it's been approved by law.

240
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,501
[SPEAKER_02]: you bring us a copy of that.

241
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:55,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

242
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

243
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:56,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

244
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:58,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

245
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:01,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, commissioner.

246
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:08,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, can we move on to the next case?

247
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

248
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:12,343
[SPEAKER_06]: 13 Marion Street, case number 8-2024-19.

249
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:27,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant and owner, Anna Ramos, wishes to convert an existing single-family dwelling to a two-family dwelling at 13 Marion Street, which is an allowed use with insufficient lot width per the City of Medford zoning ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

250
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:32,575
[SPEAKER_16]: And do we have a representative from the applicant?

251
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:33,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

252
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dennis.

253
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:41,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Members of the Board, my name is Attorney Michael Cabral, representing Anna Ramos, owner of 13 Marion Street, Medford.

254
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:45,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

255
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:48,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Attorney Cabrera, go ahead.

256
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:48,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

257
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:50,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

258
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Ramos currently resides at the house.

259
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,183
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a single family house.

260
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:58,928
[SPEAKER_16]: She is looking to convert the single family into a two family house.

261
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:03,053
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a GR district where two families are allowed as of right.

262
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:04,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

263
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:18,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Ramos meets all the zoning criteria to convert this for setbacks in lot area with one exception, that being lot width, as the board knows, in the GR district for two families, 60 feet.

264
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,212
[SPEAKER_16]: of lot width is required.

265
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:21,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

266
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:23,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Ramos is short by five feet.

267
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:32,214
[SPEAKER_16]: She has 55 feet of lot width here, which is the reason we're before the board this evening for that single issue of lot width.

268
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:40,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, she has over 7,000 square feet of lot area where only 6,000 are required.

269
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:43,756
[SPEAKER_16]: She's keeping the structure at two and a half stories.

270
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:47,037
[SPEAKER_16]: And even with the addition to the house,

271
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:50,495
[SPEAKER_16]: the law coverage will be under the 35% max coverage at 24.9%.

272
00:18:56,727 --> 00:19:00,669
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've made a request to the board for alternative relief.

273
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:14,316
[SPEAKER_16]: One, being a special permit with the finding that it's not more substantially detrimental because it is actually a pre-existing non-conforming structure and that the front corner of the house does encroach into the side yard setback.

274
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:22,220
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the addition that's being proposed, none of that addition would encroach into the setback.

275
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,661
[SPEAKER_16]: It would actually meet all the legal setbacks

276
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,463
[SPEAKER_16]: on that side of the property.

277
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:33,809
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in the alternative, if the board believes we need a variance, we've made an argument for a variance as well.

278
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,475
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy to share my screen if the board wishes to look at the site plan.

279
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie.

280
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:45,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike has a question.

281
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:46,359
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a question.

282
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Attorney Cabral, you partly answered it, I think.

283
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,425
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if I've seen the argument

284
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:57,630
[SPEAKER_15]: for the variance, I'll double check my notes.

285
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,291
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, my question was precisely about that.

286
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:10,994
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I was reading submission prior to our hearing, as I understood it, you were requesting the special permit.

287
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:15,816
[SPEAKER_15]: My reading of the Medford zoning ordinance is that

288
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:33,127
[SPEAKER_15]: here because the existing non-conforming structure is a different use that's not triggering the need for lot width constraint.

289
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:38,690
[SPEAKER_15]: And by switching the use, it's actually a new non-conformity for lot width.

290
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:45,213
[SPEAKER_15]: So for that reason, I believe the board needs to apply the variance standard

291
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:49,007
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to clarify with you up front.

292
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:50,869
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like you're making both arguments.

293
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,131
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe, Jamie, you can weigh in on that.

294
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:57,794
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just wanted to make sure before we got too deep, we had clarity on what the standard we're applying is.

295
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.

296
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:08,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Senior Planner Evans has... Good evening, Daniel Evans, Senior Planner.

297
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:12,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we had a lot of discussions when this first came in, Scott and I.

298
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:18,340
[SPEAKER_10]: You're exactly right, Member Caldera.

299
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because it's currently conforming for lot width, because lot width for a single family is only 50 feet.

300
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:35,323
[SPEAKER_10]: But once you change the use to a two-family, which is a use that's by right, but however, the lot width required for two-family is 60 feet.

301
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:37,823
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's creating a new nonconformity.

302
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,444
[SPEAKER_10]: So our stance, at least my stance, is that

303
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, it requires a variance.

304
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:46,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I studied it every which way.

305
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:53,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I don't want to have to send you to the board, but I believe it's a variance.

306
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:57,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will say that I would recommend approval of it.

307
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:03,459
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that we're looking at with the zoning overhaul is kind of

308
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,830
[SPEAKER_10]: changing some of these things.

309
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:10,852
[SPEAKER_10]: For us, I don't think it makes any sense to have a different lot with standard for a single and a two.

310
00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:17,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this is on my list as something that needs to be cleaned up because it just becomes, you know, busy work.

311
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:19,675
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a by right use.

312
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:26,177
[SPEAKER_10]: But for this one standard that for some reason, when the ordinance was written,

313
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:33,578
[SPEAKER_10]: They thought it should have another 10 feet of width and I'm not really sure what the reason is for that, but that's what it is.

314
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:40,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, we're in favor of, you know, adding additional unit here.

315
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And granting the variance.

316
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:50,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Daniel.

317
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:51,742
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are in agreement.

318
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:53,322
[SPEAKER_04]: We are reviewing this as a variance.

319
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:57,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That was also on my list.

320
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for bringing that up, Mike.

321
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:12,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Attorney Cabral, if you wanted to review the plans, just so we can, again, we are just focusing on the five feet requirement for variance.

322
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Can everyone see that?

323
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:26,922
[SPEAKER_16]: We can.

324
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:30,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I'm starting down at Marion Street here.

325
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,884
[SPEAKER_16]: We meet the adequate frontage here.

326
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:34,624
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 55 feet.

327
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:38,426
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the existing structure here.

328
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:40,966
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the existing drive aisle.

329
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:45,668
[SPEAKER_16]: The existing drive goes all the way back to an existing, this is a two-car garage here.

330
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:56,251
[SPEAKER_16]: This would be the proposed addition to the house, which includes a two-car garage in this area here.

331
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:07,336
[SPEAKER_16]: So really the only living space is roughly around this area here with a small portion over the garage.

332
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:11,822
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a non-conforming structure as well as you see here in the corner.

333
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:17,383
[SPEAKER_16]: The side yard setback I believe that's 4.3 feet, where seven and a half is required.

334
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:23,606
[SPEAKER_16]: As we go back the closest the new structure gets to this side yard here is eight feet.

335
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:29,349
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the church over here on this side they've actually given a letter of support for the project.

336
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:43,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Also note here that the closest the new structure to the side yard over here is 27 and a half feet, just more than 27 and a half feet on this side.

337
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:49,118
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, a lot with being short by five feet.

338
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:56,125
[SPEAKER_16]: If I zoom out here to confirm, I might be missing it on here.

339
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,896
[SPEAKER_16]: But the lot area is 7,100 and change square feet.

340
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,879
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, here it is right here.

341
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:05,619
[SPEAKER_16]: 7,134 square feet.

342
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:29,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I answer and again so parking spaces existing car garage here parking spaces here, and there'd be a new two car garage here as well for two existing off street parking spaces total for off street parking spaces here, which, again I know being a two family neighborhood.

343
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,306
[SPEAKER_16]: always concerns about on-street parking.

344
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:41,421
[SPEAKER_16]: This will take care of those concerns, hopefully, with certainly adequate off-street parking here for both units in the structure.

345
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:43,224
[SPEAKER_16]: The new structure

346
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:50,328
[SPEAKER_16]: relatively modest total living area about just over 1,400 square feet.

347
00:25:50,528 --> 00:25:59,892
[SPEAKER_16]: It might be 1,800 if you wanted to include the non-living area in the new garage, but the client's proposal was continue on

348
00:26:00,312 --> 00:26:06,295
[SPEAKER_16]: with the house sort of to the rear of the property, not extend it over to the neighbors on this side.

349
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:10,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, the church being supportive of that, we've kept it in line there.

350
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:28,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, to not make it or keep the density reduced, not extending the house out sort of to the right-hand side to create any kind of massing wall from Marion Street so that it is not noticeable, quite frankly, from the street with the extension.

351
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:30,392
[SPEAKER_16]: to the rear.

352
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:38,995
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy to answer any questions on the site plan and also happy to go over the elevation plans if the board would like as well.

353
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:46,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Attorney Cabral.

354
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:54,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the board have any questions or do they want to see any additional information with regards to the width of the lot?

355
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:04,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike?

356
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:11,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so Attorney Cabral, I think you may have covered this in a letter you sent us earlier today.

357
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:20,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I correctly understanding that there's an adequate turn radius into the new garage area?

358
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:23,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, absolutely.

359
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:28,148
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're looking at this being the garage area here.

360
00:27:28,408 --> 00:27:30,449
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at a turn radius, 27.6 feet.

361
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:40,627
[SPEAKER_16]: All the way to what would be the chain link fence that currently separates these 2 properties here.

362
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:45,668
[SPEAKER_16]: So, certainly plenty of room to adequately enter the garage.

363
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:51,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Turn and enter the drive aisle to exit the property again.

364
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,730
[SPEAKER_16]: That's for the.

365
00:27:53,332 --> 00:28:00,279
[SPEAKER_16]: excuse me, newly created garage, and then obviously this is the existing garage where you could certainly just pull in and out.

366
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,801
[SPEAKER_16]: You could also make a turn here.

367
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:16,815
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a, for lack of a better word, a patio area here, but certainly enough room to maneuver the vehicles through here for turning into, enter, exit the drive aisle in this direction.

368
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:18,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

369
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:32,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Would the board like to see the elevations for this?

370
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:36,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, while you're sharing, let's go ahead.

371
00:28:58,044 --> 00:28:59,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I do see Christine has her hand raised.

372
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:02,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come to you when we get to public comment.

373
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:07,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, yes.

374
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,468
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not in public comment yet.

375
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:10,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

376
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:10,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

377
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:12,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

378
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

379
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:17,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, go ahead.

380
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to clarify because I'm

381
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:38,223
[SPEAKER_03]: afraid to change screens myself my computer problems but this is a four bedroom unit edition yes that's correct correct thank you so this is the layout of the overhead

382
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,097
[SPEAKER_16]: This again is the existing structure here.

383
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:44,519
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the new structure being added here.

384
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:52,506
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, the two-bed garage here, this would be the first floor of the new addition, modest living room, kitchen.

385
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:03,315
[SPEAKER_16]: This would be the second floor of the new addition with the bedrooms on this level.

386
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:14,404
[SPEAKER_16]: And so this area here would obviously be over the new proposed garage to give the house some additional living area.

387
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:18,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise they'd be confined to this relatively small footprint here.

388
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:23,428
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I think I skipped it up here, but then this would be the half story.

389
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:31,551
[SPEAKER_16]: So this about 170 square feet of living area on the half story third floor.

390
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:41,039
[SPEAKER_16]: And that would make it conforming to be a half story as well, according to the building code, a bit outside sort of the zoning purview.

391
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:48,162
[SPEAKER_16]: But just to clarify that, that would be the half story with a living area of about 270 square feet.

392
00:30:51,623 --> 00:30:57,365
[SPEAKER_16]: And in terms of the elevations, this is the existing front

393
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:17,525
[SPEAKER_16]: This is probably the best view of if we're looking at the house from the drive aisle, so to speak, pulling in, this would be that new two-car garage that you'd see dorm room above, and this would be the new two-and-a-half-story structure here.

394
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:27,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, living space above the garage and the half-story above here without additional bedroom or office above.

395
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:30,927
[SPEAKER_16]: This would be the backside of that structure.

396
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:36,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I answer any questions on this?

397
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:49,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the board?

398
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chairman, I do have a question.

399
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:59,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possibly for the building commissioner, which is the size of these bedrooms is extremely small.

400
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know, I think from

401
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:09,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Another project, I believe, you only need 70 square feet for a bedroom or something similar.

402
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:12,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, obviously, correct me or not on that.

403
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:13,656
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

404
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:31,449
[SPEAKER_03]: But that 70 square feet can't be, I guess, is there an amount of common space or moving around space that is required?

405
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:36,136
[SPEAKER_02]: No dimension shall be less than I believe 7 foot.

406
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And 70 square foot, so it's not big.

407
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:43,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Those at 1st glance appeared within the building code.

408
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:48,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's basically my question.

409
00:32:48,438 --> 00:32:48,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

410
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chris.

411
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the board?

412
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll open that up for public comment.

413
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:13,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Christine, go ahead, if you can give your name and address for the record.

414
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:15,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, yes, thank you.

415
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:17,343
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Christine Ianni.

416
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:20,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 9 Marion Street, which is the abutting property.

417
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:35,609
[SPEAKER_00]: I worry that this proposed oversight expansion would further contribute to the detriment of the community as we've seen these types of expansions in the area have negatively impacted parking, trash, rats, noise, and the overall feel of the street.

418
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:43,157
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposed plan is inconsistent, flawed, and does not meet code requirements for the proposed structure, making it oversized for the lot.

419
00:33:43,817 --> 00:33:50,082
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I believe the attorney just referenced 1,800 square feet, which is over 100% of the existing area.

420
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:57,668
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also unclear if the tenants to occupy the three-story proposed addition plan to improperly leverage my personal driveway.

421
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:02,630
[SPEAKER_00]: to enter and exit their own given the extremely narrow and unique parking situation.

422
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:08,573
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already very challenging to get in and out of the driveway as is with the crowded on-street parking.

423
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:14,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with limited visitors now, folks will leverage the street to park.

424
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:21,080
[SPEAKER_00]: While the zone allows for a two-family, it is not to code for a two-family, and there's already a two-car garage on the lot.

425
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this is not accurately reflected in the plan by size.

426
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:33,767
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposed garage addition is facing our home, which would cause a disruption of direct headlights into neighboring homes, including ours.

427
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:43,392
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the existing two-car garage would be a more appropriate and less disruptive solution than building a separate second two-car garage on the same lot.

428
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:56,826
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposal, combined with the fact that the lot is five feet narrower than required by code, is material, especially given the unique nature of the narrow lot, which would not allow necessary room for what is proposed.

429
00:34:57,746 --> 00:35:04,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a chance to read my detailed letter submitted to the board for review, and I'm happy to answer any questions.

430
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you for listening and considering these concerns.

431
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:11,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Christine.

432
00:35:14,118 --> 00:35:26,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other public comment, if you have questions, and you want to speak and raise your hand on zoom or email Dennis at D max to roll two L's at Medford dash ma.gov that is in the chat.

433
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:47,994
[SPEAKER_04]: At a moment, I don't see anything in zoom Dennis.

434
00:35:48,014 --> 00:35:49,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything in chat?

435
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:55,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, an email no, no, no additional emails other than.

436
00:35:56,777 --> 00:36:00,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's see how these email that whether that was sent to you all.

437
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you motion.

438
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:11,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, just a point of order.

439
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:17,240
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know we have the letter from Attorney Cabral which speaks to some of this.

440
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:19,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we going to be talking about that at all?

441
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:23,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if so, I'd prefer to do it before we enter deliberations.

442
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:24,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

443
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:31,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we've got the letter of support from the church as well that was mentioned but not read.

444
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,711
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're happy to respond to

445
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:38,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything if the board wishes as well and I'm also happy to go over the.

446
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:44,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, legal requirements for both special permit or variants of the board wishes as well.

447
00:36:50,037 --> 00:36:54,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to review the letter and the responses in there?

448
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:06,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, do you want me to read it in?

449
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:25,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's in the record, so I just want, if Attorney Kerr-Braw wants to share anything beyond what was contained in the letter or just reiterate pertaining to those specific points, I think now would be the time to do it.

450
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:28,327
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just trying to preempt a scenario later.

451
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:34,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, I think our letter, we tried to go point by point sort of in a,

452
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:38,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Organized format to respond to that.

453
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:44,137
[SPEAKER_16]: We certainly understand concerns about on street parking, which is exactly the reason for another garage.

454
00:37:45,258 --> 00:37:45,658
[SPEAKER_16]: on site.

455
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:56,687
[SPEAKER_16]: As I'm sure you can all understand, you know, tandem parking sounds nice, but it never really works out in practice, so to speak.

456
00:37:56,767 --> 00:38:04,774
[SPEAKER_16]: So to actually have separate parking areas for each unit just seemed to make more sense for our client as well.

457
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:12,280
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, keeping all the on street excuse me, all the parking on site rather than on street is the goal here.

458
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,361
[SPEAKER_16]: and creating the additional garage in this area here allows for that.

459
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:23,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Also allows for, you know, not having to manage sort of vehicles and blocking each other in.

460
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:25,463
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the goal here.

461
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:35,105
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of density, I mean, we actually think it's, quite frankly, a lot less dense than most other two-family houses on these type of lots.

462
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this being sort of an oversized lot of

463
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:43,410
[SPEAKER_16]: 7100 square feet, and we, the max law coverage is 35%.

464
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:47,693
[SPEAKER_16]: According to the code, ours is only 24.9%.

465
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:54,738
[SPEAKER_16]: So, in terms of density, we've tried to reduce that with a smaller structure here.

466
00:38:55,398 --> 00:39:04,562
[SPEAKER_16]: And in addition to that, again, keeping the addition to the rear of this structure and not extending it out to Ms.

467
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:18,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Ayane's property over here to the right so that the massing of the structure actually seems much smaller because it simply extends back to the rear yard and continues to meet all the setbacks as well.

468
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:29,981
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure I can speak to trash rats that certainly there have been no complaints with regard to my client to date that I know of.

469
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:43,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Certainly our client, who wants to continue to live in the front structure here, doesn't want rats and trash on her property, right?

470
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:50,530
[SPEAKER_16]: She sort of prides herself on that, keeping the place kept up nice, not only for herself, but for her neighbors as well.

471
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:56,651
[SPEAKER_16]: She certainly wants to be respectful, and she has a good relationship with the neighbors and would like to keep it that way.

472
00:39:57,051 --> 00:40:00,772
[SPEAKER_16]: We've heard of concerns of increased rats.

473
00:40:02,012 --> 00:40:08,135
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, in the city, and that's certainly something that my client will obviously work to minimize as well.

474
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:20,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only during construction and a commissioner, there are requirements for, you know, when work is being done, you know, remediation or, you know, extermination that may be required.

475
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Our clients more than happy to comply with any of that at any time.

476
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:32,265
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that sort of hit on the major points, but certainly we've gone over here, the drive aisle as well.

477
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:39,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there are any other specific items that I missed or the board wants me to touch on, I'm happy to do that.

478
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:50,758
[SPEAKER_16]: And then no other, and then again, with the existing, you know, the structure again becomes closest, still meets setback, but closest to the church and the church did give a letter of support for the project.

479
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Mike, go ahead.

480
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:09,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Jamie, through you, I'm wondering if Attorney Cabral could speak to the neighbor's concern about headlights hitting the house.

481
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:20,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at the area plan, and it's not clear to me if the garage, the new garage is even in a location that would

482
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:25,166
[SPEAKER_15]: where a car would be perpendicular to the house.

483
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:27,507
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like maybe it's shining into the backyard.

484
00:41:28,948 --> 00:41:32,630
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure that it would go maybe to the rear of the structure.

485
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:38,313
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll say in any event, I discussed with my client there is an existing chain link here.

486
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:52,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Our client's intention was to actually put up a new solid fence here as well, which would certainly give the neighbor more privacy and should alleviate those concerns of headlights.

487
00:41:54,742 --> 00:41:55,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

488
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:04,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, go ahead.

489
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:06,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

490
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:19,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also perhaps another question for the building commissioner and the number of bedrooms, which is four, and the provided parking, which is two.

491
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:22,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that currently

492
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:28,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Meet the requirement, or are they seeking a variance for parking as well?

493
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:34,077
[SPEAKER_02]: The current requirements for a dwelling unit to have a minimum of 2 spaces.

494
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:37,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, it's not predicated necessarily the number of bedrooms.

495
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:43,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And planner Evans.

496
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:44,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

497
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:50,727
[SPEAKER_10]: So for two families and above, it's one and a half spaces per unit.

498
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:54,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So the requirement for a two family would be three spaces.

499
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:10,639
[SPEAKER_16]: I would add certainly as well, there is enough room in this area here to add additional parking if the city wanted that.

500
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do, we have not closed public comment and there have been additional discussions.

501
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Christine, I'll go to you.

502
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:27,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was just wondering if it'd be possible to speak a bit more about the plan for the proposed fence.

503
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:33,763
[SPEAKER_00]: The chain link fence that currently divides the driveway is actually on my property.

504
00:43:33,783 --> 00:43:38,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And my property actually expands a few inches past that.

505
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:41,609
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just hoping to hear a bit more about the plan for the fence.

506
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,331
[SPEAKER_16]: And my client certainly happy to discuss that with you again.

507
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:51,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Their plan was to put up a new fence along here.

508
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:52,793
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be on their property.

509
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you also raised a concern.

510
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:58,755
[SPEAKER_16]: My client has no intention of using this area here, which is your property.

511
00:43:59,155 --> 00:44:01,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Their property line stops here.

512
00:44:01,496 --> 00:44:03,677
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a fence along the property line.

513
00:44:04,917 --> 00:44:28,510
[SPEAKER_16]: If you wanted to discuss with my client whether you wanted to keep your fence or you wanted to get rid of the chain link and discuss total replacement of your chain link with a solid fence, I'm sure my client would be glad to have that discussion so that you don't have to have sort of two fences abutting one another as well, whether it be for, you know, aesthetics or whatever, maybe.

514
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:36,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Planner Evans, go ahead.

515
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:37,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

516
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:45,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I would recommend that the board place a condition on the decision that there be a solid fence if the board so desires.

517
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:51,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't leave it to after the fact discussions.

518
00:44:53,175 --> 00:45:00,761
[SPEAKER_10]: If the abutter is wanting a solid fence, which I think would make sense if she's concerned about privacy or

519
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:04,060
[SPEAKER_10]: headlight glare, whether or not that would actually happen.

520
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:09,384
[SPEAKER_16]: And on behalf of my client, we're more than happy to commit to that.

521
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:12,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

522
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Building Commissioner, go ahead.

523
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:22,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just do want to clarify, the maximum you can have is a six foot fence.

524
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:25,076
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had those conversations before.

525
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:27,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Those don't come up too often, do they?

526
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:35,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Commissioner.

527
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:35,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Christine.

528
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:43,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had one other question regarding the driveway and the garage to make sure I'm understanding correctly.

529
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:50,479
[SPEAKER_00]: For the board's context, the existing driveway is extremely narrow on either side.

530
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:55,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it barely fits one car as it drives down, which makes it very challenging to get in and out.

531
00:45:56,302 --> 00:45:58,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to understand, I had heard

532
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:03,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney Cabral, you had mentioned that there's necessary turning radius.

533
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:08,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could just quickly explain or show what you mean.

534
00:46:09,591 --> 00:46:10,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

535
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:27,586
[SPEAKER_16]: So this roughly is the proposed new two-car garage, and there would be 27.6 feet to exit the garage and turn into the driveway to exit the property and also likewise entering as well.

536
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:28,507
[SPEAKER_16]: It's probably

537
00:46:29,346 --> 00:46:37,850
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, maybe the commissioners, but certainly seems like more more space to turn a vehicle than probably most parking lot drive aisles as well.

538
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,951
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I think it's certainly more than adequate.

539
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:48,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Turning space, turning radius for vehicles to enter and exit the new proposed garage and certainly existing garage.

540
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,596
[SPEAKER_16]: not a problem at this time as well.

541
00:46:51,057 --> 00:47:03,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Also there, you know, cars come in, there is additional parking in this area right now that my client parks in as well, navigates in and out, forward, reverse, and leaving the driveway onto the street.

542
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:11,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

543
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:14,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the board?

544
00:47:22,782 --> 00:47:25,983
[SPEAKER_04]: We are still open for public comment, if there's any additional public comment.

545
00:47:31,304 --> 00:47:32,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I have a comment.

546
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:36,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, name and address for the record, please.

547
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:51,548
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Edmond Ianni, and I am speaking on behalf and as agent for Christine Ianni.

548
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:16,552
[SPEAKER_08]: The point on the off-street parking spaces that needs to be clarified is that these proposed plans indicate enough space

549
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:29,807
[SPEAKER_08]: for up to, depending on how you count them, 10 or 12 off-street parking spaces in violation of the codes max for this lot of eight.

550
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:42,097
[SPEAKER_08]: If you take into account the proposed plans allowance physically of a new two-car garage,

551
00:48:43,487 --> 00:49:09,219
[SPEAKER_08]: and parking spaces in front of each of those bays, as well as the existing garage, which is a two-car garage, and the parking spaces in front of those bays, you get to a point where, at least per the code,

552
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:27,073
[SPEAKER_08]: those unenclosed and enclosed parking spaces must be taken into account and counted to quote the code, whether or not those spaces are used for parking.

553
00:49:28,453 --> 00:49:36,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Hence the issue of one, the violation of the code limitation

554
00:49:37,262 --> 00:50:00,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And two, the excessive undue detriment in the form of, especially if all those spaces are occupied by vehicles, unnecessary, excessive headlight glare beaming into Christine's property.

555
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:14,919
[SPEAKER_08]: the existing, supplementing excessively, excessive exhaust fumes, which would be directed particularly when the cars are backing out, and the additional noise.

556
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems that

557
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:37,078
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the better solution here would be to scale down the proposal rather than build a separate new two-car garage, to simply put an addition onto the existing two-car garage, and that would solve all five of those problems.

558
00:50:42,954 --> 00:50:48,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Hence, the five feet of width is so critical as Christine pointed out.

559
00:50:49,256 --> 00:51:07,482
[SPEAKER_08]: It's already insufficient because it's non-conforming, but to propose this additional vehicular, if you will, operation on the property will exacerbate the problem.

560
00:51:08,678 --> 00:51:10,679
[SPEAKER_08]: it could use five feet more.

561
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:30,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And may I respectfully submit that this is not unlike the situation for 57 Morton Avenue a few years ago, where the applicant had to combine an additional lot to create the necessary space to convert to a two-story dwelling.

562
00:51:38,592 --> 00:51:39,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Endan.

563
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:42,693
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Chair, may I respond?

564
00:51:44,754 --> 00:51:44,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

565
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:47,874
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we're only showing four spaces.

566
00:51:47,934 --> 00:51:48,635
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not showing 10, 12.

567
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:50,515
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

568
00:51:51,395 --> 00:51:55,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I, for some reason, I can't hear.

569
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:01,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you put it?

570
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:06,674
[SPEAKER_16]: We're only proposing for off-street parking spaces here.

571
00:52:06,954 --> 00:52:13,399
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not proposing parking, as they're not shown here, up and down the entire drive aisle.

572
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:24,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Just as the neighbor doesn't have parking and stacking cars up and down her driveway here, we're not talking about what's theoretically possible.

573
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,509
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not asking for any relief.

574
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:44,978
[SPEAKER_16]: relative to parking we satisfy all off street parking requirements and certainly if there's ever a parking violation at this property or any property you know our client or you know future owners will certainly have to bring that into compliance but the purpose here was to give

575
00:52:45,618 --> 00:52:56,393
[SPEAKER_16]: adequate off street parking to also satisfy concerns, not only of the neighbor, but other neighbors as well as congested on street parking as well.

576
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:57,535
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's, you know what?

577
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:17,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Hard to have it both ways, but we're trying to provide more than adequate off street parking so that additional cars are not parked on Marion Street and leave those for visitors and other residents who do not have the adequate on site or off street parking needed for their own vehicles.

578
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:18,909
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the intention here.

579
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:23,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Attorney Cabrera.

580
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:28,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the board?

581
00:53:29,269 --> 00:53:32,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, can we check in with the building commissioner on that?

582
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:38,197
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding is that the number of parking spaces isn't what's shown on a plan.

583
00:53:38,277 --> 00:53:41,119
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just defined by the ordinance.

584
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:51,528
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm almost certain that this is nowhere near 10, but maybe it's four, maybe it's six.

585
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:52,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It's unclear to me.

586
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:54,431
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like clarity on how many

587
00:53:56,048 --> 00:54:05,855
[SPEAKER_15]: from the perspective of the city and its ordinance, how many parking spaces are there with this configuration?

588
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:10,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll defer to Danielle first.

589
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,399
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

590
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:11,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

591
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry that I keep chiming in.

592
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So those wouldn't count as parking spaces.

593
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:19,065
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not how many

594
00:54:19,848 --> 00:54:21,209
[SPEAKER_10]: cars, you can cram on a lot.

595
00:54:21,229 --> 00:54:24,913
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have reasonable access to them.

596
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:35,062
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be interpreted as tandem and changing keys around, but you can't stack a bunch of cars and have that count as a legal parking space.

597
00:54:35,082 --> 00:54:39,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's not a correct interpretation of that 100% of parking.

598
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:49,385
[SPEAKER_10]: prohibition, and I believe that doesn't actually apply to

599
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:54,996
[SPEAKER_10]: It definitely doesn't apply to singles, I'm not sure about twos.

600
00:54:55,076 --> 00:55:06,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking in the ordinance to find- Yeah, in section 94-6.1.4, maybe what he's referring to, it says residential districts, number of spaces shall not exceed 200%.

601
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:06,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

602
00:55:07,064 --> 00:55:16,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, spaces are defined not just as 20 by 10, they're also defined as space to access them and maneuver and all that sort of stuff.

603
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:20,972
[SPEAKER_02]: She's right, it's not just pack them in like sardines and that counts as a space.

604
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:30,321
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have to bear in mind they're going to have to create a lot of impervious space here that may not be driveway in order to meet stormwater regulations.

605
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:38,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the answer to how many parking spaces is not as clear as it's going to be 10 because I can draw 10 boxes on top of each other.

606
00:55:38,408 --> 00:55:39,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

607
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that will be addressed as if this moves forward as it goes through the building process, the permitting process with the building department.

608
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:54,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there are any variances or anything that needs to come to us based on those, those will come back.

609
00:55:55,939 --> 00:56:03,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if we get a parking plan and a layout through engineering that triggers a need to come back, we will send them right back to the board.

610
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:06,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Commissioner.

611
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:10,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Daniel, Senator Evans.

612
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:13,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike, for your question.

613
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:14,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the board?

614
00:56:18,114 --> 00:56:18,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand, yeah.

615
00:56:24,446 --> 00:56:24,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

616
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:30,874
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, I'll wait a moment to close the public hearing and enter deliberation.

617
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:41,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Chair, before you do so, did you want me to lay out our standard for either the special primer or the variant for the record?

618
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:44,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, please.

619
00:56:45,562 --> 00:56:48,445
[SPEAKER_16]: So, again, on the on the variance on the variance.

620
00:56:48,465 --> 00:56:54,210
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, we'll still maintain our position on the special permit, but I certainly won't won't argue that here tonight.

621
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:59,755
[SPEAKER_16]: But for a variance, certainly a unique lot in mentioned by the neighbor as well.

622
00:57:00,756 --> 00:57:03,979
[SPEAKER_16]: The lot depth requirement is only 60 feet.

623
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:05,060
[SPEAKER_16]: This lot actually has 130 feet.

624
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:11,942
[SPEAKER_16]: of depth, so it's an unusually long lot, especially relative to the width here.

625
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:18,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it being a GR district, two families are allowed as a right, so the use is actually allowed here.

626
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,545
[SPEAKER_16]: And the shortage, not significant, only five feet.

627
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:26,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, we've tried to mitigate that by putting the structure behind here.

628
00:57:27,686 --> 00:57:36,208
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, unique lot being long relative to its width, the hardship being to our client, they would be unable to actually use

629
00:57:37,228 --> 00:57:46,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Their property for an allowed use being a two family, which would certainly again limit their use here and certainly have a financial impact on them as well.

630
00:57:47,432 --> 00:57:51,073
[SPEAKER_16]: It's certainly not more substantially detrimental to the neighborhood either.

631
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:54,995
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a district there about I counted about.

632
00:57:55,495 --> 00:58:00,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Half on Marion Street are two to three family houses already.

633
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:05,139
[SPEAKER_16]: So it certainly fits in with the use in the neighborhood as well.

634
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:12,102
[SPEAKER_16]: And also this would add an additional dwelling unit, which we know that the city desires as well.

635
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:14,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, a relatively modest one as well.

636
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:16,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So not a sort of amassing structure.

637
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:21,246
[SPEAKER_16]: And we would respectfully request that the board grant the variance based on that.

638
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:22,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your time.

639
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Attorney Cabral.

640
00:58:29,761 --> 00:58:53,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have that, again, this is focused on the five feet with the property, and we are discussing a variance, again, owing to the circumstances relating to soil condition, shape, topography of such land or structures, literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant.

641
00:58:54,781 --> 00:59:04,788
[SPEAKER_04]: and that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance or bylaw.

642
00:59:09,531 --> 00:59:14,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, I'm going to motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberations.

643
00:59:18,197 --> 00:59:18,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

644
00:59:20,499 --> 00:59:20,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

645
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jim.

646
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:23,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike?

647
00:59:25,154 --> 00:59:26,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jim.

648
00:59:28,396 --> 00:59:29,156
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm good.

649
00:59:30,257 --> 00:59:32,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, thank you.

650
00:59:32,578 --> 00:59:32,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris.

651
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:35,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jamie.

652
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:35,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

653
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we are in deliberation who would like to go 1st.

654
00:59:50,787 --> 01:00:00,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we've got a with variance request here for a by right to family development.

655
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:09,138
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had statements from the planner Evans with regards to the process that they went through with the planning department.

656
01:00:10,238 --> 01:00:17,022
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a letter of support from one butter letter against from another butter.

657
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,461
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with the shape of the lot, obviously, it is a challenge.

658
01:00:24,481 --> 01:00:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have the area.

659
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:30,784
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have the depth makes up for some of that is by right.

660
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:43,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And as discussed by the planner, the intent of our changes going to our zoning will be to improve the opportunity for people to do this.

661
01:00:44,435 --> 01:00:55,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have state regulations as we've seen, you know, push for ADUs and other improvements along our ADU development within the city for adding units onto existing property.

662
01:00:56,805 --> 01:00:57,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I am in support of this.

663
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:07,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, if I could ask, we're considering a variance currently?

664
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:08,635
[SPEAKER_03]: We are, correct.

665
01:01:08,856 --> 01:01:09,056
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

666
01:01:09,216 --> 01:01:11,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And there could be a special permit?

667
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:19,847
[SPEAKER_04]: It was submitted as a special permit, but it is a variance as discussed by the commission earlier.

668
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:20,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

669
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:21,428
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

670
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:23,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will not be considered as a special permit?

671
01:01:23,469 --> 01:01:24,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes correct.

672
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:26,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It is creating a new non-conformity.

673
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:31,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are our options for conditioning on a variance?

674
01:01:34,555 --> 01:01:40,839
[SPEAKER_03]: What conditions placed upon the

675
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:48,210
[SPEAKER_04]: the project, the difference?

676
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,291
[SPEAKER_04]: From the project perspective, we're limited.

677
01:01:50,512 --> 01:02:03,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go, because the plans have not been reviewed by the building department at this point formally, they come to us for the variance prior to going through the building department review.

678
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:04,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

679
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:12,105
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is anything else that we want to require as discussed with regards to the fence, we can make those conditions.

680
01:02:24,623 --> 01:02:25,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, go ahead.

681
01:02:26,324 --> 01:02:42,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so, Jamie, from an analysis standpoint, I'm not planning to really consider the direction the city is heading with its zoning on this.

682
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we need to focus on the zoning now.

683
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,993
[SPEAKER_15]: But in terms of the zoning now,

684
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:59,569
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm seeing is a lot that is fairly large for the street.

685
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,452
[SPEAKER_15]: If we look on the area plan, it's on the larger side.

686
01:03:02,472 --> 01:03:16,885
[SPEAKER_15]: It has the area and the dimensions to support the allowed use of a two family other than the width.

687
01:03:18,486 --> 01:03:18,947
[SPEAKER_15]: And so

688
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:41,038
[SPEAKER_15]: The question from my perspective is, is there circumstances relating to the shape, topography, or soil conditions of the lot and structures that would create a hardship in this case, literally applying the zoning to this extension?

689
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:47,701
[SPEAKER_15]: And here, I think the

690
01:03:52,417 --> 01:04:04,826
[SPEAKER_15]: the biggest, so everything is dimensionally within what's allowed other than the lot width, which is one of the unusual aspects of the lot.

691
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:10,411
[SPEAKER_15]: It's relatively long and short.

692
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:18,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I do think it would be a hardship to prevent the owner from

693
01:04:21,313 --> 01:04:24,776
[SPEAKER_15]: being able to use this lot as a two-family.

694
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:34,323
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think they've done a suitable job trying to mitigate the impact.

695
01:04:34,383 --> 01:04:38,226
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not adding a lot of massing from the street.

696
01:04:38,826 --> 01:04:43,950
[SPEAKER_15]: They've indicated a willingness and an interest in putting in a fence.

697
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:49,614
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think we need a condition on the fence, but I'd love to hear the board's thoughts on that.

698
01:04:51,736 --> 01:04:58,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it seems like this is a pretty small impact with adequate parking.

699
01:05:00,423 --> 01:05:07,329
[SPEAKER_15]: And the lot certainly meets the standard of being unusual.

700
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,851
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a condition generally affecting the district.

701
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:16,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.

702
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:17,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I always appreciate your analysis.

703
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:25,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris or Jim, do you have any comments that you want to share?

704
01:05:44,385 --> 01:05:45,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic is off, Jim.

705
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:48,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

706
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:50,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at a picture,

707
01:05:51,435 --> 01:05:59,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing a chain-link fence that's on the left-hand side of the house, but then a wooden fence that's in back of that.

708
01:06:02,898 --> 01:06:06,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Question to Attorney Cabral.

709
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:12,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the fence we're talking about, the chain-link fence?

710
01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:16,843
[SPEAKER_16]: No, Mr. Tarani.

711
01:06:16,863 --> 01:06:20,564
[SPEAKER_16]: The chain-link fence we're talking about- Is it that?

712
01:06:22,277 --> 01:06:28,461
[SPEAKER_16]: The neighbor that spoke tonight, this is her property here, and this is her driveway.

713
01:06:29,162 --> 01:06:34,865
[SPEAKER_16]: And there is a chain link fence running down the boundary line that separates the two.

714
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:38,708
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is that chain link fence that we've been discussing this evening.

715
01:06:39,588 --> 01:06:46,553
[SPEAKER_16]: The wooden fence separates our client's lot from the church property on this side, which has supported the project.

716
01:06:47,233 --> 01:06:47,353
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

717
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:48,414
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

718
01:06:48,474 --> 01:06:49,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you for that.

719
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:50,075
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

720
01:06:57,798 --> 01:07:00,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have, Mr. Chair, if I may.

721
01:07:01,581 --> 01:07:06,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chris, go ahead.

722
01:07:07,085 --> 01:07:22,036
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the current bylaw say about permeability versus impermeability of the site and what the percentages are?

723
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:25,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Building Commissioner, could you respond to that?

724
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:39,619
[SPEAKER_02]: The current stormwater regulations state that if you create more than 200 feet of new impermeable surface, which the structure does, you have to go through a complete stormwater plan.

725
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:46,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So they will have to hire an engineer, create a plan, and decide how to contain the water within the site.

726
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:53,066
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also some requirements about driveways being a permeable surface, but that'll be looked at in the big picture.

727
01:07:54,911 --> 01:07:58,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that actually, to the driveway point, that's what I was getting to.

728
01:07:59,194 --> 01:08:11,783
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no currently, or part of the stormwater plan that they submit will have to show the surfacing that they're going to use?

729
01:08:13,404 --> 01:08:14,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

730
01:08:16,546 --> 01:08:17,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Planner Evans?

731
01:08:19,102 --> 01:08:19,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

732
01:08:19,503 --> 01:08:25,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, in our zoning, it's surprisingly does not address permeability.

733
01:08:25,728 --> 01:08:37,317
[SPEAKER_10]: We have landscaping requirements, but in the definition of landscaping does not indicate whether it has to be pervious or impervious, which is also something we want to change.

734
01:08:45,452 --> 01:08:46,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

735
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:56,260
[SPEAKER_16]: And our clients are really familiar with that working with an architect and will submit all of that to the commissioner assuming we get there and glad to satisfy all those concerns.

736
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other discussion from the board.

737
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a general comment if I may, Mr. Chair.

738
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:31,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I think overall it would be hard to deny this given the underlying zoning and the compliance with setbacks, et cetera.

739
01:09:32,014 --> 01:09:38,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do very much hear the abutters concerns and I'd like to

740
01:09:41,537 --> 01:10:09,102
[SPEAKER_03]: see what additional measures can be taken to alleviate the concerns of the butter at 9 Marion Street, including an opaque fence or something that would, landscaping, I mean, in some ways may be preferable to a fence because you may get something

741
01:10:10,482 --> 01:10:12,503
[SPEAKER_03]: quite not aesthetically pleasing.

742
01:10:15,184 --> 01:10:22,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I don't know what our options are there, but that's my, those are my general comments.

743
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:28,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the plot size is, you know, oversized in the general scheme of things.

744
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand the setbacks and everything.

745
01:10:33,152 --> 01:10:35,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I am concerned about the permeability of the,

746
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:46,600
[SPEAKER_03]: site and then, you know, any runoff that occurs, but I guess, you know, trust our building commissioner and engineering department to work that out.

747
01:10:49,824 --> 01:10:50,425
[SPEAKER_04]: General comments.

748
01:10:50,665 --> 01:10:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

749
01:10:51,906 --> 01:10:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

750
01:10:53,769 --> 01:10:55,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with regards to the fence,

751
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:59,794
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know I am concerned about putting a condition there.

752
01:11:00,294 --> 01:11:01,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important.

753
01:11:01,475 --> 01:11:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the idea of a opaque fence there, but I think that the applicant has indicated their interest and willingness to work with the neighbor with regards to that.

754
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:25,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be concerned about putting a condition that sets a requirement when there may be an opportunity for them to develop a different solution that they do prefer.

755
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:29,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, go ahead.

756
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I tend to agree with you, Jamie.

757
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:54,712
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess the way I'm thinking about it is the board should be very careful about imposing conditions and really restrict ourselves to the cases where the condition is truly necessary to meet the no substantial detriment standard or other aspects of the

758
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:56,272
[SPEAKER_15]: the standard.

759
01:11:56,853 --> 01:12:14,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Here I think I acknowledge there is a case to be made for a condition mostly due to the somewhat unusual configuration where the garage is oriented towards the neighboring property.

760
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It really doesn't look to me from the plans like it actually is

761
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:24,606
[SPEAKER_15]: pointing into the property.

762
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:34,871
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not seeing a scenario where it's headlights in the house from the plans I'm looking at, which is why I would be comfortable not requiring that.

763
01:12:34,911 --> 01:12:42,254
[SPEAKER_15]: It does give more flexibility for the owner and the neighbor to find something they both like.

764
01:12:42,554 --> 01:12:45,576
[SPEAKER_15]: If we impose a condition, they kind of have to do it or else they can't build.

765
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:49,738
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would prefer to move forward without the condition, but I'm

766
01:12:50,435 --> 01:13:00,698
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm open to a scenario where we move forward with the condition if that's viewed as essential to proceed under the no substantial detriment standard by a member.

767
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:08,460
[SPEAKER_16]: And I certainly know the difficulties of imposing conditions on

768
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:15,712
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why I'm more than happy to stipulate that our client is willing to work with the neighbor.

769
01:13:16,012 --> 01:13:17,512
[SPEAKER_16]: They were already planning on a fence.

770
01:13:19,553 --> 01:13:21,553
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, do you want to talk landscaping instead?

771
01:13:22,054 --> 01:13:27,095
[SPEAKER_16]: My client would be more than happy to have that discussion and would certainly like to keep their neighbors.

772
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:28,275
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to be neighbors.

773
01:13:29,396 --> 01:13:33,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Want to keep open lines of communication and certainly willing to put up that fence.

774
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:37,818
[SPEAKER_16]: My client had already discussed that with me, you know, prior to this hearing.

775
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:40,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to go on record with that as well.

776
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:45,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Attorney Cabrera.

777
01:13:47,880 --> 01:14:04,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, in that case, if, you know, I do think some amount of screening there is necessary because whether or not the headlights shine into the house or into your backyard while you're using it, it's still something that's a

778
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:11,130
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, disadvantageous to the neighbor.

779
01:14:11,731 --> 01:14:23,741
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will take the attorney at his word and the applicant at their word and they'll work something out with the neighbor.

780
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:27,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll leave it at that.

781
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:27,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

782
01:14:33,508 --> 01:14:36,451
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna motion to approve the

783
01:14:37,213 --> 01:14:39,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Variance for 13 Marion Street.

784
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:45,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a second?

785
01:14:48,162 --> 01:14:48,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jim.

786
01:14:50,264 --> 01:14:51,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Christy of it.

787
01:14:52,365 --> 01:14:54,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jim Torani.

788
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:57,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Mike Caldera.

789
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jamie Thompson.

790
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:00,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

791
01:15:04,107 --> 01:15:05,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you attorney cabral.

792
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:12,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you believe Dennis would we like to have attorney cabral put together the decision for us the language there.

793
01:15:13,753 --> 01:15:14,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm happy to do that.

794
01:15:15,014 --> 01:15:16,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Dennis, I can email that over to you.

795
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:18,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you much.

796
01:15:19,637 --> 01:15:20,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you everyone.

797
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:21,018
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

798
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:26,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone.

799
01:15:27,742 --> 01:15:32,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have next 35 Lincoln Street if I'm correct.

800
01:15:34,996 --> 01:15:36,377
[SPEAKER_06]: 35 Lincoln Street, case number A-2024-20.

801
01:15:36,437 --> 01:15:46,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant and owner, Ian Lavery, wishes to infill an existing driveway at 3537 Lincoln Street, which will remove two existing below-grade parking spaces.

802
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:54,413
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not allowed per the City of Memphis Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Section 6.1.4, and Table A, Table of Use and Parking Regulations.

803
01:15:57,496 --> 01:15:58,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dennis.

804
01:15:58,077 --> 01:15:59,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

805
01:16:00,337 --> 01:16:01,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, hi, I'm Ian Lavery.

806
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:03,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening to the board.

807
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:04,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for having us.

808
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:09,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Also on the call is our neighbor, Brad and Caitlin Dobby.

809
01:16:10,262 --> 01:16:11,803
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a two-unit condo.

810
01:16:12,744 --> 01:16:16,086
[SPEAKER_13]: We submitted three permit applications.

811
01:16:17,246 --> 01:16:24,050
[SPEAKER_13]: The one that was denied was specific to our property, but all the projects are kind of part and parcel.

812
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:29,553
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it pleases you, I'd like to share my screen and walk you guys through the project.

813
01:16:35,103 --> 01:16:35,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, please do.

814
01:16:36,564 --> 01:16:36,804
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

815
01:16:47,429 --> 01:16:48,410
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, can everyone see my screen?

816
01:16:51,371 --> 01:16:51,711
[SPEAKER_04]: We can.

817
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:52,652
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, great.

818
01:16:54,121 --> 01:17:01,344
[SPEAKER_13]: So the reason for this project is to protect our property from this sort of flooding that we're seeing on the screen here.

819
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:08,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Our section of Lincoln Street, which is near the corner of Fairfield, is the lowest point on the street.

820
01:17:09,068 --> 01:17:18,832
[SPEAKER_13]: And during severe, quick, and rapid thundershowers, you can see that the entire street floods due to the stormwater system backing up.

821
01:17:20,755 --> 01:17:28,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, on 3 or 4 occasions, we've had the water crest the driveway in the sidewalk and flow down our driveway into our garage.

822
01:17:29,965 --> 01:17:34,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Up to about 2 feet of water in each of our garages and see, we have a.

823
01:17:36,593 --> 01:17:39,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Water barrier we put up earlier this June.

824
01:17:39,095 --> 01:17:43,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we got it just in the nick of time to protect our garage.

825
01:17:43,779 --> 01:17:47,242
[SPEAKER_13]: But on other cases, we were not so lucky last year.

826
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:52,186
[SPEAKER_13]: This was the remnants of some flooding that occurred on our property.

827
01:17:52,226 --> 01:17:54,008
[SPEAKER_13]: This is as the water was draining.

828
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:58,312
[SPEAKER_13]: And then this is Brad and Caitlin's property during that same storm.

829
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:02,994
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the flooding that occurred in 2021.

830
01:18:03,514 --> 01:18:08,575
[SPEAKER_13]: This was the most significant flooding in terms of damage to the property.

831
01:18:08,595 --> 01:18:12,976
[SPEAKER_13]: It caused about $10,000 worth of damage to our properties combined.

832
01:18:13,896 --> 01:18:18,617
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see the water came in so hard and fast it actually broke through the garage doors.

833
01:18:21,357 --> 01:18:28,439
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think I have an additional picture here of the damage that was left over after the floods recited.

834
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:47,738
[SPEAKER_13]: So, to that point, we contracted with an architect to design a plan to close off the garage to create a flat driveway and prevent any water from coming to the house.

835
01:18:48,778 --> 01:18:50,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Here is a view of it.

836
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:57,923
[SPEAKER_13]: There are some additional views in the plans, but you can see from a sloped driveway in this picture,

837
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:06,068
[SPEAKER_13]: We're proposing a flat driveway with a finished basement behind this wall here that we'll pour.

838
01:19:06,088 --> 01:19:19,919
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically pouring a concrete wall about halfway up the garage doors, putting in some windows, demoing our existing driveway, and then pouring a flat driveway in its place.

839
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,882
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see the site plan here.

840
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:27,192
[SPEAKER_13]: The footprint of the driveway is not changing.

841
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:29,955
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just changing the elevation of it.

842
01:19:30,135 --> 01:19:40,105
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we are putting inside egress stairs here on each side of the property in order to have some additional egress into and out of the basement.

843
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:47,172
[SPEAKER_13]: And then each unit also has an additional interior stairway into the basement area.

844
01:19:48,585 --> 01:19:53,048
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll note that I was in the garage when the first flood happened.

845
01:19:53,788 --> 01:20:03,533
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was only afterward that the fire department told me there was a severe electrocution risk from being in there while the water was interacting with the building HVAC system in the garage.

846
01:20:03,573 --> 01:20:07,395
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a fairly significant health and safety risk.

847
01:20:08,335 --> 01:20:18,981
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition to just damage to the property, and then sort of come back to the reason we're here, and that's seeking a variance in regards to parking.

848
01:20:19,622 --> 01:20:28,007
[SPEAKER_13]: The requirements stipulate that we have 3 parking spaces for 2 units in this neighborhood.

849
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:33,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And this project eliminates the 2 interior garage spots.

850
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:41,049
[SPEAKER_13]: For each unit and leaves us with 2 total, so we are 1 short of the required parking spaces for this property.

851
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:48,255
[SPEAKER_13]: And 1 additional note is that during heavy rains, we pull the cars out of the driveway anyway.

852
01:20:49,857 --> 01:20:54,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we don't want to actually damage our cars during any flooding.

853
01:20:55,662 --> 01:21:01,806
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do have a note here from City Councilor Emily Lozaro in support of this.

854
01:21:01,866 --> 01:21:05,968
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a kind of last minute letter, so I don't believe you guys have this in your file.

855
01:21:07,668 --> 01:21:12,872
[SPEAKER_13]: has seen the damage that occurs and understands the undue stress.

856
01:21:12,953 --> 01:21:16,035
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also want to point out the last two lines here.

857
01:21:16,055 --> 01:21:17,957
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never struggled to find street parking.

858
01:21:18,597 --> 01:21:23,641
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no reason to believe that there would be any problem caused by the removal of off-street parking due to this variance.

859
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:35,571
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not a very densely populated area of the neighborhood of West Medford, and there's always ample street parking on our street and on the cornering street on Fairfield.

860
01:21:39,855 --> 01:21:41,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions on this project?

861
01:21:47,358 --> 01:21:49,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, go ahead.

862
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:55,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so my understanding is that this will be subject to the city's stormwater ordinance.

863
01:21:55,801 --> 01:22:02,283
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm just curious, have you gotten any comments from the city engineer on this?

864
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:05,027
[SPEAKER_13]: We have not.

865
01:22:05,127 --> 01:22:08,809
[SPEAKER_13]: We have spoken with Owen Wartella on a few different occasions.

866
01:22:08,869 --> 01:22:10,049
[SPEAKER_13]: He's come out to the property.

867
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:15,491
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have not received any comments in regards to this particular project.

868
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:16,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

869
01:22:20,673 --> 01:22:33,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that would, my question is, has the city, obviously the stormwater, the overflow that's coming in, has there been any engagement with the city to try to mitigate what's happening on the street in general?

870
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:45,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, so the city engaged with a contractor client filter and conducted a citywide stormwater assessment to identify probable neighborhoods and what the potential solutions would be.

871
01:22:45,538 --> 01:22:53,981
[SPEAKER_13]: The potential solution proposed for this neighborhood was, you know, a million plus dollars of drainage work.

872
01:22:55,201 --> 01:23:04,507
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last we heard from from Mr tell us that the city decided not to pursue that that project, you know, a 1Million dollars for one property being.

873
01:23:04,527 --> 01:23:06,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably outsize expenditure.

874
01:23:11,832 --> 01:23:12,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

875
01:23:17,976 --> 01:23:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions from the board?

876
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:42,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the public, please raise your hand on zoom, or you can email Dennis at the McDougal to at Medford dash and a.gov that is in the chat as well.

877
01:23:42,979 --> 01:23:47,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll wait on that.

878
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:50,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just open any other questions from the board or from the city.

879
01:23:58,845 --> 01:24:00,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a hand raised.

880
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:01,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad Dobie.

881
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

882
01:24:04,254 --> 01:24:06,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Brad Dobie.

883
01:24:06,538 --> 01:24:07,680
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 37 Lincoln Street.

884
01:24:08,887 --> 01:24:14,833
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to reiterate and introduce myself as the other owner of this property.

885
01:24:14,853 --> 01:24:30,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one thing that this flooding impacts us, it's probably worth noting, is that between the two families, we need to always have one person around the property to roll out our flood barrier in hopes that it

886
01:24:32,057 --> 01:24:32,938
[SPEAKER_12]: would stop any flooding.

887
01:24:33,018 --> 01:24:46,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Often these bursts of rain are poorly predicted by forecasts, so sometimes we don't even know we'll have a thunderstorm until maybe an hour or 30 minutes ahead of time.

888
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:52,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And if neither of us are home, then we can't do anything to defend our property.

889
01:24:52,095 --> 01:24:56,519
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would say that this has caused me sleepless nights and undue stress.

890
01:24:57,352 --> 01:25:05,974
[SPEAKER_12]: And even our kids who are eight and four worry about this, you know, kind of, you know, the property flooding.

891
01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:13,256
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is kind of our, right now, our best hopes of kind of resolving the issue.

892
01:25:13,276 --> 01:25:20,118
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kind of want to note that we are trying to be proactive about the situation just to kind of, you know,

893
01:25:21,559 --> 01:25:42,296
[SPEAKER_12]: restore our lack of worry about this being our home, rather than waiting around for something to change on the street that would cause the water to not crest over the driveway and into our garages.

894
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Brad.

895
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:55,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a hand raised, Elaine H. Name and address for the record, please.

896
01:25:55,773 --> 01:26:00,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Elaine Ho Gruchowski, 40 Lincoln Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

897
01:26:05,215 --> 01:26:06,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

898
01:26:07,336 --> 01:26:12,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the neighbor of 35 to 37 Lincoln Street across the street.

899
01:26:12,697 --> 01:26:13,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I can

900
01:26:16,717 --> 01:26:20,218
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmed that there's frequent flooding on our street.

901
01:26:20,878 --> 01:26:24,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Even before their building was built, we have frequent flooding.

902
01:26:24,498 --> 01:26:37,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanna say I support my neighbor proactively engage in a project to mitigate the damages to their house.

903
01:26:38,321 --> 01:26:42,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw the damages that was done to them, the stress.

904
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:48,990
[SPEAKER_01]: That they are experiencing and I just want to say, I support the projects.

905
01:26:51,312 --> 01:26:51,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

906
01:26:51,773 --> 01:27:01,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any other hands raised.

907
01:27:01,645 --> 01:27:03,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, do you have anything in email?

908
01:27:11,085 --> 01:27:16,149
[SPEAKER_06]: No e-mails are on this either now or previous to the meeting.

909
01:27:17,229 --> 01:27:20,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dennis.

910
01:27:22,393 --> 01:27:26,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair awaits a motion to close public hearing and enter deliberation.

911
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:27,557
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved.

912
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:31,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a second?

913
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:32,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

914
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:34,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike?

915
01:27:35,102 --> 01:27:35,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

916
01:27:36,203 --> 01:27:36,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim?

917
01:27:37,123 --> 01:27:37,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

918
01:27:38,004 --> 01:27:38,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris?

919
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:39,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

920
01:27:40,507 --> 01:27:41,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie, aye.

921
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:48,210
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike, go ahead.

922
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:53,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm supportive of this variance.

923
01:27:55,632 --> 01:28:04,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Clearly, there's an unusual topography with below-grade parking at one of the lowest points on the street.

924
01:28:05,555 --> 01:28:07,696
[SPEAKER_15]: It's causing some major property damage.

925
01:28:10,022 --> 01:28:13,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, this seems like a necessary solution to address that.

926
01:28:13,404 --> 01:28:35,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, yeah, weighing the hardship of this kind of regular need to guard the property against flooding with, um, against the potential detriment caused by being one,

927
01:28:38,109 --> 01:28:43,484
[SPEAKER_15]: parking space short of complying

928
01:28:45,342 --> 01:29:00,425
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, or conforming to the zoning ordinance, I think it's clear that, um, being one space short is not gonna provide, or is not gonna cause a substantial detriment to the neighborhood, and we're not gonna derogate from the intent of the ordinance.

929
01:29:01,065 --> 01:29:05,106
[SPEAKER_15]: This needs to be done to protect the property.

930
01:29:05,346 --> 01:29:12,507
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, as I understand it, this is gonna have to ultimately go through the city engineer for sign-off,

931
01:29:13,487 --> 01:29:16,128
[SPEAKER_15]: on the stormwater ordinance.

932
01:29:16,148 --> 01:29:27,031
[SPEAKER_15]: So in that sense, even though there hasn't been a specific upfront discussion, it sounds like that will just get addressed later in the process.

933
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:30,792
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm supportive of this proposal.

934
01:29:34,313 --> 01:29:38,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.

935
01:29:38,054 --> 01:29:38,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else from the board?

936
01:29:43,641 --> 01:29:46,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I also support this, Mr. Chairman.

937
01:29:47,703 --> 01:29:49,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry the homeowners have to go through this.

938
01:29:49,624 --> 01:29:54,726
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a big flaw in the original design of the structure.

939
01:29:54,746 --> 01:30:06,491
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably shouldn't have ever been allowed, but that's a good solution, if not, unfortunately, kind of an expensive one.

940
01:30:07,371 --> 01:30:10,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck, and I do support it.

941
01:30:12,859 --> 01:30:13,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chris.

942
01:30:17,081 --> 01:30:22,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I am also in agreement this, and it's very unfortunate that this is what you've had to deal with.

943
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:26,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I worry about storms, but that's just more gutters and runoff.

944
01:30:26,864 --> 01:30:28,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I can imagine having all that water coming into the basement.

945
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:34,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And appreciate Mike's analysis from a variance perspective.

946
01:30:35,107 --> 01:30:39,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree that this does not derogate at all from the intent of the

947
01:30:40,657 --> 01:30:47,463
[SPEAKER_04]: By law with regards to parking and Chris's aspect of, you know, the original development.

948
01:30:48,464 --> 01:30:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not catching this ahead of time.

949
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:02,636
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not seeing any other.

950
01:31:03,838 --> 01:31:10,961
[SPEAKER_15]: comment, so I'm going to motion to approve the parking variance for 35 to 37 Lincoln Street.

951
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:12,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second that.

952
01:31:14,142 --> 01:31:14,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mike.

953
01:31:14,662 --> 01:31:15,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jim.

954
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:16,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Christy Aveda?

955
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:18,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

956
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:20,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Caldera?

957
01:31:20,805 --> 01:31:20,965
Aye.

958
01:31:22,265 --> 01:31:22,905
[SPEAKER_04]: James Torani?

959
01:31:23,966 --> 01:31:24,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

960
01:31:25,206 --> 01:31:26,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie Thompson?

961
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:26,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

962
01:31:30,288 --> 01:31:30,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody.

963
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:40,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get the words, so that is approved.

964
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,629
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get that written up building commissioner.

965
01:31:43,649 --> 01:31:43,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

966
01:31:45,591 --> 01:31:47,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to mention that.

967
01:31:48,266 --> 01:31:59,853
[SPEAKER_02]: while you do have to wait for the appeals period, et cetera, et cetera, I would not hesitate to begin conversations and iron them out with the city engineer that doesn't have to wait to have a plan in place.

968
01:31:59,933 --> 01:32:03,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go when the time comes sooner, better, rather than later.

969
01:32:05,076 --> 01:32:09,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think we should proactively reach out to Owen and his team to discuss this?

970
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:10,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

971
01:32:10,179 --> 01:32:10,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

972
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:11,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

973
01:32:14,177 --> 01:32:18,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you commission and then, and I think you were on the call earlier, but I'll just reiterate.

974
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm going to write the decision.

975
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:28,805
[SPEAKER_06]: After I finished the decision, I'll file it in the city clerk's office from then there's a. Appeals period 21 days and then from there.

976
01:32:29,986 --> 01:32:31,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Once that period is done.

977
01:32:32,124 --> 01:32:33,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I can help you walk through at that point as well.

978
01:32:34,164 --> 01:32:38,105
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to the city clerk's office, basically they have a letter ready to go.

979
01:32:38,165 --> 01:32:44,706
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a boilerplate that they just fill in the dates and times, basically saying there have been no appeals during this time period.

980
01:32:45,346 --> 01:33:00,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that letter in hand with a copy of the decision, go to the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds and file the decision there, and then come back, and then go to the building department and say,

981
01:33:01,925 --> 01:33:04,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And I filed it with the clerk's office.

982
01:33:04,488 --> 01:33:05,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the letter with no appeal.

983
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:07,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to get my premise.

984
01:33:09,192 --> 01:33:09,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

985
01:33:11,534 --> 01:33:16,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I think Scott sort of said, you could actually do some of the initial stuff beforehand.

986
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:16,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct?

987
01:33:16,459 --> 01:33:17,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just when those.

988
01:33:18,621 --> 01:33:21,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's have everything sort of ready to go and then once you get everything.

989
01:33:22,735 --> 01:33:23,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll start as well.

990
01:33:23,976 --> 01:33:25,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

991
01:33:25,296 --> 01:33:27,017
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always file a building permit.

992
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't issue it technically.

993
01:33:29,558 --> 01:33:34,100
[SPEAKER_02]: But and then again, working with Owen and engineering, I would not hesitate.

994
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not affected by this.

995
01:33:36,701 --> 01:33:37,461
[SPEAKER_02]: The sooner the better.

996
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:43,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it, you know, it started when they can tell them not start to get cold out there.

997
01:33:43,783 --> 01:33:46,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So at some point, the ground will freeze.

998
01:33:47,605 --> 01:33:48,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas is coming.

999
01:33:49,026 --> 01:33:49,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Patriots are starting.

1000
01:33:56,054 --> 01:33:58,736
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope we get snow this winter, especially in the mountains.

1001
01:33:59,957 --> 01:34:00,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1002
01:34:01,298 --> 01:34:03,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like when my snow budget goes up.

1003
01:34:04,981 --> 01:34:05,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair enough.

1004
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:11,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody, for your time.

1005
01:34:11,585 --> 01:34:13,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate your patience with the meetings.

1006
01:34:13,887 --> 01:34:15,128
[SPEAKER_04]: We apologize for starting late.

1007
01:34:16,669 --> 01:34:19,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1008
01:34:19,491 --> 01:34:19,752
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1009
01:34:19,972 --> 01:34:20,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all.

1010
01:34:22,488 --> 01:34:25,670
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Dennis, we'll move on to administrative items.

1011
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:27,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have any minutes to review, correct?

1012
01:34:28,571 --> 01:34:36,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally just realized that someone had actually done them and I forgot to send them to you, so I'm sending to you now so we can approve them next month along with this month.

1013
01:34:39,656 --> 01:34:40,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1014
01:34:40,736 --> 01:34:46,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was it.

1015
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:48,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Any new items?

1016
01:34:50,782 --> 01:34:53,484
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, we definitely have some that will be.

1017
01:34:54,685 --> 01:34:58,848
[SPEAKER_06]: More than likely, it looks likely that we still have a meeting next month.

1018
01:34:58,868 --> 01:35:01,010
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple that are sort of in the approval process.

1019
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:01,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that.

1020
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:07,114
[SPEAKER_06]: 1 that on Elm Street is still being discussed.

1021
01:35:07,674 --> 01:35:14,239
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a 1 there, so and there's another 1 that I've been working with the homeowner, try to get their stuff together so they can file.

1022
01:35:14,859 --> 01:35:18,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if they can get it in shortly, we can have the meeting because I believe it's.

1023
01:35:20,222 --> 01:35:29,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the 26th, so if they can get it in, then it has to get okayed by Danielle and Scott, but hopefully we can, that might be one more.

1024
01:35:32,368 --> 01:35:33,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1025
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:38,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess for those that are on here, any conflicts with September 26th?

1026
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:42,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, Jim, or Mike?

1027
01:35:44,995 --> 01:35:47,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'll be here 26th.

1028
01:35:48,797 --> 01:35:49,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good, Jamie.

1029
01:35:58,975 --> 01:36:02,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'm, I will likely be here.

1030
01:36:02,798 --> 01:36:05,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's not worth moving on my account.

1031
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so officially is a maybe, but probably yes.

1032
01:36:10,843 --> 01:36:10,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1033
01:36:10,983 --> 01:36:13,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure with the three others, we'll have at least one other person.

1034
01:36:14,205 --> 01:36:14,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Mike.

1035
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:18,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, all right.

1036
01:36:18,787 --> 01:36:19,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, anybody else have anything new?

1037
01:36:22,089 --> 01:36:23,470
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to motion to adjourn.

1038
01:36:25,552 --> 01:36:26,132
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second.

1039
01:36:28,673 --> 01:36:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike?

1040
01:36:29,934 --> 01:36:30,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1041
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:31,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim?

1042
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:32,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1043
01:36:32,837 --> 01:36:33,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris?

1044
01:36:34,478 --> 01:36:34,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1045
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:35,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie?

1046
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:36,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1047
01:36:36,641 --> 01:36:38,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everybody for your time today.

1048
01:36:38,563 --> 01:36:38,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.
