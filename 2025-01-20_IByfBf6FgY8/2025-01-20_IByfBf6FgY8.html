    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1516.514s">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1518.821s">Thank</a>  you for being here this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1520.763s">You</a>  remind me of what I listen to this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1525.167s">Every</a>  MLK Day, I take a moment, usually with my kids, to watch the I Have a Dream speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1531.673s">But</a>  this morning, as I was shoveling snow, can I get an amen? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1536.703s">I</a>  listened to MLK's last speech in Medford when he said, I've already seen the mountaintop. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1548.233s">And</a>  I was reminded that that speech took place when there was a storm warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1554.438s">And</a>  at the beginning, he said, you are the kind of people that reveal you have the determination to go on anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1562.945s">And</a>  so I'm thankful to be in a room where there are individuals that represent a city that's determined to go on anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1572.088s">And</a>  we have, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1576.91s">So</a>  we are here to celebrate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1579.431s">We</a>  are here to reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1582.032s">And</a>  I hope if you're like me, you're here to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1586.494s">In</a>  fact, it might be good to say, I need to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1589.015s">Can</a>  you say that with me? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1591.687s">Can</a>  we say we need to grow? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1592.908s">We</a>  need to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1593.549s">And</a>  that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1596.251s">I</a>  grew up as the son of a basketball coach, which meant I got to be in locker rooms that were filled with basketball players of different colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1608.242s">And</a>  I was always comfortable being in rooms and having friendships across racial lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1614.568s">And</a>  I lived under the misconception that I was doing all that I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1619.89s">But</a>  it was several years ago when I started to understand it's one thing to be a racial reconciler. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1626.873s">It's</a>  a totally different thing to seek to be someone who brings racial justice anywhere and everywhere we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1636.477s">And</a>  so that's what today, that's what today is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1642.179s">And</a>  so I want to pray to Dr. King's God. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1644.281s">I</a>  want to invite you to join me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1645.622s">And</a>  if you belong to another faith expression, feel free to express your faith as you desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1652.969s">But</a>  let's pray together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1654.09s">Father,</a>  we thank you for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1657.013s">God,</a>  we thank you for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1660.056s">God,</a>  we thank you for this opportunity to celebrate and honor one of America's <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1667.182s">in</a>  the world's greatest servant leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1675.507s">And</a>  as we remember his life, as we celebrate his achievements, as we remember his sacrifice for justice, truly laying down his life, not only day by day, but ultimately, completely for the cause of justice, we ask that you would help each one of us <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1697.44s">grow</a>  just a little bit more to reflect the kind of living that he represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1705.185s">We</a>  need your help, we need your grace, and we thank you for what you will do in this hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1711.269s">We</a>  pray in Jesus' name, amen.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1725.448s">Okay,</a>  and now with words of welcome, may I present the mayor of Medford, my friend, Brianna. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1742.234s">Lungo-Koehn,</a>  for those of you that are new to the program.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1864.474s">Some</a>  would suggest that it makes little sense to reinvent the wheels, especially when the car is running good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1870.985s">We</a>  already know that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1874.206s">'s</a>  leadership in social justice and human rights was born out of his Christian upbringing and his life in the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1882.589s">Please</a>  welcome Medford Treasure Stacy Clayton as she ministers in song with one of Dr. King's favorite traditional hymns. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1893.973s">And</a>  she will be joined <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=1897.381s">by</a>  my friend and my piano player Jonathan Fagan.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2138.4s">Thank</a>  you so much, Daisy. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2143.023s">I</a>  always call you the soundtrack of Medford, because there's not an occasion or an event that brings us closer together that you don't show up at. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2158.094s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2162.642s">So</a>  eminently clear in the leadership and philosophy of Dr. King as a practitioner of nonviolent civil protest was his studied kinship with other global proponents of peaceful protest for social change. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2179.178s">Two</a>  such global peacemakers were Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2185.023s">All</a>  three men shared a legacy of personal sacrifice to the point where all three spent considerable time in prison on account of their beliefs and supporting activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2198.65s">During</a>  their incarcerations, Gandhi, Mandela, and King all wrote prolifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2206.093s">As</a>  we continue with today's proceedings, I will be joined by Medford poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram and the city's director of diversity, Francis Nwaje, as we each present letters written by Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Dr. King during their incarceration.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2239.319s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2328.038s">me?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2330.479s">I'm</a>  honored to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2331.399s">Thank</a>  you, Terry, for inviting me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2333.6s">It's</a>  lovely to be here to read with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2336.902s">August</a>  18, 1932, from Yarrawada Jail to the then Prime Minister of England, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2345.825s">fast</a>  unto death. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2347.807s">Dear</a>  friend, there can be no doubt that Sir Samuel Orr has showed you in the cabinet my letter to him of 11th March on the question of the representation of the depressed classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2361.082s">That</a>  letter should be treated as part of this letter and be read together with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2366.348s">I</a>  have read the British government's decision on the representation of the minorities and I have slept over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2373.032s">In</a>  pursuance of my letter to Sir Samuel Rohr and my declaration at the meeting of the Minorities Committee of the Round Table Conference on the 13th November 1931 at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2384.479s">James's</a>  Palace, I have to resist your decision with my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2389.76s">The</a>  only way I can do so is by declaring a perpetual fast unto death, from food of any kind, save water, with or without salt and soda. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2400.95s">This</a>  fast will cease if, during its progress, the British government, of its own motion or under the pressure of public opinion, revises their decision and their schemes of communal electorates for the depressed classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2415.222s">whose</a>  representatives should be elected by general electorate under common franchise, no matter how wide it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2423.804s">The</a>  proposed fast will come into operation in the ordinary course from the noon of the 20th of September next, unless the said decision is meanwhile revised in the manner suggested above. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2436.707s">I</a>  am asking the authorities here to cable the text of this letter to you so as to give you ample notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2444.312s">But</a>  in any case, I am leaving sufficient time for this letter to reach you in time by the slowest route. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2451.777s">I</a>  also ask that this letter and my letter to Sir Samuel Hoare already referred to be published at the earliest possible moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2460.584s">On</a>  my part, I have scrupulously observed the rule of this jail and have communicated my desire or the contents of the two letters to no one save my two companions, Sardar Vallabhai Patel and Sergeant Mahadev Desai. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2475.875s">But</a>  I want, if you make it possible, public opinion to be affected by my letters, hence my request for their early publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2484.742s">I</a>  regret the decision that I have taken, but as a man of religious faith, bent, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2491.527s">But</a>  as a man of religious bent that I hold myself to be, I have no other course left open to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2497.189s">As</a>  I have said in my letter to Sir Samuel Hoare, even if His Majesty's government decided to release me in order to save themselves embarrassment, my fast will have to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2507.573s">for</a>  I cannot now hope to resist the decision by any other means, and I have no desire whatsoever to compass my release by any means other than honorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2518.399s">It</a>  may be that my judgment is warped, and that I'm wholly in error in regarding separate electorates for the depressed classes as harmful to them or Hinduism. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2528.744s">If</a>  so, I am not likely to be in the right with reference to other parts of my philosophy of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2534.989s">In</a>  that case, my death by fasting will at once be a penance for my error and a lifting of a weight from off those numberless men and women who have a childlike faith in my wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2547.52s">Whereas</a>  if my judgment is right, as I have little doubt it is, the contemplated step is but a due fulfillment of the scheme of life which I have tried for more than a quarter of a century, apparently not without considerable success.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2572.436s">6</a>  October 1983, the Commissioner of Prisons, Pretoria. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2579.459s">Sir,</a>  we have been informed by the local authorities that in accordance with an instruction from prison headquarters, prisoners who are taken to doctors, hospitals, courts, et cetera, will in future be handcuffed and put in leg irons. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2599.188s">We</a>  are told that this is to be applied to all prisoners, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2603.97s">security</a>  prisoners as well as common law prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2609.753s">We</a>  wish to make an earnest appeal to you to reconsider your decision relating to security prisoners and allow the present position to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2622.859s">During</a>  the 20 years that we have spent in prison, there have been numerous changes in our treatment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2631.027s">Previously,</a>  we had been handcuffed when we were taken from Robben Island to Cape Town, but for a number of years, this has been discontinued. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2642.536s">We</a>  welcomed and appreciated the discontinuance as we welcomed all changes that were designed to alleviate the hardships of prison life and make our stay more tolerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2657.681s">Of</a>  special concern to us was the removal of practices which were not only outdated, but which were unnecessarily burdensome and humiliating. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2671.511s">While</a>  we do not wish to comment on the general security arrangements of the Prisons Department, we nevertheless wish to make some observations in support of our present appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2685.662s">One.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2686.883s">To</a>  the best of our knowledge, during the entire period of our incarceration, there has not been a single instance where a security prisoner has escaped or even attempted to do so while being escorted to Cape Town for medical reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2708.515s">Two,</a>  for the year and a half that we have been at POSMA, our experience has been that each time any of us was taken out, he was invariably accompanied by four or more warders, some armed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2725.771s">Often</a>  the warders were accompanied by a member of security police. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2732.284s">Three,</a>  this elaborate arrangement has been strictly applied in spite of our advanced ages and physical condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2747.958s">Four,</a>  in our opinion, such arrangements were and still remain quite adequate, and the additional restraints are totally unwarranted, burdensome, and humiliating. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2762.845s">This</a>  is aggravated by the great deal of attention and curiosity that is aroused among the public at the sight of handcuffed prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2774.668s">Five,</a>  we are certain that Robben Island and Palsmo authorities will be able to bear out our contention that security prisoners could not be accused of having abused the medical outings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2792.393s">Six,</a>  it has been pointed out to us and recently with greater emphasis that there is no distinction in the treatment of prisoners irrespective of whether they are common law or security prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2810.752s">7.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2812.134s">With</a>  respect, sir, may we remind you that this is not strictly in accordance with the factual position. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2821.126s">For</a>  example, security prisoners are denied the privilege of contact visits. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2827.955s">And</a>  generally, even though they may be classified as A-groups, they suffer from restrictions in their day-to-day stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2837.984s">Perhaps</a>  more important, security prisoners on the whole are being denied the facilities for remission and parole enjoyed by other prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2850.045s">We</a>  believe that the few to whom this dispensation was extended were given remission ranging from a couple of weeks to a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2861.972s">Eight,</a>  we submit that since differential treatment does in fact exist, there should be no reason why security prisoners should not be exempted from the instructions regarding handcuffs and leg irons. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2880.345s">Nine,</a>  lastly, from the point of view of health, we consider these new arrangements to be a decided disadvantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2891.693s">A</a>  number of us are suffering from high blood pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2895.775s">And</a>  it is important that when we are taken to specialists, we should be relaxed and completely free of tension. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2905.918s">it</a>  is likely that the humiliation and resentment caused by handcuffs will adversely affect our blood pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2915.627s">To</a>  an extent, therefore, this could be defeating the purpose of us consulting the specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2924.785s">We</a>  respectfully state that we cannot think of a single valid reason why this new restriction should be applied to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2935.488s">And</a>  we, once again, appeal to you to abandon them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2941.43s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2942.651s">Yours</a>  faithfully, Nelson Rohilala Mandela.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2955.678s">excerpted</a>  from Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2959.327s">'s</a>  letter from the Birmingham jail, April 16, 1963. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2965.652s">You</a>  may well ask, why direct action? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2969.735s">Why</a>  sit-ins, marches, and so forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2973.117s">Isn't</a>  negotiation a better path? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2976.519s">You</a>  are quite right in calling for negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2979.221s">Indeed,</a>  this is the very purpose of direct action. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2983.223s">Nonviolent,</a>  direct action seeks to create <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2989.132s">such</a>  a crisis and fosters such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=2998.999s">It</a>  seeks to so dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3004.636s">My</a>  citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the Nonviolent Resistor may sound rather shocking, but I must confess that I am not afraid of the word tension. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3017.286s">I</a>  have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3028.13s">Just</a>  as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3058.09s">The</a>  purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will invariably and inevitably open the door to negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3070.103s">I</a>  therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3074.463s">Too</a>  long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than in dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3083.409s">One</a>  of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3091.555s">Some</a>  have asked, why didn't you give this new city administration time to act? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3097.47s">The</a>  only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one before it will act. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3109.675s">We</a>  are sadly mistaken if we feel that the elevation of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3117.419s">While</a>  Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3126.101s">dedicated</a>  to the maintenance of the status quo. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3129.082s">I</a>  have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3139.389s">But</a>  he will not see this without the pressure from devotees of civil rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3144.632s">My</a>  friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3154.258s">Lamentably,</a>  it is an historical fact that the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3162.267s">Individuals</a>  may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture, but as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3175.94s">Justice</a>  too long delayed is justice denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3180.882s">We</a>  know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3187.365s">It</a>  must be demanded by the oppressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3190.847s">Frankly,</a>  I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was well timed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3198.09s">In</a>  the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3204.373s">For</a>  years now, I have heard the word wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3208.335s">It</a>  rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3212.636s">This</a>  wait has almost always meant never. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3219.058s">We</a>  must come to see with one of our distinguished jurists that justice too long delayed is justice denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3313.439s">Okay,</a>  live theater has moving parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3317.021s">Thank</a>  you so much Vijaya and Francis. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3321.102s">I</a>  stand with you in believing that all three civil rights champions changed the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3326.164s">Their</a>  sacrifices are both historic and well documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3330.026s">Sharing</a>  these reflections gives us the opportunity to see Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3337.209s">among</a>  his teachers and global contemporaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3342.751s">As</a>  we move forward, I believe that Dr. King would want us to be mindful of the worsening plight of new immigrants to America. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3352.167s">It</a>  would appear that there could be a dramatic shift in the federal government's response to the desires of many foreign-born travelers that want to become Americans, particularly those that are seeking to come here to escape horrible living conditions, violence, and considerable peril in their countries of origin. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3374.945s">So</a>  if you will indulge the poet in me to share a bit more, I'm going to have my musical collaborator and the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival, Jonathan Fagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3392.526s">Join</a>  me for a piece designed to highlight a less friendly stance on migrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3398.811s">This</a>  piece is called Alienation, and it's one of the tracks on a CD that we've recorded that meets at the intersection of jazz and social justice under the title of the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3414.822s">That</a>  CD is available today if you're interested, but please give this rendition a mindful listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3427.535s">Here</a>  is a fence without a gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3429.617s">You</a>  can't get in, you have to wait. <a

help us keep your kind at bay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3502.069s">Why</a>  do we feel that this is good? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3504.15s">Why</a>  can't we share the

<a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3602.087s">We're</a>  taking this country back to the time when a brown life wasn't worth a dime, except for the way it worked in the field, except for a bushel of crops to yield. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3613.092s">We're</a>  taking this country back to the day when white meant right in every way, when men of privilege could rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3623.497s">We're</a>  taking this homeland back to a season <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3627.406s">where</a>  hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods, the swamps, and bogs, where Confederate flags were boldly raised and crosses in the darkness blazed, and the land was full of racial hate served with grits on a breakfast plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3649.249s">You</a>  thought the worm had surely turned and young black bodies no longer burned, yet here you are again today with the specter of prejudice winning the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3660.673s">The</a>  maga caps we wear with pride, sure let us know who's on our side. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3665.815s">The</a>  pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3672.44s">Perhaps</a>  this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3678.043s">Until</a>  that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3684.826s">You'll</a>  pay a price as many misguided embrace the hate their voice provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3689.208s">His</a>  Twitter rants and sound bites full of ethnocentric cock and bull. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3696.297s">You'll</a>  pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls, where fences are the new condition announcing the refugees' abolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3708.584s">This</a>  isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist power, and yet the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've been concealing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3720.95s">So</a>  take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3726.303s">Our</a>  agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this dirt. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3732.147s">Tolerance</a>  is in short supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3734.448s">We</a>  won't let your kind occupy this sacred land our forebears built. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3739.351s">We</a>  don't subscribe to Anglo guilt. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3743.172s">This</a>  fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3748.275s">To</a>  all you aliens, we don't like strange. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3752.898s">No</a>  room at the end in our home on the range.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3773.145s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3774.646s">Thank</a>  you so much and Jonathan will be back to play a bit again later in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3780.851s">Okay</a>  so for the past couple of years at our MLK celebration we have continued a new WMCC tradition honoring community leadership in a number of important areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3794.367s">Today</a>  we'll award our third annual Drum Major Awards, picking up on Dr. King's notion of leading out and being engaged in the business of building beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3809.875s">These</a>  WMCC Drum Major Awards focus on the categories of civic engagement and public service, arts advocacy, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3821.667s">leadership</a>  in the faith community, and preserving the legacy of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3827.129s">Here</a>  to help present those awards are Lisa Crossman, the executive director of the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3846.991s">You</a>  don't always see him, although at six feet plus, plus, plus, he's hard to miss in a crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3856.173s">But</a>  he's very, very strategic about when he makes his appearances because he wants to have maximum impact when he's seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3868.855s">Our</a>  2025 award, Drum Major Award for Civic Engagement and Community Advocacy is presented to Reginald Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3883.97s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3885.846s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3889.093s">You</a>  know, my recollections of Reggie Graham are all basketball court recollections. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3896.334s">I</a>  recollect WMCC New Beginnings basketball squad down at Duggar Park, hooping, hooping, and hooping, day and night, just playing basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3909.857s">Also</a>  remember Reggie, obviously, is a stalwart at that Medford High squad that went to Tech Tourney back in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3918.205s">My</a>  recollections of Reggie Graham these days and Lisa's as well I'm sure are of an advocate and a you know kind of a little bit of a pit bull down in City Hall kind of making sure that you know some <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3934.472s">And</a>  you know tell the truth shame the devil that some justice gets done for the folks down in the lower half. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3943.756s">So</a>  Reggie we really appreciate you, you've been a champion you know in the parks and recreation commission and other aspects of the role of being out there for the West Medford community so we are happy to present you with this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3970.818s">All</a>  right, Reginald Graham, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3976.841s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3979.988s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3981.65s">Our</a>  next award actually was for arts and advocacy and creativity in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3988.336s">And</a>  it's to be presented to Earl and Tanya Howard. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=3994.201s">For</a>  those of you that don't know Earl and Tanya, founding principals of West Medford Open Studios. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4005.975s">So</a>  for those of you that aren't familiar with West Medford Open Studios, hopefully you'll familiarize yourself when it comes around again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4016.379s">But</a>  it is an opportunity and it has morphed a little bit, particularly after COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4023.562s">from</a>  being in individual homes in the West Medford area to being a big celebration in a single spot at Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4033.527s">And</a>  for the last couple of years, it's been really, really splendid to see the display of talent and the variety of artists that exist in Medford and the surrounding community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4044.953s">So</a>  if you <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4046.233s">have</a>  never been to a West Medford Open Studios when it comes around this year, you want to make sure that you get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4054.117s">Lots</a>  of things to buy and to try. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4056.758s">They've</a>  got loads of supply and they're all alive, none of them won't die. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4062.981s">You</a>  know, can't help it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4063.941s">It's</a>  the way my mind works these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4067.003s">You</a>  know, I rhyme and I remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4069.664s">In</a>  any event, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4072.102s">to</a>  our Earl and Tanya Howard, the Arts Advocacy and Creativity Award will be presented in due season. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4081.871s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4090.198s">Our</a>  next award is being presented posthumously and this is a difficult one for me to speak about because <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4103.868s">The</a>  life that I have in faith was influenced by a few people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4109.953s">My</a>  mother, the principal one, who said she always wanted to have a pastor in the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4117.038s">And</a>  Reverend O.G. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4119.38s">Phillips,</a>  and those of you who are Old West Medford know O.G. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4123.543s">And</a>  this woman who was always, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4129.295s">a</a>  mentor, a supporter, an advocate, and a cheerleader. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4134.98s">She</a>  was a principal connector in the interfaith community in Medford and she is and will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4143.587s">Leadership</a>  in the faith community, Reverend Dr. Florence Nottage King posthumously. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4154.098s">And</a>  I know Reverend King's daughters are here, Pamela and Paula. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4159.64s">So</a>  they're going to come up and accept the award.</p>

Cotter is an ordained pastor and minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4400.141s">She</a>  is a trained dancer and leads women and girls across New England in liturgical dance ministry, discipleship, and Christian evangelism. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4412.963s">Some</a>  of you all have seen Teresa dance solo. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4418.387s">Today,</a>  she is accompanied by some beautiful women who extend the outreach of liturgical dance all over New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4430.196s">So</a>  I'm going to bring Pastor Teresa up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4432.297s">She's</a>  going to introduce her compatriots. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4435.06s">And</a>  then we're going to have dancing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4458.915s">Good</a>  morning, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4462.583s">Good</a>  morning, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4465.762s">It's</a>  so good to see you all and to be with you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4469.164s">What</a>  a joy it is to celebrate the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4475.669s">and</a>  to celebrate the torchbearer that carried the torch with him and after him, Coretta Scott King. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4484.515s">I</a>  bring with me today, I feel like I'm home, I bring with me today two <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4491.88s">of</a>  my daughters in the faith and I would say a granddaughter in the faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4498.729s">Kadesh</a>  Sims Conroy and Tanya Langelo are spiritual daughters of mine who have been ministering with me for probably 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4510.203s">I've</a>  been able to not just minister with them, but to live life with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4516.705s">And</a>  our special guest today, my niece, Tanya's daughter, Olivia Langelo, will be joining us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4525.107s">And</a>  it was so important to bring Olivia with us today because of the celebration of Dr. King, because of the theme for today, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4535.809s">a</a>  piece, my piece of the dream, your piece of the dream, our piece of the dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4543.131s">What</a>  we're going to minister to you is a song that's entitled Believe For It. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4552.134s">And</a>  we believe that the dream that Dr. King spoke about <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4558.659s">at</a>  the March on Washington, that he spoke about in his letter at the Birmingham jail, that he spoke about in Medford before he died. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4568.467s">We</a>  believe that that dream carries on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4571.81s">But</a>  it doesn't just carry on because we talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4575.373s">It's</a>  because we are about it, that we do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4580.827s">The</a>  book that we're basing this piece on was written by Dr. King's granddaughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4587.55s">Her</a>  name is Yolanda Renee King. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4590.751s">And</a>  this book is entitled, We Dream a World. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4595.865s">Yolanda</a>  wrote in her book about how her grandparents encouraged her, even though she wasn't alive when they were alive, they encouraged her to carry the torch. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4610.095s">But</a>  not just the torch that they carried, a dream that she aspires to carry out as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4616.82s">So</a>  we encourage you today to believe in the dream that Dr. King spoke about, that Coretta Scott King moved forward, and the dream of unity, humility, mercy, love, justice for all, in spite of what's happening around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4636.149s">To</a>  carry that dream with you and to pass it on to those that are in the generations that are coming after you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4642.732s">Amen?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=4643.893s">Amen.</a> </p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8020.59s">Thank</a>  you, Shara. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8021.45s">Thank</a>  you, Callie. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8023.451s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8026.792s">I</a>  always know what to expect when I read my own poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8030.833s">I</a>  never know what to expect when someone else reads it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8035.054s">But</a>  I was riveted. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8037.414s">And</a>  I thank you very much for bringing your passion and your conviction to my words, and Callie, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8044.436s">for</a>  your bringing your warmth and generosity to the words of Langston Hughes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8050.761s">We're</a>  happy to have you with us here today and we appreciate your willingness to join from your home base of Arlington with neighboring West Medford at a time when like minds and hearts really need to work together across city lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8066.575s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8068.897s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8072.493s">So</a>  you may have noticed that today's program has showcased the amazing talents of some wonderful women. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8082.899s">That's</a>  no accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8088.562s">Fact</a>  of the matter is the movement, quote unquote, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8095.619s">was</a>  filled to overflowing with the talents and grace and intelligence and dynamism of amazing women. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8106.951s">Dr.</a>  King was blessed with tremendous relationships with great women who dynamically impacted his work in civil rights and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8118.5s">I</a>  think that the West Method Community Center, in fact, has been an incubator of more talented and inspiring women than I can easily recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8126.946s">I</a>  always want to be mindful of such important role models and contributors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8134.165s">So</a>  on to the next order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8136.405s">Now,</a>  it's always a challenge for me to come up with meaningful messages in a keynote address and speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8143.787s">Trust</a>  me, I've been on both sides, the giving and the receiving end. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8151.929s">So</a>  this year's selection for a keynote speaker really, really resonates with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8158.97s">The</a>  only concern I had was availability, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8162.7s">And</a>  that problem worked itself out fairly easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8165.341s">Kinship</a>  always helps in these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8169.563s">Celia</a>  Johnston Blue is a seasoned executive leader with over 30 years of leadership experience in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8180.288s">In</a>  2015, Celia collaborated with 12 women of color from across Massachusetts <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8186.571s">and</a>  led the development and public launch of the Massachusetts Women of Color Coalition, M-A-W-O-C-C, Incorporated. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8197.634s">In</a>  her current role as president and CEO, she is leading the organization to realize its vision and mission, which <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8208.775s">is</a>  strongly geared toward advocating for the voices of women of color to be heard and to be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8217.257s">Prior</a>  to her current role at Maywalk, Celia was the interim director of the Rhode Island Department of Human Services, a cabinet-level position reporting to Governor McKee. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8228.899s">Celia</a>  led an agency with approximately 1,000 employees in multiple divisions <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8234.58s">with</a>  a budget of approximately $900 million, providing benefits and services to 300,000 or one-third of Rhode Island's population. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8245.504s">She</a>  spent nine years in the transportation industry here in Massachusetts and gained national experience in multiple modes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8254.186s">First,</a>  appointed as a commissioner for the former Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8259.688s">She</a>  was later appointed as Deputy Registrar, Assistant Secretary of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and then promoted to Registrar, CEO of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8273.741s">Okay,</a>  now take that, just think about that for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8279.367s">The</a>  Registrar and CEO of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8285.32s">She</a>  is the first African-American in Massachusetts history to serve as that registrar for the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8292.23s">She</a>  holds a Bachelor of Science degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8294.434s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8294.935s">That's</a>  worth a clap. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8300.243s">a</a>  bachelor of science degree from Worcester State University, a master's degree in business administration from Anna Maria College, and is currently enrolled in the Ph.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8310.29s">leadership</a>  program at the University of Vermont. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8313.472s">She</a>  has received awards for her leadership and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and was named in the Power 50 <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8321.818s">Class</a>  of 2021 by the Worcester Business Journal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8325.299s">And</a>  in 2023, she received the Distinguished Alumnae Award from the Worcester State University. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8331.961s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, I present and please give a warm West Medford welcome to Celia Johnston Blue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8361.988s">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8362.99s">Oh,</a>  come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8364.973s">I</a>  know we just ate, but good morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8368.159s">All</a>  right, there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8369.962s">Can</a>  you guys hear me OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8376.987s">Thank</a>  you so much for having me today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8380.088s">I</a>  want to recognize the executive director, Linda Grossman, board president, Melinda Regan, board members, the mayor of Medford, other dignitaries, Rafael Parish Center, and the sponsors, staff, planning committee, and all the volunteers that made today's event possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8406.32s">I</a>  want to give a special shout out to Terry Carter, who asked me to speak today, and to you, the audience, for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8417.144s">So</a>  I say we give ourselves a round of applause for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8426.188s">I</a>  also want to recognize the awardees today for your work and your commitment, and stay strong and keep moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8437.172s">I</a>  want to acknowledge the fact that West Medford Community Center has been providing services and programs and activities and connecting people from West Medford, Mystic River Valley for over 90 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8453.519s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8454.879s">That</a>  is quite an accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8460.44s">I'm</a>  going to start by telling you just a little bit about who I am because I think that's important so that you can see the lens in which I am coming from and how it drives my work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8472.587s">I</a>  am very much the immigrant story. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8475.889s">My</a>  family is from Jamaica, an island in the Caribbean, West Indies. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8480.952s">Jamaica</a>  was owned and colonized by the Spaniards and English folks like the United States and so many other countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8490.143s">My</a>  family's roots and our lineage, black, West Indian, Scottish, and Irish, and I am still learning about my lineage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8499.412s">I</a>  am a mom, a wife, a sister, an auntie, godmother, friend, a boss, and proud daughter of Barrington and Valerie Johnston. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8512.93s">My</a>  family migrated to Jamaica, from Jamaica to this country, when I was 11 and a half years old, made possible by my Aunt Dorothy Vassell, my father's sister, whom we call the matriarch of our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8525.683s">I</a>  didn't know about racism until I came to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8531.109s">Although</a>  I experienced racism, I am grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8534.492s">that</a>  I also had a positive experience where some of my classmates were kind and open to this young Jamaican girl that came to their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8545.784s">Fast</a>  forward to now, I have a few decades of leadership experience stemming as Terry so eloquently introduced me today in many different sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8557.335s">And</a>  I have been blessed with most of my career to be in senior and executive level roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8563.046s">And</a>  trust me, I still have the scars for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8567.906s">Many</a>  years ago, God placed on my heart to start an organization focused on women of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8573.692s">As</a>  I know firsthand, the inequities that we faced just about on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8580.158s">Our</a>  organization is fondly called Maywalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8585.863s">We</a>  started with 12 brilliant women from across the commonwealth, and you can find their bios on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8593.226s">For</a>  those of you who might not be familiar with Maywalk, we are a statewide nonprofit organization, nonpartisan organization, based in Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8603.069s">And</a>  our mission is to address racial inequities as it exists for women of color, created by systemic, institutional, internalized, and interpersonal racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8614.413s">And</a>  we wanted to, as founding members, really call that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8619.195s">We</a>  provide programming, training, and we advocate for policies and legislation for a more equitable commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8626.719s">Our</a>  programming includes a leadership track for training and boards and commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8631.502s">We</a>  have an intergenerational leadership academy for women of color and high school girls of color, which includes a one-year mentorship program. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8640.227s">We</a>  are doing our part to encourage and empower and provide tools and strategies for women for personal and professional growth and advance their career and also inspire the next generation of leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8654.338s">With</a>  respect to our advocacy work, we have had overall four legislative wins and two ballot question wins. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8662.845s">And</a>  I'll just speak briefly about two of the wins we had last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8666.689s">I</a>  do want to say that we also were involved in the expansion of voting here in the Commonwealth called the Votes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8676.098s">We're</a>  involved in it during COVID when we have to rethink about how to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8680.902s">We're</a>  involved in that movement and then permanently expanding the rights here in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8688.429s">Last</a>  year, the maternity bill got passed, which expands access to midwifery, birth centers, and doula services and addresses postpartum depression. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8707.273s">Our</a>  ballot questions involve fair share, which is known as the millionaire tax for increased funding to schools and roads and bridges, and the Work and Family Mobility Act, which actually I started working on when I was registrar. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8721.469s">It</a>  allows immigrants to apply for a driver's license in Massachusetts regardless of their immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8732.657s">And</a>  lastly, the Wage Equity Act is when we talk about a piece of the dream, it means also a piece of the economic pie, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8742.448s">And</a>  so last year, we were in the steering committee for passing of the Francis Perkins Workplace Equity Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8750.376s">This</a>  is important for all of us in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8753.12s">It</a>  goes into effect in June of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8756.204s">What</a>  does it do? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8757.265s">It</a>  discloses to the employees who are being offered a promotion or transfer the range of what that position earned. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8766.396s">Right</a>  now, you don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8768.599s">You</a>  can do market research, you can get a sense, but you don't know what that company actually paid, and we know that our white counterparts are being paid more than we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8781.287s">It</a>  also discloses the pay range for anyone who wants to know in your organization what your role earned. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8792.887s">It</a>  also allows the attorney general to enforce the law for organizations who do not want to cooperate with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8804.292s">So</a>  this is, there's also new pay data reporting obligations, which I think is important, because we don't know if we're not measuring, we don't know how we're doing unless we really have the data to show us how we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8819.638s">So</a>  I'm proud to say that we're entering our 10th year, and yes, you can clap for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8829.725s">And</a>  you're all invited to our annual meeting and celebration next Saturday at the Beachwood Hotel in Worcester. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8836.77s">You</a>  can go online to maywalk.com and register. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8840.673s">And</a>  I encourage you to become a member and also become an ally and supporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8846.497s">In</a>  preparing for my speech, I went back and listened to many speeches and interviews that Dr. King gave. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8854.965s">One</a>  of the speeches that he gave to high school students talked about developing a blueprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8860.689s">I'm</a>  going to come back to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8862.791s">To</a>  realize our piece of Dr. King's dream, we must go back to some of the early days of civil rights movement, and we must understand the real history of this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8874.614s">I</a>  would encourage you to listen to this interview that he did in 1967 to NBC. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8882.216s">Watching</a>  and listening to these many interviews really gave me hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8886.497s">I</a>  was inspired, and it also affirmed our reality as black people that we cannot ignore. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8893.438s">Of</a>  course, I listened to his famous speech, I Have a Dream speech, but what I'm gonna do is focus on this particular interview. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8903.1s">The</a>  title of it says, in this rarely seen interview, King speaks bluntly about the new phase of the struggle for genuine equality and his continuous commitment to the civil rights movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8919.523s">The</a>  question that was posed to him was this, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8922.323s">Isn't</a>  it part of the dilemma now that people know that Negroes were being denied what was guaranteed by the Constitution, by the fact that they were citizens of this country, that when they were given those rights, did you feel like the white community said, well, we have given them all that we have now, and it's up to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8947.437s">Dr.</a>  King answered that the dilemma was deeper. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8950.18s">He</a>  was saying that the movement was in a transition period where we must be honest with America. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8957.668s">Honesty</a>  tells me to admit that America has broad racist elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8965.332s">that</a>  exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8967.533s">Racism</a>  is still alive and exists in American society. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8971.175s">There</a>  has never been a single, solid, determined commitment of large segments of white America on the whole question of racial equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8981.881s">We</a>  have to see that vacillation has always exists, and ambivalence has always exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8989.585s">And</a>  this, to me, is the so-called white backlash. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8993.587s">is</a>  merely a new name for an old phenomenon. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=8997.39s">I</a>  see the white-black backlash is a continuum in the same ambivalence and facilitation of white America and the whole question of racial justice that has existed since the founding of our nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9013.263s">We</a>  must see that in many of the people that supported us in Selma and Birmingham were outraged about the extremist behaviors towards Negro, but they were not at that moment, and they are not now, committed to genuine equality for Negroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9031.837s">It</a>  is much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to guarantee an annual income, for instance, to get rid of poverty for Negroes and poor people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9042.384s">It's</a>  much easier to integrate a bus than it is to make genuine integration a reality and quality education a reality in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9052.273s">It</a>  is much easier to integrate a public park than getting rid of public slums. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9058.958s">We</a>  are in a new phase where we've moved from the struggle for decency, characterized the struggle of about 10 to 12 years of the struggle, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9069.747s">for</a>  genuine equality and that is where we are getting the resistance because there was never intention to go this far. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9078.636s">People</a>  were reacting to Bull Connor or reacting to Jim Clark rather than acting in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9085.082s">to</a>  realization of genuine equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9087.864s">And</a>  Bill Conner, if you remember, ordered the use of hoses on the students that were marching. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9094.77s">And</a>  Jim Clark was the sheriff who did the violent arrest of civil rights protesters during Selma. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9102.753s">He</a>  was also reflecting on his I Have a Dream speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9105.777s">And</a>  during that period of the movement, he said, there was a great period of solid, a solid decade of progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9114.047s">And</a>  that dream, he said, at many points since then has turned into a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9119.113s">And</a>  so he admitted that he was very overly optimistic, but while he still had hope and faith in this country, this now needed to be tempered with the solid realism that we still have a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9135.025s">So</a>  I'm gonna focus on this response because we do still have a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9141.63s">This</a>  felt surreal to me because we're going through this very similar circumstances today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9148.115s">We're</a>  still fighting for equality in the world that we want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9152.837s">As</a>  I think about where we are in our society today, the polarization, the blatant racism, sexism language, this should be appalling and unacceptable to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9167.003s">In</a>  addition, we have ongoing wars. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9169.445s">Democracy</a>  is under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9171.647s">Voting</a>  rights are under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9173.549s">Reproductive</a>  rights are under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9176.152s">Diversity,</a>  equity, and inclusion is under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9180.115s">Critical</a>  race theory is under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9182.697s">And</a>  as a result, we have legislators debating bills and states banning books from schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9190.184s">The</a>  Supreme Court struck down the affirmative action and admission policies for colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9195.845s">Folks,</a>  structural and institutional racism and white supremacy still exist and it is heightened more than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9204.667s">When</a>  progress is made, white supremacists plot and attempt to take away the progress that we have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9211.429s">It</a>  is the very same thing that Dr. King was talking about 58 years ago, the white backlash. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9220.431s">Sadly,</a>  today, the words of Dr. King is still alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9224.495s">He</a>  said, I have a dream that my four little children will live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9236.625s">This</a>  really puts it in a nutshell for me on what we're still fighting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9242.51s">So</a>  how do we individually and collectively continue the struggle to realize the dream that Dr. King had? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9251.577s">And</a>  I would hope that all of us in this room want to see that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9256.862s">We</a>  can start by developing our own individual blueprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9261.385s">Begin</a>  by defining and developing your own values, what you need as an individual, what is the kind of life that you want to achieve, the kind of friends that you should be with, what does success look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9274.63s">Dr.</a>  King talked about a commitment to the eternal principle of beauty, love, and justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9280.312s">What</a>  is your commitment to advocating for social and racial justice? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9285.453s">What</a>  are the ways in which you will fight for a just society? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9290.215s">After</a>  we develop our blueprint, we can talk with others and see who we are aligned with, who's aligned with our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9297.259s">And</a>  from my perspective, the basic principle to understand the need for common decency and where we can collectively move the needle in addressing systemic racism and barriers that prevent us from our fullest potential and to hold America accountable, to live up to its ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9319.73s">We</a>  should focus on our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9322.171s">Be</a>  active in our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9324.351s">Be</a>  civically engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9326.712s">Public</a>  meetings, attend public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9329.473s">These</a>  days, you can see them online. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9331.294s">You</a>  don't even have to go in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9333.634s">Make</a>  sure you know who your politicians are. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9336.235s">What</a>  do they stand for? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9338.316s">Do</a>  they stand and understand and address racism? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9341.076s">What</a>  policy, what legislation are they planning to advocate for? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9346.278s">so</a>  that we can make continued progress in addressing systemic racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9351.601s">For</a>  one, we should be in Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9355.724s">The</a>  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act restores and expands voting rights across this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9367.191s">All</a>  of our congressional delegation should be for this law. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9372.334s">It</a>  has not been passed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9374.374s">That's</a>  something we can advocate for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9377.116s">Here</a>  are some ways in which I am leading and navigating in our world today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9382.438s">Love</a>  is one of my core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9386.2s">I</a>  am also using hope, faith to help guide me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9390.722s">In</a>  the Bible, hope is the expectation of something that is possible but not yet certain, while faith is the trust in something that is believed to be true even if it is not yet visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9406.629s">And</a>  for me, love is at the center of everything I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9410.23s">And</a>  in the Bible, the definition of love is this, in 1 Corinthians. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9417.112s">Love</a>  is patient and kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9420.232s">Love</a>  does not envy or boast. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9422.713s">It</a>  is not arrogant or rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9425.133s">It</a>  does not insist on its own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9427.954s">It</a>  is not irritable or resentful. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9431.735s">It</a>  does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9437.84s">Love</a>  bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things, and love never ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9449.801s">The</a>  last two are ways in which we can work together to fight for the world in which we want to see from the individual perspective and the collective perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9460.89s">In</a>  our leadership academy, we're teaching about transformative solidarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9467.135s">Transformative</a>  solidarity is changing our lives to change systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9472.476s">It</a>  is going through a metamorphosis within solidarity so that we, with privilege, can move differently, think differently, and engage differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9482.959s">It</a>  is a deep, it's a deep core change. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9487.28s">So</a>  as you think about this, think about a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9493.281s">into</a>  a completely different being. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9496.385s">It</a>  moves different. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9498.167s">It</a>  has access to different spaces and places where it once crawled. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9503.373s">It</a>  can now fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9505.556s">There</a>  are six key principles around transformative solidarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9509.981s">I'm</a>  going to focus on three. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9512.463s">Centering.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9513.645s">Transformative</a>  solidarity requires centering those most affected by systems of oppressions and shifting the power to directly impacted communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9527.239s">Commonalities.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9528.7s">We</a>  identify the values. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9530.582s">Remember</a>  I talked about the values that we're going to develop in our blueprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9534.946s">We</a>  identify the values and hopes that we have in common. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9538.989s">We</a>  build relationships through understanding our history of oppression and resilience without flattening or equating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9548.397s">Co-liberation</a>  is my favorite. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9551.32s">We</a>  work together towards our mutual freedom and redistribution of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9557.725s">This</a>  means dismantling the multi-generational legacies of white supremacy, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9564.29s">anti-black</a>  racism, and settler colonialism, and building a future toward a future where we all have what we need to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9575.053s">We</a>  can take the example of the Freedom Riders, groups of white and African American civil rights activists who participated in Freedom Rides, bus trips throughout America and the South in 1961, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9589.918s">to</a>  protest segregated bus terminal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9592.899s">It</a>  was successful because it showed that nonviolent direct action could do more than simply claiming the moral high ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9604.223s">In</a>  many situations, it could deliver better tactical results than either violent confrontation or gradual change to establish legal mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9614.767s">So</a>  here is a great example that we can be inspired on, and there are so many, many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9620.469s">So</a>  what else can you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9623.03s">Here</a>  in your local communities or in your professional worlds, I encourage each of you to find your voice, to do your part to make this world more equitable and inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9636.175s">You</a>  can do a small act that I believe will make a big difference, and that is to ensure that people of color and marginalized communities, people in diverse backgrounds and different social identities are always in the room and at the decision-making tables, particularly when decisions are being made about them or their communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9662.962s">We</a>  know that when diverse representations are in the room, where decisions are being made and voices are heard, we have better policies, we have much better outcomes, much better outcomes in organizations and in our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9680.062s">If</a>  you are in a leadership position, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9683.597s">ensure</a>  that a woman earns the same as a man for the same position, ensure black and brown people earn the same as their white counterparts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9693.12s">We</a>  can all be a part of this solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9696.501s">White</a>  supremacists and conservative groups are spending their days plotting and are attacking the progress that has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9707.845s">We</a>  must be 10 steps ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9712.087s">We</a>  can no longer be asleep at the wheel or sit on the sidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9717.889s">We</a>  must work together and find allies and supporters who have a solid, demonstrated commitment to social and racial justice and the fight for a more equitable and inclusive world. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9733.516s">We</a>  are stronger together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9741.953s">So</a>  I stand here before you today with much love in my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9747.358s">I</a>  have faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9748.639s">I</a>  am feeling incredibly hopeful, feeling blessed, and with much gratitude for Dr. King and so many other civil rights activists <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9758.807s">that</a>  came before me who dared to put words into action for a more equitable world, and although our history is marred with oppressive systems, our ancestors have shown us what transformative solidarity looked like back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9777.522s">The</a>  stakes are much higher now, so I encourage us all today to take on new transformative solidarity ways of sticking together, supporting each other for the world that we want, this peaceful world that we want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9794.502s">So</a>  let's be inspired by Dr. King and the civil rights movement and the progress that has been made, but admit that we have much more work to do, and let's recommit to doing our part for a more just society. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9812.816s">So</a>  finally, I will leave you with a quote from Doctrine for Dr. King. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9820.166s">We</a>  must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9829.574s">Thank</a>  you so much for listening today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9831.956s">Enjoy</a>  the rest of your day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9851.911s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9853.693s">Thank</a>  you so much, Celia. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9855.574s">You</a>  definitely understood the assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9859.718s">And</a>  we're so glad that you agreed to join us today as we reflect upon our own pieces of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.' <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9867.185s">'s</a>  dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9871.136s">You</a>  have been a great audience in braving the elements to join us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9875.721s">We're</a>  New Englanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9879.184s">We're</a>  supposed to be resilient and strong and not let the weather affect what we think we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9885.03s">But</a>  five or six inches of snow hits. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9889.795s">Because</a>  somebody got to get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9892.557s">And</a>  that somebody today was me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9894.398s">And</a>  I was out in Randolph saying, man, we going to be able to get to Medford today? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9901.88s">But</a>  my wife was very encouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9903.72s">And</a>  she said, if you go out and shovel us out, we'll be able to get to Medford today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9912.072s">And</a>  we're here, we did arrive, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9918.156s">As</a>  we move toward the close of this program, I would repeat that no such gathering will be complete if we didn't link arms and sing together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9927.702s">So</a>  here to present and lead us in another of Dr. King's favorite spirituals, We Shall Overcome, is the living, breathing soundtrack of Medford, Stacey Clayton, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9938.388s">accompanied</a>  once again by my good friend pianist Jonathan Fagan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9945.831s">And</a>  also I have invited our dancers to join us for We Shall Overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9951.734s">All</a>  right it is your turn everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9953.475s">If</a>  you would like you can stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9956.456s">If</a>  you would like to go ahead and sing with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9960.018s">We</a>  shall overcome, not I shall overcome, we shall overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9966.8s">It's</a>  not so easy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9968.481s">But</a>  we can do all things, as the book says, through Christ who strengthens us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9974.145s">So</a>  as long as we are armed for each other in many ways, we'll get to where our destination needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9983.993s">We</a>  just have to look out for each other, no matter what comes this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9988.149s">We</a>  shall overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9990.17s">We</a>  have a charge today that we've been given, and each one of us has a part to play in our own circle of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=9999.373s">And</a>  our destiny is what we make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10001.934s">So</a>  let's sing together, we shall overcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10016.258s">We</a>  shall overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10022.389s">We</a>  shall overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10028.5s">We</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10047.619s">I</a>  do believe that we shall overcome someday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10060.583s">Cause</a>  we'll walk hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10064.745s">We'll</a>  walk hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10071.087s">We'll</a>  walk hand in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10108.458s">And</a>  we are not afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10111.039s">We</a>  are not afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10115.201s">We</a>  are not afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10121.543s">We're</a>  not afraid today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10126.565s">We</a>  are <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10155.504s">afraid.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10157.445s">Not</a>  today, not tomorrow, not any day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10162.867s">Oh</a>  no, we are not afraid today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10174.112s">We</a>  shall stand together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10177.233s">We</a>  shall stand together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10183.5s">We</a>  shall stand together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10189.727s">We</a>  shall stand together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10215.781s">shall</a>  stand together someday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10222.046s">The</a>  truth will make us free. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10226.709s">The</a>  truth will make us free. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10232.874s">The</a>  truth will make us free. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10239.117s">The</a>  truth will make us free someday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10249.74s">Oh,</a>  deep in my heart, I do believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10264.721s">that</a>  we truth will set us free someday and we shall all live in peace we shall live in <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10282.73s">♪</a>  We shall live in peace ♪ We shall live in peace ♪ Someday ♪ Oh, deep in my heart <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10321.899s">someday.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10325.965s">That</a>  we shall live in peace someday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10351.627s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10352.027s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10353.847s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10354.508s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10356.568s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10357.328s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10357.868s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10358.328s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10360.369s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10367.87s">So</a>  Celia made mention of a charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10378.923s">no</a>  gathering of this type is complete without one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10383.886s">So</a>  from one important tradition to the next I would like to bring another friend front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10389.328s">Nicole</a>  Mosalam is a dedicated advocate for social justice, equity and interfaith connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10396.252s">She</a>  is committed to ensuring that no one feels unsafe or unwelcome in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10401.394s">As</a>  a Muslim woman <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10403.035s">Her</a>  activism is deeply rooted in faith and the principle of loving for others what she loves for herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10411.202s">She</a>  is a former executive director of the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford and a state representative candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10419.328s">Nicole</a>  has worked to build inclusive communities, amplify marginalized voices, and foster meaningful dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10428.553s">I</a>  greatly admire this woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10431.935s">Like</a>  myself, she's a cancer survivor and a fighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10435.737s">I've</a>  asked her to deliver our charge as we leave this gathering to continue on in this kindred journey to beloved community in Medford and beyond, Nicole Moselam.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10461.525s">Good</a>  afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10467.688s">Thank</a>  you, everybody, for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10471.23s">Thank</a>  you for all of the organizers and everyone who helped make this possible today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10476.633s">And</a>  we believe you are here today because you share the values that Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10487.378s">so</a>  courageously championed throughout his historic life <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10492.385s">You</a>  care about equal protection under the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10496.928s">You</a>  care about voting rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10500.09s">You</a>  care about access in housing and equity, employment, education, and health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10509.095s">And</a>  you care about the nonviolent pursuit of peace, equality, and the best vision of America we can show to the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10520.602s">even</a>  amongst this darkest time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10525.104s">And</a>  so today, I hope you've learned something meaningful, had conversations that inspired connection with your neighbors, and found a moment of peace amidst the challenges of our times. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10538.829s">These</a>  moments are powerful. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10541.831s">They</a>  remind us of our shared humanity and the resilience of our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10548.413s">But</a>  most importantly, we are reminded of the strength of the backs of those who have carried us to this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10560.88s">Now,</a>  I've been asked to take the energy that we've created here together and turn it into a charge, a call to action that carries us forward as a beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10578.191s">I'm</a>  really humbled by this responsibility, but also resolute in using these moments to share something of value as we leave here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10590.14s">Don't</a>  let this be the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10593.523s">There</a>  are three guiding principles I believe Dr. King would urge us to embrace as we move forward together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10604.057s">First,</a>  Dr. King would remind us to communicate with one another with respect and honesty. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10612.159s">He</a>  would encourage us to view our differences not as barriers, but as opportunities to learn, grow, and find common ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10624.422s">Second,</a>  Dr. King would call us to let faith be a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10631.422s">He</a>  believed in the power of earnest faith, not just as a spiritual anchor, but as a means to connect across denominations, expressions, and styles of worship. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10645.516s">Faith</a>  can unite us when we let in, and we let others in, helping us see the divine in one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10656.498s">And</a>  finally, Dr. King would urge us to stand united against social injustice, poverty, and indifference. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10667.805s">He</a>  would implore us to vote our consciences, to resist the coercion of rights for marginalized people, and to act with integrity and purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10679.594s">So</a>  as we leave this gathering, I charge you with three actionable commitments. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10688.868s">First,</a>  engage with your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10692.791s">Go</a>  beyond surface interactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10696.654s">Meet</a>  in community spaces, city halls, parks, libraries, coffee shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10705.02s">The</a>  potential is limitless. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10707.462s">And</a>  have meaningful conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10710.384s">Get</a>  to know one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10713.066s">Speak</a>  respectfully and honestly, even when it feels uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10720.522s">for</a>  what is growth without a little discomfort. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10727.289s">Connection</a>  starts with showing up first. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10731.47s">Second,</a>  let your faith be a force for unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10737.454s">Whether</a>  you find it in a mosque, a temple, a church, or a quiet moment in nature, let your faith inspire you to reach out, learn, and build bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10752.863s">As</a>  Celia reminded me in her speech with us today, one of our shared prophets said, <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10762.351s">Faith,</a>  hope, and love. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10765.432s">Let</a>  these be held amongst you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10768.734s">But</a>  the greatest of these is love. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10773.556s">And</a>  for my own faith tradition, which I believe amplifies that message, none of you have faith until you love for your brother what you love for yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10792.275s">Now</a>  finally, be a voice for what is fair, just, and true. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10800.918s">Vote</a>  not just as a civic duty, but as an expression of hope and accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10806.94s">Advocate</a>  for what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10809.261s">Encourage</a>  others to stay hopeful, engaged, and grounded in love, even when the world provokes us to anger or despair. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10820.307s">and</a>  remember to do it without compromise to yourself and with the best of intentions and integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10830.933s">Dr.</a>  King dreamed of an America where people are judged by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10843.024s">And</a>  I dare say that he would even add to that now as we seek to divide ourselves even more with arbitrary labels. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10854.232s">He</a>  envisioned a nation where darkness is driven out by light and where love transforms enemies into friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10864.379s">That</a>  dream belongs to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10868.842s">We</a>  each hold a piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10872.181s">And</a>  when we come together, those pieces form something extraordinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10880.433s">So</a>  as we leave here today, let us carry forward the sacred trust of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., his vision, his courage, and his unyielding faith in the power of community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10898.477s">Dr.</a>  King once said, not everybody can be famous. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10903.658s">But</a>  everybody can be great because greatness is determined by service. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10912.163s">So</a>  I invite you all today, when you leave here, join together in that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10920.929s">Thank</a>  you for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10923.491s">Thank</a>  you for your determination to serve and for your commitment to living out the promise of Dr. King's dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10933.376s">not</a>  just his dream, but I believe the dream of everyone who has struggled and fought so that we may all be equal to each other, so that we may all love one another as human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10952.584s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10962.947s">All</a>  right okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10967.712s">So</a>  as we wrap things up I am going to cede the floor to Lisa Crossman our executive director to acknowledge and to thank some folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10979.064s">Please</a>  show your love for Lisa and give her attention for just a few minutes more.</p>

    <p>[mBOS9fhmkww_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10994.336s">Hold</a>  the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10996.978s">So</a>  I'm not going to keep you long. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=10998.539s">I</a>  just wanted to say a few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11002.681s">If</a>  you did not know, this year marks the 90th anniversary of the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11007.304s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11008.405s">Applause</a>  for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11010.326s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11013.339s">It's</a>  a testament to the enduring spirit and unwavering support of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11018.961s">Founded</a>  in 1935, the West Medford Community Center began as a small gathering place for black residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11025.704s">Over</a>  the years, it has grown to the cornerstone of this community, adapting to the changing needs and expanding its services. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11034.067s">This</a>  year's theme, Your Piece of the Dream, a powerful reminder of the collective effort required to achieve Dr. King's vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11046.688s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11047.529s">Dr.</a>  King was indeed a powerful advocate for the empowerment of black people and fought tirelessly against racial oppression. <a href="https://youtu.be/IByfBf6FgY8&t=11054.616s">Events</a>  like this are crucial in keeping Dr. King's spirit and mission alive. <a
