42
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:41,455
[SPEAKER_07]: There are men's and ladies' rooms on this floor as you go out that door against the wall.

00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:42,275
[SPEAKER_07]: OK?

44
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,217

00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:47,378
[SPEAKER_07]: OK?

00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:48,739
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

47
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Cell phone etiquette.

48
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

49
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the world that we live in.

50
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:57,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in it too.

51
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

52
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,946
[SPEAKER_07]: We strive for immediacy.

53
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:07,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make sure that we send pictures to everybody and that whole thing.

54
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:15,155
[SPEAKER_07]: But today, we're going to live as much as possible in the present.

55
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:19,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can just silence your cell phones.

56
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,771
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

57
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:25,093
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

58
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:31,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, friends, family, and neighbors.

59
00:21:32,662 --> 00:21:40,390
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services and some special programs at the West Medford Community Center.

60
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:48,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Just want to make sure we're all in the same room.

61
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:52,146
[SPEAKER_07]: We are extremely grateful to St.

62
00:21:52,226 --> 00:22:01,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Raphael Parish and Father Paul Coughlin for making this spacious function room available to us for today's important proceedings.

63
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:19,736
[SPEAKER_07]: We are also very appreciative of all that Medford Community Media and station manager Kevin Harrington has done to allow us to broadcast the program on local cable or however that is happening, technical, not my area of expertise.

64
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:33,867
[SPEAKER_07]: But with Kevin today are Mark Davidson and Jonathan Malerba ably assisting so we will get good pictures.

65
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay thank you, thank you.

66
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright now I know a little bit of this has been going on already but

67
00:22:45,103 --> 00:23:02,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we get going and in the interest of establishing immediate community beyond our own front doors, please take a minute or two and introduce yourself to one person that you don't know.

68
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

69
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:14,442
[SPEAKER_07]: One person that you don't know and if this goes off the rails, all right, as it already has, charge it to my head and not to my heart.

70
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:18,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Today for us, love is the answer.

71
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:28,132
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

72
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:02,218
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

73
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:04,019
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

74
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

75
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:08,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

76
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:10,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

77
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:12,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

78
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:15,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody get back to your tables.

79
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:22,406
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

80
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:26,388
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

81
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:27,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

82
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:28,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

83
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:28,989
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

84
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,330
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

85
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:33,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

86
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very good.

87
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:41,105
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fun.

88
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:44,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get this party started.

89
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:46,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

90
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:47,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

91
00:24:50,215 --> 00:25:00,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Please allow me to introduce my good friend and fellow pastor Tanner Turley of Medford's Redemption Hill Church, who will offer an invocation for today's gathering.

92
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:09,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Tanner is an amazing faith leader and leads a dynamic Christian fellowship every Sunday at Medford High's Karen Auditorium.

93
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:16,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.

94
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here this morning.

95
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:25,087
[SPEAKER_00]: You remind me of what I listen to this morning.

96
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:31,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Every MLK Day, I take a moment, usually with my kids, to watch the I Have a Dream speech.

97
00:25:31,673 --> 00:25:35,117
[SPEAKER_00]: But this morning, as I was shoveling snow, can I get an amen?

98
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:47,232
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to MLK's last speech in Memphis when he said, I've already seen the mountaintop.

99
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:53,637
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was reminded that that speech took place when there was a storm warning.

100
00:25:54,438 --> 00:26:02,224
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the beginning, he said, you are the kind of people that reveal you have the determination to go on anyway.

101
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:11,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm thankful to be in a room where there are individuals that represent a city that's determined to go on anyway.

102
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,209
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, yes.

103
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are here to celebrate.

104
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:20,952
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here to reflect.

105
00:26:22,032 --> 00:26:25,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope if you're like me, you're here to grow.

106
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:28,975
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it might be good to say, I need to grow.

107
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:29,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say that with me?

108
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:32,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we say we need to grow?

109
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:33,529
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to grow.

110
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:36,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is true.

111
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:47,462
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up as the son of a basketball coach, which meant I got to be in locker rooms that were filled with basketball players of different colors.

112
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:53,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always comfortable being in rooms and having friendships across racial lines.

113
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:58,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lived under the misconception that I was doing all that I could.

114
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:06,213
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was several years ago when I started to understand it's one thing to be a racial reconciler.

115
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:15,736
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a totally different thing to seek to be someone who brings racial justice anywhere and everywhere we can.

116
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:20,438
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what today, that's what today is about.

117
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:24,241
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to pray to Dr. King's God.

118
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:25,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to invite you to join me.

119
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:32,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you belong to another faith expression, feel free to express your faith as you desire.

120
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:34,030
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's pray together.

121
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Father, we thank you for today.

122
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:39,415
[SPEAKER_00]: God, we thank you for this community.

123
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:46,321
[SPEAKER_00]: God, we thank you for this opportunity to celebrate and honor one of America's

124
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:54,006
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world's greatest servant leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

125
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:16,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we remember his life, as we celebrate his achievements, as we remember his sacrifice for justice, truly laying down his life, not only day by day, but ultimately, completely for the cause of justice, we ask that you would help each one of us

126
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,264
[SPEAKER_00]: grow just a little bit more to reflect the kind of living that he represented.

127
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:31,249
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help, we need your grace, and we thank you for what you will do in this hour.

128
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:33,410
[SPEAKER_00]: We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

129
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:41,836
Okay.

130
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and now with words of welcome, may I present the mayor of Medford, my friend, Brianna.

131
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:04,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Lungo Kern, for those of you that are new to the program.

132
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:07,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Brianna is fine, thank you.

133
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:08,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Terry.

134
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:11,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning, everyone.

135
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm honored to be here today to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'

136
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,433
[SPEAKER_10]: 's life and legacy with you all.

137
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:34,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to everyone who makes this wonderful event possible, the West Medford Community Center for organizing and running this event, led by Executive Director Lisa Crossman and Terry Carter, Medford Community Media for being with us today, St.

138
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:43,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Rayfield's Parish for hosting, and Wegmans, the Mystic Valley branch of the NAACP, and Needham Bank for your support and sponsorship.

139
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:52,664
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have an amazing keynote speaker with us today, Celia Johnston, Blue of the Massachusetts Women of Color Coalition.

140
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being here and offering your words and insights.

141
00:29:57,393 --> 00:30:04,075
[SPEAKER_10]: This year's theme, your piece of the dream, is an important idea and deserves our thought and reflection.

142
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,077
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have dreams of a brighter, more peaceful, and united future.

143
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,280
[SPEAKER_10]: We all strive to be more caring, more forgiving, and more empathetic of one another's situations.

144
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:20,713
[SPEAKER_10]: But making these dreams a reality is harder than it looks.

145
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:25,675
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we must look to the past before making our plans for the future.

146
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:31,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. King's words and actions provide us with a roadmap to equality and equity.

147
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:36,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's up to us to emulate those ideals and put them into action in our lives.

148
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:44,962
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's strive to do better each day together as a community continuing to reach our goal of equality for all.

149
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to the wonderful program.

150
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:49,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having me and can't wait.

151
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:57,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

152
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:10,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Some would suggest that it makes little sense to reinvent the wheels, especially when the car is running good.

153
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:14,226
[SPEAKER_07]: We already know that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'

154
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:21,769
[SPEAKER_07]: 's leadership in social justice and human rights was born out of his Christian upbringing and his life in the church.

155
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:32,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Please welcome Medford Treasure Stacy Clayton as she ministers in song with one of Dr. King's favorite traditional hymns.

156
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:35,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And she will be joined

157
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:43,111
[SPEAKER_07]: by my friend and my piano player Jonathan Fagan.

158
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful to be back family.

159
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:30,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Precious Lord, take my hand.

160
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:34,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Lead me on.

161
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Help me stand.

162
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I am tired.

163
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:49,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I am weak, I am worn.

164
00:32:50,168 --> 00:33:03,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light.

165
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:06,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Take my hand.

166
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:36,479
[SPEAKER_03]: ♪ Precious Lord, lead me home ♪ When my way grows drear ♪ Precious Lord, linger near ♪ When my life is over

167
00:33:56,678 --> 00:33:58,118
[SPEAKER_03]: lest I fall.

168
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:12,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.

169
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:40,675
[SPEAKER_03]: When the darkness appears and the night draws so near, and the day is past and gone,

170
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:09,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Precious love

171
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Daisy.

172
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:57,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I always call you the soundtrack of Medford, because there's not an occasion or an event that brings us closer together that you don't show up at.

173
00:35:58,094 --> 00:35:59,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for that.

174
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:18,217
[SPEAKER_07]: So eminently clear in the leadership and philosophy of Dr. King as a practitioner of nonviolent civil protest was his studied kinship with other global proponents of peaceful protest for social change.

175
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:23,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Two such global peacemakers were Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.

176
00:36:25,023 --> 00:36:37,858
[SPEAKER_07]: All three men shared a legacy of personal sacrifice to the point where all three spent considerable time in prison on account of their beliefs and supporting activities.

177
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:45,213
[SPEAKER_07]: During their incarcerations, Gandhi, Mandela, and King all wrote prolifically.

178
00:36:46,093 --> 00:37:06,121
[SPEAKER_07]: As we continue with today's proceedings, I will be joined by Medford poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram and the city's director of diversity, Francis Nwaje, as we each present letters written by Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Dr. King during their incarceration.

179
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

180
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:04,911
it please.

181
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:48,158
[SPEAKER_16]: me?

182
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:51,359
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm honored to be here.

183
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,760
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Terry, for inviting me.

184
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,601
[SPEAKER_16]: It's lovely to be here to read with all of you.

185
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:04,765
[SPEAKER_16]: August 18, 1932, from Yarrawada Jail to the then Prime Minister of England, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald.

186
00:39:05,825 --> 00:39:06,826
[SPEAKER_16]: fast unto death.

187
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:20,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Dear friend, there can be no doubt that Sir Samuel Orr has showed you in the cabinet my letter to him of 11th March on the question of the representation of the depressed classes.

188
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:25,267
[SPEAKER_16]: That letter should be treated as part of this letter and be read together with this.

189
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:32,292
[SPEAKER_16]: I have read the British government's decision on the representation of the minorities and I have slept over it.

190
00:39:33,032 --> 00:39:44,439
[SPEAKER_16]: In pursuance of my letter to Sir Samuel Rohr and my declaration at the meeting of the Minorities Committee of the Round Table Conference on the 13th November 1931 at St.

191
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:48,461
[SPEAKER_16]: James's Palace, I have to resist your decision with my life.

192
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:59,949
[SPEAKER_16]: The only way I can do so is by declaring a perpetual fast unto death, from food of any kind, save water, with or without salt and soda.

193
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:14,642
[SPEAKER_16]: This fast will cease if, during its progress, the British government, of its own motion or under the pressure of public opinion, revises their decision and their schemes of communal electorates for the depressed classes.

194
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:22,564
[SPEAKER_16]: whose representatives should be elected by general electorate under common franchise, no matter how wide it is.

195
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:35,587
[SPEAKER_16]: The proposed fast will come into operation in the ordinary course from the noon of the 20th of September next, unless the said decision is meanwhile revised in the manner suggested above.

196
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:43,572
[SPEAKER_16]: I am asking the authorities here to cable the text of this letter to you so as to give you ample notice.

197
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:50,596
[SPEAKER_16]: But in any case, I am leaving sufficient time for this letter to reach you in time by the slowest route.

198
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:59,863
[SPEAKER_16]: I also ask that this letter and my letter to Sir Samuel Hoare already referred to be published at the earliest possible moment.

199
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:15,055
[SPEAKER_16]: On my part, I have scrupulously observed the rule of this jail and have communicated my desire or the contents of the two letters to no one save my two companions, Sardar Vallabhai Patel and Sergeant Mahadev Desai.

200
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:23,641
[SPEAKER_16]: But I want, if you make it possible, public opinion to be affected by my letters, hence my request for their early publication.

201
00:41:24,742 --> 00:41:30,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I regret the decision that I have taken, but as a man of religious faith, bent,

202
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:36,469
[SPEAKER_16]: But as a man of religious bent that I hold myself to be, I have no other course left open to me.

203
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:46,713
[SPEAKER_16]: As I have said in my letter to Sir Samuel Hoare, even if His Majesty's government decided to release me in order to save themselves embarrassment, my fast will have to continue.

204
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:57,698
[SPEAKER_16]: for I cannot now hope to resist the decision by any other means, and I have no desire whatsoever to compass my release by any means other than honorable.

205
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:07,924
[SPEAKER_16]: It may be that my judgment is warped, and that I'm wholly in error in regarding separate electorates for the depressed classes as harmful to them or Hinduism.

206
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:14,149
[SPEAKER_16]: If so, I am not likely to be in the right with reference to other parts of my philosophy of life.

207
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:26,559
[SPEAKER_16]: In that case, my death by fasting will at once be a penance for my error and a lifting of a weight from off those numberless men and women who have a childlike faith in my wisdom.

208
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:41,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas if my judgment is right, as I have little doubt it is, the contemplated step is but a due fulfillment of the scheme of life which I have tried for more than a quarter of a century, apparently not without considerable success.

209
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:58,219
[SPEAKER_12]: 6 October 1983, the Commissioner of Prisons, Pretoria.

210
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:17,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Sir, we have been informed by the local authorities that in accordance with an instruction from prison headquarters, prisoners who are taken to doctors, hospitals, courts, et cetera, will in future be handcuffed and put in leg irons.

211
00:43:19,188 --> 00:43:23,910
[SPEAKER_12]: We are told that this is to be applied to all prisoners, i.e.

212
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,892
[SPEAKER_12]: security prisoners as well as common law prisoners.

213
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:41,038
[SPEAKER_12]: We wish to make an earnest appeal to you to reconsider your decision relating to security prisoners and allow the present position to continue.

214
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:49,765
[SPEAKER_12]: During the 20 years that we have spent in prison, there have been numerous changes in our treatment.

215
00:43:51,027 --> 00:44:01,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Previously, we had been handcuffed when we were taken from Robben Island to Cape Town, but for a number of years, this has been discontinued.

216
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:16,141
[SPEAKER_12]: We welcomed and appreciated the discontinuance as we welcomed all changes that were designed to alleviate the hardships of prison life and make our stay more tolerable.

217
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:29,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Of special concern to us was the removal of practices which were not only outdated, but which were unnecessarily burdensome and humiliating.

218
00:44:31,511 --> 00:44:43,961
[SPEAKER_12]: While we do not wish to comment on the general security arrangements of the Prisons Department, we nevertheless wish to make some observations in support of our present appeal.

219
00:44:45,662 --> 00:44:45,742
[SPEAKER_12]: One.

220
00:44:46,883 --> 00:45:06,760
[SPEAKER_12]: To the best of our knowledge, during the entire period of our incarceration, there has not been a single instance where a security prisoner has escaped or even attempted to do so while being escorted to Cape Town for medical reasons.

221
00:45:08,515 --> 00:45:24,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Two, for the year and a half that we have been at POSMA, our experience has been that each time any of us was taken out, he was invariably accompanied by four or more warders, some armed.

222
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:30,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Often the warders were accompanied by a member of security police.

223
00:45:32,284 --> 00:45:44,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Three, this elaborate arrangement has been strictly applied in spite of our advanced ages and physical condition.

224
00:45:47,958 --> 00:46:01,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Four, in our opinion, such arrangements were and still remain quite adequate, and the additional restraints are totally unwarranted, burdensome, and humiliating.

225
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:12,630
[SPEAKER_12]: This is aggravated by the great deal of attention and curiosity that is aroused among the public at the sight of handcuffed prisoners.

226
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:30,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Five, we are certain that Robben Island and Palsmo authorities will be able to bear out our contention that security prisoners could not be accused of having abused the medical outings.

227
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:48,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Six, it has been pointed out to us and recently with greater emphasis that there is no distinction in the treatment of prisoners irrespective of whether they are common law or security prisoners.

228
00:46:50,752 --> 00:47:00,365
[SPEAKER_12]: 7.

229
00:46:52,134 --> 00:47:00,365
[SPEAKER_12]: With respect, sir, may we remind you that this is not strictly in accordance with the factual position.

230
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:07,114
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, security prisoners are denied the privilege of contact visits.

231
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:17,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And generally, even though they may be classified as A-groups, they suffer from restrictions in their day-to-day stay.

232
00:47:17,984 --> 00:47:28,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps more important, security prisoners on the whole are being denied the facilities for remission and parole enjoyed by other prisoners.

233
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:39,931
[SPEAKER_12]: We believe that the few to whom this dispensation was extended were given remission ranging from a couple of weeks to a few months.

234
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:58,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Eight, we submit that since differential treatment does in fact exist, there should be no reason why security prisoners should not be exempted from the instructions regarding handcuffs and leg irons.

235
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:10,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Nine, lastly, from the point of view of health, we consider these new arrangements to be a decided disadvantage.

236
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:14,875
[SPEAKER_12]: A number of us are suffering from high blood pressure.

237
00:48:15,775 --> 00:48:24,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is important that when we are taken to specialists, we should be relaxed and completely free of tension.

238
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:34,526
[SPEAKER_12]: it is likely that the humiliation and resentment caused by handcuffs will adversely affect our blood pressure.

239
00:48:35,627 --> 00:48:42,934
[SPEAKER_12]: To an extent, therefore, this could be defeating the purpose of us consulting the specialists.

240
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:54,688
[SPEAKER_12]: We respectfully state that we cannot think of a single valid reason why this new restriction should be applied to us.

241
00:48:55,488 --> 00:49:00,110
[SPEAKER_12]: And we, once again, appeal to you to abandon them.

242
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:01,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

243
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:06,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Yours faithfully, Nelson Rohilala Mandela.

244
00:49:15,678 --> 00:49:19,347
[SPEAKER_07]: excerpted from Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'

245
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:22,113
[SPEAKER_07]: 's letter from the Birmingham jail, April 16, 1963.

246
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:28,934
[SPEAKER_07]: You may well ask, why direct action?

247
00:49:29,735 --> 00:49:32,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Why sit-ins, marches, and so forth?

248
00:49:33,117 --> 00:49:35,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't negotiation a better path?

249
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:39,141
[SPEAKER_07]: You are quite right in calling for negotiation.

250
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:42,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action.

251
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:46,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Nonviolent, direct action seeks to create

252
00:49:49,132 --> 00:49:57,978
[SPEAKER_07]: such a crisis and fosters such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.

253
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:03,222
[SPEAKER_07]: It seeks to so dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.

254
00:50:04,636 --> 00:50:16,405
[SPEAKER_07]: My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the Nonviolent Resistor may sound rather shocking, but I must confess that I am not afraid of the word tension.

255
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:26,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.

256
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:57,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.

257
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:09,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will invariably and inevitably open the door to negotiation.

258
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:13,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation.

259
00:51:14,463 --> 00:51:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than in dialogue.

260
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:30,834
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely.

261
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:36,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Some have asked, why didn't you give this new city administration time to act?

262
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:48,675
[SPEAKER_07]: The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one before it will act.

263
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:56,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the elevation of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham.

264
00:51:57,419 --> 00:52:04,002
[SPEAKER_07]: While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists.

265
00:52:06,101 --> 00:52:08,522
[SPEAKER_07]: dedicated to the maintenance of the status quo.

266
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:18,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation.

267
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:24,112
[SPEAKER_07]: But he will not see this without the pressure from devotees of civil rights.

268
00:52:24,632 --> 00:52:33,678
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure.

269
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:41,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Lamentably, it is an historical fact that the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.

270
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:54,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture, but as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.

271
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:00,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Justice too long delayed is justice denied.

272
00:53:00,882 --> 00:53:06,825
[SPEAKER_07]: We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor.

273
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:10,147
[SPEAKER_07]: It must be demanded by the oppressed.

274
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:16,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was well timed.

275
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:23,173
[SPEAKER_07]: In the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation,

276
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:27,274
[SPEAKER_07]: For years now, I have heard the word wait.

277
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:32,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity.

278
00:53:32,636 --> 00:53:38,058
[SPEAKER_07]: This wait has almost always meant never.

279
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:48,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We must come to see with one of our distinguished jurists that justice too long delayed is justice denied.

280
00:55:13,439 --> 00:55:15,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, live theater has moving parts.

281
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:20,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much Vijaya and Francis.

282
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:25,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I stand with you in believing that all three civil rights champions changed the world.

283
00:55:26,164 --> 00:55:29,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Their sacrifices are both historic and well documented.

284
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:36,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharing these reflections gives us the opportunity to see Martin Luther King Jr.

285
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,630
[SPEAKER_07]: among his teachers and global contemporaries.

286
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:51,112
[SPEAKER_07]: As we move forward, I believe that Dr. King would want us to be mindful of the worsening plight of new immigrants to America.

287
00:55:52,167 --> 00:56:13,823
[SPEAKER_07]: It would appear that there could be a dramatic shift in the federal government's response to the desires of many foreign-born travelers that want to become Americans, particularly those that are seeking to come here to escape horrible living conditions, violence, and considerable peril in their countries of origin.

288
00:56:14,945 --> 00:56:25,691
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you will indulge the poet in me to share a bit more, I'm going to have my musical collaborator and the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival, Jonathan Fagan.

289
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:38,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Join me for a piece designed to highlight a less friendly stance on migrants.

290
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:54,322
[SPEAKER_07]: This piece is called Alienation, and it's one of the tracks on a CD that we've recorded that meets at the intersection of jazz and social justice under the title of the Ally Project.

291
00:56:54,822 --> 00:57:01,747
[SPEAKER_07]: That CD is available today if you're interested, but please give this rendition a mindful listen.

292
00:57:07,535 --> 00:57:09,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is a fence without a gate.

293
00:57:09,617 --> 00:57:11,179
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get in, you have to wait.

294
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,382
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't be foreign or somehow strange.

295
00:57:14,683 --> 00:57:16,965
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't your home, home on the range.

296
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:19,988
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't arrive in a rickety boat.

297
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:22,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Our castle has a treacherous moat.

298
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:25,674
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't host refugees at our door.

299
00:57:25,954 --> 00:57:27,736
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not the sort we're looking for.

300
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Take good note, we stay on guard, we don't want you in our backyard.

301
00:57:32,642 --> 00:57:38,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Despite the danger you seek to avoid, our best deterrents have been deployed.

302
00:57:39,445 --> 00:57:44,288
[SPEAKER_07]: You say your country's full of peril, but like stray cats, we think you're feral.

303
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:49,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We think you're prone to filth and crime, we don't want either at this time.

304
00:57:50,165 --> 00:57:51,706
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't care what the nations say.

305
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:53,807
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't do more than hope and pray.

306
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Our stance is clear on human rights.

307
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:58,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Lock the door, turn off the lights.

308
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,552
[SPEAKER_07]: You saw that statue in the bay.

309
00:58:02,173 --> 00:58:04,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It stood for liberty until today.

310
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:06,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It welcomed tired and huddled masses.

311
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:09,378
[SPEAKER_07]: not criminals from your underclasses.

312
00:58:09,899 --> 00:58:11,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got militias on the border.

313
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:14,224
[SPEAKER_07]: They own big guns to keep the order.

314
00:58:14,284 --> 00:58:20,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Law enforcement lets them stay to help you keep, to help us keep your kind at bay.

315
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:23,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do we feel that this is good?

316
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't we share the neighborhood?

317
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:29,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because you're black and brown?

318
00:58:29,713 --> 00:58:32,434
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we just choose to stand our ground.

319
00:58:33,235 --> 00:58:38,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay in your place, deal with your issues, we'll send lots of coal and tissues.

320
00:58:38,877 --> 00:58:42,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't form caravans and run, you'll find yourself in the sight of a gun.

321
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:46,843
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no streets here lined with gold.

322
00:58:46,963 --> 00:58:48,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Our eyes are closed.

323
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Our hearts are cold.

324
00:58:49,644 --> 00:58:52,065
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no flowing milk and honey.

325
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:55,007
[SPEAKER_07]: American skies are not that sunny.

326
00:58:56,387 --> 00:58:59,029
[SPEAKER_07]: The fences we build to keep aliens out.

327
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:01,070
[SPEAKER_07]: They serve to keep our faith devout.

328
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,611
[SPEAKER_07]: This land we scheme to make our own.

329
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:06,032
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ours, you see, and ours alone.

330
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,405
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you stay on the other side, we can maintain our national pride.

331
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:15,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't show your anguished faces.

332
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:17,992
[SPEAKER_07]: We're cutting back on other races.

333
00:59:18,452 --> 00:59:20,214
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had enough of global inclusion.

334
00:59:20,494 --> 00:59:22,597
[SPEAKER_07]: We're ridding this country of race confusion.

335
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:27,663
[SPEAKER_07]: We know how to win these fights and limit all these civil rights.

336
00:59:29,126 --> 00:59:33,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Safety nets in the welfare state will have to stop for the lost and late.

337
00:59:34,711 --> 00:59:39,595
[SPEAKER_07]: A rising tide that favors the rich, that's our favorite campaign pitch.

338
00:59:40,665 --> 00:59:42,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Me Too movements and Black Lives Matter?

339
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:45,148
[SPEAKER_07]: In all due time, your ranks will scatter.

340
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,750
[SPEAKER_07]: You think that you shall overcome?

341
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:50,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cross this line, we'll give you some.

342
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:55,816
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll give you a taste of burning churches and black boys hung from oaks and birches.

343
00:59:56,236 --> 01:00:01,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll give you a taste of incarceration and prisons.com, the corporate plantation.

344
01:00:02,087 --> 01:00:12,012
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking this country back to the time when a brown life wasn't worth a dime, except for the way it worked in the field, except for a bushel of crops to yield.

345
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:22,516
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking this country back to the day when white meant right in every way, when men of privilege could rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat.

346
01:00:23,497 --> 01:00:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking this homeland back to a season

347
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:48,068
[SPEAKER_07]: where hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods, the swamps, and bogs, where Confederate flags were boldly raised and crosses in the darkness blazed, and the land was full of racial hate served with grits on a breakfast plate.

348
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:59,653
[SPEAKER_07]: You thought the worm had surely turned and young black bodies no longer burned, yet here you are again today with the specter of prejudice winning the day.

349
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:05,775
[SPEAKER_07]: The maga caps we wear with pride, sure let us know who's on our side.

350
01:01:05,815 --> 01:01:11,257
[SPEAKER_07]: The pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe.

351
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it.

352
01:01:18,043 --> 01:01:23,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Until that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price.

353
01:01:24,826 --> 01:01:29,148
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll pay a price as many misguided embrace the hate their voice provided.

354
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:35,031
[SPEAKER_07]: His Twitter rants and sound bites full of ethnocentric cock and bull.

355
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:46,362
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls, where fences are the new condition announcing the refugees' abolition.

356
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:59,470
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist power, and yet the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've been concealing.

357
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:05,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard.

358
01:02:06,303 --> 01:02:11,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Our agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this dirt.

359
01:02:12,147 --> 01:02:14,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Tolerance is in short supply.

360
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:18,851
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't let your kind occupy this sacred land our forebears built.

361
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:21,973
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't subscribe to Anglo guilt.

362
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:27,635
[SPEAKER_07]: This fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late.

363
01:02:28,275 --> 01:02:32,338
[SPEAKER_07]: To all you aliens, we don't like strange.

364
01:02:32,898 --> 01:02:38,502
[SPEAKER_07]: No room at the end in our home on the range.

365
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:53,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

366
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:59,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much and Jonathan will be back to play a bit again later in the program.

367
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay so for the past couple of years at our MLK celebration we have continued a new WMCC tradition honoring community leadership in a number of important areas.

368
01:03:14,367 --> 01:03:28,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Today we'll award our third annual Drum Major Awards, picking up on Dr. King's notion of leading out and being engaged in the business of building beloved community.

369
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:39,079
[SPEAKER_07]: These WMCC Drum Major Awards focus on the categories of civic engagement and public service, arts advocacy,

370
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:46,349
[SPEAKER_07]: leadership in the faith community, and preserving the legacy of the community.

371
01:03:47,129 --> 01:03:55,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Here to help present those awards are Lisa Crossman, the executive director of the West Medford Community Center.

372
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:14,672
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't always see him, although at six feet plus, plus, plus, he's hard to miss in a crowd.

373
01:04:16,173 --> 01:04:28,595
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's very, very strategic about when he makes his appearances because he wants to have maximum impact when he's seen.

374
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:35,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Our 2025 award, Drum Major Award for Civic Engagement and Community Advocacy is presented to Reginald Graham.

375
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

376
01:04:45,846 --> 01:04:46,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So

377
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:55,314
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, my recollections of Reggie Graham are all basketball court recollections.

378
01:04:56,334 --> 01:05:09,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I recollect WMCC New Beginnings basketball squad down at Duggar Park, hooping, hooping, and hooping, day and night, just playing basketball.

379
01:05:09,857 --> 01:05:15,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Also remember Reggie, obviously, is a stalwart at that Medford High squad that went to Tech Tourney back in the day.

380
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:33,472
[SPEAKER_07]: My recollections of Reggie Graham these days and Lisa's as well I'm sure are of an advocate and a you know kind of a little bit of a pit bull down in City Hall kind of making sure that you know some

381
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:42,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know tell the truth shame the devil that some justice gets done for the folks down in the lower half.

382
01:05:43,756 --> 01:05:58,143
[SPEAKER_07]: So Reggie we really appreciate you, you've been a champion you know in the parks and recreation commission and other aspects of the role of being out there for the West Medford community so we are happy to present you with this award.

383
01:06:10,818 --> 01:06:13,019
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Reginald Graham, ladies and gentlemen.

384
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:17,161
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

385
01:06:19,988 --> 01:06:20,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

386
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:27,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next award actually was for arts and advocacy and creativity in the community.

387
01:06:28,336 --> 01:06:32,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's to be presented to Earl and Tanya Howard.

388
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:41,067
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you that don't know Earl and Tanya, founding principals of West Medford Open Studios.

389
01:06:45,975 --> 01:06:55,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So for those of you that aren't familiar with West Medford Open Studios, hopefully you'll familiarize yourself when it comes around again this year.

390
01:06:56,379 --> 01:07:03,142
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is an opportunity and it has morphed a little bit, particularly after COVID.

391
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:13,187
[SPEAKER_07]: from being in individual homes in the West Medford area to being a big celebration in a single spot at Duggar Park.

392
01:07:13,527 --> 01:07:24,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the last couple of years, it's been really, really splendid to see the display of talent and the variety of artists that exist in Medford and the surrounding community.

393
01:07:24,953 --> 01:07:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you

394
01:07:26,233 --> 01:07:33,677
[SPEAKER_07]: have never been to a West Medford Open Studios when it comes around this year, you want to make sure that you get out there.

395
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:36,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of things to buy and to try.

396
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:41,600
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got loads of supply and they're all alive, none of them won't die.

397
01:07:42,981 --> 01:07:43,921
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, can't help it.

398
01:07:43,941 --> 01:07:46,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the way my mind works these days.

399
01:07:47,003 --> 01:07:48,824
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I rhyme and I remember.

400
01:07:49,664 --> 01:07:50,505
[SPEAKER_07]: In any event,

401
01:07:52,102 --> 01:08:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: to our Earl and Tanya Howard, the Arts Advocacy and Creativity Award will be presented in due season.

402
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:08,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

403
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:21,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next award is being presented posthumously and this is a difficult one for me to speak about because

404
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:29,392
[SPEAKER_07]: The life that I have in faith was influenced by a few people in this community.

405
01:08:29,953 --> 01:08:35,036
[SPEAKER_07]: My mother, the principal one, who said she always wanted to have a pastor in the family.

406
01:08:37,038 --> 01:08:39,300
[SPEAKER_07]: And Reverend O.G.

407
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Phillips, and those of you who are Old West Medford know O.G.

408
01:08:43,543 --> 01:08:47,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And this woman who was always,

409
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:54,920
[SPEAKER_07]: a mentor, a supporter, an advocate, and a cheerleader.

410
01:08:54,980 --> 01:09:03,046
[SPEAKER_07]: She was a principal connector in the interfaith community in Medford and she is and will be sorely missed.

411
01:09:03,587 --> 01:09:09,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Leadership in the faith community, Reverend Dr. Florence Nottage King posthumously.

412
01:09:14,098 --> 01:09:19,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Reverend King's daughters are here, Pamela and Paula.

413
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to come up and accept the award.

414
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:25,881
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

415
01:09:27,742 --> 01:09:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Hallelujah.

416
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:31,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Glory to God.

417
01:09:31,523 --> 01:09:33,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Hallelujah.

418
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:34,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Take your time, darling.

419
01:09:35,844 --> 01:09:36,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Hallelujah.

420
01:09:37,244 --> 01:09:37,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

421
01:09:37,885 --> 01:09:38,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, darling.

422
01:09:38,445 --> 01:09:38,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

423
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:39,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

424
01:09:39,685 --> 01:09:42,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, darling.

425
01:09:44,626 --> 01:09:57,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, your mother, and I'm sure there aren't too many if any in this room that don't at least know of her, she was a beacon of light in the West Medford Community Center.

426
01:09:57,953 --> 01:10:01,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Never had a discouraging word to say to anybody

427
01:10:01,695 --> 01:10:04,676
[SPEAKER_07]: always had an encouraging word for everybody.

428
01:10:05,156 --> 01:10:08,037
[SPEAKER_07]: She was really a beautiful person, a beautiful soul.

429
01:10:08,377 --> 01:10:16,679
[SPEAKER_07]: You've taken after her, and we're proud to present this drum major award, posthumous leader, your mom, Reverend Dr. Florence Nottage King.

430
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:18,080
[SPEAKER_07]: God bless you both.

431
01:10:26,962 --> 01:10:28,182
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta have flowers for both.

432
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:29,763
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't start nothing, you know what I'm saying?

433
01:10:30,885 --> 01:10:46,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, alright so our final drum major award is an award for preserving the legacy of the West Medford community and it goes to none other than Johnny Reed.

434
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:11,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Well over 25 years ago, Johnny got together with a few other, we call them old heads, and they came up with an

435
01:11:14,918 --> 01:11:18,899
[SPEAKER_07]: idea for a neighborhood, an annual neighborhood reunion.

436
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:28,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And the West Medford reunion, for those of you who have not partaken, is a landmark event in the West Medford community.

437
01:11:29,823 --> 01:11:34,945
[SPEAKER_07]: We are now sharing some of the responsibility for making sure that it continues to happen.

438
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:41,347
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be the 90th anniversary of the West Medford Community Center.

439
01:11:48,030 --> 01:12:03,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the last, I would say, quarter of that history, the West Medford reunion has been part and parcel to keeping this community, which has become very fragmented for a number of reasons, together.

440
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:08,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And when folks get together, it's like they never, never left each other.

441
01:12:08,863 --> 01:12:11,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's partying, it's dancing, it's

442
01:12:12,885 --> 01:12:27,177
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of drinking, another story another day but it's a wonderful occasion and hopefully the West Memphis Community Center in partnership with Johnny and others will be able to keep this tradition going.

443
01:12:27,237 --> 01:12:34,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So for preserving the legacy of the community Johnny Reed we just want to say thank you and present this award to you.

444
01:12:37,694 --> 01:12:38,094
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

445
01:12:39,317 --> 01:12:39,797
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

446
01:12:41,861 --> 01:12:42,342
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

447
01:12:44,205 --> 01:12:44,686
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

448
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:45,267
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

449
01:12:46,824 --> 01:12:53,590
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so as you can already see, today is a family affair for West Medford and for the community center.

450
01:12:53,970 --> 01:13:01,537
[SPEAKER_07]: There is talent and community spirit all around us, and we try to take advantage of it whenever possible.

451
01:13:02,038 --> 01:13:10,085
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, that frequently means that I take advantage of the talent and community spirit that I find in my own household.

452
01:13:13,152 --> 01:13:19,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So Pastor Teresa J. Cotter is an ordained pastor and minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

453
01:13:20,141 --> 01:13:29,212
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a trained dancer and leads women and girls across New England in liturgical dance ministry, discipleship, and Christian evangelism.

454
01:13:32,963 --> 01:13:37,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you all have seen Teresa dance solo.

455
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:49,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, she is accompanied by some beautiful women who extend the outreach of liturgical dance all over New England.

456
01:13:50,196 --> 01:13:52,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to bring Pastor Teresa up.

457
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:54,839
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to introduce her compatriots.

458
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to have dancing.

459
01:14:18,915 --> 01:14:21,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, West Medford.

460
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, West Medford.

461
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:28,544
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so good to see you all and to be with you again.

462
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:34,888
[SPEAKER_09]: What a joy it is to celebrate the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

463
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:43,334
[SPEAKER_09]: and to celebrate the torchbearer that carried the torch with him and after him, Coretta Scott King.

464
01:14:44,515 --> 01:14:50,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I bring with me today, I feel like I'm home, I bring with me today two

465
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:57,667
[SPEAKER_09]: of my daughters in the faith and I would say a granddaughter in the faith.

466
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:08,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Kadesh Sims Conroy and Tanya Langelo are spiritual daughters of mine who have been ministering with me for probably 15 years.

467
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:15,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been able to not just minister with them, but to live life with them.

468
01:15:16,705 --> 01:15:24,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And our special guest today, my niece, Tanya's daughter, Olivia Langelo, will be joining us as well.

469
01:15:25,107 --> 01:15:34,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was so important to bring Olivia with us today because of the celebration of Dr. King, because of the theme for today,

470
01:15:35,809 --> 01:15:41,591
[SPEAKER_09]: a piece, my piece of the dream, your piece of the dream, our piece of the dream.

471
01:15:43,131 --> 01:15:50,973
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're going to minister to you is a song that's entitled Believe For It.

472
01:15:52,134 --> 01:15:57,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And we believe that the dream that Dr. King spoke about

473
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:07,226
[SPEAKER_09]: at the March on Washington, that he spoke about in his letter at the Birmingham jail, that he spoke about in Memphis before he died.

474
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:11,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We believe that that dream carries on today.

475
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:14,732
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't just carry on because we talk about it.

476
01:16:15,373 --> 01:16:19,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because we are about it, that we do something about it.

477
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:26,670
[SPEAKER_09]: The book that we're basing this piece on was written by Dr. King's granddaughter.

478
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:30,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Her name is Yolanda Renee King.

479
01:16:30,751 --> 01:16:34,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And this book is entitled, We Dream a World.

480
01:16:35,865 --> 01:16:49,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Yolanda wrote in her book about how her grandparents encouraged her, even though she wasn't alive when they were alive, they encouraged her to carry the torch.

481
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:56,160
[SPEAKER_09]: But not just the torch that they carried, a dream that she aspires to carry out as well.

482
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:14,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So we encourage you today to believe in the dream that Dr. King spoke about, that Coretta Scott King moved forward, and the dream of unity, humility, mercy, love, justice for all, in spite of what's happening around us.

483
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:22,292
[SPEAKER_09]: To carry that dream with you and to pass it on to those that are in the generations that are coming after you.

484
01:17:22,732 --> 01:17:23,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen?

485
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:24,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen.

486
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:08,181
They say this mountain can't be moved.

487
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:11,104
[SPEAKER_18]: They say this change will never end.

488
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:27,244
[SPEAKER_19]: But they don't know you like we do.

489
01:18:27,364 --> 01:18:34,008
[SPEAKER_18]: There is power in your name.

490
01:18:34,128 --> 01:18:39,591
[SPEAKER_19]: We've heard that there is always hope.

491
01:18:39,611 --> 01:18:42,833
[SPEAKER_19]: We've heard that time will never change.

492
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:47,556
[SPEAKER_19]: They haven't seen what you can do.

493
01:19:33,782 --> 01:19:36,765
We know that hope is never lost.

494
01:19:36,785 --> 01:19:42,190
For there is still an empty grave.

495
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:47,976
God, we believe no matter what, there is power in your name.

496
01:20:04,125 --> 01:20:08,607
Move me and move along.

497
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:13,930
Break me and break along.

498
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,690
God, we believe.

499
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:17,331
God, we believe for it.

500
01:20:17,811 --> 01:20:22,874
From the apostle Paul, we'll see a miracle.

501
01:20:22,914 --> 01:20:24,054
God, we believe.

502
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,975
God, we believe.

503
01:20:40,521 --> 01:20:42,081
[SPEAKER_19]: We trust in you.

504
01:21:09,879 --> 01:21:12,321
God, we believe forever.

505
01:21:12,361 --> 01:21:16,946
From the impossible light, we'll see a miracle.

506
01:21:17,026 --> 01:21:17,686
God, we believe.

507
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:18,547
God, we believe forever.

508
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:48,074
[SPEAKER_19]: You said, I believe.

509
01:21:49,255 --> 01:21:54,060
You said, it is done.

510
01:21:55,361 --> 01:21:57,983
You said, I believe.

511
01:21:58,543 --> 01:22:01,186
I believe it.

512
01:22:01,426 --> 01:22:04,148
[SPEAKER_19]: You said, it is done.

513
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:27,532
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't trust you when you say so it's gone.

514
01:22:53,565 --> 01:22:56,007
God, we believe for it.

515
01:22:56,087 --> 01:23:01,931
[SPEAKER_19]: From the impossible, we'll see a miracle.

516
01:23:01,971 --> 01:23:04,093
[SPEAKER_19]: God, we believe.

517
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:06,875
[SPEAKER_19]: God, we believe for it.

518
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:07,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Lord.

519
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:09,437
[SPEAKER_19]: God, we believe for it.

520
01:24:13,336 --> 01:24:15,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright was that amazing or what?

521
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:25,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it was going to be special as they were rehearsing in our living room.

522
01:24:26,421 --> 01:24:35,325
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the pounding over the man cave you know it let me know that y'all were in for something special today.

523
01:24:38,728 --> 01:24:47,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, heartfelt thanks to Pastor Teresa and her team for that wonderful presentation honoring God and Dr. Martin Luther King.

524
01:24:47,637 --> 01:24:49,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm certain they are both well pleased.

525
01:24:51,027 --> 01:24:56,290
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, it has been quite a first hour, give or take.

526
01:24:56,690 --> 01:25:04,894
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a break now for some refreshment and an opportunity for folks to connect a bit more with whoever is at your table.

527
01:25:04,954 --> 01:25:16,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, our volunteers will guide you to getting a snack, and then you are asked to return to your tables and eat and to wait for further instructions.

528
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that OK?

529
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:20,002
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right, we'll be back.

530
01:56:37,804 --> 01:56:38,265
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

531
01:56:38,305 --> 01:56:39,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon, everyone.

532
01:56:39,646 --> 01:56:43,029
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

533
01:56:43,149 --> 01:56:43,510
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

534
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:46,192
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a few folks, but that ain't all the folks.

535
01:56:46,252 --> 01:56:47,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's try it again.

536
01:56:47,673 --> 01:56:49,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Good afternoon, everyone.

537
01:56:50,707 --> 01:56:51,727
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, love it, love it.

538
01:56:52,468 --> 01:57:02,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I know everybody's still kind of munching a little bit and that's all good, but we want to get the program started so that we stay kind of on track.

539
01:57:03,712 --> 01:57:11,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to ask something that's going to move some folks out of their comfort zone and that's okay because that's what we came here to do anyways.

540
01:57:11,895 --> 01:57:24,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you're at a table that has less than like six people at it, I want you to relocate to it and populate, fully populate another table.

541
01:57:25,501 --> 01:57:34,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so look around and see where there are tables that have just a few people and move to a table where you can fill it out a little bit.

542
01:57:37,742 --> 01:57:38,222
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

543
01:57:38,783 --> 01:57:42,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have a seat that you want to bring somebody to let them know.

544
01:57:43,545 --> 01:57:44,005
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

545
01:57:47,687 --> 01:57:47,948
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

546
01:57:47,968 --> 01:57:50,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be don't be reluctant witnesses.

547
01:57:51,549 --> 01:57:52,010
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

548
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:53,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Shift and move.

549
01:57:59,454 --> 01:57:59,954
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

550
01:58:00,234 --> 01:58:00,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep that's right.

551
01:58:01,035 --> 01:58:02,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold up a few fingers.

552
01:58:02,215 --> 01:58:03,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Let folks know you got space.

553
01:58:05,017 --> 01:58:05,437
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

554
01:58:06,787 --> 01:58:07,287
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

555
01:58:07,367 --> 01:58:07,807
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

556
01:58:07,867 --> 01:58:09,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Kick it right into gear.

557
01:58:10,228 --> 01:58:10,648
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

558
01:58:15,410 --> 01:58:15,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

559
01:58:17,271 --> 01:58:17,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

560
01:58:18,111 --> 01:58:18,431
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

561
01:58:18,491 --> 01:58:23,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So we hope everyone is refreshed and a bit reflective.

562
01:58:24,234 --> 01:58:33,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we want to take just a little time and bring you through an exercise of community building at your individual tables.

563
01:58:34,442 --> 01:58:37,445
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so pay attention, because here comes the instructions.

564
01:58:40,469 --> 01:58:40,909
[SPEAKER_07]: All right?

565
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear other voices that aren't mine.

566
01:58:43,972 --> 01:58:44,993
[SPEAKER_07]: It's disturbing to me.

567
01:58:48,257 --> 01:58:49,838
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so relax your host.

568
01:58:50,679 --> 01:58:51,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Relax your host.

569
01:58:54,163 --> 01:58:55,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your best to relax your host.

570
01:58:57,868 --> 01:58:58,989
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you very much.

571
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:07,415
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so on each table, you will find a purple mesh bag for each seat at that table.

572
01:59:08,056 --> 01:59:12,659
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, eight seats at the table, eight purple mesh bags.

573
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:17,283
[SPEAKER_07]: In the bag, you will find a few mints to sweeten your breath.

[SPEAKER_07]: Piece of the dream.

02:02:12,485 --> 02:02:13,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

624
02:02:14,488 --> 02:02:17,471
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right, table four in the house, in the building.

625
02:02:18,432 --> 02:02:20,354
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right.

626
02:02:21,235 --> 02:02:23,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley, Reverend Wendy in the building.

627
02:02:23,698 --> 02:02:25,079
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right.

628
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,522
[SPEAKER_07]: NAACP in the building, eh, Jill?

629
02:02:28,223 --> 02:02:30,225
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right, all right.

630
02:02:30,245 --> 02:02:31,146
[SPEAKER_07]: What we got over here?

631
02:02:31,166 --> 02:02:33,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, hey, hey.

632
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:36,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an out-of-the-box solution.

633
02:02:39,946 --> 02:02:41,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It works perfectly.

634
02:02:41,147 --> 02:02:45,190
[SPEAKER_07]: It never would have occurred to me.

635
02:02:45,691 --> 02:02:46,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

636
02:02:46,672 --> 02:02:48,113
[SPEAKER_07]: A linear construct.

637
02:02:49,494 --> 02:02:49,974
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

638
02:02:51,015 --> 02:02:51,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nicely done.

639
02:02:52,116 --> 02:02:52,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

640
02:02:53,017 --> 02:02:54,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nicely done.

641
02:02:54,178 --> 02:02:54,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Innovative.

642
02:02:55,859 --> 02:02:56,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Innovative.

643
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:57,680
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

644
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:59,502
[SPEAKER_07]: What we got going on?

645
02:02:59,522 --> 02:03:00,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, good going guys.

646
02:03:01,003 --> 02:03:01,423
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

647
02:03:01,564 --> 02:03:02,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.

648
02:03:03,405 --> 02:03:03,785
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

649
02:03:03,905 --> 02:03:04,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Where we at?

650
02:03:05,805 --> 02:03:07,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicely done, man.

651
02:03:07,046 --> 02:03:07,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd you go?

652
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:08,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Borrow a piece from someplace else?

653
02:03:09,408 --> 02:03:11,950
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just like the city, robbing Peter to pay Paul.

654
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:12,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

655
02:03:12,871 --> 02:03:13,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

656
02:03:16,413 --> 02:03:17,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I say that out loud?

657
02:03:18,155 --> 02:03:19,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry.

658
02:03:21,157 --> 02:03:21,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.

659
02:03:21,838 --> 02:03:22,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice day.

660
02:03:22,938 --> 02:03:23,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you very much.

661
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:24,840
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

662
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:25,500
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good.

663
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:26,101
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good.

664
02:03:26,201 --> 02:03:26,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

665
02:03:26,561 --> 02:03:27,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Where we at?

666
02:03:27,542 --> 02:03:28,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, nice.

667
02:03:29,003 --> 02:03:29,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

668
02:03:30,704 --> 02:03:31,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

669
02:03:31,305 --> 02:03:31,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

670
02:03:31,805 --> 02:03:32,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

671
02:03:32,466 --> 02:03:33,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mary.

672
02:03:33,667 --> 02:03:34,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

673
02:03:34,788 --> 02:03:35,168
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

674
02:03:37,052 --> 02:03:37,332
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

675
02:03:37,372 --> 02:03:38,293
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up over here.

676
02:03:39,273 --> 02:03:39,633
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up.

677
02:03:39,793 --> 02:03:40,954
[SPEAKER_07]: What they had to call in a ring.

678
02:03:40,994 --> 02:03:42,075
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to call in a ringer.

679
02:03:43,836 --> 02:03:44,156
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

680
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:45,857
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

681
02:03:47,898 --> 02:03:48,418
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

682
02:03:48,678 --> 02:03:49,198
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

683
02:03:49,399 --> 02:03:49,699
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

684
02:03:51,219 --> 02:03:51,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

685
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:52,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

686
02:03:55,102 --> 02:03:55,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

687
02:03:55,602 --> 02:03:56,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

688
02:03:56,122 --> 02:03:56,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

689
02:03:57,923 --> 02:03:58,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

690
02:03:58,583 --> 02:03:59,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfectly well.

691
02:03:59,344 --> 02:03:59,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Well done.

692
02:03:59,884 --> 02:04:00,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Well done.

693
02:04:01,065 --> 02:04:01,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Well done.

694
02:04:03,046 --> 02:04:03,406
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

695
02:04:05,022 --> 02:04:05,402
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

696
02:04:07,324 --> 02:04:07,684
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

697
02:04:09,886 --> 02:04:10,186
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

698
02:04:14,109 --> 02:04:22,236
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I said, it's not a competition.

699
02:04:22,256 --> 02:04:25,499
[SPEAKER_07]: It is simply a demonstration.

700
02:04:27,538 --> 02:04:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: of connection and personal responsibility.

701
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:35,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Our gifts may not be equal, but our sacrifice can be.

702
02:04:36,625 --> 02:04:39,807
[SPEAKER_07]: We've emptied the bags and we built something.

703
02:04:40,648 --> 02:04:44,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for your openness and your participation.

704
02:04:45,792 --> 02:04:52,597
[SPEAKER_07]: We recognize that this is just a baby step in what we'd like to see across the city on a regular basis.

705
02:04:53,475 --> 02:05:03,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Our hope is that all our community-based institutions can become greater and more effective incubators for dynamic communion and convening.

706
02:05:03,899 --> 02:05:07,801
[SPEAKER_07]: That is certainly the intent of the West Medford Community Center.

707
02:05:09,801 --> 02:05:10,141
OK.

708
02:05:10,802 --> 02:05:11,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

709
02:05:11,562 --> 02:05:14,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Give yourselves a round of applause.

710
02:05:15,043 --> 02:05:15,363
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

711
02:05:15,423 --> 02:05:18,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate your spirit and your cooperation.

712
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:29,422
[SPEAKER_07]: For me personally, everything that we've done today underpins what I do as a poet in a creative spirit.

713
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:35,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I stated early that I love to have my family join me in these special WMCC programs.

714
02:05:36,064 --> 02:05:39,285
[SPEAKER_07]: They really, really bless me by their willingness and cooperation.

715
02:05:40,285 --> 02:05:54,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked my dear cousin, Shara Owen Schwartz, and her daughter, my beautiful niece, Callie, to read two poems that show both the beauty and peril of the struggle for social justice in this country right now.

716
02:05:55,154 --> 02:05:57,155
[SPEAKER_07]: The first poem is one of my own.

717
02:05:57,955 --> 02:05:59,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It's entitled, How Much Longer?

718
02:06:00,517 --> 02:06:05,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And the second is a piece by the legendary Langston Hughes called, I Dream a World.

719
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:08,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, Shara and Callie Owen Schwartz.

720
02:06:51,991 --> 02:07:07,438
[SPEAKER_13]: So this piece I'm about to read is by Terry E. Carter, the esteemed first poet laureate of Medford

721
02:07:16,538 --> 02:07:18,759
[SPEAKER_13]: It's entitled, How Much Longer.

722
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:22,560
[SPEAKER_13]: How much longer?

723
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:26,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying don't pray.

724
02:07:27,001 --> 02:07:32,723
[SPEAKER_13]: The Lord hears your petitions for peace and safety and sobriety.

725
02:07:32,743 --> 02:07:35,684
[SPEAKER_13]: The Lord sees your bended knees.

726
02:07:35,764 --> 02:07:42,006
[SPEAKER_13]: He understands the anguish in every tear and mournful sob and will comfort you.

727
02:07:44,558 --> 02:07:55,507
[SPEAKER_13]: But he also sees the zealotry and flawed logic of the ones who cry, my freedoms, my rights, my constitution.

728
02:07:57,048 --> 02:08:06,496
[SPEAKER_13]: He sees the foul report of the NRA behemoth and pocketed politicians in the MAGA muteness.

729
02:08:08,138 --> 02:08:20,589
[SPEAKER_13]: He sees the hardened heart and the unsympathetic spirit of the corrupted character of the leaders he did not select, the ones with blood on their hands.

730
02:08:24,412 --> 02:08:27,335
[SPEAKER_13]: How much longer will they, will we, will you and I do nothing?

731
02:08:32,435 --> 02:08:36,158
[SPEAKER_13]: The word ordains that faith without works is dead.

732
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:46,426
[SPEAKER_13]: It's as dead as the 19 in Uvalde, the 14 in Buffalo, the 58 in Vegas, the 49 in Orlando, the 32 in Blacksburg, the 27 in Newtown, the 26 in Sutherland Springs, the 23 in Killeen, the 23 in El Paso, the nine in Charleston.

733
02:09:03,907 --> 02:09:06,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Those dead are in his eternal keeping.

734
02:09:08,368 --> 02:09:11,988
[SPEAKER_13]: More dead are in our will and manifest.

735
02:09:13,509 --> 02:09:17,609
[SPEAKER_13]: How much longer will we agonize but not act?

736
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:22,890
[SPEAKER_13]: How much longer will we wring our hands but not change?

737
02:09:23,491 --> 02:09:31,172
[SPEAKER_13]: How much longer will we keep machinery in play that kills our children every day, every single day?

738
02:09:33,934 --> 02:09:49,268
[SPEAKER_13]: How much longer will we let the greed and the grime and the godlessness of a few bring doom and dread and death into the living rooms, schools, and sanctuaries of the beloved community?

739
02:09:51,891 --> 02:09:53,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying don't pray.

740
02:09:55,204 --> 02:10:01,606
[SPEAKER_13]: But we will never have real peace without real justice and genuine accountability.

741
02:10:02,186 --> 02:10:15,891
[SPEAKER_13]: If we allow it to forever be all about the banks, all about the stocks, all about the free market and the bottom line, that's what it's always going to be about.

742
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:31,332
[SPEAKER_13]: If we let them continue to talk us, bend us, and buy us out of doing what is right, they will always be empowered to do what is patently wrong.

743
02:10:33,413 --> 02:10:38,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Always be influenced to do what is painfully abusive.

744
02:10:39,354 --> 02:10:45,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Always be paid and prepared to do what is poison and perverse.

745
02:10:48,069 --> 02:10:53,236
[SPEAKER_13]: 120 plus guns per civilian in this country.

746
02:10:53,596 --> 02:10:56,039
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just the ones we think we know about.

747
02:10:58,042 --> 02:11:00,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any ounce of sanity in that equation?

748
02:11:03,338 --> 02:11:19,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there not a perfect storm for the emotionally unstable, the mentally unbalanced, the violently predisposed, for the harbinger of hate, and for the power of suggestion over the ignorant and unhinged?

749
02:11:21,156 --> 02:11:22,518
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying don't pray.

750
02:11:24,074 --> 02:11:37,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting off my knees right now, but this time I'm asking God to give me the courage to do more and to do differently and be the change I want to see in this nation.

751
02:11:40,044 --> 02:11:56,828
[SPEAKER_13]: I've asked him to compel us to join our mustard seeds together and sow our germ of faith and strength and unity to move this mountain of violence and murder to distant, forbidden shores.

752
02:11:58,948 --> 02:12:05,710
[SPEAKER_13]: To shores beyond these thresholds of pain, beyond our sadness or a sense of loss.

753
02:12:07,544 --> 02:12:32,620
[SPEAKER_13]: beyond the somber services and the makeshift altars, beyond the Twitter rants and the Facebook soliloquies, beyond the podcast and chat rooms and Zoom squares, beyond our living rooms, our schools, our sanctuaries, beyond our beloved community and beyond the places we call home.

754
02:12:45,887 --> 02:12:47,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I Dream a World by Langston Hughes.

755
02:12:49,049 --> 02:12:57,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I dream a world where man, no other man, will scorn, where love will bless the earth and peace its paths adorn.

756
02:12:58,152 --> 02:13:06,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I dream a world where all will know sweet freedom's way, where greed no longer saps the soul, nor avarice blights our day.

757
02:13:08,216 --> 02:13:09,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I dream a world where

758
02:13:09,436 --> 02:13:16,919
[SPEAKER_14]: A world I dream where black or white, whatever race you be, will share the bounties of the earth and every man is free.

759
02:13:17,819 --> 02:13:24,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Where wretchedness will hang its head and joy, like a pearl, attends the needs of all mankind.

760
02:13:24,922 --> 02:13:26,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Of such I dream my world.

761
02:13:29,203 --> 02:13:29,623
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

762
02:13:29,643 --> 02:13:31,524
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

763
02:13:31,724 --> 02:13:32,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

764
02:13:33,365 --> 02:13:33,805
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

765
02:13:33,825 --> 02:13:33,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

766
02:13:34,745 --> 02:13:34,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

767
02:13:40,590 --> 02:13:41,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Shara.

768
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:42,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Callie.

769
02:13:43,451 --> 02:13:43,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

770
02:13:46,792 --> 02:13:50,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I always know what to expect when I read my own poetry.

771
02:13:50,833 --> 02:13:53,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I never know what to expect when someone else reads it.

772
02:13:55,054 --> 02:13:57,014
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was riveted.

773
02:13:57,414 --> 02:14:03,836
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thank you very much for bringing your passion and your conviction to my words, and Callie,

774
02:14:04,436 --> 02:14:09,400
[SPEAKER_07]: for your bringing your warmth and generosity to the words of Langston Hughes.

775
02:14:10,761 --> 02:14:25,454
[SPEAKER_07]: We're happy to have you with us here today and we appreciate your willingness to join from your home base of Arlington with neighboring West Medford at a time when like minds and hearts really need to work together across city lines.

776
02:14:26,575 --> 02:14:26,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

777
02:14:28,897 --> 02:14:29,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

778
02:14:32,493 --> 02:14:40,117
[SPEAKER_07]: So you may have noticed that today's program has showcased the amazing talents of some wonderful women.

779
02:14:42,899 --> 02:14:44,240
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no accident.

780
02:14:48,562 --> 02:14:53,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Fact of the matter is the movement, quote unquote,

781
02:14:55,619 --> 02:15:06,891
[SPEAKER_07]: was filled to overflowing with the talents and grace and intelligence and dynamism of amazing women.

782
02:15:06,951 --> 02:15:17,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. King was blessed with tremendous relationships with great women who dynamically impacted his work in civil rights and social justice.

783
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:26,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the West Method Community Center, in fact, has been an incubator of more talented and inspiring women than I can easily recall.

784
02:15:26,946 --> 02:15:32,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I always want to be mindful of such important role models and contributors.

785
02:15:34,165 --> 02:15:36,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So on to the next order of business.

786
02:15:36,405 --> 02:15:43,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, it's always a challenge for me to come up with meaningful messages in a keynote address and speaker.

787
02:15:43,787 --> 02:15:48,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, I've been on both sides, the giving and the receiving end.

788
02:15:51,929 --> 02:15:58,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So this year's selection for a keynote speaker really, really resonates with me.

789
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:01,911
[SPEAKER_07]: The only concern I had was availability,

790
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:05,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And that problem worked itself out fairly easily.

791
02:16:05,341 --> 02:16:07,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Kinship always helps in these matters.

792
02:16:09,563 --> 02:16:19,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Celia Johnston Blue is a seasoned executive leader with over 30 years of leadership experience in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors.

793
02:16:20,288 --> 02:16:25,871
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2015, Celia collaborated with 12 women of color from across Massachusetts

794
02:16:26,571 --> 02:16:36,794
[SPEAKER_07]: and led the development and public launch of the Massachusetts Women of Color Coalition, M-A-W-O-C-C, Incorporated.

795
02:16:37,634 --> 02:16:46,657
[SPEAKER_07]: In her current role as president and CEO, she is leading the organization to realize its vision and mission, which

796
02:16:48,775 --> 02:16:56,617
[SPEAKER_07]: is strongly geared toward advocating for the voices of women of color to be heard and to be recognized.

797
02:16:57,257 --> 02:17:08,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to her current role at Maywalk, Celia was the interim director of the Rhode Island Department of Human Services, a cabinet-level position reporting to Governor McKee.

798
02:17:08,899 --> 02:17:14,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Celia led an agency with approximately 1,000 employees in multiple divisions

799
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:24,783
[SPEAKER_07]: with a budget of approximately $900 million, providing benefits and services to 300,000 or one-third of Rhode Island's population.

800
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:34,126
[SPEAKER_07]: She spent nine years in the transportation industry here in Massachusetts and gained national experience in multiple modes.

801
02:17:34,186 --> 02:17:39,028
[SPEAKER_07]: First, appointed as a commissioner for the former Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission

802
02:17:39,688 --> 02:17:52,560
[SPEAKER_07]: She was later appointed as Deputy Registrar, Assistant Secretary of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and then promoted to Registrar, CEO of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.

803
02:17:53,741 --> 02:17:58,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now take that, just think about that for a second.

804
02:17:59,367 --> 02:18:03,931
[SPEAKER_07]: The Registrar and CEO of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.

805
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:12,170
[SPEAKER_07]: She is the first African-American in Massachusetts history to serve as that registrar for the Commonwealth.

806
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:14,314
[SPEAKER_07]: She holds a Bachelor of Science degree.

807
02:18:14,434 --> 02:18:14,874
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

808
02:18:14,935 --> 02:18:15,696
[SPEAKER_07]: That's worth a clap.

809
02:18:20,243 --> 02:18:30,250
[SPEAKER_07]: a bachelor of science degree from Worcester State University, a master's degree in business administration from Anna Maria College, and is currently enrolled in the Ph.D.

810
02:18:30,290 --> 02:18:32,992
[SPEAKER_07]: leadership program at the University of Vermont.

811
02:18:33,472 --> 02:18:40,797
[SPEAKER_07]: She has received awards for her leadership and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and was named in the Power 50

812
02:18:41,818 --> 02:18:44,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Class of 2021 by the Worcester Business Journal.

813
02:18:45,299 --> 02:18:51,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And in 2023, she received the Distinguished Alumnae Award from the Worcester State University.

814
02:18:51,961 --> 02:18:58,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, I present and please give a warm West Medford welcome to Celia Johnston Blue.

815
02:19:21,988 --> 02:19:22,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning.

816
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:24,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, come on.

817
02:19:24,973 --> 02:19:28,139
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we just ate, but good morning.

818
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:29,942
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, there we go.

819
02:19:29,962 --> 02:19:31,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you guys hear me OK?

820
02:19:36,987 --> 02:19:40,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for having me today.

821
02:19:40,088 --> 02:20:05,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to recognize the executive director, Linda Grossman, board president, Melinda Regan, board members, the mayor of Medford, other dignitaries, Rafael Parish Center, and the sponsors, staff, planning committee, and all the volunteers that made today's event possible.

822
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:16,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give a special shout out to Terry Carter, who asked me to speak today, and to you, the audience, for being here today.

823
02:20:17,144 --> 02:20:20,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So I say we give ourselves a round of applause for that.

824
02:20:26,188 --> 02:20:34,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to recognize the awardees today for your work and your commitment, and stay strong and keep moving forward.

825
02:20:37,172 --> 02:20:52,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to acknowledge the fact that West Medford Community Center has been providing services and programs and activities and connecting people from West Medford, Mystic River Valley for over 90 years.

826
02:20:53,519 --> 02:20:54,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

827
02:20:54,879 --> 02:20:56,720
[SPEAKER_11]: That is quite an accomplishment.

828
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:11,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to start by telling you just a little bit about who I am because I think that's important so that you can see the lens in which I am coming from and how it drives my work.

829
02:21:12,587 --> 02:21:15,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I am very much the immigrant story.

830
02:21:15,889 --> 02:21:20,292
[SPEAKER_11]: My family is from Jamaica, an island in the Caribbean, West Indies.

831
02:21:20,952 --> 02:21:29,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamaica was owned and colonized by the Spaniards and English folks like the United States and so many other countries.

832
02:21:30,143 --> 02:21:38,491
[SPEAKER_11]: My family's roots and our lineage, black, West Indian, Scottish, and Irish, and I am still learning about my lineage.

833
02:21:39,412 --> 02:21:51,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I am a mom, a wife, a sister, an auntie, godmother, friend, a boss, and proud daughter of Barrington and Valerie Johnston.

834
02:21:52,930 --> 02:22:05,663
[SPEAKER_11]: My family migrated to Jamaica, from Jamaica to this country, when I was 11 and a half years old, made possible by my Aunt Dorothy Vassell, my father's sister, whom we call the matriarch of our family.

835
02:22:05,683 --> 02:22:10,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know about racism until I came to the United States.

836
02:22:11,109 --> 02:22:13,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I experienced racism, I am grateful.

837
02:22:14,492 --> 02:22:24,462
[SPEAKER_11]: that I also had a positive experience where some of my classmates were kind and open to this young Jamaican girl that came to their school.

838
02:22:25,784 --> 02:22:36,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Fast forward to now, I have a few decades of leadership experience stemming as Terry so eloquently introduced me today in many different sectors.

839
02:22:37,335 --> 02:22:42,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have been blessed with most of my career to be in senior and executive level roles.

840
02:22:43,046 --> 02:22:46,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And trust me, I still have the scars for that.

841
02:22:47,906 --> 02:22:53,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Many years ago, God placed on my heart to start an organization focused on women of color.

842
02:22:53,692 --> 02:22:59,377
[SPEAKER_11]: As I know firsthand, the inequities that we faced just about on a daily basis.

843
02:23:00,158 --> 02:23:05,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Our organization is fondly called Maywalk.

844
02:23:05,863 --> 02:23:11,929
[SPEAKER_11]: We started with 12 brilliant women from across the commonwealth, and you can find their bios on our website.

845
02:23:13,226 --> 02:23:22,429
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you who might not be familiar with Maywalk, we are a statewide nonprofit organization, nonpartisan organization, based in Worcester.

846
02:23:23,069 --> 02:23:34,333
[SPEAKER_11]: And our mission is to address racial inequities as it exists for women of color, created by systemic, institutional, internalized, and interpersonal racism.

847
02:23:34,413 --> 02:23:38,495
[SPEAKER_11]: And we wanted to, as founding members, really call that out.

848
02:23:39,195 --> 02:23:46,119
[SPEAKER_11]: We provide programming, training, and we advocate for policies and legislation for a more equitable commonwealth.

849
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:50,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Our programming includes a leadership track for training and boards and commission.

850
02:23:51,502 --> 02:23:59,467
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an intergenerational leadership academy for women of color and high school girls of color, which includes a one-year mentorship program.

851
02:24:00,227 --> 02:24:13,398
[SPEAKER_11]: We are doing our part to encourage and empower and provide tools and strategies for women for personal and professional growth and advance their career and also inspire the next generation of leaders.

852
02:24:14,338 --> 02:24:22,105
[SPEAKER_11]: With respect to our advocacy work, we have had overall four legislative wins and two ballot question wins.

853
02:24:22,845 --> 02:24:26,669
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll just speak briefly about two of the wins we had last year.

854
02:24:26,689 --> 02:24:36,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to say that we also were involved in the expansion of voting here in the Commonwealth called the Votes Act.

855
02:24:36,098 --> 02:24:40,322
[SPEAKER_11]: We're involved in it during COVID when we have to rethink about how to vote.

856
02:24:40,902 --> 02:24:47,608
[SPEAKER_11]: We're involved in that movement and then permanently expanding the rights here in the Commonwealth.

857
02:24:48,429 --> 02:24:59,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, the maternity bill got passed, which expands access to midwifery, birth centers, and doula services and addresses postpartum depression.

858
02:25:07,273 --> 02:25:20,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Our ballot questions involve fair share, which is known as the millionaire tax for increased funding to schools and roads and bridges, and the Work and Family Mobility Act, which actually I started working on when I was registrar.

859
02:25:21,469 --> 02:25:27,997
[SPEAKER_11]: It allows immigrants to apply for a driver's license in Massachusetts regardless of their immigration status.

860
02:25:32,657 --> 02:25:41,567
[SPEAKER_11]: And lastly, the Wage Equity Act is when we talk about a piece of the dream, it means also a piece of the economic pie, right?

861
02:25:42,448 --> 02:25:49,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And so last year, we were in the steering committee for passing of the Francis Perkins Workplace Equity Act.

862
02:25:50,376 --> 02:25:53,080
[SPEAKER_11]: This is important for all of us in this room.

863
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:55,603
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes into effect in June of this year.

864
02:25:56,204 --> 02:25:57,025
[SPEAKER_11]: What does it do?

865
02:25:57,265 --> 02:26:06,116
[SPEAKER_11]: It discloses to the employees who are being offered a promotion or transfer the range of what that position earned.

866
02:26:06,396 --> 02:26:08,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, you don't know that.

867
02:26:08,599 --> 02:26:20,386
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do market research, you can get a sense, but you don't know what that company actually paid, and we know that our white counterparts are being paid more than we are.

868
02:26:21,287 --> 02:26:31,893
[SPEAKER_11]: It also discloses the pay range for anyone who wants to know in your organization what your role earned.

869
02:26:32,887 --> 02:26:43,692
[SPEAKER_11]: It also allows the attorney general to enforce the law for organizations who do not want to cooperate with that.

870
02:26:44,292 --> 02:26:58,798
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is, there's also new pay data reporting obligations, which I think is important, because we don't know if we're not measuring, we don't know how we're doing unless we really have the data to show us how we're doing.

871
02:26:59,638 --> 02:27:04,922
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm proud to say that we're entering our 10th year, and yes, you can clap for that.

872
02:27:09,725 --> 02:27:16,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're all invited to our annual meeting and celebration next Saturday at the Beachwood Hotel in Worcester.

873
02:27:16,770 --> 02:27:20,593
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go online to maywalk.com and register.

874
02:27:20,673 --> 02:27:25,457
[SPEAKER_11]: And I encourage you to become a member and also become an ally and supporter.

875
02:27:26,497 --> 02:27:33,984
[SPEAKER_11]: In preparing for my speech, I went back and listened to many speeches and interviews that Dr. King gave.

876
02:27:34,965 --> 02:27:40,169
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the speeches that he gave to high school students talked about developing a blueprint.

877
02:27:40,689 --> 02:27:41,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to come back to this.

878
02:27:42,791 --> 02:27:54,054
[SPEAKER_11]: To realize our piece of Dr. King's dream, we must go back to some of the early days of civil rights movement, and we must understand the real history of this country.

879
02:27:54,614 --> 02:28:00,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I would encourage you to listen to this interview that he did in 1967 to NBC.

880
02:28:02,216 --> 02:28:06,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Watching and listening to these many interviews really gave me hope.

881
02:28:06,497 --> 02:28:12,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I was inspired, and it also affirmed our reality as black people that we cannot ignore.

882
02:28:13,438 --> 02:28:21,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I listened to his famous speech, I Have a Dream speech, but what I'm gonna do is focus on this particular interview.

883
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:38,542
[SPEAKER_11]: The title of it says, in this rarely seen interview, King speaks bluntly about the new phase of the struggle for genuine equality and his continuous commitment to the civil rights movement.

884
02:28:39,523 --> 02:28:41,703
[SPEAKER_11]: The question that was posed to him was this,

885
02:28:42,323 --> 02:29:06,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't it part of the dilemma now that people know that Negroes were being denied what was guaranteed by the Constitution, by the fact that they were citizens of this country, that when they were given those rights, did you feel like the white community said, well, we have given them all that we have now, and it's up to them?

886
02:29:07,437 --> 02:29:10,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. King answered that the dilemma was deeper.

887
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:17,648
[SPEAKER_11]: He was saying that the movement was in a transition period where we must be honest with America.

888
02:29:17,668 --> 02:29:23,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Honesty tells me to admit that America has broad racist elements.

889
02:29:25,332 --> 02:29:26,132
[SPEAKER_11]: that exists.

890
02:29:27,533 --> 02:29:31,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Racism is still alive and exists in American society.

891
02:29:31,175 --> 02:29:41,040
[SPEAKER_11]: There has never been a single, solid, determined commitment of large segments of white America on the whole question of racial equality.

892
02:29:41,881 --> 02:29:49,065
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to see that vacillation has always exists, and ambivalence has always exists.

893
02:29:49,585 --> 02:29:52,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And this, to me, is the so-called white backlash.

894
02:29:53,587 --> 02:29:56,650
[SPEAKER_11]: is merely a new name for an old phenomenon.

895
02:29:57,390 --> 02:30:12,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I see the white-black backlash is a continuum in the same ambivalence and facilitation of white America and the whole question of racial justice that has existed since the founding of our nation.

896
02:30:13,263 --> 02:30:31,136
[SPEAKER_11]: We must see that in many of the people that supported us in Selma and Birmingham were outraged about the extremist behaviors towards Negro, but they were not at that moment, and they are not now, committed to genuine equality for Negroes.

897
02:30:31,837 --> 02:30:41,664
[SPEAKER_11]: It is much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to guarantee an annual income, for instance, to get rid of poverty for Negroes and poor people.

898
02:30:42,384 --> 02:30:52,192
[SPEAKER_11]: It's much easier to integrate a bus than it is to make genuine integration a reality and quality education a reality in our schools.

899
02:30:52,273 --> 02:30:58,298
[SPEAKER_11]: It is much easier to integrate a public park than getting rid of public slums.

900
02:30:58,958 --> 02:31:08,846
[SPEAKER_11]: We are in a new phase where we've moved from the struggle for decency, characterized the struggle of about 10 to 12 years of the struggle,

901
02:31:09,747 --> 02:31:17,735
[SPEAKER_11]: for genuine equality and that is where we are getting the resistance because there was never intention to go this far.

902
02:31:18,636 --> 02:31:24,482
[SPEAKER_11]: People were reacting to Bull Connor or reacting to Jim Clark rather than acting in good faith.

903
02:31:25,082 --> 02:31:27,804
[SPEAKER_11]: to realization of genuine equality.

904
02:31:27,864 --> 02:31:33,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And Bill Conner, if you remember, ordered the use of hoses on the students that were marching.

905
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:40,515
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jim Clark was the sheriff who did the violent arrest of civil rights protesters during Selma.

906
02:31:42,753 --> 02:31:45,677
[SPEAKER_11]: He was also reflecting on his I Have a Dream speech.

907
02:31:45,777 --> 02:31:53,366
[SPEAKER_11]: And during that period of the movement, he said, there was a great period of solid, a solid decade of progress.

908
02:31:54,047 --> 02:31:58,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And that dream, he said, at many points since then has turned into a nightmare.

909
02:31:59,113 --> 02:32:15,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And so he admitted that he was very overly optimistic, but while he still had hope and faith in this country, this now needed to be tempered with the solid realism that we still have a long way to go.

910
02:32:15,025 --> 02:32:21,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm gonna focus on this response because we do still have a long way to go.

911
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:27,495
[SPEAKER_11]: This felt surreal to me because we're going through this very similar circumstances today.

912
02:32:28,115 --> 02:32:31,817
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still fighting for equality in the world that we want to see.

913
02:32:32,837 --> 02:32:46,083
[SPEAKER_11]: As I think about where we are in our society today, the polarization, the blatant racism, sexism language, this should be appalling and unacceptable to all of us.

914
02:32:47,003 --> 02:32:49,305
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition, we have ongoing wars.

915
02:32:49,445 --> 02:32:51,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Democracy is under attack.

916
02:32:51,647 --> 02:32:53,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Voting rights are under attack.

917
02:32:53,549 --> 02:32:55,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Reproductive rights are under attack.

918
02:32:56,152 --> 02:32:59,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Diversity, equity, and inclusion is under attack.

919
02:33:00,115 --> 02:33:02,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Critical race theory is under attack.

920
02:33:02,697 --> 02:33:09,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a result, we have legislators debating bills and states banning books from schools.

921
02:33:10,184 --> 02:33:15,165
[SPEAKER_11]: The Supreme Court struck down the affirmative action and admission policies for colleges.

922
02:33:15,845 --> 02:33:23,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Folks, structural and institutional racism and white supremacy still exist and it is heightened more than ever.

923
02:33:24,667 --> 02:33:31,029
[SPEAKER_11]: When progress is made, white supremacists plot and attempt to take away the progress that we have made.

924
02:33:31,429 --> 02:33:39,831
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the very same thing that Dr. King was talking about 58 years ago, the white backlash.

925
02:33:40,431 --> 02:33:44,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Sadly, today, the words of Dr. King is still alive.

926
02:33:44,495 --> 02:33:56,605
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, I have a dream that my four little children will live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.

927
02:33:56,625 --> 02:34:01,790
[SPEAKER_11]: This really puts it in a nutshell for me on what we're still fighting for.

928
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:11,097
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do we individually and collectively continue the struggle to realize the dream that Dr. King had?

929
02:34:11,577 --> 02:34:15,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would hope that all of us in this room want to see that happen.

930
02:34:16,862 --> 02:34:20,685
[SPEAKER_11]: We can start by developing our own individual blueprint.

931
02:34:21,385 --> 02:34:34,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Begin by defining and developing your own values, what you need as an individual, what is the kind of life that you want to achieve, the kind of friends that you should be with, what does success look like?

932
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:39,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. King talked about a commitment to the eternal principle of beauty, love, and justice.

933
02:34:40,312 --> 02:34:45,013
[SPEAKER_11]: What is your commitment to advocating for social and racial justice?

934
02:34:45,453 --> 02:34:49,255
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the ways in which you will fight for a just society?

935
02:34:50,215 --> 02:34:56,698
[SPEAKER_11]: After we develop our blueprint, we can talk with others and see who we are aligned with, who's aligned with our values.

936
02:34:57,259 --> 02:35:18,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And from my perspective, the basic principle to understand the need for common decency and where we can collectively move the needle in addressing systemic racism and barriers that prevent us from our fullest potential and to hold America accountable, to live up to its ideal.

937
02:35:19,730 --> 02:35:21,651
[SPEAKER_11]: We should focus on our communities.

938
02:35:22,171 --> 02:35:23,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Be active in our communities.

939
02:35:24,351 --> 02:35:26,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Be civically engaged.

940
02:35:26,712 --> 02:35:29,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Public meetings, attend public meetings.

941
02:35:29,473 --> 02:35:31,274
[SPEAKER_11]: These days, you can see them online.

942
02:35:31,294 --> 02:35:32,934
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't even have to go in person.

943
02:35:33,634 --> 02:35:36,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you know who your politicians are.

944
02:35:36,235 --> 02:35:37,655
[SPEAKER_11]: What do they stand for?

945
02:35:38,316 --> 02:35:41,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they stand and understand and address racism?

946
02:35:41,076 --> 02:35:45,698
[SPEAKER_11]: What policy, what legislation are they planning to advocate for?

947
02:35:46,278 --> 02:35:50,841
[SPEAKER_11]: so that we can make continued progress in addressing systemic racism.

948
02:35:51,601 --> 02:35:54,463
[SPEAKER_11]: For one, we should be in Congress.

949
02:35:55,724 --> 02:36:06,010
[SPEAKER_11]: The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act restores and expands voting rights across this country.

950
02:36:07,191 --> 02:36:12,033
[SPEAKER_11]: All of our congressional delegation should be for this law.

951
02:36:12,334 --> 02:36:13,894
[SPEAKER_11]: It has not been passed yet.

952
02:36:14,374 --> 02:36:17,096
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something we can advocate for.

953
02:36:17,116 --> 02:36:21,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Here are some ways in which I am leading and navigating in our world today.

954
02:36:22,438 --> 02:36:25,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Love is one of my core values.

955
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:29,862
[SPEAKER_11]: I am also using hope, faith to help guide me.

956
02:36:30,722 --> 02:36:45,589
[SPEAKER_11]: In the Bible, hope is the expectation of something that is possible but not yet certain, while faith is the trust in something that is believed to be true even if it is not yet visible.

957
02:36:46,629 --> 02:36:50,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And for me, love is at the center of everything I do.

958
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:56,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the Bible, the definition of love is this, in 1 Corinthians.

959
02:36:57,112 --> 02:36:59,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Love is patient and kind.

960
02:37:00,232 --> 02:37:02,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Love does not envy or boast.

961
02:37:02,713 --> 02:37:04,613
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not arrogant or rude.

962
02:37:05,133 --> 02:37:07,934
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not insist on its own way.

963
02:37:07,954 --> 02:37:11,035
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not irritable or resentful.

964
02:37:11,735 --> 02:37:17,000
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.

965
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:28,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things, and love never ends.

966
02:37:29,801 --> 02:37:39,909
[SPEAKER_11]: The last two are ways in which we can work together to fight for the world in which we want to see from the individual perspective and the collective perspective.

967
02:37:40,890 --> 02:37:46,094
[SPEAKER_11]: In our leadership academy, we're teaching about transformative solidarity.

968
02:37:47,135 --> 02:37:51,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Transformative solidarity is changing our lives to change systems.

969
02:37:52,476 --> 02:38:02,939
[SPEAKER_11]: It is going through a metamorphosis within solidarity so that we, with privilege, can move differently, think differently, and engage differently.

970
02:38:02,959 --> 02:38:06,760
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a deep, it's a deep core change.

971
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:12,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So as you think about this, think about a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly.

972
02:38:13,281 --> 02:38:15,664
[SPEAKER_11]: into a completely different being.

973
02:38:16,385 --> 02:38:17,686
[SPEAKER_11]: It moves different.

974
02:38:18,167 --> 02:38:22,772
[SPEAKER_11]: It has access to different spaces and places where it once crawled.

975
02:38:23,373 --> 02:38:24,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It can now fly.

976
02:38:25,556 --> 02:38:29,760
[SPEAKER_11]: There are six key principles around transformative solidarity.

977
02:38:29,981 --> 02:38:31,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to focus on three.

978
02:38:32,463 --> 02:38:33,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Centering.

979
02:38:33,645 --> 02:38:46,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Transformative solidarity requires centering those most affected by systems of oppressions and shifting the power to directly impacted communities.

980
02:38:47,239 --> 02:38:48,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Commonalities.

981
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:50,542
[SPEAKER_11]: We identify the values.

982
02:38:50,582 --> 02:38:54,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember I talked about the values that we're going to develop in our blueprint.

983
02:38:54,946 --> 02:38:58,489
[SPEAKER_11]: We identify the values and hopes that we have in common.

984
02:38:58,989 --> 02:39:07,256
[SPEAKER_11]: We build relationships through understanding our history of oppression and resilience without flattening or equating them.

985
02:39:08,397 --> 02:39:10,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Co-liberation is my favorite.

986
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:16,824
[SPEAKER_11]: We work together towards our mutual freedom and redistribution of power.

987
02:39:17,725 --> 02:39:23,470
[SPEAKER_11]: This means dismantling the multi-generational legacies of white supremacy,

988
02:39:24,290 --> 02:39:34,173
[SPEAKER_11]: anti-black racism, and settler colonialism, and building a future toward a future where we all have what we need to thrive.

989
02:39:35,053 --> 02:39:47,997
[SPEAKER_11]: We can take the example of the Freedom Riders, groups of white and African American civil rights activists who participated in Freedom Rides, bus trips throughout America and the South in 1961,

990
02:39:49,918 --> 02:39:52,619
[SPEAKER_11]: to protest segregated bus terminal.

991
02:39:52,899 --> 02:40:03,423
[SPEAKER_11]: It was successful because it showed that nonviolent direct action could do more than simply claiming the moral high ground.

992
02:40:04,223 --> 02:40:13,547
[SPEAKER_11]: In many situations, it could deliver better tactical results than either violent confrontation or gradual change to establish legal mechanism.

993
02:40:14,767 --> 02:40:20,449
[SPEAKER_11]: So here is a great example that we can be inspired on, and there are so many, many more.

994
02:40:20,469 --> 02:40:22,470
[SPEAKER_11]: So what else can you do?

995
02:40:23,030 --> 02:40:35,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Here in your local communities or in your professional worlds, I encourage each of you to find your voice, to do your part to make this world more equitable and inclusive.

996
02:40:36,175 --> 02:40:58,012
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do a small act that I believe will make a big difference, and that is to ensure that people of color and marginalized communities, people in diverse backgrounds and different social identities are always in the room and at the decision-making tables, particularly when decisions are being made about them or their communities.

997
02:41:02,962 --> 02:41:19,582
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that when diverse representations are in the room, where decisions are being made and voices are heard, we have better policies, we have much better outcomes, much better outcomes in organizations and in our communities.

998
02:41:20,062 --> 02:41:21,925
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are in a leadership position,

999
02:41:23,597 --> 02:41:32,480
[SPEAKER_11]: ensure that a woman earns the same as a man for the same position, ensure black and brown people earn the same as their white counterparts.

1000
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:35,381
[SPEAKER_11]: We can all be a part of this solution.

1001
02:41:36,501 --> 02:41:46,745
[SPEAKER_11]: White supremacists and conservative groups are spending their days plotting and are attacking the progress that has been made.

1002
02:41:47,845 --> 02:41:51,026
[SPEAKER_11]: We must be 10 steps ahead.

1003
02:41:52,087 --> 02:41:57,449
[SPEAKER_11]: We can no longer be asleep at the wheel or sit on the sidelines.

1004
02:41:57,889 --> 02:42:12,896
[SPEAKER_11]: We must work together and find allies and supporters who have a solid, demonstrated commitment to social and racial justice and the fight for a more equitable and inclusive world.

1005
02:42:13,516 --> 02:42:15,637
[SPEAKER_11]: We are stronger together.

1006
02:42:21,953 --> 02:42:26,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So I stand here before you today with much love in my heart.

1007
02:42:27,358 --> 02:42:28,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I have faith.

1008
02:42:28,639 --> 02:42:38,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I am feeling incredibly hopeful, feeling blessed, and with much gratitude for Dr. King and so many other civil rights activists

1009
02:42:38,807 --> 02:42:56,822
[SPEAKER_11]: that came before me who dared to put words into action for a more equitable world, and although our history is marred with oppressive systems, our ancestors have shown us what transformative solidarity looked like back then.

1010
02:42:57,522 --> 02:43:13,481
[SPEAKER_11]: The stakes are much higher now, so I encourage us all today to take on new transformative solidarity ways of sticking together, supporting each other for the world that we want, this peaceful world that we want to see.

1011
02:43:14,502 --> 02:43:31,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's be inspired by Dr. King and the civil rights movement and the progress that has been made, but admit that we have much more work to do, and let's recommit to doing our part for a more just society.

1012
02:43:32,816 --> 02:43:38,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So finally, I will leave you with a quote from Doctrine for Dr. King.

1013
02:43:40,166 --> 02:43:48,153
[SPEAKER_11]: We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.

1014
02:43:49,574 --> 02:43:51,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for listening today.

1015
02:43:51,956 --> 02:43:53,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy the rest of your day.

1016
02:44:11,911 --> 02:44:12,231
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1017
02:44:13,693 --> 02:44:15,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Celia.

1018
02:44:15,574 --> 02:44:17,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You definitely understood the assignment.

1019
02:44:19,718 --> 02:44:27,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're so glad that you agreed to join us today as we reflect upon our own pieces of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'

1020
02:44:27,185 --> 02:44:27,786
[SPEAKER_07]: 's dream.

1021
02:44:31,136 --> 02:44:35,701
[SPEAKER_07]: You have been a great audience in braving the elements to join us today.

1022
02:44:35,721 --> 02:44:38,664
[SPEAKER_07]: We're New Englanders.

1023
02:44:39,184 --> 02:44:44,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We're supposed to be resilient and strong and not let the weather affect what we think we want to do.

1024
02:44:45,030 --> 02:44:49,114
[SPEAKER_07]: But five or six inches of snow hits.

1025
02:44:49,795 --> 02:44:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Because somebody got to get rid of it.

1026
02:44:52,557 --> 02:44:54,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And that somebody today was me.

1027
02:44:54,398 --> 02:45:01,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was out in Randolph saying, man, we going to be able to get to Medford today?

1028
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:03,680
[SPEAKER_07]: But my wife was very encouraging.

1029
02:45:03,720 --> 02:45:08,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And she said, if you go out and shovel us out, we'll be able to get to Medford today.

1030
02:45:12,072 --> 02:45:15,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're here, we did arrive, okay.

1031
02:45:18,156 --> 02:45:27,061
[SPEAKER_07]: As we move toward the close of this program, I would repeat that no such gathering will be complete if we didn't link arms and sing together.

1032
02:45:27,702 --> 02:45:38,008
[SPEAKER_07]: So here to present and lead us in another of Dr. King's favorite spirituals, We Shall Overcome, is the living, breathing soundtrack of Medford, Stacey Clayton,

1033
02:45:38,388 --> 02:45:42,230
[SPEAKER_07]: accompanied once again by my good friend pianist Jonathan Fagan.

1034
02:45:45,831 --> 02:45:51,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I have invited our dancers to join us for We Shall Overcome.

1035
02:45:51,734 --> 02:45:53,034
[SPEAKER_02]: All right it is your turn everybody.

1036
02:45:53,475 --> 02:45:55,416
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like you can stand.

1037
02:45:56,456 --> 02:45:59,017
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like to go ahead and sing with us.

1038
02:46:00,018 --> 02:46:03,959
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall overcome, not I shall overcome, we shall overcome.

1039
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:08,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so easy, right?

1040
02:46:08,481 --> 02:46:13,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can do all things, as the book says, through Christ who strengthens us.

1041
02:46:14,145 --> 02:46:23,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as we are armed for each other in many ways, we'll get to where our destination needs to be.

1042
02:46:23,993 --> 02:46:26,955
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to look out for each other, no matter what comes this year.

1043
02:46:28,149 --> 02:46:29,810
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall overcome.

1044
02:46:30,170 --> 02:46:38,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a charge today that we've been given, and each one of us has a part to play in our own circle of life.

1045
02:46:39,373 --> 02:46:41,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And our destiny is what we make it.

1046
02:46:41,934 --> 02:46:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's sing together, we shall overcome.

1047
02:46:56,258 --> 02:47:01,207
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall overcome.

1048
02:47:02,389 --> 02:47:07,318
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall overcome.

1049
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: We

1050
02:47:27,619 --> 02:47:40,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that we shall overcome someday.

1051
02:47:40,583 --> 02:47:43,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we'll walk hand in hand.

1052
02:47:44,745 --> 02:47:50,327
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll walk hand in hand.

1053
02:47:51,087 --> 02:47:54,148
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll walk hand in hand.

1054
02:48:28,458 --> 02:48:30,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are not afraid.

1055
02:48:31,039 --> 02:48:34,801
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not afraid.

1056
02:48:35,201 --> 02:48:40,763
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not afraid.

1057
02:48:41,543 --> 02:48:46,545
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not afraid today.

1058
02:48:46,565 --> 02:48:46,705
[SPEAKER_03]: We are

1059
02:49:15,504 --> 02:49:16,865
[SPEAKER_03]: afraid.

1060
02:49:17,445 --> 02:49:22,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Not today, not tomorrow, not any day.

1061
02:49:22,867 --> 02:49:33,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, we are not afraid today.

1062
02:49:34,112 --> 02:49:35,293
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall stand together.

1063
02:49:37,233 --> 02:49:42,379
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall stand together.

1064
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:48,666
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall stand together.

1065
02:49:49,727 --> 02:49:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall stand together.

1066
02:50:15,781 --> 02:50:21,946
[SPEAKER_03]: shall stand together someday.

1067
02:50:22,046 --> 02:50:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth will make us free.

1068
02:50:26,709 --> 02:50:31,873
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth will make us free.

1069
02:50:32,874 --> 02:50:36,657
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth will make us free.

1070
02:50:39,117 --> 02:50:49,720
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth will make us free someday.

1071
02:50:49,740 --> 02:50:54,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe.

1072
02:51:04,721 --> 02:51:19,804
[SPEAKER_03]: that we truth will set us free someday and we shall all live in peace we shall live in

1073
02:51:22,730 --> 02:51:47,305
[SPEAKER_03]: ♪ We shall live in peace ♪ We shall live in peace ♪ Someday ♪ Oh, deep in my heart

1074
02:52:01,899 --> 02:52:05,945
[SPEAKER_03]: someday.

1075
02:52:05,965 --> 02:52:12,373
[SPEAKER_03]: That we shall live in peace someday.

1076
02:52:31,627 --> 02:52:31,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1077
02:52:32,027 --> 02:52:32,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1078
02:52:33,847 --> 02:52:34,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1079
02:52:34,508 --> 02:52:35,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1080
02:52:36,568 --> 02:52:37,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1081
02:52:37,328 --> 02:52:37,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1082
02:52:37,868 --> 02:52:38,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1083
02:52:38,328 --> 02:52:38,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1084
02:52:40,369 --> 02:52:40,789
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1085
02:52:47,870 --> 02:52:56,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So Celia made mention of a charge.

1086
02:52:58,923 --> 02:53:02,945
[SPEAKER_07]: no gathering of this type is complete without one.

1087
02:53:03,886 --> 02:53:08,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So from one important tradition to the next I would like to bring another friend front and center.

1088
02:53:09,328 --> 02:53:15,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole Mosalam is a dedicated advocate for social justice, equity and interfaith connection.

1089
02:53:16,252 --> 02:53:21,294
[SPEAKER_07]: She is committed to ensuring that no one feels unsafe or unwelcome in their community.

1090
02:53:21,394 --> 02:53:22,355
[SPEAKER_07]: As a Muslim woman

1091
02:53:23,035 --> 02:53:30,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Her activism is deeply rooted in faith and the principle of loving for others what she loves for herself.

1092
02:53:31,202 --> 02:53:38,648
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a former executive director of the Islamic Cultural Center of Medford and a state representative candidate.

1093
02:53:39,328 --> 02:53:47,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole has worked to build inclusive communities, amplify marginalized voices, and foster meaningful dialogue.

1094
02:53:48,553 --> 02:53:50,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I greatly admire this woman.

1095
02:53:51,935 --> 02:53:54,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Like myself, she's a cancer survivor and a fighter.

1096
02:53:55,737 --> 02:54:06,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I've asked her to deliver our charge as we leave this gathering to continue on in this kindred journey to beloved community in Medford and beyond, Nicole Moselam.

1097
02:54:21,525 --> 02:54:22,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.

1098
02:54:27,688 --> 02:54:31,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody, for being here today.

1099
02:54:31,230 --> 02:54:36,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of the organizers and everyone who helped make this possible today.

1100
02:54:36,633 --> 02:54:46,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And we believe you are here today because you share the values that Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

1101
02:54:47,378 --> 02:54:51,160
[SPEAKER_01]: so courageously championed throughout his historic life

1102
02:54:52,385 --> 02:54:55,887
[SPEAKER_01]: You care about equal protection under the law.

1103
02:54:56,928 --> 02:54:59,489
[SPEAKER_01]: You care about voting rights.

1104
02:55:00,090 --> 02:55:08,195
[SPEAKER_01]: You care about access in housing and equity, employment, education, and health care.

1105
02:55:09,095 --> 02:55:19,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And you care about the nonviolent pursuit of peace, equality, and the best vision of America we can show to the world.

1106
02:55:20,602 --> 02:55:23,323
[SPEAKER_01]: even amongst this darkest time.

1107
02:55:25,104 --> 02:55:37,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today, I hope you've learned something meaningful, had conversations that inspired connection with your neighbors, and found a moment of peace amidst the challenges of our times.

1108
02:55:38,829 --> 02:55:41,090
[SPEAKER_01]: These moments are powerful.

1109
02:55:41,831 --> 02:55:47,213
[SPEAKER_01]: They remind us of our shared humanity and the resilience of our communities.

1110
02:55:48,413 --> 02:55:58,359
[SPEAKER_01]: But most importantly, we are reminded of the strength of the backs of those who have carried us to this moment.

1111
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:15,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've been asked to take the energy that we've created here together and turn it into a charge, a call to action that carries us forward as a beloved community.

1112
02:56:18,191 --> 02:56:28,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really humbled by this responsibility, but also resolute in using these moments to share something of value as we leave here today.

1113
02:56:30,140 --> 02:56:31,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let this be the end.

1114
02:56:33,523 --> 02:56:42,049
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three guiding principles I believe Dr. King would urge us to embrace as we move forward together.

1115
02:56:44,057 --> 02:56:50,639
[SPEAKER_01]: First, Dr. King would remind us to communicate with one another with respect and honesty.

1116
02:56:52,159 --> 02:57:03,001
[SPEAKER_01]: He would encourage us to view our differences not as barriers, but as opportunities to learn, grow, and find common ground.

1117
02:57:04,422 --> 02:57:09,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, Dr. King would call us to let faith be a bridge.

1118
02:57:11,422 --> 02:57:24,175
[SPEAKER_01]: He believed in the power of earnest faith, not just as a spiritual anchor, but as a means to connect across denominations, expressions, and styles of worship.

1119
02:57:25,516 --> 02:57:34,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Faith can unite us when we let in, and we let others in, helping us see the divine in one another.

1120
02:57:36,498 --> 02:57:45,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, Dr. King would urge us to stand united against social injustice, poverty, and indifference.

1121
02:57:47,805 --> 02:57:58,453
[SPEAKER_01]: He would implore us to vote our consciences, to resist the coercion of rights for marginalized people, and to act with integrity and purpose.

1122
02:57:59,594 --> 02:58:06,540
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we leave this gathering, I charge you with three actionable commitments.

1123
02:58:08,868 --> 02:58:11,590
[SPEAKER_01]: First, engage with your neighbors.

1124
02:58:12,791 --> 02:58:15,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Go beyond surface interactions.

1125
02:58:16,654 --> 02:58:22,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Meet in community spaces, city halls, parks, libraries, coffee shops.

1126
02:58:25,020 --> 02:58:26,201
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential is limitless.

1127
02:58:27,462 --> 02:58:29,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And have meaningful conversations.

1128
02:58:30,384 --> 02:58:31,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to know one another.

1129
02:58:33,066 --> 02:58:38,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Speak respectfully and honestly, even when it feels uncomfortable.

1130
02:58:40,522 --> 02:58:45,127
[SPEAKER_01]: for what is growth without a little discomfort.

1131
02:58:47,289 --> 02:58:49,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Connection starts with showing up first.

1132
02:58:51,470 --> 02:58:56,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, let your faith be a force for unity.

1133
02:58:57,454 --> 02:59:11,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you find it in a mosque, a temple, a church, or a quiet moment in nature, let your faith inspire you to reach out, learn, and build bridges.

1134
02:59:12,863 --> 02:59:20,788
[SPEAKER_01]: As Celia reminded me in her speech with us today, one of our shared prophets said,

1135
02:59:22,351 --> 02:59:24,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Faith, hope, and love.

1136
02:59:25,432 --> 02:59:27,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Let these be held amongst you.

1137
02:59:28,734 --> 02:59:30,955
[SPEAKER_01]: But the greatest of these is love.

1138
02:59:33,556 --> 02:59:49,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my own faith tradition, which I believe amplifies that message, none of you have faith until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.

1139
02:59:52,275 --> 02:59:58,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Now finally, be a voice for what is fair, just, and true.

1140
03:00:00,918 --> 03:00:05,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote not just as a civic duty, but as an expression of hope and accountability.

1141
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:08,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Advocate for what is right.

1142
03:00:09,261 --> 03:00:18,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Encourage others to stay hopeful, engaged, and grounded in love, even when the world provokes us to anger or despair.

1143
03:00:20,307 --> 03:00:28,932
[SPEAKER_01]: and remember to do it without compromise to yourself and with the best of intentions and integrity.

1144
03:00:30,933 --> 03:00:40,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. King dreamed of an America where people are judged by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.

1145
03:00:43,024 --> 03:00:51,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And I dare say that he would even add to that now as we seek to divide ourselves even more with arbitrary labels.

1146
03:00:54,232 --> 03:01:03,198
[SPEAKER_01]: He envisioned a nation where darkness is driven out by light and where love transforms enemies into friends.

1147
03:01:04,379 --> 03:01:07,361
[SPEAKER_01]: That dream belongs to all of us.

1148
03:01:08,842 --> 03:01:11,144
[SPEAKER_01]: We each hold a piece of it.

1149
03:01:12,181 --> 03:01:18,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we come together, those pieces form something extraordinary.

1150
03:01:20,433 --> 03:01:37,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we leave here today, let us carry forward the sacred trust of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., his vision, his courage, and his unyielding faith in the power of community.

1151
03:01:38,477 --> 03:01:42,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. King once said, not everybody can be famous.

1152
03:01:43,658 --> 03:01:50,582
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody can be great because greatness is determined by service.

1153
03:01:52,163 --> 03:01:58,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So I invite you all today, when you leave here, join together in that service.

1154
03:02:00,929 --> 03:02:02,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being here today.

1155
03:02:03,491 --> 03:02:11,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your determination to serve and for your commitment to living out the promise of Dr. King's dream.

1156
03:02:13,376 --> 03:02:31,744
[SPEAKER_01]: not just his dream, but I believe the dream of everyone who has struggled and fought so that we may all be equal to each other, so that we may all love one another as human beings.

1157
03:02:32,584 --> 03:02:32,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1158
03:02:42,947 --> 03:02:46,471
[SPEAKER_07]: All right okay.

1159
03:02:47,712 --> 03:02:58,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we wrap things up I am going to cede the floor to Lisa Crossman our executive director to acknowledge and to thank some folks.

1160
03:02:59,064 --> 03:03:03,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Please show your love for Lisa and give her attention for just a few minutes more.

1161
03:03:14,336 --> 03:03:16,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold the mic.

1162
03:03:16,978 --> 03:03:18,398
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not going to keep you long.

1163
03:03:18,539 --> 03:03:21,801
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say a few words.

1164
03:03:22,681 --> 03:03:27,284
[SPEAKER_15]: If you did not know, this year marks the 90th anniversary of the West Medford Community Center.

1165
03:03:27,304 --> 03:03:28,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

1166
03:03:28,405 --> 03:03:30,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Applause for that.

1167
03:03:30,326 --> 03:03:30,706
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1168
03:03:33,339 --> 03:03:37,921
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a testament to the enduring spirit and unwavering support of our community.

1169
03:03:38,961 --> 03:03:45,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Founded in 1935, the West Medford Community Center began as a small gathering place for black residents.

1170
03:03:45,704 --> 03:03:52,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Over the years, it has grown to the cornerstone of this community, adapting to the changing needs and expanding its services.

1171
03:03:54,067 --> 03:04:01,910
[SPEAKER_15]: This year's theme, Your Piece of the Dream, a powerful reminder of the collective effort required to achieve Dr. King's vision.

1172
03:04:06,688 --> 03:04:07,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me.

1173
03:04:07,529 --> 03:04:13,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. King was indeed a powerful advocate for the empowerment of black people and fought tirelessly against racial oppression.

1174
03:04:14,616 --> 03:04:20,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Events like this are crucial in keeping Dr. King's spirit and mission alive.

1175
03:04:20,462 --> 03:04:24,846
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always inspiring when the community comes together for such meaningful events.

1176
03:04:25,587 --> 03:04:29,070
[SPEAKER_15]: We hope you join us for our gatherings during this landmark year.

1177
03:04:29,090 --> 03:04:32,333
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a very special year for me.

1178
03:04:33,474 --> 03:04:34,815
[SPEAKER_15]: My son attends St.

1179
03:04:34,855 --> 03:04:36,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Raphael's here for school.

1180
03:04:37,037 --> 03:04:41,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I come and Father Paul, I see him three days a week in church in the mornings.

1181
03:04:42,001 --> 03:04:44,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Many of you come to our events and we've been to yours.

1182
03:04:45,223 --> 03:04:48,066
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just a wonderful reminder of

1183
03:04:48,746 --> 03:04:54,829
[SPEAKER_15]: All the hard work, all the tough days when we come together, we have this event at the beginning of the year.

1184
03:04:54,949 --> 03:04:57,790
[SPEAKER_15]: It really sets the tone for us and the work that we do.

1185
03:04:58,430 --> 03:05:02,032
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have some really wonderful and great things happening this year.

1186
03:05:02,072 --> 03:05:08,214
[SPEAKER_15]: We hope that you join us in celebration for the 90th, which will be Memorial Day weekend 2025.

1187
03:05:11,365 --> 03:05:13,546
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to just give a special thanks to St.

1188
03:05:13,626 --> 03:05:22,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Raphael Parish, Bill Cadigan, Father Paul, and Miss Blackear, who was downstairs opening the door, just being so gracious.

1189
03:05:23,289 --> 03:05:33,732
[SPEAKER_15]: We also want to thank the Mystic Branch Area NAACP, the Needham Bank, and Wegmans for their sponsorship of this dynamic event.

1190
03:05:33,772 --> 03:05:36,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Without their partnership, this would not be possible.

1191
03:05:38,094 --> 03:05:38,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes, yes.

1192
03:05:41,232 --> 03:05:45,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also like to thank some special people.

1193
03:05:45,294 --> 03:05:47,335
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I say your name, please stand up.

1194
03:05:48,335 --> 03:05:48,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1195
03:05:48,656 --> 03:05:50,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Ketley, Ms.

1196
03:05:50,156 --> 03:05:50,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Marilyn, Ms.

1197
03:05:51,337 --> 03:05:55,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Charmaine, Mr. Grant, Ms.

1198
03:05:55,339 --> 03:05:56,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Rachel, Ms.

1199
03:05:56,159 --> 03:05:57,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Shirley, get up now.

1200
03:05:57,219 --> 03:05:57,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Get up.

1201
03:06:00,575 --> 03:06:00,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1202
03:06:00,815 --> 03:06:02,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Alita, thank you.

1203
03:06:02,316 --> 03:06:06,537
[SPEAKER_15]: These ladies, they helped us pull this whole event together.

1204
03:06:06,937 --> 03:06:07,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1205
03:06:07,117 --> 03:06:08,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Melinda's out there too.

03:06:08,977 --> 03:06:10,318
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you so much.

1207
03:06:10,878 --> 03:06:12,178
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad it looks seamless.

1208
03:06:13,699 --> 03:06:15,799
[SPEAKER_15]: And a special thanks to our board members.

1209
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:17,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, if you just could just stand up.

1210
03:06:17,540 --> 03:06:19,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Brian Collins and Ms.

1211
03:06:19,180 --> 03:06:22,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Melinda Regan and Michael Bergman, I believe, are in the room.

1212
03:06:22,621 --> 03:06:24,062
[SPEAKER_15]: And David Kilpatrick.

1213
03:06:26,188 --> 03:06:27,829
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go, David Kilpatrick.

1214
03:06:28,229 --> 03:06:32,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Phil is not here, but thank you all to the board and their leadership.

1215
03:06:32,452 --> 03:06:36,894
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been a great support for us this year, and we hope many more years.

1216
03:06:37,855 --> 03:06:40,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And thanks to Kevin Harrington and his team.

1217
03:06:41,417 --> 03:06:42,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Kevin does a wonderful job.

1218
03:06:44,644 --> 03:06:45,966
[SPEAKER_15]: He gives and gives and gives.

1219
03:06:45,986 --> 03:06:47,987
[SPEAKER_15]: He does some dynamic work.

1220
03:06:48,288 --> 03:06:51,470
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we're so gracious and happy to have him.

1221
03:06:52,171 --> 03:06:58,957
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, last but not least, the man, the myth, the legend, Terry E. Carter.

1222
03:06:58,977 --> 03:07:00,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1223
03:07:06,535 --> 03:07:09,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, thank you for your creative vision and your inspiration.

1224
03:07:10,556 --> 03:07:11,836
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a lovely day.

1225
03:07:12,276 --> 03:07:14,357
[SPEAKER_15]: And time is a precious gift.

1226
03:07:14,597 --> 03:07:16,097
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've spent it here with us.

1227
03:07:16,157 --> 03:07:17,578
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just couldn't be more grateful.

1228
03:07:17,658 --> 03:07:18,698
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you so much.

1229
03:07:24,319 --> 03:07:24,779
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1230
03:07:25,099 --> 03:07:25,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Lisa.

1231
03:07:25,959 --> 03:07:26,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Again.

1232
03:07:29,494 --> 03:07:33,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody can be great because anybody can serve.

1233
03:07:33,635 --> 03:07:35,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are prophetic words.

1234
03:07:35,395 --> 03:07:37,575
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to have a college degree to serve.

1235
03:07:37,595 --> 03:07:40,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve.

1236
03:07:41,036 --> 03:07:46,057
[SPEAKER_07]: You only need to have a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.

1237
03:07:46,517 --> 03:07:54,599
[SPEAKER_07]: As we leave this place, let's allow our hearts to be full of grace and our souls be generated by love.

1238
03:07:54,679 --> 03:07:55,379
[SPEAKER_07]: God bless you.

1239
03:07:55,439 --> 03:07:56,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a wonderful afternoon.

1240
03:08:20,719 --> 03:08:22,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuesday might be a off day for a brother.

1241
03:08:23,901 --> 03:08:25,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be a off day.

1242
03:08:25,082 --> 03:08:25,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.

1243
03:09:49,717 --> 03:09:50,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's your camera?

1244
03:09:51,038 --> 03:09:51,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you not?

1245
03:09:52,519 --> 03:10:05,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, just by way of shameless self-promotion, if you're interested, I have a couple of volumes of my poetry, and we have our CD over here on the table, so if you're interested, come see me.

1246
03:10:06,069 --> 03:10:13,454
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and last but not least, I just want to make mention of Sunday, August 23rd,

1247
03:10:17,135 --> 03:10:25,759
[SPEAKER_07]: excuse me, February 23rd, five o'clock at Somerville Community Baptist Church on 31 College Avenue in Somerville.

1248
03:10:26,179 --> 03:10:30,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Stacey Clayton has her annual gospel concert.

1249
03:10:30,622 --> 03:10:32,122
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not to be missed.

1250
03:10:32,683 --> 03:10:45,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So put it on your calendar, Sunday, February 23rd, five o'clock, Somerville Community Baptist Church, Stacey Clayton's annual gospel concert in celebration of Black History Month.
