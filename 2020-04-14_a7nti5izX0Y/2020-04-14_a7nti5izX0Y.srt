[SPEAKER_05]: We have a full committee.

35
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we are going to start with art.

36
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:44,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if Ms.

37
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Patterson has any comments initially.

38
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:54,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'd like, just for ease of transition, I can share my screen again and we can go through the departments.

39
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:55,648
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

40
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:56,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

41
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tony, you'll be up first.

42
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:00,789
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

43
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:09,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are going to make sure that we have, show all my windows here.

44
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:41,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So going with the same format that we have been utilizing for previous budget meetings, we are identifying the proposed column, which you can see, can you see the screen here?

45
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:44,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

46
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:55,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so for fiscal year 2021, this is the proposed column that the department heads have identified their need for the upcoming fiscal year.

47
00:03:55,847 --> 00:04:04,331
[SPEAKER_02]: In the narrative documents that they had shared, they have identified the specifics that make up each of their line items.

48
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:14,079
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have identified any of their hopeful items if there were such an opportunity.

49
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:29,313
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the Fine Arts Department, again, I'm just utilizing a placeholder line item for the total of the departmental value of the Steps and Lane COLAs going into fiscal year 2021.

50
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:32,330
[SPEAKER_02]: for the department.

51
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It is $1,828,829 for the salaries.

52
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we go through each of the individual fine art supply and or instruction, contract service, textbook amounts

53
00:04:52,733 --> 00:05:04,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Zignes will explain and go through each of his departmental requests, but he has a level funded budget request here for the dollar figures.

54
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:14,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you would like me to transition to the narrative, I'm happy to do so, or we can stay on this document and have the department heads just speak to their narrative.

55
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a question, just protocol, chair?

56
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:21,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you may.

57
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:25,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

58
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to ask, are we doing the raise hand option on our screen?

59
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we raising our hand?

60
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:33,636
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you want us to ask questions on this, the first?

61
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:47,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second is for the shared drive, superintendent Vincent, I'm seeing the narrative on the shared drive, but I'm not seeing the budget build for this particular item, unless I'm missing it.

62
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:47,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, is it?

63
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a full document, it's a PDF, and it's entitled Fiscal FY21 All Budget Build?

64
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:56,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

65
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what page is this on for that?

66
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:01,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're sharing the screen, but I just want to know.

67
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:03,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It's page 20 of 28.

68
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

69
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

70
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:09,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hold on, let me unmute you.

71
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:09,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

72
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:13,024
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it, Kathy?

73
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:17,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I couldn't find these budget sheets either.

74
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I still can't find them.

75
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:21,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where they are.

76
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:31,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the shared documents with all the narratives, but I don't have the budget sheets for these committee meetings, for the committee of the whole this particular meeting.

77
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:36,345
[SPEAKER_02]: They are inclusive in the shared drive.

78
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:38,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, if it,

79
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,271
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it easier.

80
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:52,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I can stay on this particular page and we can go through each of the departments that we are reviewing and you can follow along as the department heads just review their narrative.

81
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:54,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

82
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:00,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And member McLaughlin, you asked about raising hands.

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,861
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine if you just want to raise your hand.

84
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:06,122
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing is while we're sharing the screen, I cannot see everybody.

85
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:07,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So feel free to

86
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,489
[SPEAKER_05]: respectfully ask questions as you may.

87
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only see like six people on the side and be able to see the screen, so.

88
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:19,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Ms.

89
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Patterson, thank you.

90
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:37,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I think we can turn it on to Tony Zignage, the department head for the fine arts, and he can review his narrative, identifying each of the categories that you see on your screen.

91
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:55,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have anything to add, miss?

92
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:56,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm sorry.

93
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can everyone hear me?

94
00:07:58,977 --> 00:07:59,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

95
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:04,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

96
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, not quite sure if my connection was good.

97
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:13,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you all have the narrative.

98
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like me to go through the narrative or just add to that?

99
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:39,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to say in the interest of time and based on the total number of departments that are going to be presenting, I would like to suggest that you would summarize the key points from your narrative and then refer to this document so that we're able to hear from all of the departments.

100
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:41,505
[SPEAKER_09]: today.

101
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:42,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

102
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, absolutely.

103
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:49,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the first thing I'd like to do is publicly acknowledge our fine art staff for their phenomenal work this year.

104
00:08:51,410 --> 00:09:03,737
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a trying year and I was really pleased that they've all stepped up and volunteered to help at every turn, including right now collaborating with each other for the distance learning.

105
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,780
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's not meant

106
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:21,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the narrative that I think was especially important is that I mentored five student teachers from Gordon College, Lesley University, and the School of Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts, which

107
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:32,368
[SPEAKER_00]: which we need good new teachers and the requirements for the cooperating teacher is much greater these days.

108
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they should be commended for that.

109
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:41,978
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our budget concerns,

110
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Right up at the wish list is up now.

111
00:09:47,421 --> 00:10:04,117
[SPEAKER_00]: The maintenance of equipment that deals mainly with piano tuning, keeping the kilns in operating condition for the art department, and some other extra things that I'll mention in a moment.

112
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:13,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Pupil transportation is mainly for the marching band to go to and from competitions and their other engagements.

113
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:24,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Office supplies basically mainly paper is a big need There will come a day.

114
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:46,722
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope when the Everything can be done on tablets and whatever but right now paper is still a big priority for us the textbook supplies is mainly it says textbooks, but it's mainly curriculum supplies mainly for the music teachers that includes method books printed materials printed music and

115
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:55,185
[SPEAKER_00]: and some online materials.

116
00:10:55,946 --> 00:11:02,388
[SPEAKER_00]: The instructional supplies is mainly the consumable things that the art department uses.

117
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:07,049
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through a lot of paints and paper and supplies such as that.

118
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:17,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardware, we have, again, we have the kilns in particular and a lot of the instruments need upkeep and repair.

119
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:31,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, as far as the, um, in addition to our normal operating requirements, we're able to accomplish some important things, extra things this past year.

120
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:38,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the baby grand piano at the McGlynn auditorium needed some major attention in addition to, um, needed to be tuned.

121
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:42,954
[SPEAKER_00]: The cover, the music stands had undergone significant damage over the years.

122
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:46,696
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to remedy that and put that instrument back into shape.

123
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:56,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, I was able to replace about half of the art room stools at some of our elementary and middle school art rooms.

124
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:09,630
[SPEAKER_00]: These rooms had and still have the original stools from when the schools opened, and they tip over easily and have this formica-type seat that when it falls, it chips and has sharp edges and leaves shards.

125
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year we're able to replace 20 at the Brooks, 20 at the McGlynn Middle School, 20 at the Columbus,

126
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:23,096
[SPEAKER_00]: and 15 at the Roberts with the metal type stool that you see in the art rooms which are much sturdier and safer.

127
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:28,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping to replace the rest next year.

128
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And another major concern which I outlined in my wish list is the need for safe and functional means of displaying our student artwork.

129
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:42,609
[SPEAKER_00]: The display boards that we currently have at the schools are old and deteriorating and there's virtually no way to display 3D art.

130
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:49,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And our students create some amazing work that we really should be able to exhibit in the proper manner.

131
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:53,455
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of my priorities for the upcoming year.

132
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,678
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much that's it in a nutshell.

133
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:59,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be pleased to answer any questions.

134
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?

135
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

136
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Member Graham.

137
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:11,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a quick question for you.

138
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:17,715
[SPEAKER_15]: For the marching band, do students pay participation fees to be part of the marching band?

139
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:23,657
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, there are fees associated.

140
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:26,938
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them, most of it is covered by fundraising that the kids do.

141
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:30,899
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a,

142
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,441
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes some money to run the marching band.

143
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, not a lot of it is covered by the budget.

144
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of fundraising involved, yes.

145
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:51,350
[SPEAKER_15]: And do you have a sense of the average amount of fundraising that happens year over year to support the band?

146
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really don't have that.

147
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell you that off the top of my head.

148
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:59,515
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot has to do with what's happening for that year.

149
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we're hoping next year is the year that the band is supposed to go to Hawaii.

150
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:10,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And that depends a lot, a major lot on fundraising.

151
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:17,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Mrs. Relo has been in touch with the organizers and they're just kind of taking a wait and see attitude of what's going to happen.

152
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:23,526
[SPEAKER_00]: So next year coming up is iffy as far as everything that's going to take place.

153
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:27,769
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes all of the competitions and regular things that they normally do.

154
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:41,588
[SPEAKER_15]: And does the band parent organization, did they submit information to the district about their fundraising dollars this year?

155
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:44,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there some way to know what that amount of money is?

156
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:48,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have, make sure you get that right away.

157
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:54,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, again, everything that's normally done at the end of the year is kind of up, you know.

158
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get it.

159
00:14:55,788 --> 00:15:00,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more than happy to make sure that tomorrow we get that information to you.

160
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, whenever you have a chance, it's not urgent.

161
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:13,297
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I'm just trying to sort of understand how all of the extracurriculars come together, which is different from, you know, between fine arts and all that good stuff.

162
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:14,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

163
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:15,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor.

164
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, member van de Kloot.

165
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Mr. Zigney, I just wanted to ask.

166
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:32,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that there's been some frustrations with working out your student enrollment in the music programs in particular.

167
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,801
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you looking at for next year?

168
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:39,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And because you mentioned some frustrations this year.

169
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:49,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's so as far as, again, not as you know this budget is great if I can get what I got last year, I'm happy.

170
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:55,122
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest concern is in the area of access to the kids.

171
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:01,738
[SPEAKER_00]: now is when the kids at home are doing their sign up.

172
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:06,339
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll know in a few weeks if we've made any progress in that area.

173
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So the real issue for us is getting able to get our kids scheduled, basically.

174
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,701
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, I think we made some improvements.

175
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:18,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, in the past, I wasn't quite as pleased.

176
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:22,924
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, I am satisfied that we have done everything that we can.

177
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:24,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had the access to the kids.

178
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,125
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been able to present our program as best we could.

179
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:35,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that maybe that will give us some improvement in our numbers, especially.

180
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:43,540
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there are issues at the high school that affect the scheduling that are being worked on and hopefully will be resolved.

181
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've done and everybody's doing everything they can to address that problem.

182
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:54,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping in a few weeks when those numbers come in, then we'll have some good news.

183
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm optimistic.

184
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:56,828
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thank you, Tony.

185
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:57,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

186
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:01,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions relating to the fine arts budget?

187
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:10,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, we can move on to physical education and health.

188
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:25,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so on screen, we have the page that identifies the again, the placeholder amount for all of the salaries that include a step in lane for the upcoming fiscal year, which is $1,404,022.

189
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of the additional line items has been level funded again, and we can

190
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:40,989
[SPEAKER_02]: review, I will share the screenshot on the narrative as well.

191
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:48,651
[SPEAKER_02]: But if Rachel Perry would like to jump in and review her narrative items at this time.

192
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:49,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

193
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:50,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

194
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:51,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, everyone.

195
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,472
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll get right into it.

196
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:57,032
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go right through my line items and just explain what each is used for.

197
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,073
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'll talk about what I'm asking for for next year.

198
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:06,416
[SPEAKER_13]: So first we're looking at $6,000 for my fitness center supervision.

199
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:11,139
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is to have somebody open and close the fitness center after school.

200
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,102
[SPEAKER_13]: We have that on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursdays at the high school from 2.30 to 4.30.

201
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:23,228
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's for our staff, faculty, and for our students to be able to use the fitness center after school on three days a week.

202
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,570
[SPEAKER_13]: And that starts in September and that ends in June.

203
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,043
[SPEAKER_13]: The next line item is maintenance of equipment, which we have $20,000 in that slot.

204
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:46,008
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that money, what we do is we have a fitness company come in to maintain the equipment two times a year to make sure everything's working okay and to replace anything that needs to be replaced or upgraded.

205
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:54,892
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have a company called Wingspeed come in to make sure our low elements course at the middle schools are also maintained.

206
00:18:55,848 --> 00:19:05,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the rest of that money we actually put towards upgrading some equipment in the fitness center, which the fitness center is about 10 years old.

207
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,863
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really start need to start upgrading some of that equipment.

208
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:12,207
[SPEAKER_13]: What we've done already is put some turf.

209
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:18,210
[SPEAKER_13]: a strip of turf in the middle of the fitness center to work on functional training.

210
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,832
[SPEAKER_13]: We've added TRXs to the fitness center, moved some equipment around.

211
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:26,874
[SPEAKER_13]: We've gotten the flip tires, we've gotten kettlebells, new medicine balls.

212
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,515
[SPEAKER_13]: So we really have done some upgrades.

213
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:39,899
[SPEAKER_13]: This year I've also ordered a couple of bikes and some of the water rowers, which haven't come in yet, but those will additionally be added to the fitness center for this year.

214
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:48,528
[SPEAKER_13]: And within the next few years, we need to continually start to upgrade some of that equipment that's in there as it is old or getting old.

215
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:52,112
[SPEAKER_13]: My next line item is office supplies, $400.

216
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:56,176
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for paper, pens, pencils, things like that.

217
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:59,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Instructional supplies, we have $15,000 and that's for equipment for

218
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:05,674
[SPEAKER_13]: my physical education and health education teachers.

219
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:14,261
[SPEAKER_13]: That could be anything from balls, bats, things like that to health education where they need markers, post a board for projects and things.

220
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:17,904
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's for the elementaries, middle and high schools.

221
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:22,568
[SPEAKER_13]: My next line is $7,000 for textbooks.

222
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:30,115
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is for curriculum supplies that could be for Michigan model things that we need to reorder every year if needed at schools.

223
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,688
[SPEAKER_13]: things like that, CPR curriculum that may need to be ordered.

224
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:43,110
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last one would be travel conferences for $500, and that's for conferences I could send a teacher to or for myself.

225
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:47,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm looking for a level funding for that piece.

226
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:52,167
[SPEAKER_13]: For the past five years, I have been doing the budget.

227
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:58,008
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have been looking for two full-time positions.

228
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:04,630
[SPEAKER_13]: One being adaptive physical education teacher that will meet the needs of our special education students across the district.

229
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:12,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're looking to continue to be inclusive, but we're also looking to support our students where they need support.

230
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:18,452
[SPEAKER_13]: And that could be a push-in model where the teacher actually goes into a physical education class and works with the student.

231
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:23,297
[SPEAKER_13]: or it could also be a pull-out model and that's going to depend on what the student needs are.

232
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:31,746
[SPEAKER_13]: The other position I would be looking for is for a middle school health teacher and that's to meet the needs of the middle school students.

233
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:37,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now we have one health teacher at the middle school that's going between two schools.

234
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I would be looking for one

235
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:41,013
[SPEAKER_13]: to be at each school.

236
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:50,378
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have guidance Councilors that are teaching some health right now, which could be an issue for them sometimes if they're dealing with a student in crisis.

237
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,839
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to stop what they're doing to go teach a class.

238
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:04,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it would probably fit us better if we have a teacher that is licensed in health and in education in those classrooms doing that.

239
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:13,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I don't know if you want me to go through that wish list that that's a big wish We're looking, um doing some renovations in the girls locker.

240
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:29,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking to put in a um classroom a spinning studio and a yoga studio, um, so I was looking to put in flat screen tvs some projectors and then Um spinning bikes, which is a really large cost there um

241
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:34,710
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not sure if anyone has any questions.

242
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:42,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to be clear, I did not include two additional positions in the salary hold.

243
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:54,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we were to move forward with that, that would be something that we would need to add into this number, just for clarity for the group.

244
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:54,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

245
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:08,607
[SPEAKER_03]: have a ballpark or can you give us some range of what those two positions would be?

246
00:23:28,604 --> 00:23:37,726
[SPEAKER_02]: for the full year for the amount on the mid range of a master's level would be roughly 60,000 per position.

247
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:38,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So another 120,000.

248
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:39,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

249
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:55,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the adapted PE teacher, I know that's something that you and Bobby have been asking about for a while, and you've had some conversation over, do you find that

250
00:23:55,995 --> 00:24:04,458
[SPEAKER_03]: there are many students in the special education community with IEPs that require adapted PE?

251
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:15,981
[SPEAKER_13]: So in order to really know that number, we would have to do some testing on students, but just checking in with my teachers, they do feel that it is a need in Medford.

252
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:20,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

253
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:20,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

254
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming, is there a special license for,

255
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:25,959
[SPEAKER_03]: teachers who do adapt to PE.

256
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:32,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the concerns that had been discussed in the past, and you addressed it in your narrative, I appreciate that, was the inclusivity of it.

257
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:45,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that we're not creating a sub-separate gym class, we're creating an inclusive gym class where curriculum is adapted and modified for students as needed on an individual basis.

258
00:24:45,131 --> 00:24:47,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a special license or something for that for PE?

259
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:52,275
[SPEAKER_13]: There is an APENS license, but it's not mandatory to have.

260
00:24:53,191 --> 00:25:00,833
[SPEAKER_13]: teachers can actually practice adaptive phys ed with a physical education license, but it is something that I would want someone in that position to have.

261
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:07,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rachel, do you know if any of the surrounding districts that are comparable to Medford have a position like this?

262
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have done some research on it.

263
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Malden has it.

264
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Somerville is looking to do it.

265
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:15,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Revere is putting it in for next year.

266
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Stoneham has it.

267
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,098
[SPEAKER_13]: So more and more districts are adding it.

268
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And so right now, if a student's IEP requires some adapted physical education, how are we accommodating that?

269
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:28,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know?

270
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:36,410
[SPEAKER_13]: We would have to accommodate it with the teachers we have, which is getting very difficult because they are really at their limits as well.

271
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:39,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

272
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:40,753
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

273
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:45,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions for Ms.

274
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:45,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Perry?

275
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:47,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Van der Kloot?

276
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:52,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a question also to Mayor Longo-Curran after Ms.

277
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:53,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Nguyen.

278
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:55,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Van der Kloot, then Member Kreatz.

279
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot, can you press unmute?

280
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:12,903
[SPEAKER_12]: You said that the two requests for the two additional faculty were not included in that one.

281
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:26,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that, just remind me because I don't remember since our last budget meeting, if anybody else had made requests for additional personnel, were they not included in the baseline budget?

282
00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:28,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

283
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:40,814
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a notation that they had requested it, but for the purpose of just developing our baseline amount, I did not include additional new staff that might be required.

284
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,475
[SPEAKER_12]: In any department?

285
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:42,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

286
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:42,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

287
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:43,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

288
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

289
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

290
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:51,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you, Ms.

291
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:52,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Perry, for the report.

292
00:26:53,142 --> 00:27:03,046
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do recall from last year's budget that you did put in for the same two requests for the full-time adaptive PE.

293
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the middle school would be new, I think, this year.

294
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:14,750
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just want to express the need for the adaptive PE teachers for both special education and vocational students.

295
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:27,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard, you know, many, many times, you know, at the beginning of the fall straight through from parents and students that there is no time in their schedule to take gym or PE.

296
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:39,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to share an update from after, you know, the students have been out that I've heard from some of my son's friends who said that they're taking their PE online.

297
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:47,051
[SPEAKER_10]: where they're going to record like, you know, an exercise that they have to send in and, you know, it's I guess it's working out really well.

298
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:58,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just think that it's really important that, you know, if possible, we can get both of these positions added, so that there will be equity with the middle school and

299
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:03,486
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, also equity with the vocational school and the high school and special education needs.

300
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:07,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it's a, you know, really important for, you know, for everybody.

301
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:13,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I'm really hoping that maybe there'll be extra money available for this, um, item.

302
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:14,533
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been requested.

303
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, this is the second year in a row.

304
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,856
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to, you know, express my concerns.

305
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:19,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

306
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:22,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, mayor.

307
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:24,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

308
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

309
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:27,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Rachel.

310
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:29,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a quick question.

311
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:40,291
[SPEAKER_15]: When we talked about the middle school health curriculum, we noted the need for a staff person, but we also had some notes about professional development and materials.

312
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:45,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that included in these numbers that we're looking at on screen or are those additional costs too?

313
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:49,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that could actually come right out of that textbooks line, the $7,000.

314
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:49,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

315
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I had already had in mind for that.

316
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:55,175
[SPEAKER_13]: And what about the professional development that too?

317
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:56,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

318
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, got it.

319
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:57,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

320
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:58,775
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

321
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:07,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions relating to the physical education and health budget?

322
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:12,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, we can go to number three live.

323
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:13,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Miss Perry.

324
00:29:15,455 --> 00:29:17,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Library and media.

325
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:19,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Page 22 of 28.

326
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, correct.

327
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:33,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we have a placeholder for the salaries, which includes step and lane, no additional changes, even though they might have been requested in a narrative.

328
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:40,891
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just as the positions are currently at 1.156387 for the salaries in the media tech department.

329
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, Ms.

330
00:29:48,178 --> 00:29:58,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Layden has requested almost a near flatlined budget with the exception of an additional 3,000 in her textbook accounts.

331
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:07,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can jump to the narrative if she'd like to begin reviewing her particular line items.

332
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:10,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

333
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:18,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to mention a few of the current status that happened this year and some highlights, because they really do guide the requests for next year.

334
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:26,600
[SPEAKER_14]: We did put in a little over 1,000 new Chromebooks this year, which takes us to over 2,000 Chromebooks in the district.

335
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,421
[SPEAKER_14]: So we really did double our Chromebook capacity this year in the schools.

336
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:37,943
[SPEAKER_14]: That includes classroom carts, library devices, universal access devices, replacing devices that were broken.

337
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,064
[SPEAKER_14]: We're in a much better place with Chromebooks.

338
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:46,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have on average about one and a half to two and a half students per Chromebook right now.

339
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:52,489
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what we had when we ended our closure.

340
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:58,852
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do have a fair amount of devices that have gone out, but that is what we were at as we entered the closure time.

341
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:08,253
[SPEAKER_14]: We're in the process of actually replacing old iPad teacher or staff iPads with Chromebooks, so we put about 350 of those into

342
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,732
[SPEAKER_14]: into play.

343
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:19,360
[SPEAKER_14]: We have some staff who continue to hold on to their iPads, but we have enough to replace the ones for people who do want them.

344
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,802
[SPEAKER_14]: They're very old, the iPads from the first buy.

345
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:27,228
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of our equipment is from our initial large bond buy, which was in 2012.

346
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:31,673
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been trying to replace desktops and Chromebooks.

347
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:55,107
[SPEAKER_14]: iPads and and and get into a better more current technology position We did have the opportunity this year with it with resources that became available to start replacing desktop computers So we replaced we're starting with the teaching labs that really have a higher demand on the devices so we did about 125 of those so we did a new

348
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:01,190
[SPEAKER_14]: tech teaching lab in the McGlynn and Andrews middle schools.

349
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,492
[SPEAKER_14]: We did it in the Roberts and McGlynn elementary school and the Curtis Tufts lab.

350
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:08,934
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did start replacing those desktops from the old 2012 machines.

351
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:10,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are very old.

352
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,577
[SPEAKER_14]: They're about eight years old in play, and they're actually probably about nine years old in build.

353
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:17,379
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're getting up to 10 years on those devices.

354
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're hoping to continue those labs.

355
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:44,290
[SPEAKER_14]: We did the high school ones already except for one So we're starting with a tech teaching labs, and then we're moving to the other labs We do have a new high school maker space which was almost done and almost ready to be to be used and that's funded by both the City of Medford as well as we had a Verizon grant so those those materials are coming in that includes things like 3d printers and

356
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:47,639
[SPEAKER_14]: virtual reality headsets and 3D pens.

357
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there's a lot of things that we're coming into there.

358
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,522
[SPEAKER_14]: We're hoping to build further down in K to eight schools, which is why I mentioned that one now.

359
00:32:55,022 --> 00:33:01,364
[SPEAKER_14]: We did expand our computer science offerings, both in the K to eight tech classrooms, as well as the high school.

360
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,625
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a new high school teacher this year for technology.

361
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:08,447
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're able to offer additional computer science classes, digital literacy, a student help desk.

362
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:12,609
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're building that program, the new website, welcoming library,

363
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,075
[SPEAKER_14]: as part of our library program.

364
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:19,156
[SPEAKER_14]: We did start after-school STEAM workshops at the middle schools.

365
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:21,256
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a high school relaxation station.

366
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:27,418
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a partnership with the Medford Public Library that allows students to access the public library services.

367
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:30,739
[SPEAKER_14]: We started STEAM workshops through a partnership with the

368
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:32,921
[SPEAKER_14]: public library with the middle schools.

369
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,542
[SPEAKER_14]: They were alternating between the two schools.

370
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:44,452
[SPEAKER_14]: We did increase the before school hours for the library at the middle schools, and both of those library paras are receiving a stipend to do that.

371
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:53,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And we started an enrollment, which became incredibly critical as we started this online learning, in the Student Data Privacy Alliance.

372
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:54,883
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a statewide initiative.

373
00:33:55,803 --> 00:34:02,908
[SPEAKER_14]: it actually makes sure that all the programs that we're using with our students, those vendors have agreed to student data privacy agreements.

374
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:12,193
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we were in the process of onboarding with that, and then now with everyone working on lots of things online, that's become really critical.

375
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:14,515
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll continue that process as the

376
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,875
[SPEAKER_14]: as the year goes on and we'll have an annual enrollment with them.

377
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:21,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are my general ones.

378
00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:25,840
[SPEAKER_14]: The general items in the budget, they're pretty standard each year.

379
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,044
[SPEAKER_14]: The kinds of technology we're using are pretty standard.

380
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:34,767
[SPEAKER_14]: The computers and the monitors, the laptops, we're doing a lot of support for those.

381
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:39,050
[SPEAKER_14]: iPads, we're phasing out in general except for specific needs.

382
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,391
[SPEAKER_14]: The Raptor security systems,

383
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:54,401
[SPEAKER_14]: digital cameras, projectors, all the basic operating, day-to-day operating licenses, software, Microsoft licenses, subscription support.

384
00:34:54,441 --> 00:35:05,549
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are pretty standard so that we are about the same from year to year with some changes of what we're supporting, but still the same level of support.

385
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:06,729
[SPEAKER_14]: We have

386
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,152
[SPEAKER_14]: One technology teacher in each of the K to 5 schools.

387
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:28,680
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one technology teacher in each of the middle schools and we have Several technology teachers at the high school some of who share their roles with tech support Media support with our media literacy class our web design class Allison also does the the website?

388
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:32,502
[SPEAKER_14]: We have and then one full-time computer teacher

389
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:37,707
[SPEAKER_14]: teacher who's doing the various courses, and so we align with the new standards.

390
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:40,229
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not so new anymore, they're 2016.

391
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:52,520
[SPEAKER_14]: The library staffing, so all our, the Medford elementary, middle school libraries are staffed and open five days a week, and that was a big push in the last few years to expand the staffing to be able to do that.

392
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:55,562
[SPEAKER_14]: The paraprofessionals are managing the

393
00:35:56,543 --> 00:35:59,924
[SPEAKER_14]: K-5 libraries and the certified librarians are traveling between.

394
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:05,745
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have one halftime elementary librarian who is traveling between the elementary schools.

395
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:11,226
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one middle school librarian certified who is traveling between the two middle schools.

396
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:16,106
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have one certified librarian and two paraprofessionals who are covering the high school.

397
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:24,248
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're sharing those resources, and we have a library para who keeps those libraries open and maintains the collections in each of those libraries.

398
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,583
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's our current staffing at the library.

399
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:38,374
[SPEAKER_14]: The plan going forward is to replace the remaining desktop computers in the technology teaching labs that we have not yet done.

400
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:44,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the Columbus, the Brooks, and one Medford High School web design tech lab.

401
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,361
[SPEAKER_14]: So replacing those

402
00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:59,241
[SPEAKER_14]: 2012 machines with with more current machines because they're getting really too old to do what we need them to do those school in the tech labs We have we've been putting in a lot of Chromebooks, which is a great thing the

403
00:37:01,063 --> 00:37:06,386
[SPEAKER_14]: but the oldest of our Chromebooks are beginning to age out in terms of support from Google.

404
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:11,548
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's an auto expiration of, of supporting those operating systems.

405
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:16,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And so each year we'll start that process of those becoming too old to update.

406
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:22,514
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll still be functional, but they're not functional in a way that we're going to allow them to be used for like MCAS testing.

407
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,695
[SPEAKER_14]: So those will have to start phasing out for,

408
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:28,576
[SPEAKER_14]: for certain use, even though they still may be operational.

409
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:34,057
[SPEAKER_14]: The first year that's gonna happen is in 2021, there'll be about 100 of them that will age out.

410
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:38,999
[SPEAKER_14]: In 2022, there'll be almost 600 that will age out.

411
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:48,581
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're gonna hopefully start doing that sooner rather than all at once as they begin to, the auto-update expiration will come due each of those years.

412
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,062
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking to support a maker space in each of our libraries.

413
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:58,534
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking to build technology course pathways at no cost, except perhaps for a stipend.

414
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:01,897
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking to bring the Girls Who Code clubs to each of our schools.

415
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:05,721
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll be either after school or lunchtime kinds of clubs.

416
00:38:06,282 --> 00:38:09,465
[SPEAKER_14]: And then going forward, we do need to look at replacing

417
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:13,429
[SPEAKER_14]: the 2012 machines that are left, the desktop machines that are left.

418
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's close to 1,200 of those.

419
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:24,019
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're looking at options to either start phasing those through, looking at lease options, looking at buy options, but they're big and they're expensive.

420
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,041
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a big ticket item.

421
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:40,892
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking at cybersecurity training for all staff and single sign-on exploration, which is something that's been on my radar, but it sure would have made a whole lot easier to transition now to doing distance learning if there was a single sign-on to all the programs that students need.

422
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,874
[SPEAKER_14]: But we are looking at exploring that for next year.

423
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:51,239
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the budget allocations, the additional salaries, which are not in the salary line item, but we're looking to have

424
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:08,856
[SPEAKER_14]: No, sorry, the additional salaries that's listed there are it includes things like the summer work for our tech support Additional technology maintenance for after-school things that we try and do not during the school day So that that goes to the additional salaries the contracted services item.

425
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:14,582
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty much similar every year the helpdesk reporting system our library software our

426
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Our online coursework, Play-Doh.

427
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:23,329
[SPEAKER_14]: The Student Data Privacy Alliance is a membership each year, a variety of those kinds of things.

428
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:25,751
[SPEAKER_14]: The equipment maintenance is pretty self-explanatory.

429
00:39:26,412 --> 00:39:33,598
[SPEAKER_14]: The instructional supplies, keeping anything running requires screen repairs, microphones, DVD drives, lighting, tools, mice.

430
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:35,800
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just an annual expense.

431
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:43,046
[SPEAKER_14]: The replacement equipment is really just trying to replace what gets broken until we can replace it

432
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:47,926
[SPEAKER_14]: in a larger scale kinds of things, like we've been able to do at least a little bit in the last year.

433
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:53,670
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did replace, we started, I listed those replacement items we've already done.

434
00:39:54,810 --> 00:40:05,298
[SPEAKER_14]: We're increasing, the only increase of those items that's in that budget now is the $3,000 for the textbook account, and that's to cover increasing the collection's diverse titles as well as

435
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:08,199
[SPEAKER_14]: the changing social studies and civics curriculum.

436
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,479
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just need a little bit more money to build that collection a little bit.

437
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,121
[SPEAKER_14]: The book fairs still contribute a lot of money to our additions in the libraries, especially the elementary school.

438
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:25,803
[SPEAKER_14]: The staffing, again, that's not in there, but we could really use to increase our elementary librarian staffing.

439
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,264
[SPEAKER_14]: We're halftime among the elementary schools.

440
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:32,785
[SPEAKER_14]: For a certified librarian, it'd be good to at least have that person be one full time.

441
00:40:33,845 --> 00:40:44,330
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd like to increase the paraprofessional hours in each of those libraries so that it's not just, so if it went from 26 and a half to 30 hours, that could cover a little bit of time.

442
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:53,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrews and McGlynn, we'd like to take out that stipend and actually increase their hours so that they could be scheduled to do before school and a little bit of after school time for study hall.

443
00:40:54,134 --> 00:41:00,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, both middle schools are covering the stipend for having them work before school so we can have a before school opening.

444
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:05,680
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the meantime, the library paraprofessionals are continuing to manage the collections at the library.

445
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:09,403
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where we are in the library media technology world.

446
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

447
00:41:13,706 --> 00:41:14,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions?

448
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:17,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question.

449
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Member van de Kloot.

450
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:27,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Given the, can you tell us, Molly, what was the number of Chromebooks given out to students so far?

451
00:41:27,616 --> 00:41:29,437
[SPEAKER_14]: During this closure?

452
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:30,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

453
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:31,748
[SPEAKER_14]: about 650.

454
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:51,044
[SPEAKER_12]: So given that that many has come out and will take a certain amount of use and abuse, is there, and also just understanding, even with that amount given out, there might really be more need.

455
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:51,724
[SPEAKER_12]: So

456
00:41:56,084 --> 00:42:03,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we really okay with the numbers that we've got right now, or is it just very conservative?

457
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:10,521
[SPEAKER_14]: So going forward for Chromebook?

458
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:16,004
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know the answer to that because I don't know what happens with these coming back.

459
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:26,828
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were working on getting closer to closer to having an average of at least a two student per device ratio in the district.

460
00:42:26,928 --> 00:42:28,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was really beginning to work well.

461
00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:36,815
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually decreasing the need for some of the open lab spaces, because there was so much more Chromebook use in the classroom.

462
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:42,639
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was working in that direction, except for specialized software, which needs to be on desktop machines.

463
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:49,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were getting closer, and each of the schools were using some of their budgets to buy Chromebooks if they could, and the PTOs, some were still buying.

464
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:55,009
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were really getting close, and we put so many in from our free cash allotment this year.

465
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:56,790
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was a really good move.

466
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:16,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the answer to that because if we start to decline in terms of the number that comes back and then the aging of the first rounds coming through, we do still need to, I think, replace each year so that those aging out ones, which we really are going to take out of circulation for things like MCAS,

467
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,609
[SPEAKER_14]: because we just don't know about there being able to be used for that.

468
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,110
[SPEAKER_14]: It may become a problem going forward.

469
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer is, we're getting close, but I don't know in the next year.

470
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,333
[SPEAKER_12]: What does one cost?

471
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,074
[SPEAKER_14]: About $200 a piece.

472
00:43:32,094 --> 00:43:32,074
$200.

473
00:43:32,294 --> 00:43:33,854
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you very much.

474
00:43:33,874 --> 00:43:36,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member van de Kloot.

475
00:43:38,636 --> 00:43:39,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a question, too.

476
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:39,797
[SPEAKER_10]: May I?

477
00:43:39,857 --> 00:43:40,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Lungo-Koehn?

478
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:41,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

479
00:43:41,777 --> 00:43:42,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz.

480
00:43:43,118 --> 00:43:43,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

481
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:46,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the report Molly really appreciate it.

482
00:43:47,203 --> 00:44:04,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I had a question, follow up to Paulette's question, I wanted to know, were there any students that wanted a Chromebook, and they still are, you know, we're still trying to reach out to those families or do we know that information yet I'm just wondering if anybody knows that.

483
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:10,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've had some response since the last distribution last week.

484
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:16,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been contacted by some teachers who've heard of Families Who Need Them.

485
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:20,268
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have had some that have had problems with the Chromebooks that they've received.

486
00:44:21,388 --> 00:44:28,271
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard because we're not there to troubleshoot any of those, but whether it's actually a problem or it's something that we can fix easily.

487
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:30,793
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are still numbers.

488
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:37,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not quite sure if they missed the notification about the two, or to be honest, do they need to have them?

489
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:40,077
[SPEAKER_14]: brought to them, we really don't know.

490
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:50,160
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are definitely still some students who have been coming, definitely fewer since the last distribution, but we did a lot more in the last one than I thought after the first one.

491
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure that we're done.

492
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:58,903
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're able to come into the building and do it again, I'm guessing a third round would not be a bad thing to do.

493
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:01,484
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do at this point have the devices to do that.

494
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:03,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

495
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:05,931
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had one more question.

496
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:11,858
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted, you know, I know it's detailed in the report, but I thought it was interesting.

497
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:19,128
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could describe the difference between the certified school librarian and the librarian paraprofessional.

498
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:23,426
[SPEAKER_14]: So the certified librarian is trained as a librarian.

499
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:25,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they are able, they're actually teachers.

500
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:39,495
[SPEAKER_14]: So they are trained to do the kinds of, not just the administrative of checking out books or putting them on a shelf, but actually to classify those books and to assist teachers in selecting materials for their curriculum.

501
00:45:39,675 --> 00:45:43,958
[SPEAKER_14]: And library paraprofessionals, although some actually happen to be teachers,

502
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:51,082
[SPEAKER_14]: as a matter of the job description, they're not at all required to be teachers and don't have that training.

503
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:54,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

504
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:55,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

505
00:45:57,126 --> 00:45:57,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

506
00:45:58,827 --> 00:45:59,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor?

507
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:01,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Member Graham.

508
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:02,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Molly.

509
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:10,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you tell me, the screen that we're looking at now, which one of those line items is the replacement budget?

510
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:17,830
[SPEAKER_14]: So the replacement, the $175 is not the added replacement.

511
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:24,257
[SPEAKER_14]: That is replacing what's right in the dollars for the three labs that we haven't yet done.

512
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:27,501
[SPEAKER_14]: But then anything else, if you look at the wish list,

513
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:42,909
[SPEAKER_14]: The estimated cost, if we were to do a large-scale replacement of 2012 machines, it's either essentially close to $1.4 million in a one-time switchover, or it's an annual lease.

514
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:46,431
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was looking at some of the lease costs, and that would still be close to $400,000 a year.

515
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:52,496
[SPEAKER_14]: to do that, and that would be a lease to own, just because that's what they do.

516
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:59,760
[SPEAKER_15]: So the $175 would equal the labs at Columbus Brooks and Medford High for $75.

517
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:00,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

518
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:03,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, what is the other $100?

519
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:08,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus replacing any of the older devices that break that have to be replaced.

520
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:15,371
[SPEAKER_14]: So any desktop that needs to be replaced, projectors that need to be replaced, printers that need to be replaced, broken desktops.

521
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:22,374
[SPEAKER_14]: The Chromebooks that are now six years old that are starting to need to be replaced.

522
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:26,797
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's all the normal maintenance plus all the hardware that needs to be replaced.

523
00:47:27,657 --> 00:47:32,520
[SPEAKER_15]: But it doesn't include the 136 on the second line of the plans.

524
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that right?

525
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:43,086
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you see right, it says NPS technology refresh plan up under plans.

526
00:47:44,713 --> 00:47:46,114
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that number says 136.

527
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:49,417
[SPEAKER_15]: So this, that hundred is not the same as this 136.

528
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:50,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

529
00:47:52,099 --> 00:48:01,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and then when you talk about, uh, things like, uh, maker spaces and building learning capacity, um,

530
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,311
[SPEAKER_15]: cybersecurity training.

531
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,093
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no cost associated with any of those things on your plan.

532
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:11,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of those we don't have.

533
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:12,555
[SPEAKER_14]: They're really just a plan.

534
00:48:12,595 --> 00:48:18,719
[SPEAKER_14]: So the cybersecurity, for example, we had a few quotes of doing some of that cybersecurity training, but we did not move forward with that yet.

535
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:22,581
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was between $8,000 and $10,000, but we didn't put it in there yet.

536
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,023
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some things that we actually can do even free.

537
00:48:25,863 --> 00:48:33,807
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just didn't decide on what that plan was for that, but it is something that we know we need to do for all of our staff who are on computers.

538
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:36,148
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to have some cybersecurity training.

539
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:38,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Same thing with the single sign-on.

540
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:45,033
[SPEAKER_14]: There could be no cost if we use a program, say, like Clever, but it's still something that's a plan from the technology department side.

541
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:47,314
[SPEAKER_14]: The Girls Who Code is a free curriculum.

542
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:51,235
[SPEAKER_14]: So there doesn't necessarily need to be a cost if we can get volunteers to do it.

543
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,736
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of those things do not have a cost the maker space.

544
00:48:55,096 --> 00:48:58,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually hoping to seek some funding for like we did Verizon for the high school.

545
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:00,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

546
00:49:01,718 --> 00:49:07,160
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, as I, as we scroll down your plan.

547
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,721
[SPEAKER_15]: There's this, there's this mention of, I guess it's in the

548
00:49:12,412 --> 00:49:19,474
[SPEAKER_15]: down to the wish list about the 1,200 machines, the 2012 desktops, the 1,200 machines.

549
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:22,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Are these numbers in the budget somewhere?

550
00:49:22,795 --> 00:49:22,835
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

551
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:26,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

552
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:31,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Can the machines even be used anymore?

553
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:42,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, the hardest use machines are the technology teaching labs, and those are the ones we're replacing first.

554
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:51,028
[SPEAKER_14]: So the other machines, and so the Chromebooks have taken some of that strain off of trying to quickly update those machines.

555
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:51,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Can they be used?

556
00:49:52,229 --> 00:49:53,289
[SPEAKER_14]: They are being used.

557
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:55,790
[SPEAKER_14]: They are not updated to Windows 10 yet.

558
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:00,931
[SPEAKER_14]: The plan is to try and do that if we can.

559
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:08,273
[SPEAKER_14]: It's certainly going to stretch the ability of these machines, but for sort of going forward, we do need to look at doing that.

560
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:09,414
[SPEAKER_14]: We've done it with some.

561
00:50:10,694 --> 00:50:13,295
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're hoping to do that with all.

562
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:20,776
[SPEAKER_14]: cause a fair amount of them to not be able to be used because it's a pretty heavy load on those old machines.

563
00:50:21,136 --> 00:50:31,398
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of that replacement money that is in that line item for 175 will have to be used for some of those machines or some of the machines that we're taking out of the old labs that we're replacing with newer machines.

564
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:33,478
[SPEAKER_14]: So to answer that, yes.

565
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:34,639
[SPEAKER_14]: For how much longer?

566
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:35,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

567
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:37,219
[SPEAKER_14]: They're getting really old.

568
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:41,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we just need to think about what we want to do for that.

569
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,501
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a big ticket item.

570
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:56,065
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not in the budget, but it is something that It is not going away and only going to become a continued issue because it's a lot of it's essentially every teacher machine it's most uh every

571
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:03,631
[SPEAKER_14]: pretty much every library machine and it's every open lab machine in all of our schools.

572
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:04,871
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a lot.

573
00:51:05,072 --> 00:51:12,733
[SPEAKER_14]: So whether we do them gradually or we do them all at once, or we do it as a lease or we do it as a buy, it's a very large item, but they're getting old.

574
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:15,114
[SPEAKER_14]: And so at some point they won't be able to keep running.

575
00:51:15,514 --> 00:51:17,774
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that they power one won't make them useful.

576
00:51:18,294 --> 00:51:22,295
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're sort of making them work, but I don't know how much longer.

577
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:41,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and then when you talk about increased library staff, is there like an average amount of salary that a licensed librarian or credentialed librarian we would expect to pay?

578
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:46,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would fall under the teacher's salary schedule.

579
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:55,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if you're getting a seasoned staff person coming in, you're looking at a $60,000 range.

580
00:51:56,335 --> 00:52:06,140
[SPEAKER_02]: The paraprofessionals, in order to adjust any hours, that would need to be negotiated because they are part of the collective bargaining agreement for paras.

581
00:52:06,705 --> 00:52:22,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the requests in the intent of doing additional expanding of library hours certainly has collective bargaining implications and is not something that can just easily be provided in a budget scenario.

582
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:23,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's other factors.

583
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,391
[SPEAKER_14]: The library paraprofessional staff are actually not in the union.

584
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:30,392
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not in the paraprofessionals union.

585
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:31,072
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

586
00:52:31,683 --> 00:52:35,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were referring to the non-unit, not the actual paraprofessionals.

587
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Our paraprofessionals are not in the union.

588
00:52:42,286 --> 00:53:02,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Just additionally, since you were referring to the large scale purchase, because we really can't identify a $1.2 million item within the budget, that is something that we would be looking or recommending for a capital project and or a bonding.

589
00:53:03,405 --> 00:53:16,529
[SPEAKER_02]: to be done separately outside of the budget, that it's just not something that we can actually absorb in a given year, but that can be explored in another fashion.

590
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:28,733
[SPEAKER_15]: And Kirsten, in your opinion, if we were to have a line item that dealt with routine maintenance so that we don't find ourselves in a position where we're having to

591
00:53:29,725 --> 00:53:37,492
[SPEAKER_15]: bond and spend millions of dollars in one shot, like what would that number be from your perspective that would keep us maintained?

592
00:53:38,053 --> 00:53:50,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and I think this is, you know, something that Molly would also weigh in on, but you know, in the terms of the line item for the $175,000, that's what we've been trying to gradually increase

593
00:53:51,508 --> 00:54:02,154
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had a starting platform of new devices in one given year, then it would be much easier to determine what a replacement value would be.

594
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:07,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, $225,000, would that be a 20% replacement?

595
00:54:07,718 --> 00:54:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't quantify that because we have so many devices that are

596
00:54:14,022 --> 00:54:20,690
[SPEAKER_02]: being reused and repurposed right now and we're not at a full startup platform.

597
00:54:21,111 --> 00:54:30,603
[SPEAKER_02]: But the intent and what we have done gradually over the last three years, as you can see, has infused a little bit in this particular

598
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:36,467
[SPEAKER_02]: maintenance repair line item, if you will, replenishment.

599
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:47,494
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was the idea, to get gradually to a sustainable number that could just be funded and take care of all of those units as they came up for renewal.

600
00:54:47,514 --> 00:54:49,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thanks.

601
00:54:50,733 --> 00:55:05,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the hope is that if the devices were newer, that that replacement line could go down and we wouldn't have to have the same kind of infusion of repairs and the cost that goes with that and supplies to keep those machines moving.

602
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:11,913
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would take out some of that money if we were actually in a better shape with the technology that was coming in.

603
00:55:13,975 --> 00:55:14,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

604
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:15,196
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, we have 30 more minutes.

605
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody have any more questions?

606
00:55:19,996 --> 00:55:20,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

607
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:28,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'm a little, so the wishlist was supposed to be things nobody thinks they're going to get.

608
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,949
[SPEAKER_08]: everything above the wish list I thought was going to be in the budget.

609
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:43,257
[SPEAKER_08]: So am I going to have to sit down, pick the budget, then go in and create my own budget, including the things that were asked for, not including the wish list, to know what the budget's request is?

610
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:45,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I thought we weren't working from some number.

611
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,361
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know why.

612
00:55:50,602 --> 00:56:09,468
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, why the two FTEs for PE are not in that budget, and why is it that a bunch of this stuff that's on this media and library stuff, it's not in the wish list category.

613
00:56:09,788 --> 00:56:11,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it not already baked into the budget?

614
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:20,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't know how much work I'm supposed to do when I get the documents to then create what the real documents are supposed to be.

615
00:56:21,483 --> 00:56:29,787
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Paul, what you're looking at is the real document in terms of the request from the department heads, with the exception of staffing.

616
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:37,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was important that you see the staffing levels as they are before you begin to add to them, regardless of a request.

617
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:41,593
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes perfect sense.

618
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:45,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But then where and when will we sit down and actually do that add?

619
00:56:47,596 --> 00:56:49,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see that in the schedule of meetings.

620
00:56:50,188 --> 00:57:03,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will be in in the totality of the budget once it's completed, and you see where we are and what the reality is to the city's ability to fund and the revenue sources coming in.

621
00:57:04,352 --> 00:57:08,553
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point in time, we will have the realization of where

622
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,285
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the total bottom line budget needs to be.

623
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:16,407
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not what the city council has been clear on.

624
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:19,390
[SPEAKER_08]: They want us to send them a budget for what we need.

625
00:57:19,971 --> 00:57:21,572
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a librarian at every school.

626
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:25,776
[SPEAKER_08]: The June 1st budget is not going to include that.

627
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:35,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that we have never gone in that mode.

628
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:39,937
[SPEAKER_02]: of preparing an inflated budget with wish list items.

629
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not talking about the wish list items.

630
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:45,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm talking about the stuff above the wish list line.

631
00:57:47,082 --> 00:57:56,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in terms of each department and, you know, Superintendent can can also add add to this conversation is that

632
00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:06,477
[SPEAKER_02]: There are things that are contingent upon collective bargaining agreements, contingent on the realities of the budget itself.

633
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:21,107
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of where we are going to be at the end of this process, I think it's going to be valuable that you see where we are without any of those additional staffing, and they are requests at this point.

634
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:34,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think the media lab one is a little more complicated, and I know we have to keep moving, but the two FTEs for the PE Health Department, those are not nice to have, those are not wish lists.

635
00:58:34,665 --> 00:58:35,905
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be on this budget.

636
00:58:36,265 --> 00:58:43,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at the end of the day, if the budget is too big and city council says no, then we go back to the drawing board and figure out what to cut.

637
00:58:43,768 --> 00:58:48,790
[SPEAKER_08]: But as it is now, as I see how we're gonna do this, we're gonna send them a budget that is the,

638
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:56,155
[SPEAKER_08]: small percentage increase that will include nothing that the departments are asking for.

639
00:58:57,536 --> 00:59:03,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just going to be, I mean, ignoring the current crisis, which is how we're sort of operating at this moment in time.

640
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:16,511
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, just year over year, there's no reason to think that five years from now, we will ever have somebody in the health education who can help our students with disabilities.

641
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:18,753
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be nobody in there five years from now

642
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,192
[SPEAKER_08]: who will actually teach our middle schoolers what sex is.

643
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:25,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is the repeated process.

644
00:59:26,017 --> 00:59:30,321
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my third budget where we don't ever add any of these people in.

645
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:37,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And city council is supposed to be the folks that we send the budget we want, not the budget we think they'll accept.

646
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:48,337
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, just point of information, this budget is higher than I think can actually be presented as it is.

647
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:57,885
[SPEAKER_05]: This is working off a 5% increase where I think the city advised recently we should only be working off of a 3% increase from last year.

648
00:59:57,965 --> 01:00:04,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe if the city council is looking for what additional, on top of the 5% increase, what additional

649
01:00:05,158 --> 01:00:07,138
[SPEAKER_05]: things the school committee is looking for.

650
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it should be on a side memo or.

651
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,800
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just want to clarify something.

652
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,582
[SPEAKER_08]: We had in our meeting about how we're going to run the budgets, but there was no target.

653
01:00:20,922 --> 01:00:25,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody in the room went around and said, there is no target.

654
01:00:25,263 --> 01:00:26,743
[SPEAKER_08]: We're building this from scratch.

655
01:00:27,763 --> 01:00:33,105
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're talking like there was a target, which I think half of us honestly believe there was always a target.

656
01:00:33,185 --> 01:00:34,525
[SPEAKER_08]: We were never going to say it out loud.

657
01:00:35,138 --> 01:00:40,242
[SPEAKER_08]: So there can't be a target of 5% if there's not a target.

658
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:50,351
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we had this conversation at length and I was personally told that there is no such thing as a number that we work to.

659
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:53,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of looks like, I don't know what I'm talking about.

660
01:00:53,374 --> 01:00:58,598
[SPEAKER_15]: And yet here we are, we're talking about a number that we're working toward and we don't even know what that number is.

661
01:00:58,778 --> 01:01:01,601
[SPEAKER_15]: No one has ever told us there's a 5% number we're working toward.

662
01:01:02,652 --> 01:01:09,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we start a queue there so that we're raising hands and starting a queue?

663
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Dr. Vincent and Member McLaughlin.

664
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:14,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

665
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:21,387
[SPEAKER_09]: So the June 1st meeting, that would be reserved for us to do our final review and revisions.

666
01:01:21,767 --> 01:01:28,529
[SPEAKER_09]: The process that we're going through right now is looking at where we are with the additional pieces.

667
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:42,512
[SPEAKER_09]: So in addition to health, in addition to what's been said for technology, in addition to what we talked about for literacy and additional coaches, at the end of this process, even though we don't have a set number,

668
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:51,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it ends up being 4.75% or 5% that the City Council ends up approving, we do have a number.

669
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:53,302
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a solid number.

670
01:01:53,683 --> 01:01:59,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a little bit of wiggle room, but it's within a reasonable wiggle room for this year.

671
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:04,614
[SPEAKER_09]: In light of what we're going through right now, everyone is very aware that

672
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:10,227
[SPEAKER_09]: The entire nation is in a state of crisis.

673
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:13,008
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to really be realistic.

674
01:02:13,088 --> 01:02:16,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, for example, we wanted to get the adaptive PE added.

675
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:30,135
[SPEAKER_09]: We weren't able to do it last year, and so I definitely was committed to prioritizing adding the additional adaptive PE program for this year because it's something that we deferred a year ago.

676
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:43,185
[SPEAKER_09]: However, all of those suggested positions, there's no way we can add an additional 50 FTEs by the time we're finished with the entire process.

677
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:48,530
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't have an exact number, but we have some type of a ballpark.

678
01:02:49,991 --> 01:02:56,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, even though I represent the schools, you have to understand that we're part of a larger city.

679
01:02:56,179 --> 01:03:03,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And the same way we're making our requests, the fire department will, the police department will as well.

680
01:03:03,027 --> 01:03:06,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, we just need to, uh,

681
01:03:07,852 --> 01:03:28,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I think be a little more flexible this year and understand that although we don't have a hard number we have to have a reasonable number and when we do have all of those positions by the June 1st meeting we will be able to say okay let's prioritize which ones can we realistically do and we're going to say yes

682
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:39,250
[SPEAKER_09]: to some requested positions, and for others, they're going to have to be deferred another year or longer, depending on what we can manage.

683
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:43,172
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we need to go through this process.

684
01:03:43,872 --> 01:03:45,493
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 20 minutes left.

685
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:49,996
[SPEAKER_09]: We still need to hear from health services and from athletics.

686
01:03:50,796 --> 01:04:06,798
[SPEAKER_09]: About what's going on and um how they are being impacted as well And i'm hoping um that I know there may be one or two other questions that we're at least able to um, let those two departments present because we do have um

687
01:04:08,738 --> 01:04:16,966
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a serious situation, but we need to let them at least present what it is they're doing, what's realistic, what their wishlist is.

688
01:04:17,507 --> 01:04:23,593
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in the end on June 1st, that will be our true marathon session.

689
01:04:23,613 --> 01:04:27,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe when we get closer to June 1st, we may want to modify the time.

690
01:04:28,538 --> 01:04:41,027
[SPEAKER_09]: and leave a larger block of time for us to be able to really talk about what needs to stay and what needs to be added and what needs to be let go until a future point in time.

691
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:42,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

692
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:55,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to add sort of to Jenny, to member Graham and member Rousseau's point, I feel like we're creating or we're talking about two simultaneous budgets.

693
01:04:55,808 --> 01:05:09,014
[SPEAKER_03]: We want an actual budget of what a school district, you know, would, especially as a new member, what the school district would be run at if we had many of the items that have been asked for for some time and have, you know, ask for city council.

694
01:05:09,054 --> 01:05:10,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm hearing is that,

695
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:12,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, again, I'm new to the process.

696
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:38,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So one, I think it'd be really great to have a process memo where we're understanding, okay, this June 1st date, sort of what the expectations are, what we're, you know, the goals are for getting where we're going and that there's this, or is not this number that we sort of back this budget into and, or this initiative to create what I would call an actual, you know, so this is an actual budget, I guess, of what's actually being spent and what we think a 4% increase will get us.

697
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:39,896
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, this,

698
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:51,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's an additional budget or what, but I think backing it up a little bit, I feel like we need a process now that's really explaining to us what this process is, number one.

699
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And number two, I think that there is an actual versus differential budget.

700
01:05:54,031 --> 01:06:00,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think, you know, I think that we need to have a process now that's really explaining to us what this process is, number one.

701
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:04,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And number two, I think that there is an actual versus differential budget.

702
01:06:05,392 --> 01:06:14,879
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a line item that's what we're actually spending, what we'd propose or like to spend, like Christine has here, a surplus, a deficit.

703
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:21,585
[SPEAKER_03]: But the proposals, I don't think we can put in a couple of things on this line item and not on that line item, and a few here and not there.

704
01:06:21,765 --> 01:06:25,948
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to be all or none and figure it out moving forward.

705
01:06:25,968 --> 01:06:27,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that's part of the policy or process memo.

706
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:28,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

707
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So just putting my two cents in there.

708
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:32,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

709
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:38,561
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no other questions for library media, we can move on to health services.

710
01:06:38,581 --> 01:06:41,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a hard stop time.

711
01:06:42,323 --> 01:06:49,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Zoom might cut us off right at 5.30, so we can go into the regular meeting, but let's see if we can get through the health services.

712
01:06:50,786 --> 01:06:57,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, again, just to reiterate, the only area that is not being included is additional staff at this point.

713
01:06:58,234 --> 01:07:04,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I've included the addition the current staff as as it is identifying the steps and lane changes.

714
01:07:05,919 --> 01:07:09,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the Health Service Department, we have 1,167,804 going into fiscal year 2021.

715
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:10,001
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a slight increase

716
01:07:19,715 --> 01:07:21,576
[SPEAKER_02]: in each of her line items.

717
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:25,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she also has a decrease for one of the categories.

718
01:07:26,697 --> 01:07:30,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can just review based on Ms.

719
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:34,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray's narrative document that she has provided.

720
01:07:34,899 --> 01:07:40,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will flip to her narrative as well so that we can go through each of her requests.

721
01:07:43,022 --> 01:07:43,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.

722
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:46,723
[SPEAKER_11]: So some of the

723
01:07:47,810 --> 01:08:09,758
[SPEAKER_11]: The request for the upcoming year, we did have, I am looking for an increase in the summer school nursing stipends because we are providing more summer school hours and coverage over with each increasing year.

724
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:15,280
[SPEAKER_11]: As well as in the nursing contract, the nurses do have,

725
01:08:16,947 --> 01:08:27,891
[SPEAKER_11]: stipends available if they want to go in during the summer and prepare their offices and update care plans and get everything ready for the onset of school.

726
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:40,275
[SPEAKER_11]: The other increase was in medical supplies, and we have a number of medical supplies, specifically the

727
01:08:40,943 --> 01:08:44,845
[SPEAKER_11]: We're called in boo bags that are used in emergency.

728
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:52,009
[SPEAKER_11]: They are all the silicone is degrading and we need to be replacing those this year.

729
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:56,752
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's an additional $3,000 in the medical supplies line.

730
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:06,717
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as wish list items, going to the narrative, you can read how the school nurse

731
01:09:07,368 --> 01:09:19,414
[SPEAKER_11]: role has really increased in complexity over the years, and we have a lot, we've assumed a lot of unfunded state mandates into our role.

732
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:21,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope everybody can hear me.

733
01:09:23,396 --> 01:09:32,300
[SPEAKER_11]: We, in order to keep students healthy, ready to learn, and able to access their curriculum, I am requesting an increase in nursing positions.

734
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:36,062
[SPEAKER_11]: My priority is that the

735
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Curtis Tufts High School, as well as the Andrews Middle School.

736
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,342
[SPEAKER_11]: The Curtis Tufts has a nurse assigned two days a week.

737
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:50,487
[SPEAKER_11]: In the interim, on the off days, nurses are pulled from buildings, including myself, if there is student need.

738
01:09:51,507 --> 01:10:00,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the past three years, we have found an increasing student request to see a nurse, and we have been sending more nurses on the off days

739
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:18,456
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a need for a lot of health education individually and as groups related to substance use prevention and vaping education, as well as helping these students transition to some understanding of what is health insurance.

740
01:10:19,196 --> 01:10:23,638
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you work within a healthcare environment for yourself?

741
01:10:23,878 --> 01:10:29,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot of help that the nurses provide at that building.

742
01:10:31,345 --> 01:10:42,271
[SPEAKER_11]: The second request for a position at the Andrews Middle School, the Andrews Middle School is the only one in the district that's staffed by one nurse.

743
01:10:43,032 --> 01:10:56,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And her role has increased over the past years in terms of the amount of student visits that she has, the amount of parent support that she provides, health education that she provides.

744
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:00,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And for equity amongst the schools in the other district,

745
01:11:01,615 --> 01:11:03,515
[SPEAKER_11]: position for the Andrews Middle School.

746
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:09,477
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody has any questions, I'd be willing to try to answer them.

747
01:11:10,197 --> 01:11:10,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

748
01:11:10,857 --> 01:11:11,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Ray.

749
01:11:11,337 --> 01:11:12,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions for Ms.

750
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:13,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Ray?

751
01:11:14,598 --> 01:11:17,658
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, we can go directly to athletics.

752
01:11:17,718 --> 01:11:18,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Member McLaughlin.

753
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:20,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

754
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Tony, for the report.

755
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:23,699
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

756
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:26,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we've been doing the Universal Safety Committee for the past.

757
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:39,076
[SPEAKER_03]: two years, and one of the questions that we've had ongoing is about safety equipment, especially for evacuation for students with physical disabilities and other needs.

758
01:11:39,216 --> 01:11:44,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any needs in that area that you're looking at at this point, or is that something specifically you're looking at grants for?

759
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,842
[SPEAKER_11]: We probably use grant funding for that.

760
01:11:48,862 --> 01:11:55,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have, you know, I have the comprehensive school health services grant,

761
01:11:55,577 --> 01:12:06,466
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully, monies in that can be used for some technology purchases, possibly for some safety equipment.

762
01:12:06,786 --> 01:12:11,210
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also a venture between myself and the special ed department.

763
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:14,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So we work collaboratively.

764
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:17,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the past, we have shared some of those costs.

765
01:12:18,196 --> 01:12:23,080
[SPEAKER_11]: But they are very student-specific purchases to make sure that we have

766
01:12:23,638 --> 01:12:25,659
[SPEAKER_11]: on what we need for the students in the buildings.

767
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:33,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So has there been an inventory or such of that or an understanding of the need or no at this point?

768
01:12:34,284 --> 01:12:34,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

769
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:47,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So every school has a safety evacuation sled that is, it's a universal sled that can be used for any student in the building.

770
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:52,575
[SPEAKER_11]: For our students that are wheelchair dependent, we do have

771
01:12:53,772 --> 01:12:55,513
[SPEAKER_11]: safety evacuation chairs.

772
01:12:55,533 --> 01:13:10,156
[SPEAKER_11]: In the last year, we purchased a new model that is really, it's like the gold standard.

773
01:13:10,396 --> 01:13:19,458
[SPEAKER_11]: So over time, I would like to replace the others that we have with the better model.

774
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,299
[SPEAKER_11]: It provides much easier use,

775
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:28,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I think the restraint system that it has is make students more comfortable as well.

776
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:30,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

777
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:30,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

778
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,722
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

779
01:13:35,902 --> 01:13:36,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

780
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:39,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, next we have athletics.

781
01:13:40,144 --> 01:13:41,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, can, can I ask a question real quick?

782
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:41,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

783
01:13:42,225 --> 01:13:42,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

784
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:51,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, for the two nursing positions that you're looking for, Tony, what is the sort of, uh,

785
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:55,690
[SPEAKER_15]: starting point for salary for a position like that?

786
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,912
[SPEAKER_11]: The same as with the teachers.

787
01:13:58,952 --> 01:13:59,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

788
01:14:00,013 --> 01:14:20,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I can't take in a nurse without any experience, you know, compared to a new teacher can come in college, a new nurse into the schools cannot, they need to have a body of experience and maturity

789
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:24,622
[SPEAKER_11]: that lends them to work in an autonomous situation.

790
01:14:25,102 --> 01:14:26,743
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we don't have doctors here.

791
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:35,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they have to have that sense of professionalism and experience to allow them to work optimally.

792
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:37,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

793
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:38,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

794
01:14:39,506 --> 01:14:39,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

795
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:40,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

796
01:14:41,927 --> 01:14:42,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And on to athletics.

797
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:45,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

798
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:46,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody.

799
01:14:46,488 --> 01:14:47,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Bobby.

800
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:54,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to briefly review and recap for the athletic salaries.

801
01:14:54,902 --> 01:15:00,104
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one that is funded from the budget itself, and that is the athletic trainer.

802
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:08,227
[SPEAKER_02]: The other main salaries, which include Mr. Maloney's and his secretary, come from the community schools.

803
01:15:09,453 --> 01:15:15,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, so that's another piece that we look at the gap fill at the end of the year.

804
01:15:15,997 --> 01:15:21,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the athletic department, the salary is just for the new athletic trainer.

805
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:26,944
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be her second year in fiscal 2021, which is why you see a reduction.

806
01:15:28,836 --> 01:15:43,522
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have a few variations that we were able to reduce some line items and I will let Mr. Maloney jump in and I can share the narrative as we go along.

807
01:15:46,323 --> 01:15:46,963
[SPEAKER_07]: We're pretty good.

808
01:15:47,683 --> 01:15:48,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be good.

809
01:15:48,504 --> 01:15:52,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if we do have the spring season, we will have no problems.

810
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, the school committee was kind enough to implement

811
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,621
[SPEAKER_07]: middle school sports, it's went off very well.

812
01:16:01,482 --> 01:16:04,644
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a projection of 75,000, which that's not needed.

813
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:08,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll be fine with these numbers next year.

814
01:16:08,226 --> 01:16:12,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for all your support and getting me in before 530.

815
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:15,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?

816
01:16:19,593 --> 01:16:21,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only see member Graham on the screen.

817
01:16:21,774 --> 01:16:22,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So okay.

818
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:24,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, member Graham.

819
01:16:26,032 --> 01:16:26,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

820
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:27,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Bobby.

821
01:16:27,192 --> 01:16:28,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

822
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:33,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in integrated or inclusive sports.

823
01:16:34,476 --> 01:16:41,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that a number of our cities surrounding us have that option.

824
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:45,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, my screen just changed with the change in the sharing.

825
01:16:46,581 --> 01:16:47,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you guys still hear me?

826
01:16:48,462 --> 01:16:48,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

827
01:16:49,629 --> 01:16:53,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know a number of the surrounding communities have that option.

828
01:16:53,472 --> 01:17:16,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering if that's been a consideration for, I know that you guys have worked hard with training in a number of areas, but I'm wondering if it's a consideration for any of the sports that we're doing and especially like the middle school sports, making sure that students with disabilities and some of whom have extensive needs that we're finding ways to integrate them into our sports community.

829
01:17:18,323 --> 01:17:21,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Rachel and I have had extensive conversations.

830
01:17:22,468 --> 01:17:25,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the support on the adaptive PE position.

831
01:17:25,972 --> 01:17:34,141
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hoping once we get that position online that the three of us will sit down and make this happen.

832
01:17:35,988 --> 01:17:50,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so for the after school, any of the other athletics for the students to be able to participate, like the middle school program, those other things, are we having to turn away individuals with disabilities at all that want to participate as far as you know, or are there any?

833
01:17:50,713 --> 01:17:51,733
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not to my knowledge.

834
01:17:51,773 --> 01:17:58,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Both principals have been very well, have done a great job about the inclusivity and everything.

835
01:17:58,155 --> 01:18:02,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick Tucci and Mike Diles have not said a word to us, neither have the coaches.

836
01:18:03,717 --> 01:18:04,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

837
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:10,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of them?

838
01:18:10,455 --> 01:18:12,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

839
01:18:12,657 --> 01:18:30,636
[SPEAKER_15]: In our first budget meeting where we talked about the budget process and the notion that we weren't building to a number, we also had a motion on the table to schedule budget hearings for community schools specifically, as well as the before and after school and food service.

840
01:18:30,676 --> 01:18:32,558
[SPEAKER_15]: So those big revolving accounts.

841
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,375
[SPEAKER_15]: And to my knowledge, those haven't been scheduled yet.

842
01:18:36,616 --> 01:18:39,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a plan to get those on the calendar sooner rather than later?

843
01:18:40,157 --> 01:18:52,703
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my second scheduling question for Bobby is, we did have a motion to talk about the policies and procedures around athletics eligibility, and that was supposed to be end of March.

844
01:18:52,723 --> 01:18:56,165
[SPEAKER_15]: But obviously, we're all just a little delayed here.

845
01:18:56,185 --> 01:19:01,087
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was just curious when we could expect that information as we go forward.

846
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:06,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Peter Cushing's on, but I believe the report's done.

847
01:19:08,182 --> 01:19:16,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul DeLava, myself, Rachel Perry, Mo Lavin from guidance sat down and we put a plan in place.

848
01:19:17,465 --> 01:19:20,826
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe the MIA schedule should be done.

849
01:19:21,526 --> 01:19:23,447
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as community schools, I do not know.

850
01:19:25,111 --> 01:19:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a clarification for you, Jenny, those programs are not budget built.

851
01:19:31,653 --> 01:19:45,318
[SPEAKER_02]: They are directed strictly on receipts, reimbursements, tuitions, and so they operate within their own isolated program on annual

852
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: and expenditures out.

853
01:19:48,491 --> 01:20:00,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we were doing is just reviewing, which I believe I've shared thus far in the term of a recap of those program areas, but they are not budget developed.

854
01:20:00,914 --> 01:20:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: We can give an estimate, but again, right now with the volatility of everything that's happening, that estimate is not going to look as

855
01:20:14,295 --> 01:20:17,497
[SPEAKER_02]: the normal trend has been for each of those program areas.

856
01:20:17,957 --> 01:20:33,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So to the extent of a budget hearing or billed for those outside programs, I don't think that that was not the intent that I was looking for.

857
01:20:34,908 --> 01:20:35,429
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at.

858
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:41,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think it may have been my motion and that was definitely my intent.

859
01:20:41,414 --> 01:20:45,938
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I understand that they are not budget built in this same way.

860
01:20:46,118 --> 01:20:47,360
[SPEAKER_15]: However, we have no

861
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:54,736
[SPEAKER_15]: We have no visibility or transparency into how those revolving accounts work, like community schools.

862
01:20:55,177 --> 01:21:00,281
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's a million things that come in and out of community schools, and we don't ever talk about those things.

863
01:21:00,341 --> 01:21:12,193
[SPEAKER_15]: So my intention when we were having that discussion, and I don't know how other people feel about this, but my intention was that we would have a financial review of those revolving accounts that was

864
01:21:12,733 --> 01:21:16,734
[SPEAKER_15]: in more detail than a single line item on a single piece of paper.

865
01:21:17,754 --> 01:21:33,478
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to, if that was unclear the first time, I'm happy to make a motion right now to conduct a financial review of our evolving account programs in some level of detail so that we can all understand the ins and outs of those programs.

866
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:37,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

867
01:21:39,796 --> 01:21:45,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to jump in and I'm gonna ask for Ms.

868
01:21:45,419 --> 01:21:47,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson to give some feedback.

869
01:21:48,381 --> 01:22:01,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, I said it last time when we met, we are under tremendous pressure not being in a traditional working environment along with everyone.

870
01:22:01,908 --> 01:22:05,611
[SPEAKER_09]: And the demands of being able to prepare

871
01:22:06,651 --> 01:22:12,278
[SPEAKER_09]: the entire budget for the district now to do an additional deep dive of

872
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,071
[SPEAKER_09]: additional revolving accounts.

873
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:28,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel that that's a tremendous ask and a heavy lift where we're already in the month of April and our own fiscal situation isn't even resolved.

874
01:22:28,858 --> 01:22:32,940
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had all the departments present for this academic school year.

875
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:40,725
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still trying to do pre-budget meetings and at the same time meeting to deliver services to our students.

876
01:22:41,525 --> 01:22:57,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So I understand that there was a second, but I just feel I need to speak and say that this is a tremendous additional ask and burden to be able to get this done between now and June 1st.

877
01:23:01,154 --> 01:23:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Superintendent.

878
01:23:03,616 --> 01:23:21,829
[SPEAKER_02]: To that extent, not only are we developing these reports, doing the steps and lane increases, looking at the contractual obligations for next fiscal year, we are also providing and maintaining the level of service within the business center, which incorporates

879
01:23:22,349 --> 01:23:26,673
[SPEAKER_02]: conducting payroll, conducting accounts payable to ensure bills are paid out.

880
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:33,799
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also having to get started on our open enrollment for all of our benefits that will be started this week.

881
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:39,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a significant amount of effort and work that is going on right now.

882
01:23:40,385 --> 01:23:48,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can see on the screen currently, just the departments that we've reviewed right now, we are almost at $30 million in our fiscal 21.

883
01:23:50,215 --> 01:23:51,376
[SPEAKER_02]: budget request.

884
01:23:52,256 --> 01:24:03,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we continue with this process, we're going to have a significant amount of work to do to identify where we are going to come in and be able to present a budget to city council

885
01:24:03,832 --> 01:24:09,676
[SPEAKER_02]: and or in a time frame that will allow us to get that approved before the end of June.

886
01:24:10,276 --> 01:24:22,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to provide a recap again, but as I've shared, there are some pieces of the information that are not complete because they are not in the system.

887
01:24:22,283 --> 01:24:23,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't provide you

888
01:24:24,348 --> 01:24:25,709
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is not yet there.

889
01:24:25,929 --> 01:24:31,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't provide you the amounts that have not been posted.

890
01:24:31,151 --> 01:24:31,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

891
01:24:31,611 --> 01:24:32,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I can provide guesstimates.

892
01:24:32,972 --> 01:24:36,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I can provide the activity year to date and where it stands.

893
01:24:37,293 --> 01:24:45,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But these programs are in and of themselves supposed to be individual operating programs.

894
01:24:45,817 --> 01:24:49,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there is not the revenue to support them, then their program

895
01:24:49,947 --> 01:24:55,629
[SPEAKER_02]: is either supplemented and or reduced in this level of service.

896
01:24:55,749 --> 01:25:07,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the capacity of being able to have additional meetings in this format, I think is just unattainable right now.

897
01:25:09,414 --> 01:25:10,374
[SPEAKER_02]: With all due respect.

898
01:25:12,335 --> 01:25:12,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor.

899
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:17,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

900
01:25:17,957 --> 01:25:18,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

901
01:25:20,498 --> 01:25:25,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely understand that there's only so many hours in the day and there's only so many people in the office.

902
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:42,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's nobody in the office, but the decisions, for instance, whether or not these programs are offering services or charging fees at a rate that the school committee thinks is appropriate is a school committee decision, but we never get to make the decision.

903
01:25:42,652 --> 01:25:45,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we be doing the same cost for families

904
01:25:46,878 --> 01:25:51,459
[SPEAKER_08]: who have a half a million dollars in income versus families that are living on $10,000 a year in income.

905
01:25:51,859 --> 01:25:53,059
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't make that decision.

906
01:25:53,719 --> 01:26:01,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, there's a lot of decisions the school committee should be making that are very much related to these programs.

907
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:13,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, you know, the program does, if the particular account does not have enough funds, we transfer our money from our general budget into it or from another one of those accounts.

908
01:26:14,483 --> 01:26:15,803
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're making a decision

909
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:35,998
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just so much that we have no idea what's going on, but then at the end of the day, we're expected to just hand some money over or, you know, I have had emails, numerous emails over the last couple of years, like, why do I pay so little for before or after school?

910
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:42,682
[SPEAKER_08]: From some families that are like living large by Medford standards, who are like, I can't believe I pay so little.

911
01:26:43,356 --> 01:26:54,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as a school committee member, I should be deciding on whether, we should be deciding whether or not to adjust the rates for those programs so that we can support families that are living below the poverty level.

912
01:26:55,505 --> 01:27:03,931
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't do any of that, but also, you know, we had that big issue with the foreign afterschool or Israeli afterschool recently.

913
01:27:04,171 --> 01:27:12,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was, a lot of that has to do with the fact that, you know, there's this view that afterschool is collecting all this money

914
01:27:12,944 --> 01:27:15,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're just using it like it's a piggy bank.

915
01:27:16,805 --> 01:27:26,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And the lack of transparency on the fact that those employees have benefits, they have all the other stuff that isn't coming out of that account.

916
01:27:30,848 --> 01:27:33,408
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to open the books on this stuff.

917
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to be able to say, after school brings in this amount of money and after we have paid all of the employees and the city has paid for their benefits,

918
01:27:42,459 --> 01:27:43,279
[SPEAKER_08]: for their retirement.

919
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:49,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And I realize some of that will be kind of squishy, but right now we don't say anything about it.

920
01:27:49,742 --> 01:27:56,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it $600,000 in profit we're pulling out of afterschool people and then complaining because we don't want to pay them more?

921
01:27:56,766 --> 01:27:58,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's what it looks like to the public.

922
01:27:58,766 --> 01:28:04,769
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not an unreasonable view, because that's the view I feel like I have often as a school committee member.

923
01:28:05,009 --> 01:28:11,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And I get that we don't have enough time to do yet more reports this budget season, but I just feel like

924
01:28:12,085 --> 01:28:14,926
[SPEAKER_08]: This lack of transparency here is a problem.

925
01:28:15,846 --> 01:28:22,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in all due respect, we've provided that information in each subsequent budget year.

926
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:29,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've identified what the anticipated amount we would need from each of those programs in order to fill the gap.

927
01:28:30,492 --> 01:28:37,834
[SPEAKER_02]: As I reported on the last report of the revolving accounts, we didn't utilize the full amount I was able to reserve.

928
01:28:37,974 --> 01:28:39,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank goodness we did going into this

929
01:28:41,537 --> 01:28:42,478
[SPEAKER_02]: unknown crisis.

930
01:28:43,038 --> 01:28:51,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the extent of identifying that it's not transparent, I have to disagree with that.

931
01:28:52,482 --> 01:29:04,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And also identify that there will be more discussion in our executive session that you will have the additional information regarding some of those revolving accounts.

932
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I know we're at 530.

933
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:13,122
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have a motion on the table.

934
01:29:13,142 --> 01:29:25,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, can you just repeat your motion, it was to conduct a financial review of revolving our revolving our significant revolving accounts so food service before and after schools and community schools.

935
01:29:25,769 --> 01:29:30,712
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm, I'm super willing, I'm super willing to talk about a reasonable timeline but

936
01:29:32,472 --> 01:29:37,654
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how we ever have a reasonable timeline because every time we talk about the budget, we run out of time.

937
01:29:37,814 --> 01:29:45,457
[SPEAKER_15]: So something has to change in this process going forward, for sure, so that we can have time to talk about all of this stuff.

938
01:29:45,577 --> 01:29:56,981
[SPEAKER_15]: But we can't continue to say we don't have time when this committee is expected to sign off on a budget and send it to the city council.

939
01:29:58,562 --> 01:30:01,983
[SPEAKER_15]: whether it's this budget or it's revolving accounts, it's all related.

940
01:30:02,103 --> 01:30:07,244
[SPEAKER_15]: None of it can be isolated, not the way we currently do business.

941
01:30:07,264 --> 01:30:09,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

942
01:30:10,164 --> 01:30:20,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We could move this meeting to the 5.30 meeting if we want to continue the discussion or we can take the vote on the motion and then go to the 5.30, either way.

943
01:30:20,827 --> 01:30:22,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to weigh in.

944
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:24,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, member van der Kloot.

945
01:30:25,732 --> 01:30:28,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we pick one of the areas that we want to see?

946
01:30:28,794 --> 01:30:29,934
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

947
01:30:30,735 --> 01:30:31,835
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

948
01:30:31,995 --> 01:30:36,217
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of time by, or, you know, you said June 1st.

949
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:39,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we say June, hold it out a little bit longer?

950
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:41,220
[SPEAKER_12]: You know.

951
01:30:43,301 --> 01:30:43,601
[SPEAKER_12]: 15th?

952
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:44,942
[SPEAKER_12]: We're running out of daylight.

953
01:30:44,962 --> 01:30:50,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, I'm certainly willing to, you know, I know,

954
01:30:53,737 --> 01:31:03,166
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that we wanted to put the budget meetings before the other meetings, and I know that there's a lot of planning time, but we could consider doing a different night as well, or time.

955
01:31:03,887 --> 01:31:11,755
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to work out, I hear the administration saying, oh my God, we've got so much to do, and I hear your need of saying,

956
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:15,558
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to see more in depth.

957
01:31:15,598 --> 01:31:25,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have discussed, and I think we will discuss some of it in depth, but I'm trying to look for a place that might be a little more amenable to administration.

958
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:27,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we push it out, Christine?

959
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:35,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for a I'm doing the best I can I'm one person here.

960
01:31:35,152 --> 01:31:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one person doing the finances I'm doing everything I possibly can to get this budget.

961
01:31:41,694 --> 01:31:43,995
[SPEAKER_02]: The operating budget is that the main?

962
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive here that we are trying to maintain I still have my own obligations at home as other folks do but I am I am one person and one person alone working on this process so in that regard I can't promise that

963
01:32:00,631 --> 01:32:03,018
[SPEAKER_02]: an unrealistic timeline.

964
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:06,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working 12 hours a day on this stuff right now.

965
01:32:06,728 --> 01:32:06,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And

966
01:32:07,577 --> 01:32:14,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And quite frankly, it's it's impeding my vision right now looking at these screens and we'll be on these white screens for another five hours.

967
01:32:15,004 --> 01:32:20,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am doing my very best for this for this process.

968
01:32:20,789 --> 01:32:27,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been transparent and I have provided the documents and the numbers as they have been provided.

969
01:32:27,855 --> 01:32:30,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I will load up the the numbers for all these additional

970
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:36,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to amend my motion to give us until October 15th to have these meetings.

971
01:33:05,459 --> 01:33:07,720
[SPEAKER_05]: to start the budget meetings in October next year?

972
01:33:08,241 --> 01:33:11,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking specifically about these revolving account meetings.

973
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:17,448
[SPEAKER_15]: They can wait to occur until next year, but they need to occur before October 15th.

974
01:33:18,789 --> 01:33:25,495
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure that's necessarily real right now.

975
01:33:26,636 --> 01:33:26,976
[SPEAKER_12]: However,

976
01:33:31,811 --> 01:33:32,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

977
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,274
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what is public and not.

978
01:33:37,316 --> 01:33:38,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second that for the October 15th.

979
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:42,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was already seconded, though.

980
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:43,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor, ma'am?

981
01:33:44,422 --> 01:33:45,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

982
01:33:46,304 --> 01:33:57,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm just wondering also, and I've been in Paulette and Paul and Mia and Kathy have been on the committee, obviously, for more than one term.

983
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in several meetings in the past where this has been, this information has been asked for.

984
01:34:02,704 --> 01:34:16,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm just confused because it's not like, okay, now I know we have a lot of, you know, we have a pandemic going on, we have lots of things going on, but this has been asked for in the past and it's always been sort of put off and I'm not really understanding why.

985
01:34:16,956 --> 01:34:25,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that's just, I'm out of the loop or maybe somebody can enlighten me here, but I don't really understand why this has been asked for for years and has not been answered.

986
01:34:26,001 --> 01:34:27,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not accurate.

987
01:34:27,322 --> 01:34:38,368
[SPEAKER_02]: We have provided the revolving account reviews and in all fairness and honesty for this body, that has been done on an annual basis.

988
01:34:38,929 --> 01:34:41,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually we are working on that for March.

989
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:43,491
[SPEAKER_02]: However, things have been

990
01:34:45,473 --> 01:34:47,014
[SPEAKER_02]: in a backlog situation.

991
01:34:47,355 --> 01:34:55,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And quite frankly, a lot of this has to do with things that occur in the Treasury Office at City Hall that are out of my hands.

992
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot report something that is not yet in the system.

993
01:34:59,723 --> 01:35:05,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the sense of saying that this information has not been provided, I'm sorry, but that is not correct.

994
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:09,470
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been providing an annual review of the revolving accounts

995
01:35:10,473 --> 01:35:16,102
[SPEAKER_02]: for each of them subsequently, and I can provide those reports for you as they have been done the last three years.

996
01:35:17,224 --> 01:35:18,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Member van de Kloot.

997
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on one second.

998
01:35:20,797 --> 01:35:21,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you unmute yourself?

999
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:21,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1000
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:23,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1001
01:35:23,078 --> 01:35:28,341
[SPEAKER_12]: I would concur that I've certainly heard the information before that it's not that this information was withheld.

1002
01:35:28,722 --> 01:35:30,663
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just the update on the information.

1003
01:35:30,883 --> 01:35:41,629
[SPEAKER_12]: And in previous years, we also waited because the accounts were not finished off yet to a later date in the year.

1004
01:35:41,809 --> 01:35:44,691
[SPEAKER_12]: So I certainly would endorse what Ms.

1005
01:35:44,711 --> 01:35:45,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Patterson is saying.

1006
01:35:46,912 --> 01:35:50,193
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we can certainly shoot for October 15th.

1007
01:35:50,553 --> 01:35:58,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I think, um, if so we can take the vote and move on now, um, that that would be our objective would be, would be good.

1008
01:35:58,634 --> 01:36:03,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, and we'll, um, you know, all things considered.

1009
01:36:05,256 --> 01:36:05,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1010
01:36:05,996 --> 01:36:15,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so a motion to review all revolving account accounts and have meetings to do that on or before.

1011
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:22,062
[SPEAKER_05]: before October 15th, motion by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1012
01:36:22,082 --> 01:36:22,922
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

1013
01:36:22,942 --> 01:36:23,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, please.

1014
01:36:24,922 --> 01:36:26,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1015
01:36:26,263 --> 01:36:28,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot.

1016
01:36:34,784 --> 01:36:36,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot, you have to unmute yourself.

1017
01:36:36,285 --> 01:36:37,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it's not working in my end.

1018
01:36:40,305 --> 01:36:40,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

1019
01:36:41,286 --> 01:36:42,266
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta unmute yourself.

1020
01:36:42,606 --> 01:36:42,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1021
01:36:46,435 --> 01:36:47,675
[SPEAKER_05]: go ahead, you do it, Member Van der Kloot.

1022
01:36:47,755 --> 01:36:48,296
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

1023
01:36:48,696 --> 01:36:49,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1024
01:36:49,656 --> 01:36:50,636
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, Member Graham?

1025
01:36:50,997 --> 01:36:51,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1026
01:36:51,717 --> 01:36:52,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Kreatz?

1027
01:36:54,318 --> 01:36:54,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Cathy?

1028
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:56,659
[SPEAKER_12]: She might have got it.

1029
01:36:56,779 --> 01:36:56,899
Yes.

1030
01:36:57,179 --> 01:36:58,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

1031
01:36:58,759 --> 01:36:59,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin?

1032
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:00,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1033
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:01,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Mustone?

1034
01:37:02,681 --> 01:37:02,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1035
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:04,882
[SPEAKER_12]: What, she left?

1036
01:37:05,002 --> 01:37:06,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, absent.

1037
01:37:06,402 --> 01:37:07,883
[SPEAKER_12]: She's here, she said yes.

1038
01:37:08,263 --> 01:37:09,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, okay.

1039
01:37:09,543 --> 01:37:10,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Van der Kloot?

1040
01:37:12,004 --> 01:37:12,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1041
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,425
[SPEAKER_12]: And Member Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1042
01:37:15,405 --> 01:37:15,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1043
01:37:15,725 --> 01:37:17,847
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 the affirmative, 0 the negative.

1044
01:37:18,867 --> 01:37:19,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper passes.

1045
01:37:20,248 --> 01:37:21,089
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from Paul, too.

1046
01:37:21,109 --> 01:37:22,129
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't ask me, Paulette.

1047
01:37:22,329 --> 01:37:23,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

1048
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,790
[SPEAKER_08]: That's OK.

1049
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:26,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, so I marked you off, Paul.

1050
01:37:26,912 --> 01:37:27,012
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1051
01:37:27,313 --> 01:37:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1052
01:37:29,414 --> 01:37:29,894
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1053
01:37:30,475 --> 01:37:34,277
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no other questions, I believe this kicks us off at

1054
01:37:36,937 --> 01:37:41,461
[SPEAKER_05]: 545 Mr. Cushing okay 545 so we can continue this.

1055
01:37:41,881 --> 01:37:45,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a five minute break and reconvene at our next meeting.

1056
01:37:45,203 --> 01:37:50,587
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other, you have to get logged off and then get on to the next zoom call.

1057
01:37:50,707 --> 01:37:51,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1058
01:37:51,828 --> 01:37:52,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

1059
01:37:53,889 --> 01:37:54,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1060
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:58,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose motion meeting is adjourned.
