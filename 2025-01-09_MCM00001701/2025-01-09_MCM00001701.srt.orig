1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,067
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to call the meeting to order.

2
00:00:02,087 --> 00:00:04,829
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take roll call.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Kayla Lessen?

4
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:06,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

5
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:08,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta Cameron?

6
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:09,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Here.

7
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:10,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Harry Weaver?

8
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:10,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Here.

9
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Penelope Taylor?

10
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:12,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Here.

11
00:00:13,257 --> 00:00:13,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Lisa Sun?

12
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:14,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Here.

13
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:17,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Brianna Longo?

14
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:18,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here.

15
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,977
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take all things a little bit out of order tonight but that's okay with everybody.

16
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:36,619
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start with the working groups and we'll start with the declaration of trust is ready to be signed by all members.

17
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:46,382
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll sign the declaration before the notary and we'll have De'Aria from the mayor's office who is a licensed notary.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,221
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is urchin.

19
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:54,021
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a signature pinch at the end.

20
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,802
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to sign their name and then fill in the date.

21
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I ripped it.

22
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:03,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, gosh.

23
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:09,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I have another copy.

24
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:10,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:12,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited.

26
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:13,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to use a book?

27
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:00,638
[SPEAKER_10]: They're so.

28
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:00,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

29
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:30,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

30
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:51,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And this will get filed?

31
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, in Registry of Deeds.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,503
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the procedure for filing at the Registry of Deeds?

33
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:09,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet.

34
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to stay at the ESS's office.

35
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

36
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:19,350
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to get a check made out in advance to the Registry of Deeds.

37
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:29,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So however that happens in the city, in your city system, you get the check made out in advance and then you can go and walk it and drop it off at the Registry of Deeds.

38
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:30,397
[SPEAKER_11]: You can mail it.

39
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:31,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you?

40
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

41
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:38,227
[SPEAKER_11]: But the most complicated part is having to check it out for the exact amount in advance.

42
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:42,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's in other documents, it should be like $105.

43
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:42,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

44
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I know mortgages are $205.

45
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:49,531
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to check that out?

46
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:51,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

47
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:54,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Daria.

48
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:55,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

49
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:59,514
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm pretty sure you guys are not arguing, but...

50
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:03,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all.

51
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:28,932
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.

52
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

53
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:31,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dario.

54
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a problem.

55
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, guys.

56
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:38,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

57
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

58
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,501
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of my new user solutions, so check that out.

59
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:46,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

60
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:50,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Mine was to pick something to celebrate every day.

61
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:55,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of waiting for September 25 to bring me something to celebrate, I think everything celebrates.

62
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:56,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

63
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:09,163
[SPEAKER_11]: And now the second part of working groups is the action plan.

64
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:16,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta, Penny and myself were on the action plan committee.

65
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,910
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to leave one of you all to update if that's okay.

66
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:25,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, we can both give our part.

67
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:36,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've been working on drafting the narrative that goes with the data that we presented last month or a couple of months ago.

68
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:41,370
[SPEAKER_11]: So that we'll have all of the data portion of the plan.

69
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have held one focus group meeting with service providers.

70
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:47,993
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a great

71
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:58,350
[SPEAKER_11]: response from about 27 service providers in the region who are interested in providing input.

72
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So we met with about half of them in the first meeting.

73
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:06,355
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll meet with the remaining this month.

74
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're still working on a date to hold that meeting.

75
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:12,119
[SPEAKER_03]: The potential dates are January 14th, 17th or 21st.

76
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:29,641
[SPEAKER_11]: And so after we have this input from the stakeholder service providers, then we'd like to pivot toward holding a public meeting so we can get public input and what the community needs are.

77
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:37,043
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's actually about now is the time that we need to be planning to organize the public meeting.

78
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,184
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after the

79
00:06:42,452 --> 00:07:05,389
[SPEAKER_11]: we hold a public meeting, then we'll start working together with committee members, with the trust board members to go through what will be the meat of the action plan, our purpose and goals and strategies so that we can develop that plan with an understanding from all of the input that we've gathered so far.

80
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,193
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, one question to the chair.

81
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:16,928
[SPEAKER_08]: public meeting at a scheduled trust meeting on Wednesday?

82
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:19,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you're thinking, or will it be a separate night?

83
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be a separate night.

84
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:29,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions about the workgroup on the action plan?

85
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I could ask, actually, if there are any parameters that we should think about with respect to the public meeting?

86
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:52,831
[SPEAKER_11]: night or what time would be good to hold it, where, and any thoughts about who to invite or how to put the invitation out there so that we get a really robust.

87
00:07:55,232 --> 00:08:00,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the chair, the city can help with the comms piece, whatever you need, and PDS has a newsletter, too.

88
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:02,293
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of picking a night, right?

89
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:06,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Wednesdays work great for me because it's just a guaranteed night.

90
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to take my kids anywhere without having to scramble.

91
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:16,534
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know if we could do like a 5 o'clock meeting and then do a listening session at 6 or something like that.

92
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:20,195
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds good for me here.

93
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:20,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

94
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:21,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

95
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:21,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

96
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:25,276
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good idea.

97
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:33,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're meeting the action plan group later this week, so we can put forth that we can propose.

98
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:37,774
[SPEAKER_01]: a night to end the agenda.

99
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:49,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I personally would love everyone in our trust to help with outreach and make sure people are invited to participate in the community meeting because it is broad.

100
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:52,347
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just service providers and developers.

101
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the whole community.

102
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that will be an important piece, too.

103
00:08:56,531 --> 00:09:00,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll hear all about the city supports and make sure we're connected.

104
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:05,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to add to that, Friday afternoon meeting is going to be a public meeting.

105
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:10,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So if any of you are interested, please feel free to join the working group.

106
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:23,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And the working group has met the last five times on September 10, September 23rd, October 21st, November 22nd, and on November 26th.

107
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:27,938
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are hoping to have the meeting notes ready for the next affordable housing trust meeting.

108
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So let all of you have access to the meeting notes.

109
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:32,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

110
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:33,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

111
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And the meeting for Friday is already public, right?

112
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

113
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the state's calendar.

114
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

115
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:42,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a working group meeting?

116
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:42,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

117
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:43,904
[SPEAKER_03]: For the action plan?

118
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:48,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an action plan working group meeting, but it's a public meeting.

119
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

120
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,450
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

121
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:59,916
[SPEAKER_11]: And on to the next topic, which is item number four, application updates and funding and technical assistance.

122
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:08,851
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see, Aditi, can you provide us with an update for the CPA funding against CHAPA?

123
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:25,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good idea, but CPA has, or CPC has approved our funding request, so the next step is to go before the committee of the whole, and that is on... It's your... January 21st.

124
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:25,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

125
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a remote meeting.

126
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:36,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to respond to the Council's questions if they have any.

127
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:54,647
[SPEAKER_03]: We would go before the City Council on the 28th of January.

128
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,048
[SPEAKER_03]: At that meeting, we don't have to be present.

129
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:01,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa, who's the CPA manager, will be our representative.

130
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:07,273
[SPEAKER_11]: And you said the Committee of the Whole is Tuesday, January 21st.

131
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:08,574
[SPEAKER_11]: At what time?

132
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:11,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to see what date.

133
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:15,837
[SPEAKER_11]: You said the City Council meeting is going to be.

134
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:16,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on the 28th.

135
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:19,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to confirm the time of the 21st.

136
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:21,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I have sent an email to all of you.

137
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:22,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the meeting invite.

138
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can check in if it's on the calendar.

139
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make myself available.

140
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:28,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

141
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I just tell the time on my calendar.

142
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:30,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

143
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is 7 p.m., but I'll just check.

144
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:32,752
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 or 7.

145
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:33,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

146
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me check.

147
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:49,083
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, I'll just update on the CHAPA's technical assistance.

148
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:58,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, we didn't receive the technical assistance grant from CHAPA, but they've offered to provide some sort of technical support.

149
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:11,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a meeting with CHAPA on the 20... I think it's on the 20... Sorry, I'm trying to...

150
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,360
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the last week of January.

151
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So find out what sort of technical support are they interested to provide.

152
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:28,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the next meeting in February, I'll update you all with the details.

153
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:29,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

154
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,233
[SPEAKER_08]: the public works facility committee meeting on January 21st at 7?

155
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:49,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I have 6 p.m., says the committee of the whole.

156
00:12:49,716 --> 00:13:01,464
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole Tuesday, 21st, 6 p.m.

157
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,908
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the meeting with Chapman is actually January 24th at 11 a.m.

158
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:18,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I put a tentative.

159
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:18,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be present, yeah.

160
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:33,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so next item on our agenda, we're waiting for updates from the Office of Planning and Development and Sustainability.

161
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:36,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so Daniel and Halisha will join us at 5.30.

162
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:49,421
[SPEAKER_03]: want to talk about the action plan or any other topics that are listed on the agenda, we can discuss that until they come.

163
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:55,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to talk about the stakeholder meeting a little bit on some of the feedback that we got on?

164
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:58,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my notes attached here.

165
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:03,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't feeling too refreshed in my memory about the meetings.

166
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:15,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And while you look for that, actually, if it's not on the agenda, I probably shouldn't bring it up.

167
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:16,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind.

168
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:18,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working on some funding for the trust.

169
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,537
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple avenues.

170
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,761
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have updates for funding.

171
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:47,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Working on selling two lots up in the heights that there are interested parties for, and I have looped in the council, especially Matt Lemming, who's interested in revamping linkage.

172
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:57,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously the President, so we are moving forward, going to go to the Council, I believe, on the 21st to get approval to put out an RFP.

173
00:14:57,122 --> 00:15:03,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So be extra transparent and ask for permission to put out an RFP to sell those lots.

174
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:09,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'd like the proceeds, we'd like the proceeds to go into the Affordable Housing Trust.

175
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:11,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're valued at over 600,000.

176
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:16,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll put a minimum price on there, probably about half.

177
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:22,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there is some ledge, but that's just one thing I'm working on.

178
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:29,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And our hope is, and Councilor Lemming's request is, that we use that funding, I think it was either 80 or 130, to update linkage.

179
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:29,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

180
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:36,668
[SPEAKER_08]: and then I am working with Tufts University with regards to their dormitory.

181
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:48,395
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what they give to the trust, if it's eventually approved, we'll not remediate some of the issues that the neighborhood may face, but I am working that avenue too.

182
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's potentially half a million.

183
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:56,614
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really helpful.

184
00:15:56,634 --> 00:16:05,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is really relevant for the action plan to be able to compile any possible known funding sources.

185
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Just thinking about funding.

186
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:21,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have my notes in front of us, but there was a grant that we were going to get from when we first started talking about the trust.

187
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:25,439
[SPEAKER_11]: There was the CPA application and match money.

188
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:37,203
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't much, I mean, but we do have something called MVDC, Mystic Valley Development Corporation.

189
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:37,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there it is.

190
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:46,812
[SPEAKER_03]: The three cities together are developing part of Medford, I think Medford, Everett, and Malden, part of this commission.

191
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:51,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the developers has promised verbally to provide

192
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,943
[SPEAKER_03]: $250,000, if my memory serves right.

193
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:57,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

194
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:57,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

195
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,104
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't know anything on that yet.

196
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:00,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

197
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:05,847
[SPEAKER_03]: MEU has been drafted and we're waiting for that to be executed.

198
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

199
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:22,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just looked up my, I have my notes from the stakeholders meetings in front of me.

200
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:32,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to sort of break down what was done at the stakeholders meeting, the first stakeholders meeting, Roberta and I did a presentation.

201
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:36,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Roberta, for putting together the PowerPoint on that.

202
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:45,740
[SPEAKER_11]: We did the introductions and then we broke up into two separate working groups in the Zoom and we're asking developers and,

203
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:53,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it was a breakout room for developers and a breakout room for supportive services.

204
00:17:54,021 --> 00:18:02,570
[SPEAKER_11]: In the breakout room for developers, we had asked the developers, what opportunities do they see to create affordable housing in Medford?

205
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:10,178
[SPEAKER_11]: What other housing issues would they want to come from the trust besides housing construction?

206
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:19,124
[SPEAKER_11]: How much is it costing to develop units, affordable units, or provide assistance per unit?

207
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we consider a cap on the funding per unit?

208
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:30,909
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not DHCD anymore, it's EOL.

209
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, very much like they do.

210
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:44,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we asked them to walk us through sort of how they go about creating a pro forma, a budget for funding sources for developing housing.

211
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:52,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I don't have the questions that were asked at the supportive services breakout room.

212
00:18:54,317 --> 00:19:00,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if my notes are correct, we can ask what can Metro do as a city for the service providers?

213
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:10,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say I came away learning more about the gaps of hearing what services are provided and then what is needed to really ensure that those services

214
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:14,293
[SPEAKER_01]: are stabilizing folks and letting them stay in Medford.

215
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:26,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So some things like a flexible, more flexible pool of rental assistance funds, kind of in general, maximizing the money and the trust that can be nimble to fill those gaps.

216
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that came up was just

217
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it was like kind of the paperwork that goes behind getting people into programs, so reducing barriers and burdens as far as that goes.

218
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:50,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of emphasis on collaborations, like people who are already working here working together, and again, filling those gaps, but being more powerful together to think through these problems.

219
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:59,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to see, there were some like specific ideas I was trying to find, some deeper developer subsidies.

220
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:06,231
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of reflection on programs that are already running and what could make them better or more effective.

221
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:15,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like, what they would change about some programs that they're either involved in in Medford or Somerville or other communities.

222
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:24,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of thinking about the sweet spot for developer subsidies, for inclusionary zoning, and kind of the

223
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Transportation gaps for warming centers and resources.

224
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:47,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just like, you know, we'll give the full notes, but there's like a really, I feel like getting sort of a regional perspective with them, the folks who are actually on the ground in Medford and can kind of look around and see what's working great, but what needs like more robust support and then what's missing.

225
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:50,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my summary.

226
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,374
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like the conversation that we had with them.

227
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:58,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

228
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:10,817
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was very, a little bit, um, it was really helpful to learn how much the organizations are doing, who are already working in Medford.

229
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:19,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, but I still think that there's a gap in terms of helping people to know about those programs.

230
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

231
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:31,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think one of the gaps you're up to is kind of stateful, a gap and an opportunity I'll say is like state programs and how our program would interface with them.

232
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:40,107
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I think it's ABCD helps a lot of people apply for RAP, like emergency rental assistance, but there's like a $7,000 cap on RAP for a year.

233
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:45,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that's just not enough to stabilize the family and they're a little limited at what else they can access.

234
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:50,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, in terms of aligning with the state, there was a lot of encouragement to

235
00:21:51,409 --> 00:22:03,479
[SPEAKER_01]: consider that the state will be a major funder and try to make sure that we are aligning with their programs and setting up our infrastructure to be as compatible as possible and enticing for their funding as possible.

236
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:17,770
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems as though there's like really a collaboration among communities Medford and East and then Somerville and that direction.

237
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Somerville, Cambridge, you know that.

238
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:36,398
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it, like, I don't know, like, it could be helpful to not have to reinvent the wheel if we could create some more cross-pollinization between those two regions.

239
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:39,961
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, there's only so much funding to go around.

240
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:44,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know whether we can use our funding to help create those opportunities.

241
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that came up in the developers?

242
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:59,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Breakdown issues, maybe like structural issues besides construction costs, interest rates.

243
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I think finding open cash match.

244
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Was finding properties an issue?

245
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,882
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't really talk too much about the properties.

246
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:17,785
[SPEAKER_11]: They did talk a lot about city owned properties and trying to

247
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:24,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it was really a lot of just the cost of constructions and the cost of interest rates, materials, et cetera.

248
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I just noticed an interesting note.

249
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:47,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one of the barriers that was brought up was just criteria in the lotteries, like for inclusionary units and things like that.

250
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:55,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So just really trying to keep things simple when building things to make sure we're not creating a burdensome situation.

251
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Research as well, so.

252
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:11,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Important to think about, I guess they had the 33 unit development and Wakefield we heard about, but they only wound up getting 11 people in the lottery because the criteria was too much criteria.

253
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they had to like, totally regroup.

254
00:24:14,572 --> 00:24:20,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was a bit of a wake up call to not over to me.

255
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:22,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, let's not over means test it, but just kind of think about how to.

256
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:30,460
[SPEAKER_11]: It might also be a signal that the affordable units don't match the level of need.

257
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:43,269
[SPEAKER_11]: So if they're all affordable at 80% area median income, maybe they've already served that population and they need to find other... Variations?

258
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, other areas of affordability.

259
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:51,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Although the 80% area median income could be Section 8 units,

260
00:24:53,143 --> 00:25:10,846
[SPEAKER_11]: So layering subsidies with other programs, but then you might need to do marketing specifically to Section 8 administering agencies so that they direct their clients to apply for those units.

261
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:31,135
[SPEAKER_11]: But stopping your, or setting your affordable limits at 80%, you're missing, unless you have a voucher in place, you're actually missing a large population that doesn't make 80%, that doesn't have affordable, a voucher, so it's... Yeah.

262
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:35,179
[SPEAKER_11]: But where's the... Yeah.

263
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,681
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to be able to make it.

264
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:38,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Both are in need.

265
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:46,807
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the barriers highlighted in the affordable housing developer session was funding timeline.

266
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:52,169
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be aligned with the state or federal funding as well.

267
00:25:52,769 --> 00:26:03,672
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about whether or not the trust should have a roll-in application process or just one RFP that goes out and have applications come in.

268
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:08,635
[SPEAKER_11]: and then start trying to rate the applications.

269
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:17,461
[SPEAKER_11]: But because of the way the state does their application processes, they need their conditional commitments fairly quickly.

270
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:22,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And so having a role in application process for the trust would be helpful.

271
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:29,096
[SPEAKER_01]: see a note to the mayor's earlier question about like sites.

272
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:38,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that came up, someone mentioned that like, we're in a really good position to analyze potential sites for affordable housing because we are on the ground, we're looking around.

273
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:46,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So just that those, you know, just kind of reiterating that we're in a good position to see those opportunities and really consider the ones that are most compatible, so.

274
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

275
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we okay to go?

276
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:04,585
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go back up to the second item on our agenda, which is updates from the Office of Planning and Development and Sustainability.

277
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:08,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know her exact time name.

278
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:11,549
[SPEAKER_06]: She did go be not in the building and come back.

279
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:23,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

280
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:28,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've met most of you in person, but not everybody.

281
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:30,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm Alicia Hunt.

282
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:31,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the director of planning.

283
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:35,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I work for the mayor, and Aditi works in my office, as Danielle does.

284
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:37,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you mind just telling me your first names?

285
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:42,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I've been working with Roberta for years, but just to put the names with the faces.

286
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:43,358
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Kayla.

287
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:44,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Penny.

288
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:45,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

289
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa Ann.

290
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:47,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa's son.

291
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:48,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry.

292
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:49,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

293
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:50,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

294
00:27:50,303 --> 00:28:01,828
[SPEAKER_00]: I just because I saw the names I was involved in sort of the appointments and stuff and I met some of you before but I just I've seen your name on some comments like things like that on Facebook so it's nice to put your face to it.

295
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:11,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I was glad that I could be here and I think you're holding the meeting a little earlier than usual so that we could be here which I also appreciate we almost always have either

296
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:23,372
[SPEAKER_06]: a community development board meeting on Wednesday night, or now on alternate Wednesdays, we're meeting with the city council and their planning and permitting committee on the alternate Wednesday night.

297
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:26,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can be really hard to get us on a Wednesday night.

298
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:35,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that ADT presented a bunch of stuff about where zoning and the housing production plan stood and stuff like that with you guys last month.

299
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:41,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And she and I were talking earlier that it would be helpful for me to provide some updates on that.

300
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:51,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some cases, actually, I don't want to say clarifications, but this zoning project is an active ongoing thing and therefore is kind of a moving target.

301
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:56,999
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every two weeks there's something different than we've made some new recommendation or decision.

302
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:05,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing I did just want to make sure everybody knows is that if you go to the URL medfordma.org slash zoning,

303
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:10,544
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a web page there that I'm trying really hard with our comms department, and it's on me.

304
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:15,467
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very good about updating whenever I send them to update the whole process.

305
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:25,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things is that there are some reference documents on there that can be useful as well as... Do you mind pulling that web page up?

306
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,253
[SPEAKER_06]: We hadn't discussed doing that.

307
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,075
[SPEAKER_06]: My screen is... Yeah.

308
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:42,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are some reference documents as well as what we're doing is every meeting that we're having that is a public meeting, we are trying to put up the presentation.

309
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,581
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can put it up in advance, we're putting it up.

310
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:47,103
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a document going to the council, we're putting it up.

311
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:50,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And then afterwards, we're linking the video from the meeting.

312
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:57,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, some of that is I had a graduate student working with us and he's been away for a break.

313
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:59,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the most recent meetings aren't up yet.

314
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:09,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But I find that that's a really good way to just sort of like what's, in fact, Aditi was saying to me, is the missing gap zoning on our SharePoint somewhere?

315
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:14,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, go to the webpage and that's gonna be the most recent last version.

316
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:19,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see all the meetings are listed and all the links.

317
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:29,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where I pointed her to the zoning amendment, but you can also see like, you can, pretty reliably, these are gonna be the most recent versions of everything.

318
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:41,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, Aditi, on that page under that, I was going to do that, but one other thing that's on there that as you guys were talking, I realized would be really useful to you.

319
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:48,779
[SPEAKER_06]: On that page, if you scroll down a little further to resources, it's citywide maps.

320
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:57,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you click on actually land use maps, these are actually maps that were made by our consultants for us.

321
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:02,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's a bunch that are land use and there are a bunch that are zoning.

322
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:15,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And so these just sort of provide these were intended to help us with some of the decisions that we're making right like residential clusters is useful zoning is of course getting outdated as we speak.

323
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:33,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But and I think the one above actually put it together with the zone yeah so it's nice about this one is that they took the zoning in our neighboring communities and they said what's the closest zone like what is the nearest so like that the light yellow.

324
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:40,319
[SPEAKER_06]: in the other communities are all single family zones or that those communities had the single family zones.

325
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was sort of a way to see Medford in more context.

326
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:48,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like the next one is literally just that map, but just clipped to just Medford.

327
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:53,790
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's another group, I don't know if you want to scroll through, but like median income.

328
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:57,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember off the top of my head what's on all of them, right?

329
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to present them to you tonight.

330
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:01,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to know that these exist.

331
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:04,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And that this work was done this past summer.

332
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really the most recent.

333
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:11,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the other one, the one he had on vacation, is that?

334
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:14,235
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's just the one.

335
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:21,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And it may be that that land use, so one of them has, and if we don't, no, okay.

336
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,921
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't have it, let me just check,

337
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:42,637
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done a bunch of work on where the zoning, oh yeah, so if you just keep going, there's value versions and then there's front building, building setbacks and stuff like that and dimensions and lot sizes and how much compliance and non-compliance and stuff.

338
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's really, you can do a deep dive and you can go into this for hours, but I wanted you all to know that those are there and they're linked off of that.

339
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:55,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're basing a lot of the work on.

340
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:07,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then the other thing is before you go to the zoning, but if you go back to the zoning webpage, if you go, which one did I click on?

341
00:33:08,081 --> 00:33:11,962
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the presentation for December 11th.

342
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:18,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have just that zoning presentation and just scroll down in it to, I think it's the fourth slide.

343
00:33:18,524 --> 00:33:19,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like this, that one.

344
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:29,929
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so this one just kind of lays out and just so we're clear, we've asked them to change North Medford and South Medford.

345
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:31,511
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what they really, really meant.

346
00:33:32,071 --> 00:33:35,874
[SPEAKER_06]: The consultant who was putting those labels, we thought that's what she meant.

347
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:40,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And she just meant the northern half of Medford, everything above the river.

348
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:46,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she meant the southern, everything below like the hillside in South Medford area.

349
00:33:46,883 --> 00:33:49,125
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're updating that to just be like,

350
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,015
[SPEAKER_06]: the two residential sections.

351
00:33:53,095 --> 00:34:00,880
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the first in January, we're going to be working on basically all the single family zones and looking at that.

352
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And how should that be?

353
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: What should those be?

354
00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:07,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll work on as well, dimensional standards, development standards.

355
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:12,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And February, we're going to be looking at the multifamily zones.

356
00:34:12,948 --> 00:34:18,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have mentioned to Aditi that those would be some good meetings for her to be attending with us.

357
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:27,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she can like there when they're probably mean they're probably means you're welcome to go to any of you are, but she could then say, oh, the affordable housing trust should know about this one.

358
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:29,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me send you these materials.

359
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:30,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me give you this update.

360
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:41,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now we have penciled in 80 years for February, because our consultants feel like the information that we have out of the state isn't solid enough.

361
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And she doesn't want us to spin our wheels.

362
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:48,769
[SPEAKER_06]: working through ADU new policies through the state if they're still coming out with regulations.

363
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:58,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So once the regulations have settled down a little bit more, the plan is to tackle ADUs and making sure that what we have is compliant with the state.

364
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And then do we want to change anything?

365
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:05,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't let us change anything that would be not compliant with the state.

366
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be in February.

367
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:13,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in case anybody's on watching public or going to watch the meeting,

368
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:21,764
[SPEAKER_06]: ADUs is Accessory Dwelling Units.

369
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:31,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the little units that people can add as of right that the state has now said that everybody has to be allowed to make as of right, but there are guidelines that are coming.

370
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:36,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to look at that again in February.

371
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:38,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are allowed in Medford now.

372
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:44,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the Medford ordinance is that they need to be owner occupied.

373
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:49,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that the state has said that they can't require owner occupied.

374
00:35:49,796 --> 00:36:00,819
[SPEAKER_06]: The state law, one of the reasons we're still waiting for a little bit of guidelines on that is because when you read the regulations, you couldn't read them to say that you could have built an ADU on a commercial building.

375
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, well, why would you build?

376
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:04,040
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't make any sense.

377
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,500
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not clear enough.

378
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're waiting for some more guidelines to just kind of, what does that really mean?

379
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:11,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

380
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:20,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we will go on to work on the commercial areas, the various squares and regions in Medford.

381
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:27,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will tell you that the reason some people want us to really look at West Medford and Wellington, they're pushed out some.

382
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:28,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Danielle.

383
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:28,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

384
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't wait for you.

385
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:38,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the reason they are pushed down is because we are doing some studies.

386
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:45,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are actually going to do what's called the Wellington Transformational Study of that region.

387
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:49,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had gotten some grant money to do it.

388
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:51,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We put it out to bid two years ago.

389
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't enough money.

390
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:57,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've gotten some additional money from the Gaming Commission to do that.

391
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And we received five proposals today.

392
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:11,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I can tell you that project will move forward, but I haven't even opened a proposal yet, which were the Wellington area study.

393
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:30,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are also doing a West Medford, so we got money to look at West Medford as well, and we're leveraging that money to do a citywide SWOT analysis, and it's really focused more on economic development, not housing, but a strength, weakness, and opportunities.

394
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:41,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are also intended to be, that's intended to be the commercial districts, whereas West Medford single family would be part of this northern

395
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:44,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford single family that we plan to do sooner.

396
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:47,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is all sort of coming.

397
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Things will be changing.

398
00:37:49,957 --> 00:37:55,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'm saying to a lot of people is, if you look at something in Medford and say, but will the zoning let me do it?

399
00:37:56,521 --> 00:38:03,825
[SPEAKER_06]: That question isn't really the most wonderful question that we're asking right now, because the zoning is very quickly changing.

400
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:09,242
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is worthwhile for people to say to us, this is what I would like to do.

401
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:11,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the zoning I would need to do it.

402
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:15,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we will feed that into the decisions we're making.

403
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:28,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could imagine that if we were thinking that four stories was the right height in a commercial district, and there was a developer saying, but I really want to do ground floor commercial and four stories residential above it.

404
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:30,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, well, that's five stories.

405
00:38:30,486 --> 00:38:33,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we would consider it with five stories.

406
00:38:33,623 --> 00:38:37,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Why make them go through the variance process if it's actually what they want to do?

407
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:42,526
[SPEAKER_06]: If they say to me, it's not financially feasible to do four, I need five.

408
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:44,887
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take that into consideration.

409
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:49,529
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not making any zoning simply because a developer asked for it.

410
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:59,613
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I have been encouraging developers to tell me what they want because I don't want us to change the zoning to something that they're not going to build, right?

411
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be buildable or it's pointless.

412
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,254
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a long way to a question about that.

413
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:11,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you talking to or hearing from nonprofit developers and hearing what they want?

414
00:39:11,897 --> 00:39:20,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something that DT had been doing some work with and Barbara before her about looking at smaller parcels and nonprofit projects.

415
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've been asking her to sort of like feed through what what we're hearing and they've been really.

416
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:29,365
[SPEAKER_06]: On the ground, trying to figure out specific projects.

417
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:40,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you that I have not been sort of going and finding developers and asking them for money for things other than they're showing up and they're saying, I want to build on this to gap.

418
00:39:41,676 --> 00:39:42,696
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to build?

419
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:46,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know 1 of the areas you're interested in the MBA zone.

420
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:51,344
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a developer who wants to build in the MBTA zone.

421
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:54,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said to me, but we have some concerns with the zoning.

422
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said to them, tell me exactly what you want changed.

423
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:07,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll look at it to understand what the problem is and whether it's a, you just need to pony up and you just need to pay for it.

424
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:11,579
[SPEAKER_06]: You need our zoning or is what you're looking for a reasonable.

425
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:15,182
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's actually one of the ones that I'll touch on because apparently there are some

426
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:21,277
[SPEAKER_06]: state imposed setbacks on some of the state roads that are in their deeds.

427
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:29,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And their required setbacks in their deeds are larger than what we were allowing under the MBTA zoning.

428
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was like a direct conflict.

429
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:40,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that is something that we are very much looking at and saying, okay, maybe actually we need to change the zoning to recognize state required easements.

430
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,496
[SPEAKER_06]: or we can get the state to change them.

431
00:40:43,596 --> 00:40:59,865
[SPEAKER_11]: So just a suggestion would be because we don't have relationships right now with many non-profit housing developers building in Medford, they might not have answers to the question of what would you want the zoning to do in Medford because they're not even thinking about it.

432
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:01,565
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't have any experience in Medford.

433
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wonder whether... We do.

434
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:05,888
[SPEAKER_06]: We can bring them through in touring.

435
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:06,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

436
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:10,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, so we do actually have relationships with today.

437
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:16,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Have they looked at our zoning enough to be able to have opinions about what is working or not working?

438
00:41:16,732 --> 00:41:21,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to remember who is the developer in the room?

439
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:22,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

440
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:22,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

441
00:41:22,895 --> 00:41:28,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's brought us two projects that he's looking at, and then it's somebody else looking in North Medford.

442
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:35,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Caribbean Development Corporation, CIDC.

443
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Caribbean Integrated Development Corporation.

444
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:51,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was just thinking that if we have trouble getting those answers from developers because they're not currently in Medford, maybe reaching out to neighboring communities

445
00:41:52,983 --> 00:42:15,577
[SPEAKER_11]: that have more non-profit development activity and finding out from their planning departments whether they're seeing lessons learned in their zoning that maybe we could avoid pitfalls based on the experience of some of our neighbors if we don't have the answers.

446
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:26,805
[SPEAKER_06]: The other group that we've been talking to, but it's slightly on the side, I don't know that they've really looked at our zoning, but we could ask for their experiences, the Arlington Housing.

447
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:33,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we've been meeting with, we've talked with them a couple of times about developing housing.

448
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:38,807
[SPEAKER_03]: We could also pose this question in our upcoming focus group sessions.

449
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:41,308
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a good question to add to our list of questions.

450
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:43,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of it is that

451
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:49,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not necessarily the question of what do you not like in our zoning?

452
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:51,498
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you want?

453
00:42:51,578 --> 00:42:53,158
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the heights and setbacks?

454
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:57,360
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you looking for in general is what we're kind of asking.

455
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what you'll find is that this is not really just tweaking.

456
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,563
[SPEAKER_06]: This is saying here's what makes sense.

457
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:08,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of it is like our setbacks, if you've ever looked at them, have a weird formula of

458
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I can never get it right.

459
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:26,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Height plus length divided by six or something, which means that the taller your building, the further back it is from the road and tends to be sitting in a sea of parking, which is just not how we want to see buildings built anymore.

460
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:32,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of it is just saying, I don't even care what you think about that setback.

461
00:43:32,058 --> 00:43:33,199
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going.

462
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:36,020
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had trouble looking at things like,

463
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:39,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it's the required open space.

464
00:43:40,264 --> 00:43:41,004
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

465
00:43:41,064 --> 00:43:42,805
[SPEAKER_06]: The required usable open space.

466
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Required usable open space.

467
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:48,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And the required open space is a function of how many units are on the site.

468
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:54,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So it basically says for each unit you need this much instead of a percentage of the lot.

469
00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:57,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes it difficult to density.

470
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

471
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:04,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is sort of why I'm saying it's less what they think of our current zoning and more like what kind of zoning would they want to see.

472
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:10,013
[SPEAKER_06]: in order to make this a buildable project or a doable project for them?

473
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:22,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's hard to, like, kind of do, like, a test fit with our existing zoning because there's so many variables that you have to get so far along, and then you figure out whether you need things.

474
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:25,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, with open spaces, you don't know how many units you have.

475
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:28,382
[SPEAKER_07]: All this stuff, and so it's tricky.

476
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:34,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we don't have, like, you know, FAR or just building footprint percentages.

477
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:45,710
[SPEAKER_06]: where we're looking to change and looking to make things make more sense and be easier for somebody to develop a project.

478
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:51,012
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want the upfront costs to be so hard because the zoning analysis is so hard.

479
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: We have people call us and say, can you tell us if I'd be allowed to build this?

480
00:44:55,434 --> 00:44:58,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, well, the question is a use question that I can look at.

481
00:44:59,036 --> 00:45:04,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to know what density and how many units you can put on this parcel, I was like, I can't tell you.

482
00:45:04,258 --> 00:45:07,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally can't, not under our current zoning.

483
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:13,085
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to say, like, how many units, and then we have to do all these calculations.

484
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:16,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, it's kind of nuts, frankly.

485
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you trying to get to form-based code, or?

486
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that we're ready to go quite that far.

487
00:45:23,192 --> 00:45:24,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

488
00:45:24,353 --> 00:45:30,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So much as, and then, so you were going to, do you want to pull up the other one you have open, is our, the mystic app zone.

489
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:31,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

490
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,440
[SPEAKER_06]: That's this one, yeah.

491
00:45:37,185 --> 00:45:42,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, that's your presentation, but it's in there.

492
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:51,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that I know, I was talking to Aditi earlier, one of the things that we've been changing is, so we've been doing incentive zoning.

493
00:45:52,138 --> 00:45:59,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things in the incentive zoning, sorry, I keep thinking in terms that you're all planners because I know many of you are.

494
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:04,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if I start going over, like, if you don't want to say so.

495
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:10,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the idea of incentive zoning is that there's a certain amount of and we're using it for height.

496
00:46:11,592 --> 00:46:24,139
[SPEAKER_06]: height that you can build by right but then if you want to go taller you have to give us certain things and I know Aditi shared that with you last month and she was having trouble explaining the affordability requirements.

497
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:36,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Well the bottom line is what we put in the MBTA zoning was too confusing and I realized that when we were saying we would like the incentive zoning throughout the city to be essentially the same.

498
00:46:36,406 --> 00:46:37,747
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be some things that you

499
00:46:38,303 --> 00:46:46,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So in MBTA zoning, we gave you a bonus if you did commercial, because we were not allowed to require commercial on the first floor.

500
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:50,708
[SPEAKER_06]: On NYSBG-AB, we are requiring commercial on the first floor.

501
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:52,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not getting a bonus floor for that.

502
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:54,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are some variations.

503
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:04,553
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things I went and reread the affordability requirements, and I said to my consultant, I do not remember what this means, and I cannot explain this to somebody.

504
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, it's wrong.

505
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:12,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to change it to be something that a reasonable person can read and understand.

506
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:15,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So we came up with this new table.

507
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:23,299
[SPEAKER_06]: The numbers are designed to work out to be very, very similar to that, but it's laid out more clearly.

508
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:28,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the way you would read this, so there are two things, and this is actually just more units.

509
00:47:28,822 --> 00:47:30,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a good one to start with.

510
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:37,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's so we have in our incentive zoning in our inclusionary zoning.

511
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:40,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the zoning that requires affordable units.

512
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It varies by how many units in the building.

513
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:46,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what you can see in the first two columns.

514
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:58,210
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 to 24 units, you're currently required to do 10%, 25 to 49, you're required to do 13% of the units affordable, and 50 or more units, 15% affordable.

515
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:06,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So then we said, well, if you do more affordability, more units that are affordable, you can get an extra floor.

516
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:11,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the numbers that have been recommended to us as being affordable,

517
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,542
[SPEAKER_06]: people will still build to in Medford.

518
00:48:16,403 --> 00:48:30,713
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do 3% extra and that you get an additional floor, and so the 3% means a total of 13% affordable units, 16% or 18% affordable units get to a floor.

519
00:48:31,814 --> 00:48:42,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for two additional, for two floors instead of one for two, you would do 5% additional and that would bring you up to 20% for the larger buildings.

520
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:58,920
[SPEAKER_06]: What is not in here yet but will be probably in the next round of zoning that we approve and by that I mean like what comes through in January or February will be that right now you may be aware that we don't do it's called fractional payments.

521
00:48:59,584 --> 00:49:08,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it turns out that you were supposed to build 3.2 affordable units, right now you have to round up to four.

522
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:21,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we see is that developers are reducing the size of their building, making bigger units so that they only round up to three units instead of having to get four for 3.2.

523
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we're going to be allowing are fractional payments so you would

524
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:31,011
[SPEAKER_06]: do three units of affordable and he'd give us cash for the 0.2.

525
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:34,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cash will come to the Affordable Housing Trust.

526
00:49:35,452 --> 00:49:37,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will be an income stream for this board.

527
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:44,834
[SPEAKER_06]: What we don't have figured out yet, I've asked the consultants for, is what is the formula?

528
00:49:45,134 --> 00:49:47,635
[SPEAKER_06]: How much is that 0.2, right?

529
00:49:47,695 --> 00:49:49,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how do you convert that into dollars?

530
00:49:49,636 --> 00:49:54,057
[SPEAKER_06]: If any of you have recommendations, you know things, they're off doing research.

531
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:55,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not asking you to do that.

532
00:49:55,937 --> 00:50:02,622
[SPEAKER_06]: but if you've seen something that you like somewhere else, this is a very good time to pass those formulas along to us.

533
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:04,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they reaching out to other communities?

534
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:06,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certain that they are.

535
00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:17,134
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the things that they tend to do is look at what other, I don't know if they're calling them or if they're doing the online like data search, like I said to them, you go find out what everybody else is doing and come back to us.

536
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:24,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Somerville, sorry, Somerville does do fractional payments and they do have a, for rentals,

537
00:50:25,877 --> 00:50:27,078
[SPEAKER_06]: fairly easy.

538
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of it, that people can understand it, that developers can figure out what it's going to cost them.

539
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:40,647
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good to know, especially that, and some of it is the formula easy to understand.

540
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:44,469
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the things we're trying to do is not make this a black box for everybody.

541
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:50,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is coming because you'll look at these numbers and you'll say, but you're going to end up with fractions everywhere.

542
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:51,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's good.

543
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: We can turn those into cash.

544
00:50:54,550 --> 00:51:12,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So a question is for especially in the corridors where there are going to be a lot of smaller units that are incorporated into the zoning, what to do about projects that are under 10 units?

545
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:17,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they not allowed to participate in the incentives?

546
00:51:17,864 --> 00:51:22,987
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other incentives they have to use, simply because

547
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:27,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the fact that what would really happen, right?

548
00:51:27,866 --> 00:51:31,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's 10% of 9 units, now you're a fraction.

549
00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:37,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And is that affordable for a developer that 8 units are market rate and 1 is an affordable unit?

550
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:44,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, at those numbers, when we start talking about fractional payments, it's not completely off the table, but you are looking at

551
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:46,550
[SPEAKER_06]: smaller developers?

552
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:55,858
[SPEAKER_11]: And then another question is, can they level up another floor just on the basis of fractional payments?

553
00:51:57,879 --> 00:52:01,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to do the math to see how that comes out.

554
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:02,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it might.

555
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:03,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

556
00:52:03,504 --> 00:52:07,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if you had 10... So can they buy a floor?

557
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:07,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

558
00:52:07,908 --> 00:52:10,850
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had 10 units and one unit is 10%,

559
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:19,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And now 13%, it's gonna be 1.3, that is definitely, that's what they're doing there.

560
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:21,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I clarify something?

561
00:52:21,293 --> 00:52:27,399
[SPEAKER_01]: That all whole numbers would be a unit that people couldn't just pay instead of building a unit?

562
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:27,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

563
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:27,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

564
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:36,026
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that we also, I've been hearing for many years, is very important, is that you don't let them buy out of the whole thing.

565
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the fraction would be a fractional payment.

566
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other piece here, if you scroll up, is actually deeper.

567
00:52:45,284 --> 00:52:46,105
[SPEAKER_06]: No, down.

568
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:46,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

569
00:52:46,785 --> 00:52:48,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I use the language differently.

570
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:49,908
[SPEAKER_06]: My kids do that, too.

571
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,650
[SPEAKER_06]: They scroll the opposite way I said.

572
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,214
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one is for deeper affordability.

573
00:52:56,534 --> 00:53:00,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So to do some, it's 65% of AMI instead of 80%.

574
00:53:02,139 --> 00:53:04,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're affordable by people who have lower incomes.

575
00:53:06,202 --> 00:53:13,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It still is the 10, 13, and 15%, but you would do 8% at 80% and 2% at 65.

576
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:19,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't understand exactly what we mean that's going to happen at the 10 to 24 units.

577
00:53:20,352 --> 00:53:27,377
[SPEAKER_06]: At 20 units, you could do the 5 and 5, and you can do one unit at 80 and one at 65.

578
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:34,882
[SPEAKER_06]: How we would actually make this work if somebody came to us and wanted to do it, we would have to sort of figure that out.

579
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:43,887
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least these are numbers that are understandable and this is a table that a reasonable person can read and understand.

580
00:53:47,994 --> 00:54:07,020
[SPEAKER_11]: So just so I make sure that I'm understanding what you're saying properly for a 10 to 24 unit if they want to buy an additional floor and offer units more at 65% they don't have to go to 13% affordability instead they're breaking the

581
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,561
[SPEAKER_11]: breaking the 10% between the two, 80% and 2%.

582
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:19,263
[SPEAKER_06]: In my experience in the last four years, it is very hard to get a developer to go to deeper affordability.

583
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:31,607
[SPEAKER_06]: They just don't want to do it because it's long-term money that they are not recouping on those apartments because this is in perpetuity and they have to meet the SHI.

584
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:36,088
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to be on the list, the state list of

585
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:38,727
[SPEAKER_06]: affordable housing in perpetuity.

586
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:39,728
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't get out of this.

587
00:54:39,788 --> 00:54:43,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford used to allow people to get out of it after 10 and 15 years.

588
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:45,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, we're not having that anymore.

589
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:50,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, I just want to be real clear about that having changed.

590
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the mystic app zoning, and it's been passed.

591
00:54:55,331 --> 00:55:01,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I do feel like if I can remember correctly, that there's still there's what I consider almost typos in here.

592
00:55:01,152 --> 00:55:03,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the plan is

593
00:55:04,432 --> 00:55:09,295
[SPEAKER_06]: that as we do each round of updates, we are finding things that we could do better.

594
00:55:09,315 --> 00:55:13,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then in June, we're actually holding June for cleanup.

595
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:21,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the idea is that we would go back and anything that we've changed further, we would then fix across the board.

596
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:28,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And a real easy example is if you go in this table and scroll down to where it's the green, the lead stuff.

597
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, it was still in that table.

598
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:49,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm right so the bottom line so what is we've been we haven't quite passed green score that is actually been so the green school score is coming with the it's been referred by the City Council of the community development board.

599
00:55:50,939 --> 00:55:56,322
[SPEAKER_06]: But the bottom line is certifiable as lead platinum or equivalent in the

600
00:55:56,862 --> 00:56:07,187
[SPEAKER_06]: MBTA communities it actually had is certified as LEED Gold for one story and certified as LEED Platinum for two stories.

601
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:19,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And what our climate planner pointed out and raised is that LEED Gold is very similar, very close to what people are being required to do by the extended stretch code that we have passed here in Medford.

602
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:21,993
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were kind of given that away for free.

603
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:28,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're removing the lead gold option and lead platinum is a stretch now.

604
00:56:28,978 --> 00:56:30,059
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something a little harder.

605
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:37,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And the difference between the word certified and certify a bulb, you don't actually get certified until the building has been open for a year.

606
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:42,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was creating like a dissonance problem.

607
00:56:42,678 --> 00:56:45,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reality is we want them to be all those check marks.

608
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:48,901
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to see that they have done all those things from their lead consultant.

609
00:56:50,182 --> 00:56:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they choose to not go ahead and get the certification, we don't care.

610
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,745
[SPEAKER_06]: We want them to do those green things.

611
00:56:57,925 --> 00:57:02,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've changed the language to certify a ball in the stuff going forward.

612
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:03,728
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the kind of like.

613
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:08,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of small, it needs to get propagated back through previous things.

614
00:57:09,097 --> 00:57:11,981
[SPEAKER_06]: We expect that's going to happen in other places as well.

615
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:20,031
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple of things like we can't change our current table, dimensional table and take out

616
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:31,462
[SPEAKER_06]: The setback of that height divided by width, height plus width divided by 6 until we have new setbacks for all the different zones.

617
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:35,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And once we have something else, then we can go back and edit it out of the old version.

618
00:57:36,848 --> 00:57:38,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So there'll be some cleanup throughout.

619
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:47,474
[SPEAKER_06]: If for any reason any of you are looking at our zoning and you see things you think we need to change, this is an amazingly good time to tell us about it.

620
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:53,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Telling us next year will just make us feel like this.

621
00:57:53,362 --> 00:57:56,426
[SPEAKER_08]: One question, because I know I always ask it through the chair.

622
00:57:58,127 --> 00:58:11,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we doing anything with the smaller developers that are doing one home here, one home there, and that have done 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, but haven't added to any affordable ability stock that we have?

623
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:17,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I have yet to have somebody tell me how we can do that legally, if anybody knows of a way or has believes it.

624
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:19,902
[SPEAKER_06]: We're open to that.

625
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:29,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's one thing when the developer is doing 10 units together, they did a subdivision over on Winthrop Street.

626
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:35,297
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that under our new zoning, my understanding is we can do that one of the 10.

627
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:36,498
[SPEAKER_06]: That one predates that.

628
00:58:40,523 --> 00:58:51,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, but we should be able to what, but what you're talking about is the gentleman that we know that he's, he's got three, your projects at a time.

629
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:52,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

630
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:57,512
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know of a way to do, we have, we asked, um, Emily.

631
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:58,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

632
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:58,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

633
00:58:58,832 --> 00:58:59,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jonathan.

634
00:58:59,593 --> 00:59:02,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so, you know, Emily is our consultant on this.

635
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:07,197
[SPEAKER_06]: She was the project manager on our, uh, comprehensive plan.

636
00:59:07,637 --> 00:59:09,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So she is very familiar with that.

637
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:15,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jonathan Silverstein is the lawyer working with her on this.

638
00:59:15,712 --> 00:59:18,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonathan's well-known for land-use law.

639
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:20,296
[SPEAKER_06]: He used to be with KP Law.

640
00:59:20,697 --> 00:59:30,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you know of Mark Bobrowski, who wrote the big land-use law book, he is actually kind of in training to take over Mark's legal practice.

641
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:37,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a question regarding split lots.

642
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:38,844
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know it's coming up.

643
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:51,173
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a big meeting about it, various in various places where somebody comes and split their lots to try to maybe not have to do the inclusionary pieces of it.

644
00:59:52,363 --> 01:00:19,661
[SPEAKER_11]: will your zoning make it so that if they do split the lots that they can talk about a larger developer saying i'm putting two buildings and that each one is one right there's exactly they've taken a lot and they've now split it into three different parcels and they're i'm going to say phases they'll build it in phases but in those phases should if it meets the criteria for your inclusionary units should still be

645
01:00:20,437 --> 01:00:47,131
[SPEAKER_07]: inclusionary 27 units over and three lots instead of anybody even come close to propose I think about here our current visionary learnings addresses that segmentation not be able to do that and also adding on to the subdivision about having able to set aside a lot Jonathan actually brought up that that's probably it's

646
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:58,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he was going to take that out of our, even if there's a legal challenge and there's something going through the courts right now that he might take that ability away so I wouldn't know.

647
01:00:59,295 --> 01:00:59,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

648
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:07,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I will say Danielle is an expert on the language and what's literally in the zoning and I'm more like the big picture.

649
01:01:09,135 --> 01:01:14,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask a question about the deeper subsidies piece?

650
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:35,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and apologies, this has been like a math week, and I'm not a particular math whiz, but I guess, I was just, on line one, so I see the potential, if you're looking at, let's say, 24-unit building, if it was all 10%, then that would produce two units and put .4 as cash.

651
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:36,834
[SPEAKER_01]: That's easy.

652
01:01:36,914 --> 01:01:37,755
[SPEAKER_01]: With this split,

653
01:01:38,953 --> 01:01:45,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it produces 1 unit, and then the rest is cash because it's, it's less than 2.

654
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:45,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so.

655
01:01:50,076 --> 01:01:51,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I guess.

656
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:52,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you say that again?

657
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this is the bonuses, like there's already the floor.

658
01:01:57,905 --> 01:01:59,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the 10% is the floor.

659
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:07,676
[SPEAKER_06]: But what they're saying is that you could do, so the way this is written is you could do 8% because it works really well.

660
01:02:07,696 --> 01:02:11,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll say that most of the projects that have been in front of us in the last couple of years,

661
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,402
[SPEAKER_06]: have been 150 and more units.

662
01:02:13,622 --> 01:02:15,524
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have four, nine and under.

663
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:20,468
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't seen very much at all that has hit this 10 to 50 units.

664
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:22,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we've permitted one in the last

665
01:02:23,598 --> 01:02:24,358
[SPEAKER_06]: four years.

666
01:02:24,518 --> 01:02:24,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

667
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:26,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess I'm going to talk through what I was observing.

668
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think 24 is the largest number.

669
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:35,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it was like a flat 10%, then that would produce 2.4 units and the 0.4 would be in cash.

670
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:41,884
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you split it, 8% of 24 is like, it's like 1.95.

671
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,904
[SPEAKER_01]: So that proves one unit with a lot of leftover.

672
01:02:43,924 --> 01:02:47,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the 2% is like less than half a unit.

673
01:02:47,565 --> 01:02:52,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this equation, they only they're being, they're only being asked

674
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:58,759
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce one unit instead of two, and then more of it is as money, but they're getting the same.

675
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:06,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure that you could use that first, the one additional floor.

676
01:03:06,484 --> 01:03:09,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do the two additional floors and split them half and half, right?

677
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:13,850
[SPEAKER_06]: One at 80% and one at 65%.

678
01:03:15,471 --> 01:03:16,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would work.

679
01:03:17,672 --> 01:03:21,055
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not sure that we would let them

680
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:23,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still not following you.

681
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many units are they going to pay?

682
01:03:25,174 --> 01:03:25,594
[SPEAKER_07]: 24-unit building.

683
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:26,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So in this model, 8% of the 24 is 1.95.

684
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one unit.

685
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:28,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 0.95 is cash.

686
01:03:28,656 --> 01:03:29,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a percentage payment.

687
01:03:29,797 --> 01:03:33,199
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the 2% doesn't even make an entire unit.

688
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:36,461
[SPEAKER_01]: 2% of 24 does not even create an entire unit.

689
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:37,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So the net affordable unit gain

690
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:54,043
[SPEAKER_01]: is just one instead of two.

691
01:03:54,563 --> 01:04:13,098
[SPEAKER_11]: But you'll get the cash so you could do you could do one of two things you could probably you could negotiate with the developer instead of doing the fractional payment you'd maybe give the second unit at 65 or you can take the cash for 80 percent and the cash.

692
01:04:13,759 --> 01:04:18,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Right so it's a sort of a unicorn product there aren't that many types of those projects showing up so and then it

693
01:04:19,285 --> 01:04:22,306
[SPEAKER_01]: is it at your discretion to decide?

694
01:04:22,386 --> 01:04:25,467
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give them the gray, they may take it.

695
01:04:25,587 --> 01:04:32,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen fractionals only below 0.5% and above 0.5, you round up.

696
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:40,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may be one of the things where we come out with the consultants may come forward with that one.

697
01:04:40,731 --> 01:04:42,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that's one that makes sense.

698
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're so close to 0.5.

699
01:04:45,092 --> 01:04:48,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're not taking away the option to provide the unit.

700
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they might just want to provide the unit and not feel the cash payment.

701
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:53,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a choice.

702
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,266
[SPEAKER_07]: We weren't mandating a fraction of payment.

703
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:58,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say we haven't reviewed any language yet.

704
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's all hypothetical.

705
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,612
[SPEAKER_11]: They can choose.

706
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:07,075
[SPEAKER_11]: City will always take the unit if you want to take the unit.

707
01:05:08,636 --> 01:05:13,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I've just raised hand in a public meeting to read any emails.

708
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to raise my hand and then it thinks I want to raise my hand.

709
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:23,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes up on screen.

710
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:28,001
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have it set that way, there's a setting to recognize raised hands as actual.

711
01:05:28,021 --> 01:05:28,521
[SPEAKER_04]: That's new.

712
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:46,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

713
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:51,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just want to make sure if there's anybody out there that has something to add.

714
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:56,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else, you wanted me to, the MBTA zoning, and that's where I started to sort of move into that.

715
01:05:57,236 --> 01:06:02,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have, so the reality is, if you look at that area, it's a pretty built out area.

716
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:14,424
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some potential that on the upper right quadrant, there are some buildings that have really large parking lots that under the new zoning, those parking lots could become developable if they wanted to.

717
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:20,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot, there is a big, the lower right is basically all MBTA.

718
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:27,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a project proposed for that shaft cutout out of the MBTA lot.

719
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:30,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Criterion, I don't know if any of you are familiar with them.

720
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,300
[SPEAKER_06]: They've done a bunch with Rivers Edge.

721
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:36,481
[SPEAKER_06]: They have been working with us.

722
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:39,822
[SPEAKER_06]: We changed, we did a plan development district for them.

723
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:42,843
[SPEAKER_06]: We changed the zoning.

724
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:44,584
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a mass change for them.

725
01:06:45,686 --> 01:06:47,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I check in with him periodically.

726
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,492
[SPEAKER_06]: He's still working on it.

727
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:55,909
[SPEAKER_06]: He ran into some issues with the state, with the river and Chapter 91 that has been slowing him down.

728
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,967
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's planning to come.

729
01:06:59,627 --> 01:07:10,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's another parcel over there that, over the years, I've actually heard from a couple different developers interested in it, and we are talking with them.

730
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:14,559
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones who have raised for us this whole issue with the easement.

731
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:21,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently on Route, and I don't remember which is which, there's Route 28 and Route 16, and on one of their borders, they have a state

732
01:07:22,152 --> 01:07:26,535
[SPEAKER_06]: easement that requires a 25-foot setback and on the other, a 20-foot setback.

733
01:07:27,115 --> 01:07:31,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And we required a maximum of a 15-foot setback.

734
01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:33,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of the things that we've been discussing.

735
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:36,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Should they put it forward to the council as they change?

736
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:38,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we put that forward?

737
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:43,926
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually also asked about the certifiable versus certified on the lead.

738
01:07:44,306 --> 01:07:46,207
[SPEAKER_06]: That may have actually been the first time I heard it.

739
01:07:46,247 --> 01:07:47,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to our climate planner and she's like,

740
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:51,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

741
01:07:51,617 --> 01:07:52,637
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to change that.

742
01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:57,059
[SPEAKER_06]: They had one other question about lot coverage that I don't think we're going to get on.

743
01:07:58,459 --> 01:08:07,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is some that's coming and we are expecting that we'll need to do those changes to the MBTA communities.

744
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:09,483
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's kind of, that's it.

745
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:12,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about MBDC briefly.

746
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's what is the makeup of the building types currently in this area?

747
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it mostly commercial?

748
01:08:24,821 --> 01:08:25,541
[SPEAKER_06]: It's real.

749
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:28,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually mostly.

750
01:08:29,965 --> 01:08:33,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say multifamily with some ground floor commercial.

751
01:08:33,949 --> 01:08:36,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually the upper right quadrant is commercial.

752
01:08:36,932 --> 01:08:43,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's a bank, there's 5 Cabot Road, like CHA is going in there, there are offices and stuff up there.

753
01:08:44,258 --> 01:08:47,481
[SPEAKER_06]: The CAPI site, the National Development site.

754
01:08:47,702 --> 01:08:48,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

755
01:08:49,063 --> 01:08:54,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So the left hand, all those small parts, that's station landing.

756
01:08:55,148 --> 01:08:58,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so if you're familiar with station landing, that's what you're looking at, really.

757
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:00,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And Fells Lake Plaza, isn't that included?

758
01:09:00,977 --> 01:09:10,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Where there's potential with CVS's and all those blocks of stores there, as well as stop and shop and side lots, you could potentially build up.

759
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:10,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

760
01:09:11,695 --> 01:09:19,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And that whole area where the stop and shop, et cetera, are we do think has a lot of potential, but that's a lot of what the Wellington transformational study.

761
01:09:19,846 --> 01:09:29,158
[SPEAKER_06]: 1 of the things that we recognize when we first started to look at this area was that it's a very tight thing between traffic transportation.

762
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,083
[SPEAKER_06]: and density and how do you make it all work in a way that makes sense.

763
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:37,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was part of what we wanted to study for.

764
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:42,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also an area with a lot of commercial and some industrial and jobs.

765
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:48,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a tough thing where you want more housing, but you don't want to lose the jobs to housing.

766
01:09:48,492 --> 01:09:49,913
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do you make that all work?

767
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:55,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of what this study is that I have five proposals sitting on the desk that I haven't opened yet.

768
01:09:58,544 --> 01:10:24,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to do anything else on this and then I can explain a little bit the mayor's probably more familiar with MVDC than even I am but I have some I mean we have the history and that did you have a slide or you know it's the area so if you're looking at the upper right quadrant it's the area above that where the porch was yeah the porch restaurant that whole five parcels there and they're building their

769
01:10:26,218 --> 01:10:42,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they have the building permits yet, but they have all the other permissions up to building permit for building a new building, a residential building, and they have one more lot.

770
01:10:42,563 --> 01:11:09,322
[SPEAKER_08]: do you want to do a google map yeah and that'll help you understand what we're talking about yeah they don't pay taxes like the normal parcel would they're part of a pilot agreement between and we never gets 88 of taxes malden gets 12 and then everett um has some monies that are dedicated to them through the original agreement so ted and i sit on the board um they're not too happy with medford right now because

771
01:11:10,002 --> 01:11:35,870
[SPEAKER_08]: the language in the prior agreements say that once 15 years has gone by from the completion of the building, it will fall onto our tax rolls versus stay in the pilot, which was, they said this is kind of a forever thing and we're arguing, obviously, this is not, we weren't giving up this land forever, but the MVDC will be around for quite some time since they're still building.

772
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the early 90s,

773
01:11:38,902 --> 01:11:44,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Late 90s and early 2000s, this whole area was an industrial wasteland, truly.

774
01:11:44,994 --> 01:11:46,316
[SPEAKER_06]: You've seen photos of it.

775
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,182
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a barge in the river.

776
01:12:00,284 --> 01:12:06,369
[SPEAKER_06]: There's everywhere, a HUD loan, a section 108, MVDC was formed to pay back the 108 loan.

777
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:13,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was the first time I got an invoice from HUD asking for an annual payment on this loan.

778
01:12:13,235 --> 01:12:14,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh!

779
01:12:14,736 --> 01:12:19,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And then within like a day, I got an email from Malden saying, have you gotten an invoice from this?

780
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,320
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to send it to us.

781
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,361
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd pay it for you.

782
01:12:21,381 --> 01:12:21,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh!

783
01:12:22,562 --> 01:12:24,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Lovely, that's great.

784
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:30,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are still paying off the loan that was used for the major cleanup that's there.

785
01:12:30,226 --> 01:12:39,250
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever get the chance to get out into River's Edge, the building 200 River's Edge has models and photos and stuff about this.

786
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:44,452
[SPEAKER_06]: John Priato, who was the developer in the end, is really proud of this work and he's really engaged

787
01:12:45,171 --> 01:12:56,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually understand that he was a New York City developer who moved up here and now this is where his offices are and he's actually training his son to take over the business for him.

788
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:58,973
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're pre auto lane associates.

789
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:03,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have been developing these buildings.

790
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:09,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's the dark one sort of in the middle there, that one, that was the first residential.

791
01:13:09,564 --> 01:13:15,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the two commercial buildings that are like office buildings are along the river and the Tufts Boathouse.

792
01:13:15,769 --> 01:13:26,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe it's this commercial building that's just about 15 years old or the residential building that we're talking about how it would start paying taxes directly to Medford.

793
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:33,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then across the street is the building where the porch was, there's a new restaurant getting ready to open in there.

794
01:13:33,351 --> 01:13:39,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of parking and there's residential above and great section up there.

795
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:45,976
[SPEAKER_06]: That's had been surface parking, but they are getting ready to build a residential, a large residential.

796
01:13:45,996 --> 01:13:48,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say 300 ish unit.

797
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:49,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's good.

798
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,293
[SPEAKER_06]: About not up there.

799
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:54,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.

800
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:59,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So the left side is going to be on the order of 300 units.

801
01:13:59,094 --> 01:14:00,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's 250.

802
01:14:02,014 --> 01:14:02,694
[SPEAKER_06]: To keep the park.

803
01:14:02,794 --> 01:14:03,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's right below the park.

804
01:14:04,294 --> 01:14:04,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

805
01:14:04,714 --> 01:14:07,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the right-hand side, they're leaving that vacant.

806
01:14:08,315 --> 01:14:11,156
[SPEAKER_06]: That had always planned to be another office commercial building.

807
01:14:11,696 --> 01:14:15,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And for now, they're just holding, sitting on the land because they're not sure.

808
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:19,657
[SPEAKER_06]: They never had vacancies until the pandemic.

809
01:14:20,177 --> 01:14:23,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they do actually have vacancies in the commercial office building.

810
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're not building another one quite yet.

811
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how why it's an area.

812
01:14:31,887 --> 01:14:33,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Our zoning does not apply there.

813
01:14:33,909 --> 01:14:40,795
[SPEAKER_06]: When they wanted to build this building, the site plan review went through actually the MVDC, which the people who

814
01:14:41,662 --> 01:15:10,816
[SPEAKER_06]: manage the MVDC said to us well we give a lot of courtesy to Medford and the developers we have a wonderful relationship with the owner there so he was like of course we're going to come meet with you what do you want and he met with me and Danielle and we kind of channeled what the planning board would ask for that for there and then it went to the MVDC for approval but he had already incorporated like everything Danielle and I had asked for including she was able there are no inclusionary requirements

815
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:20,436
[SPEAKER_06]: In this area, and the previous inclusionary negotiation were that, like, they were just there was not much there the 10 year.

816
01:15:20,856 --> 01:15:23,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's 10% it was like, 5% for 10 years or something.

817
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:33,532
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically we asked for more affordable.

818
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:35,593
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked to meet our inclusionary zoning.

819
01:15:36,054 --> 01:15:37,814
[SPEAKER_06]: They almost had a heart attack.

820
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:42,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how Danielle negotiated the payment to the affordable housing trust.

821
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:46,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And frankly a lot more affordable housing than they were planning on.

822
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was not a lot.

823
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:51,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's one or two that are deeper.

824
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:58,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

825
01:15:59,218 --> 01:16:02,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's sort of the background of that that area.

826
01:16:02,321 --> 01:16:12,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, their taxes won't come straight to the city, they'll go into this fund, the fund does pay off the loan, and then can pay for other things, and we get some of the money.

827
01:16:12,391 --> 01:16:16,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And then over time, they should come off the tax rolls too.

828
01:16:16,556 --> 01:16:18,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've read the documents, it was very clear to me.

829
01:16:20,374 --> 01:16:24,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just a question about that area.

830
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:33,181
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I don't know if everyone has been over there, but it's the most beautiful park in Medford is just the waterfront.

831
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,042
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so beautifully developed.

832
01:16:35,722 --> 01:16:37,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any way.

833
01:16:39,957 --> 01:16:46,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Connecting better that area with the rest of the city so that the rest of Medford can enjoy that place.

834
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:50,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that those residents can get to the rest of Medford.

835
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:53,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let me come up and show you that.

836
01:16:53,923 --> 01:16:57,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, there's this stuff that goes down under the thing, but there's our dream.

837
01:16:58,045 --> 01:16:59,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it an orange?

838
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:01,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this is how great this developer is.

839
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: He literally.

840
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:06,197
[SPEAKER_06]: called me up and said, I think you should come see.

841
01:17:06,217 --> 01:17:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we could do this path.

842
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:12,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me take you and show you what I'm thinking of.

843
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:18,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And so here, this area, I don't know how well you can zoom in on this, but this is the orange line.

844
01:17:19,081 --> 01:17:24,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is, the orange line goes underground and there's a land bridge here.

845
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:30,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time that he took me, he drove me around to here and we walked in on this.

846
01:17:31,224 --> 01:17:32,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can walk right up to here.

847
01:17:33,355 --> 01:17:36,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was a fence, and he's like, Alicia, I think we should build a path here.

848
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:39,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was an abandoned rail line up here.

849
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:46,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then, the MBTA has started running a commuter rail on here and some freight rails up on this land bridge.

850
01:17:47,023 --> 01:17:51,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would have to figure out how to cross those rail lines.

851
01:17:52,106 --> 01:17:53,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Or did the MBTA put them back on the ground?

852
01:17:53,907 --> 01:17:54,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

853
01:17:54,787 --> 01:17:57,549
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we want to do is a path.

854
01:17:57,649 --> 01:17:59,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So this rail spur exists.

855
01:17:59,731 --> 01:18:02,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've talked to every developer along here.

856
01:18:02,112 --> 01:18:08,916
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually comes all the way along here and wraps around down to Riverside Ave, or almost quite.

857
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:11,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I have talked to every developer.

858
01:18:11,838 --> 01:18:15,620
[SPEAKER_06]: 40B is open to this and willing to participate.

859
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:23,824
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys just did the Bulletin Woods, and they actually redesigned how they were addressing this edge so that they could be open to a path there.

860
01:18:23,844 --> 01:18:26,626
[SPEAKER_06]: DJs heard me and understood.

861
01:18:27,113 --> 01:18:30,274
[SPEAKER_06]: but they have a fence and they would probably keep their fence anyhow.

862
01:18:30,474 --> 01:18:33,855
[SPEAKER_06]: On their side, there's a wetland along there that makes it a little tough.

863
01:18:34,435 --> 01:18:35,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this is a car wash.

864
01:18:35,536 --> 01:18:37,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would love to have that.

865
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:41,998
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it the orange line connector.

866
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:47,519
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing is frankly- Was there talk of an overpass too in the past?

867
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:52,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did get some money from the Gaming Commission to actually do

868
01:18:53,586 --> 01:18:58,951
[SPEAKER_06]: A feasibility study, but the staff person who had requested that, and we're going to do that.

869
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:00,652
[SPEAKER_06]: She ended up leaving.

870
01:19:00,672 --> 01:19:05,437
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got more money to be a bigger job.

871
01:19:07,538 --> 01:19:11,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we haven't had anybody with the bandwidth to take that project back up.

872
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:17,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's it's one of that I'm kind of passionate about because it was it was really it's an exciting project.

873
01:19:17,863 --> 01:19:23,326
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd love it would really connect this whole neighborhood of the river and John's idea.

874
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:25,947
[SPEAKER_06]: The developer was that we would put red light there.

875
01:19:26,703 --> 01:19:28,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would make it easy for people.

876
01:19:28,224 --> 01:19:33,025
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, people could cross, and we could connect right over to my property.

877
01:19:33,345 --> 01:19:38,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that whole neighborhood, all those people could come over here and access the river on my property.

878
01:19:39,627 --> 01:19:42,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever hear that from a developer?

879
01:19:42,128 --> 01:19:43,148
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a nice guy.

880
01:19:43,288 --> 01:19:44,669
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a good developer.

881
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:47,469
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was his idea.

882
01:19:47,489 --> 01:19:49,310
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, we could put in a crosswalk.

883
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:50,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be wonderful.

884
01:19:51,511 --> 01:19:54,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And he would help pay for some of it, a little bit.

885
01:19:56,348 --> 01:19:58,210
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, sorry.

886
01:19:58,570 --> 01:19:59,691
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's fine.

887
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that one.

888
01:20:00,912 --> 01:20:01,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops, sorry.

889
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:02,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to run.

890
01:20:02,113 --> 01:20:02,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a 6.15.

891
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:03,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

892
01:20:03,054 --> 01:20:03,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

893
01:20:03,735 --> 01:20:04,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to meet you.

894
01:20:05,056 --> 01:20:05,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

895
01:20:05,557 --> 01:20:06,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I love your resolution.

896
01:20:06,558 --> 01:20:07,438
[SPEAKER_06]: See you later.

897
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:08,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.

898
01:20:11,462 --> 01:20:13,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then the paths do connect down.

899
01:20:13,664 --> 01:20:14,705
[SPEAKER_06]: They go under Route 16.

900
01:20:14,825 --> 01:20:17,067
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't go between Route 16 and the river.

901
01:20:23,025 --> 01:20:24,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, from, yeah, just go south.

902
01:20:25,126 --> 01:20:26,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So the paths are lovely.

903
01:20:26,347 --> 01:20:29,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they cross under there, and then it stops.

904
01:20:30,209 --> 01:20:33,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So that developer, Criterion, is where they, that there.

905
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:35,972
[SPEAKER_06]: He is, he's actually a partner of John Priattel's.

906
01:20:35,992 --> 01:20:39,774
[SPEAKER_06]: He is perfectly, he is ready to build his section of the path there.

907
01:20:40,454 --> 01:20:45,657
[SPEAKER_06]: We have designs, John Priattel actually paid Tetra Tech to design the path all the way down to the end.

908
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:51,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have been working through the permitting process, and

909
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:56,082
[SPEAKER_06]: MassDOT, we even got an earmark to build it.

910
01:20:56,762 --> 01:21:04,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got to tell you, when MassDOT manages a project, it takes like three times longer and it's twice as expensive.

911
01:21:04,845 --> 01:21:08,226
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep telling me though that I don't have to worry about how expensive it is.

912
01:21:08,286 --> 01:21:09,747
[SPEAKER_06]: They are going to build it.

913
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,768
[SPEAKER_06]: But we

914
01:21:12,626 --> 01:21:14,047
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's taking a really long time.

915
01:21:14,247 --> 01:21:17,288
[SPEAKER_06]: If you scroll down to the end, you can see that there's a path that ebbs.

916
01:21:17,868 --> 01:21:23,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So John actually paid for the design and the construction of all the rest of that path.

917
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:26,032
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not even on his property.

918
01:21:27,053 --> 01:21:28,413
[SPEAKER_06]: He used to maintain it too.

919
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:31,715
[SPEAKER_06]: But now he's gotten the DCR to take it over.

920
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:33,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would be the missing link.

921
01:21:35,536 --> 01:21:35,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

922
01:21:36,297 --> 01:21:36,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

923
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:38,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I sound so wistful.

924
01:21:38,884 --> 01:21:43,326
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those projects I've been working on for like six years, and this is ridiculous.

925
01:21:43,727 --> 01:21:44,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds that way.

926
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:47,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I was passionate about it.

927
01:21:47,389 --> 01:21:49,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

928
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:52,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have a plan.

929
01:21:52,071 --> 01:21:57,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you know under Route 28, there's a boardwalk on the Somerville side.

930
01:21:57,595 --> 01:22:04,959
[SPEAKER_06]: We have fully designed the boardwalk on the Medford side to go under Route 28 there by Assembly Row.

931
01:22:06,948 --> 01:22:07,910
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fully designed.

932
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, again, a mass dot project.

933
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:10,715
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the tip.

934
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:14,462
[SPEAKER_00]: It is supposed to be advertised and go out.

935
01:22:14,822 --> 01:22:18,309
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk from Costco to across subred right there.

936
01:22:19,062 --> 01:22:20,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

937
01:22:20,563 --> 01:22:22,664
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Amelia Earhart Dam.

938
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:27,166
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I'll walk out of there instead of driving out of there, because that place is amazing.

939
01:22:27,287 --> 01:22:29,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll park on the other side.

940
01:22:30,248 --> 01:22:31,909
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Amelia Earhart Dam.

941
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:34,230
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a new bike path, though.

942
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:39,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The northern strand goes out, goes into Costco, into the back of that there.

943
01:22:39,473 --> 01:22:40,754
[SPEAKER_06]: My son has taken that.

944
01:22:40,874 --> 01:22:41,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

945
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:41,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

946
01:22:41,754 --> 01:22:43,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the bike path?

947
01:22:43,455 --> 01:22:44,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the other side.

948
01:22:47,684 --> 01:22:53,787
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to the north, where it says Revere Peach Parkway, there, over on the right side.

949
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:54,827
[SPEAKER_06]: You see it there?

950
01:22:54,847 --> 01:22:54,927
[SPEAKER_06]: That?

951
01:22:55,027 --> 01:22:55,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

952
01:22:55,327 --> 01:22:59,449
[SPEAKER_06]: One time he was like, if I bike there, would you come pick me up?

953
01:22:59,489 --> 01:23:02,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, you have to bike back out of that shopping center.

954
01:23:02,591 --> 01:23:06,352
[SPEAKER_06]: You find a place outside of that shopping center, and I will come pick you up.

955
01:23:09,758 --> 01:23:16,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's the Amelia Earhart dam is actually really important to this to the city of Medford for climate reasons.

956
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:29,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it prevents so this this whole area in that green and everything used to be title and used to be salt marshes and that dam makes us a freshwater river.

957
01:23:30,243 --> 01:23:35,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And it prevents storm surge, and it prevents storm surge from coming and flooding Medford.

958
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:39,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one of our concerns with sea level rise is that it will get overtopped.

959
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:44,971
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another project that we work with as a region on that.

960
01:23:44,991 --> 01:23:46,251
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

961
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there other things?

962
01:23:51,087 --> 01:23:54,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I made your meeting go really, really long.

963
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:55,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm quite the talker.

964
01:23:55,429 --> 01:23:58,090
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really helpful.

965
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:00,631
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of good information.

966
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:01,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for coming.

967
01:24:01,592 --> 01:24:08,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Besides the zoning, is there anything else that is helpful to know about policy or plan implementation?

968
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:20,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in the big picture that a DTS probably talked about, we have looked at one of the parcels, the city owns overall.

969
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:24,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's a Medford square RFP, which I feel like is left.

970
01:24:24,509 --> 01:24:26,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know bothers me that it's up.

971
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:29,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It's making me fuzzy lean forward.

972
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:47,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've looked at in general all the parcels that the city owns and which ones are vacant and which might be developable and before DT Barbara took some nonprofit developers around to look at them and to start to understand what might make sense as being buildable.

973
01:24:47,912 --> 01:24:54,995
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that I've conveyed to the mayor over the years is that's how we could participate in building affordable housing.

974
01:24:55,135 --> 01:24:56,756
[SPEAKER_06]: is providing the land for it.

975
01:24:57,836 --> 01:25:00,097
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is something that has happened.

976
01:25:00,177 --> 01:25:03,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some of those developers continue to reach out to Aditi from time to time.

977
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:16,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, Danny LeBlanc is pretty serious, I think, about one of the, it's not actually even a city-owned parcel, but the two that he's been interested in most recently are privately owned, that he is coming.

978
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:22,367
[SPEAKER_06]: He used to be with the Somerville Community Corporation, so he is a very experienced nonprofit developer.

979
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:29,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Working mostly on Maldon right now, not the city, but just not government, but that area.

980
01:25:30,309 --> 01:25:32,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's looking at a project in Medford.

981
01:25:35,114 --> 01:25:39,498
[SPEAKER_06]: But then he might come to this board and say, can you help with it?

982
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:41,680
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been talking to us about the zoning piece of it.

983
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Medford Square RFP

984
01:25:45,711 --> 01:25:53,383
[SPEAKER_06]: This went out to bid these parcels and I will say that the blue one is right below City Hall there.

985
01:25:54,004 --> 01:26:00,614
[SPEAKER_06]: We did say that if the developer has a good treatment of the parking lot behind City Hall.

986
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:10,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And can replicate City Hall staff parking on these parcels that we are open to it expanding closer to City Hall.

987
01:26:10,892 --> 01:26:21,255
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the proposals we have actually does use that and puts a plaza between that building and City Hall and has just a busway through it, which I kind of.

988
01:26:21,847 --> 01:26:22,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked that.

989
01:26:24,209 --> 01:26:46,704
[SPEAKER_06]: We suggested that the paint might be best served as a parking garage that serves the theater, the city hall, and that these residential buildings might have parking with them, but that maybe more of the parking is over here on the side against the highway to allow greater density on the sites that are nicer and closer to the river.

990
01:26:48,085 --> 01:26:54,927
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the big pushbacks that we have had is that you can almost see the word senior center in the bottom right there.

991
01:26:56,327 --> 01:26:58,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Seniors are very concerned right now.

992
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:01,468
[SPEAKER_06]: They all park in that big yellow lot.

993
01:27:02,428 --> 01:27:05,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm told that they use 40 spots a day.

994
01:27:05,129 --> 01:27:16,231
[SPEAKER_06]: The senior center director has been tracking them and asking people to sign in and say if they've driven a car and where they park, so she can give us proof that they're using that.

995
01:27:16,802 --> 01:27:24,705
[SPEAKER_06]: They have 15 dedicated spots, but she shows us that they're using 40 a day because don't they have parking behind the senior center?

996
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:25,906
[SPEAKER_06]: They have almost none.

997
01:27:26,126 --> 01:27:29,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost all of that parking belongs to that high rise.

998
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they have a couple of higher handicap spots.

999
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:34,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1000
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,090
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be a total of 5.

1001
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:41,154
[SPEAKER_11]: In your center spot, they're using the parking lot across with a with a pop-up park.

1002
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:41,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1003
01:27:41,534 --> 01:27:41,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1004
01:27:41,974 --> 01:27:42,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1005
01:27:42,214 --> 01:27:42,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1006
01:27:42,755 --> 01:27:46,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Are the housing authority tenants actually using all the parking that the housing authority has?

1007
01:27:47,398 --> 01:27:49,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So the housing authority does not.

1008
01:27:50,461 --> 01:27:54,584
[SPEAKER_06]: They are required to have it for their number of units by our zoning.

1009
01:27:54,824 --> 01:28:01,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you know, that also plays into their funding through the federal government that they're compliant with zoning.

1010
01:28:01,549 --> 01:28:03,831
[SPEAKER_06]: So it gets they're actually doing a major renovation.

1011
01:28:03,851 --> 01:28:04,951
[SPEAKER_06]: They're adding 20 units.

1012
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:12,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've talked to them about, we'd love to see an agreement where the senior center can use some of that parking.

1013
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:19,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And they basically said they cannot do that until their project is done because of their federal financing and stuff.

1014
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:25,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, during their construction, they're actually occupying a lot of their parking with construction vehicles.

1015
01:28:27,548 --> 01:28:31,172
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a fascinating project, but that aside, so the senior center.

1016
01:28:32,054 --> 01:28:38,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pushback we get is that seniors want to be able to park very close to walk a distance.

1017
01:28:38,382 --> 01:28:40,044
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to be on an open lot.

1018
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:42,266
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to park in a in a.

1019
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:46,028
[SPEAKER_06]: parking garage, that makes them very nervous.

1020
01:28:46,948 --> 01:28:48,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a lot of the difficulty.

1021
01:28:49,688 --> 01:29:01,571
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, we look at this large lot and say, how do we not develop more commercial or we want to do some ground floor commercial and residential because people want to park and go to the senior center.

1022
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:06,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just doesn't, there's a dissonance there that's pretty difficult to overcome.

1023
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:12,273
[SPEAKER_11]: But it makes sense to just, I'm sorry, it's a generational thing to be like, I just, I think the problem goes

1024
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:27,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was going to say, would it make sense to just hold on to that yellow line for until at least until the House and Authority project is completed so that then that changes our thinking about what's possible?

1025
01:29:27,943 --> 01:29:32,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will say that doing one of these projects takes a very long time.

1026
01:29:32,226 --> 01:29:34,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So we put it out to bid.

1027
01:29:34,668 --> 01:29:36,970
[SPEAKER_06]: We got proposals back at the end of December.

1028
01:29:37,811 --> 01:29:41,474
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a team reviewing the proposals, and then we're going to interview the companies.

1029
01:29:41,981 --> 01:29:43,902
[SPEAKER_06]: with a plan to make an award.

1030
01:29:44,423 --> 01:29:53,570
[SPEAKER_06]: We expect that it'll take, from right now, two months before we have a decision on who is getting it.

1031
01:29:55,271 --> 01:30:09,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it'll take probably, I was saying this to a different group that included our land use lawyer, and she kept nodding at everything I said, and I was like, sure, my timing sounds good, and she's like, yeah, so I'm gonna repeat myself.

1032
01:30:10,918 --> 01:30:18,805
[SPEAKER_06]: another four months on the order of to negotiate an actual contract to the point where you have something signed.

1033
01:30:19,325 --> 01:30:23,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they do a design that they have to go through site plan review.

1034
01:30:24,049 --> 01:30:28,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to change the zoning to make it doable, because the zoning is ridiculous.

1035
01:30:28,453 --> 01:30:37,241
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's already, we think in the overall, we had Medford Square on the list, that by March, we should have a feel for what we want to hear.

1036
01:30:37,801 --> 01:30:42,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we'll be changing the zoning anyhow, regardless of who will allow it.

1037
01:30:43,365 --> 01:30:44,986
[SPEAKER_11]: So how many months for the planning?

1038
01:30:45,006 --> 01:31:02,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we think that the site... Well, yeah, between the amount of time... When I've watched these guys from other developers have their zoning, how long it takes them to come to site plan review, to work through the site plan review process takes... It could take three or four months.

1039
01:31:03,385 --> 01:31:08,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But them getting to site plan review may take them four to six months to get there in the first place.

1040
01:31:09,449 --> 01:31:14,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're talking more than a year from now before they've been through site plan review.

1041
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:16,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they start construction documents.

1042
01:31:16,954 --> 01:31:18,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That could take them a year.

1043
01:31:19,115 --> 01:31:22,797
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also what's called Chapter 91 along the river.

1044
01:31:22,817 --> 01:31:25,479
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some fingers of Chapter 91.

1045
01:31:25,959 --> 01:31:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe they're going to have to go through NEPA permitting.

1046
01:31:28,521 --> 01:31:29,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We think that's another year to 18 months.

1047
01:31:32,628 --> 01:31:36,169
[SPEAKER_06]: We think it might be 3 years before there are shovels in the ground on this project.

1048
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:42,931
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we're, I mean, how long before the housing project is completed?

1049
01:31:42,951 --> 01:31:47,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're 6, 9 months.

1050
01:31:48,673 --> 01:31:56,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be a little longer than that because they are renovating while the building is occupied 2 floors at a time.

1051
01:31:56,755 --> 01:31:58,596
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, because I just wonder, like,

1052
01:31:59,563 --> 01:32:07,065
[SPEAKER_11]: To put a forever building on this site that is smaller than what we could build because of a project that overlapped by a few months.

1053
01:32:07,485 --> 01:32:08,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure that it was.

1054
01:32:08,865 --> 01:32:10,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I just said that we're getting the pushback.

1055
01:32:10,765 --> 01:32:11,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1056
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:11,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1057
01:32:12,246 --> 01:32:21,908
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that we have the right city council right now and the right mayor to move forward with a good project on this site.

1058
01:32:22,731 --> 01:32:30,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I will say that I've, I've looked at some different ideas for this and there's 1 idea where you have a hard building the whole way around on that curve.

1059
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:32,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can look at it and you know, I'm not sure I like that.

1060
01:32:32,773 --> 01:32:38,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And you look at an idea that is a good size building, but has some open space along the river and stuff.

1061
01:32:38,915 --> 01:32:43,736
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, oh, is that open spaces that service parking or is that Plaza like.

1062
01:32:44,496 --> 01:32:46,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let's fill in the blanklets.

1063
01:32:46,657 --> 01:32:48,937
[SPEAKER_06]: That could evolve over the next 3 years, right?

1064
01:32:48,977 --> 01:32:51,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly how that space is used.

1065
01:32:52,098 --> 01:32:54,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there are a couple of different ideas.

1066
01:32:55,839 --> 01:32:58,100
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the proposals came in with the parking garage.

1067
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,381
[SPEAKER_06]: One came in with 3 buildings.

1068
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:03,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's all negotiable right now.

1069
01:33:05,113 --> 01:33:14,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So question about the senior center, are they open to being tenants at any of the newly developed buildings?

1070
01:33:14,697 --> 01:33:19,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not something that we really put forward, but it is an intriguing idea.

1071
01:33:19,479 --> 01:33:25,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what if you actually built a new senior center in the building and then potentially use their space for parking?

1072
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:29,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they have the lovely Peace Garden right there now.

1073
01:33:29,663 --> 01:33:30,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1074
01:33:30,744 --> 01:33:31,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be difficult.

1075
01:33:32,932 --> 01:33:44,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, another question is whether any of the proposals take into consideration the need for more office space for City Hall.

1076
01:33:44,222 --> 01:33:47,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Or any kind of municipal space.

1077
01:33:47,605 --> 01:33:49,847
[SPEAKER_06]: We've sort of pushed for that a little bit.

1078
01:33:50,327 --> 01:33:51,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't tell you off the top of my head.

1079
01:33:51,968 --> 01:33:55,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you, I looked at them very thoroughly the day before I left for vacation.

1080
01:33:56,749 --> 01:33:59,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got back on Monday and I have not looked at them since then.

1081
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:02,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Or any civic space.

1082
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:08,551
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that we asked for were more affordable housing than inclusionary zoning.

1083
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:10,632
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked for civic space.

1084
01:34:11,132 --> 01:34:13,052
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked for parking.

1085
01:34:13,072 --> 01:34:15,713
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked for creative solutions to parking.

1086
01:34:16,273 --> 01:34:20,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we do have the theater and we want people to be able to come and use the theater.

1087
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:28,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Theater, other than Wednesday nights, actually overlaps very well with City Hall, but they need a lot more parking than City Hall does.

1088
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:32,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So we asked them to be creative with that.

1089
01:34:33,682 --> 01:34:46,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're sort of starting, and part of this is we then need to interview them and kind of dig into what are they actually, I might, is it we're gonna end up with a version that is not quite either proposal, but kind of a mush of the two.

1090
01:34:46,626 --> 01:34:47,766
[SPEAKER_06]: One had,

1091
01:34:51,663 --> 01:34:56,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I saw 1 of the slides and something about 150 housing units.

1092
01:34:56,766 --> 01:34:59,607
[SPEAKER_06]: They both had significantly more housing units than that.

1093
01:34:59,887 --> 01:35:01,508
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a floor that we put in.

1094
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:03,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 1 had at least 250 or 300 and the other had 500 units.

1095
01:35:09,731 --> 01:35:23,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And we asked for more studio one-bedroom units, smaller units, like this says, looking for graduate students and seniors in a down size, and they were both responsive to that as well.

1096
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:28,367
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of, when we did a walkthrough, said, you know, we're not really looking for luxury housing.

1097
01:35:29,088 --> 01:35:32,171
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, we don't want 100% affordable here.

1098
01:35:33,673 --> 01:35:41,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we need tenants who are going to support all these businesses, the restaurants, the cafes, a grocery store.

1099
01:35:41,817 --> 01:35:48,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we need some of the people that have the disposable income to be able to support these things.

1100
01:35:50,181 --> 01:35:53,483
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one of the, we were looking for in the blend.

1101
01:35:54,685 --> 01:35:57,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And we very much asked for ground floor commercial.

1102
01:35:57,527 --> 01:36:05,194
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever stand at the hotel at night and you look towards Medford Square, you kind of go, that's safe.

1103
01:36:05,554 --> 01:36:07,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I want to walk down there?

1104
01:36:07,175 --> 01:36:08,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so dark.

1105
01:36:09,117 --> 01:36:15,022
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you walk a block and a half, you walk two blocks and you're like, oh, actually, I'm really glad I'm here.

1106
01:36:15,042 --> 01:36:16,103
[SPEAKER_06]: This is lovely.

1107
01:36:16,163 --> 01:36:17,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are businesses and restaurants.

1108
01:36:18,244 --> 01:36:22,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it seemed to us that having some businesses lining that

1109
01:36:23,266 --> 01:36:34,756
[SPEAKER_06]: so that people would be drawn from the hotel, which is usually quite full, into Medford Square would actually be a really nice thing to be doing and would really help the whole area.

1110
01:36:35,597 --> 01:36:36,878
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the circulation?

1111
01:36:36,898 --> 01:36:43,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We said to them that the circulation is completely on the table.

1112
01:36:44,145 --> 01:36:48,569
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been working with the DPW commissioner who's completely open to real mining roads.

1113
01:36:49,293 --> 01:36:53,799
[SPEAKER_06]: To changing the traffic flow on the directional ways.

1114
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:57,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so that we're very open to that.

1115
01:36:59,065 --> 01:37:01,308
[SPEAKER_06]: 1 of the proposals I think really took that to heart.

1116
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:06,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's something that we need to work through is exactly how would that work.

1117
01:37:08,867 --> 01:37:14,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, so I'm actually talking with the consultant tomorrow, and we're talking sort of strategy and how to do this.

1118
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:31,179
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been asked to share the proposal, and I've said not until I've talked to the consultant, but my instinct is to not share them with the public until we get to interview both companies so that neither of them has the opposing, the other group's proposal.

1119
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:36,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after we've interviewed them would be the point where we would share it all with the public.

1120
01:37:36,942 --> 01:37:37,543
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.

1121
01:37:38,804 --> 01:37:39,585
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a push.

1122
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:41,606
[SPEAKER_06]: People really want to see it and want to see the meeting.

1123
01:37:41,666 --> 01:37:45,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling that hurts our negotiation place if we do that.

1124
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.

1125
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:51,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to go pick up my daughter.

1126
01:37:51,856 --> 01:37:59,983
[SPEAKER_06]: City Hall is open until 730 on Wednesday and I don't actually have another meeting tonight.

1127
01:38:00,023 --> 01:38:00,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

1128
01:38:01,044 --> 01:38:02,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I enjoyed it.

1129
01:38:02,165 --> 01:38:02,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1130
01:38:06,317 --> 01:38:07,838
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, should I turn it back to you guys?

1131
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:10,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any other questions?

1132
01:38:12,141 --> 01:38:14,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question.

1133
01:38:14,522 --> 01:38:24,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys talk about, when you were talking about the zoning changes, you mentioned when the discussion will be about single-family zoning districts.

1134
01:38:24,688 --> 01:38:29,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we talked about the timing, and I think you actually missed the Monday meeting where

1135
01:38:31,474 --> 01:38:32,814
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't mean North Medford?

1136
01:38:33,255 --> 01:38:34,555
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was there.

1137
01:38:35,675 --> 01:38:39,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So we talked about that and that's coming January and February.

1138
01:38:39,636 --> 01:38:47,539
[SPEAKER_07]: But that would be good for any input from this body about what do you think would make sense?

1139
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a date for that?

1140
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:51,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have dates for the meetings.

1141
01:38:54,016 --> 01:38:58,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We should put them on the zoning website.

1142
01:39:00,318 --> 01:39:03,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the January 15th one staying January 15th?

1143
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:11,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So we actually have a community development board on January 15th, and we're going to do a public hearing on Salem Street on the 22nd.

1144
01:39:11,301 --> 01:39:12,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we still on track to do that?

1145
01:39:12,701 --> 01:39:13,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have to apply.

1146
01:39:17,289 --> 01:39:20,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote it myself, so hopefully it's good enough.

1147
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:20,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

1148
01:39:22,092 --> 01:39:27,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So the public hearing on Salem Street is going to be January 22nd at this community development board.

1149
01:39:27,174 --> 01:39:27,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And Greensboro.

1150
01:39:27,954 --> 01:39:28,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And Greensboro.

1151
01:39:30,316 --> 01:39:37,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you want, like, the DC could send those to you, but if they're not on that website, we should get those in the next, let's say, next day or so.

1152
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:43,962
[SPEAKER_06]: January 15th is a public, is the city council zoning meeting.

1153
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,510
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think Danielle and I can be at that one.

1154
01:39:48,051 --> 01:39:54,432
[SPEAKER_06]: January 29th is the other one on the neighborhoods and the single family.

1155
01:39:55,372 --> 01:40:00,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And then February 12th and 26th is when we're going to do multifamily at the City Council.

1156
01:40:00,713 --> 01:40:01,173
[SPEAKER_06]: January 29th.

1157
01:40:01,213 --> 01:40:02,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And then February 12th and February 26th.

1158
01:40:14,108 --> 01:40:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just to be transparent, we are meeting with the City Council Vice President and President and the consultants offline, like weekly, and emailing with them so that by the time we're going to the public meetings, we've hashed out a lot of stuff on this.

1159
01:40:28,816 --> 01:40:30,077
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking public input.

1160
01:40:30,117 --> 01:40:31,678
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to hear what people have to say.

1161
01:40:31,698 --> 01:40:38,281
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are, like, you can't do this kind of dramatic zoning in like two meetings.

1162
01:40:38,502 --> 01:40:41,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having, you know, additional meetings

1163
01:40:41,543 --> 01:40:49,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the 115 City Council zoning meeting, that's the same night as the Community Development Board meeting?

1164
01:40:49,446 --> 01:40:49,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.

1165
01:40:49,947 --> 01:40:51,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a conflict.

1166
01:40:52,167 --> 01:40:53,268
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know how to resolve.

1167
01:40:53,348 --> 01:40:54,268
[SPEAKER_07]: We just don't have enough.

1168
01:40:54,628 --> 01:40:56,369
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of our standing meeting dates.

1169
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:57,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1170
01:40:57,930 --> 01:41:06,033
[SPEAKER_07]: They departed from their meeting dates, and I'm stuck to mine because when I departed last year, I caused conflicts.

1171
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:10,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I will say that that is the Community Development Board meeting where we are hearing

1172
01:41:11,415 --> 01:41:16,920
[SPEAKER_06]: We are hoping it will be the final hearing on the tough storm and a 21 St.

1173
01:41:18,161 --> 01:41:23,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Clair, which is a shelter for MV.

1174
01:41:23,306 --> 01:41:26,269
[SPEAKER_06]: DV, domestic violence.

1175
01:41:26,389 --> 01:41:27,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

1176
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:28,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1177
01:41:28,671 --> 01:41:29,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So domestic violence shelter.

1178
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:32,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And so both of those have been very, very controversial.

1179
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:45,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're aware of the tough storm project, so that we're hoping will free up a lot of housing in Medford for families and Somerville by taking students out of apartments and putting them in a dorm.

1180
01:41:46,725 --> 01:41:50,387
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is very big and the neighborhood doesn't like it.

1181
01:41:51,847 --> 01:41:54,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not anything we can do.

1182
01:41:54,368 --> 01:41:58,410
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have any leverages of Dover Amendment protected use.

1183
01:41:58,977 --> 01:42:02,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, conforms with height is actually lower than what's allowed.

1184
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:08,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all kinds of little weird things in our zoning that allows that.

1185
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:12,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it a for-profit student or developer?

1186
01:42:12,423 --> 01:42:21,927
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the interesting thing is it is, but it's on Tufts property and Tufts will be retaking the complete ownership of the building after it's built.

1187
01:42:22,925 --> 01:42:25,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not really understanding.

1188
01:42:25,066 --> 01:42:30,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was like, they're still going to have them manage it, but it's on, because we asked our lawyer about it.

1189
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:38,816
[SPEAKER_06]: She said it is on Tufts property and they are going to retake complete ownership afterwards and Tufts students are going to live there.

1190
01:42:40,037 --> 01:42:42,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, it's not even graduate, it's juniors and seniors.

1191
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:48,823
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, this is a Tufts project, even if there's a for-profit developer involved.

1192
01:42:50,488 --> 01:42:52,349
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be like a trend I've seen.

1193
01:42:52,969 --> 01:42:58,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It should absolutely be housing their undergraduate students.

1194
01:42:59,212 --> 01:43:05,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's nuts that you could have like 19 year olds living in the neighborhoods.

1195
01:43:06,815 --> 01:43:12,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, it's the parents of not 12 year olds, but 20 year olds who have an apartment.

1196
01:43:12,138 --> 01:43:14,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and they're following better means.

1197
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:14,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1198
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pleasantly surprised by the tough students.

1199
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,841
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very, very low key.

1200
01:43:21,141 --> 01:43:22,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you live in that neighborhood?

1201
01:43:22,322 --> 01:43:22,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.

1202
01:43:22,622 --> 01:43:26,044
[SPEAKER_12]: I live on Woodbine, right behind Elliot Pearson School.

1203
01:43:26,164 --> 01:43:28,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1204
01:43:29,647 --> 01:43:30,728
[SPEAKER_07]: My neighbors want to help me.

1205
01:43:31,608 --> 01:43:33,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so upset.

1206
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:37,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle lived in- I mean, I break them in every year.

1207
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:40,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the noise ordinance?

1208
01:43:40,154 --> 01:43:40,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1209
01:43:40,614 --> 01:43:41,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Calling.

1210
01:43:44,757 --> 01:43:47,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year, every August, they had to learn.

1211
01:43:54,333 --> 01:44:11,256
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was curious to know the ratio of a lot to the building on it, is the easiest way to visually look at the assessor's maps or crunch numbers through the assessor's pages?

1212
01:44:11,796 --> 01:44:13,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So like what's the coverage ratio?

1213
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:29,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclosure of ADUs in mind, so I just like to look around and kind of be like, what are some, like, especially share ADU information with certain lots or owners, but.

1214
01:44:30,293 --> 01:44:42,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So the ADU regulations should be promulgated by February when this goes into effect.

1215
01:44:42,616 --> 01:44:44,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think they're taking public comment on them.

1216
01:44:45,688 --> 01:44:49,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not certain if they are.

1217
01:44:50,330 --> 01:45:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there was a comment period and there was a forum and there was a comment period and then they were going to either make changes not similar to the META guidelines, which I guess now are going to be regulations per.

1218
01:45:06,979 --> 01:45:08,360
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a legal case today.

1219
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:10,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually got the KP law memo on that that I skimmed

1220
01:45:17,163 --> 01:45:18,984
[SPEAKER_06]: It came in at 515.

1221
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know of anything.

1222
01:45:20,224 --> 01:45:20,845
[SPEAKER_06]: GIS.

1223
01:45:21,245 --> 01:45:21,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1224
01:45:21,605 --> 01:45:21,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1225
01:45:22,005 --> 01:45:22,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Just look at maps.

1226
01:45:22,726 --> 01:45:27,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyond the assessor's database.

1227
01:45:27,548 --> 01:45:35,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I just think in my neighborhood, there's a lot of houses on really big blocks, and I'm like, oh, I want to let all of them know about ADS.

1228
01:45:36,013 --> 01:45:40,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's one of my, I just look around, and I'm like, this seems like prime

1229
01:45:40,798 --> 01:45:42,439
[SPEAKER_01]: They should just know about it.

1230
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:45,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, we don't have the setbacks.

1231
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:47,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know where the setbacks will be at.

1232
01:45:53,949 --> 01:45:56,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm forwarding what we got.

1233
01:45:56,252 --> 01:46:01,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So KP Law will sometimes write an e-update, a memo.

1234
01:46:02,138 --> 01:46:06,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I've asked in the past if we can share these, and they say yes, they put these out for public consumption.

1235
01:46:06,823 --> 01:46:11,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm forwarding it to you, and then you can share it with the board if you want.

1236
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:14,192
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the MBTA decision.

1237
01:46:14,832 --> 01:46:17,234
[SPEAKER_06]: that came out yesterday, today?

1238

[SPEAKER_06]: Today.

1242
01:46:19,596 --> 01:46:24,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then they came with their update pretty darn fast there.

1243
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got it at 5.15.

1244
01:46:28,523 --> 01:46:30,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Nina got it at 5.

1245
01:46:31,145 --> 01:46:32,126
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not bad.

1246
01:46:34,448 --> 01:46:35,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything else?

1247
01:46:36,149 --> 01:46:37,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else have any questions?

1248
01:46:39,135 --> 01:46:39,335
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1249
01:46:40,016 --> 01:46:43,798
