235
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that in the past councils, this has been entertained.

236
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe several councils ago, Councilor Camuso, Councilor Miyako had considered moving to meeting

[SPEAKER_06]: three weeks and then the fourth week of the month being for Committee of the Whole.

[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scott Felder.

250
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:44,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank Councilor Baez for bringing this forward.

251
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:54,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that, just to make it clear, I know that I did get a few phone calls in regards, and I appreciate this going to subcommittee, because I think it is something that's important that's being vetted.

252
00:14:54,675 --> 00:15:04,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the fear is that will we get enough business done in two meetings a month?

253
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And the biggest question is really,

254
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:13,341
[SPEAKER_03]: The ability for again, which was said many times to the people's forum that.

255
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:19,985
[SPEAKER_03]: gives people a chance every week to come to the podium that have to express a concern or an issue that comes before them.

256
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:24,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the, these are some of the topics we'll talk about during the subcommittee.

257
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:35,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this is getting the ball rolling and making sure that we have deep dialogue to make sure that residents get involved and attend that subcommittee.

258
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it's, when we,

259
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:39,506
[SPEAKER_03]: know, share your concerns.

260
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:56,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I've received a few phone calls and a few emails in regards to the fear of losing that venue where a resident has a place to speak on a weekly basis.

261
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I've

262
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:10,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to the subcommittee meeting and welcome all the residents that emailed me and called that had concerns to come out and share your concerns and that, you know, I think are valid.

263
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:18,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also understand, coach, Councilor Beas is, Vice President Beas is, you know, thought process to get that dialogue going.

264
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:19,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

265
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:21,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Any discussion?

266
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:27,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, on a motion by Councilor Beas, seconded by Councilor Knight.

267
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:30,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

268
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:32,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

269
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:33,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

270
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:33,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

271
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:33,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

272
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:35,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

273
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:35,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

274
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:36,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

275
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:37,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

276
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:38,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

277
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:40,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

278
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:59,606
[SPEAKER_12]: 22011 offered by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Bears, be it resolved by the members of the committee that the rules of the Memphis City Council be updated to strike the following committees.

279
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:07,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Rule 34, after the organization of the council, the president of the council should appoint members to the following committees.

280
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Committee of the whole on finance and budgets to consist of

281
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:20,234
[SPEAKER_12]: a committee of the whole meeting wherein all members of the city council meet with the president, provide a chairperson.

282
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

283
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:32,898
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, do you have a brief synopsis by the person who presided on this, Councilor Morocco?

284
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:40,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, so the intention here is that the current subcommittees don't, what is in the council rules don't reflect the current subcommittees.

285
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:54,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would allow us to update those subcommittees and also allow us to be nimble in the sense of, you know, reflecting the names of offices in city hall and just appointing people related to the subcommittee.

286
00:17:54,186 --> 00:18:01,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So just modernizing the subcommittees, especially since they don't actually reflect the current subcommittees that are doled out.

287
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:04,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may.

288
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:06,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

289
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:16,180
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to what Councilor Morrell said, the updated language would reflect how subcommittees have been created and appointed, at least as long as I've been Councilor, and I think longer than that.

290
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:20,783
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another resolution on here to review the full Council rules.

291
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:27,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it's possible that we can make additional updates, changes, put a number of standing committees back in there.

292
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:36,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the intent here is to just reflect how committees and subcommittees are appointed, created and appointed by and the members and chairs appointed by the President of the Council.

293
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I can Mr. President.

294
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:46,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, like, if we can maybe entertain tabling this for committed a whole meeting where we can

295
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:55,919
[SPEAKER_03]: really get the input of residents and we can really vet this process as we go forward.

296
00:18:55,939 --> 00:19:10,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are some of these subcommittees that, you know, I'd like to, as we just started, maybe, you know, bring in the school committee and ask their opinions, especially when, as a former member of the school committee, whenever you

297
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:28,495
[SPEAKER_03]: not that I felt this way, but some council, some committee members felt that when you did a combined subcommittee, a committee that it might overstep a bound and there might be some animosity.

298
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:36,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that not saying that it is or isn't, but this is something that it'd be nice to sit with, you know, sit with the committee members and I get some input.

299
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:40,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I did get one city school committee member called me to remind me

300
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:48,845
[SPEAKER_03]: when we tried to do that years ago, which I didn't, I didn't see it being a problem, but it is, it is a change.

301
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:59,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that it's something that I like to see in, you know, in a process where we could just discuss this as just this being the topic of the conversation.

302
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:09,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, making a motion to- Yeah, if I could send this to, I mean, rules or the committee of the whole- Yeah, with this involves all councilors should go to the committee.

303
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:13,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if I may, just to say that, you know,

304
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:21,465
[SPEAKER_06]: these do not reflect the current committees and subcommittees in 2020, 2021.

305
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:36,612
[SPEAKER_06]: And the intent here is really to say, hey, I think personally, how I feel is to actually put into the rules what we have done for the past two years and say, you know, the president will create subcommittees.

306
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:45,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are certainly, we certainly have some of these, but we don't have a school buildings, we don't have a school racial balance, we don't have public utilities, for example.

307
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some subcommittees we do have right now that aren't reflected in this list.

308
00:20:50,337 --> 00:21:08,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so you know the intent here is, is, I agree with you to have a discussion about this in the future that's actually what my next resolution is about, but just in between now and then, to make sure that the current president can appoint subcommittees in the interim, so it's not meant to be a permanent, you know, this is how it's going to go from here on out it's just, you know,

309
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:16,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it could be argued, right, that last term, Councilor Caravaglio appointed a set of committees that aren't reflected in here.

310
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that against the council rules, you know?

311
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:26,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all this is meant to be, is kind of temporary to say, we can appoint committees for now, and then we can also have those discussions.

312
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:28,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, I completely understand.

313
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:41,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree with, you know, with most of the subcommittee, the new subcommittee, you know, changes, but I think that really it's understanding each one with the vision of the President and what direction

314
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:56,806
[SPEAKER_03]: we're looking to go with when you're, you're talking and getting the input from, you know, our residents that that elected us to say, for instance, the school and racial balance, I think that's, you know, something that we need.

315
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:57,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are old.

316
00:21:58,268 --> 00:21:58,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

317
00:21:58,688 --> 00:21:59,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to change those two.

318
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,592
[SPEAKER_06]: All this does this is actually taking all of the

319
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:14,520
[SPEAKER_06]: uh listed committees out of the current rules right and just changing it to the president shall form committees and the subcommittees and appoint chairpersons and members right okay so i think that's my confusion is like the the understanding of what

320
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:18,288
[SPEAKER_03]: what is the change going to be.

321
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:37,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're allowing the president to do that, and it's presented in a way that might have some animosity toward another city body, I think that's the concern that before doing that is understanding what the president's definition

322
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,920
[SPEAKER_03]: of each new title is.

323
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:47,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that would be my only... Well, common practice is the president usually asks the members what committees they'd like to be on.

324
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:50,022
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to put people on a committee they don't want to be on.

325
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:54,784
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know when I was president, I'd always ask everybody, what committee do you want to be on?

326
00:22:54,844 --> 00:23:01,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And the president hopefully tries to make everybody happy.

327
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, if I could, Councilor Kerrio,

328
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:11,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And I absolutely hear what you're saying, Councilor Scarpella, and I think that's valid, and those are conversations that need to be had.

329
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:14,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't want to, I think Councilor, Vice President Behrs has the same concern.

330
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:28,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to inhibit, somehow inhibit ourselves from being able to form the subcommittees, particularly if we're sending things to rules right now, get stuck in kind of a catch-22 where we can't have that rules subcommittee because we're trying to hold for this committee of the whole.

331
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:35,490
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm curious if the language, if you would be satisfied the language were clarified, that this is something we'll

332
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:42,724
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, have a meeting about down the road, but it doesn't inhibit the president from forming subcommittees, you know, in the interim.

333
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:55,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President, I see this nothing more as, you know, streamlining the way that we do business a little bit.

334
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, I think it's safe to say that

335
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:06,008
[SPEAKER_07]: The President has always been given some flexibility and leeway in establishing subcommittees, whether or not they outlined in the rules or not.

336
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:12,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think what we're really doing is kind of splitting hairs a little bit over an issue here that's not really that big of a deal right ultimately.

337
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,414
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a number of subcommittees.

338
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:23,919
[SPEAKER_07]: My first term, when I was elected, Councilor Camuso and I went over the list, and I recommended that he create a number of different subcommittees, and he just created them.

339
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,301
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have to go through rules change or anything like that.

340
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:34,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I'm looking at this, I think, you know, we talk about some of the ad hoc committees that we've voted on to allow the president to have discretion to create.

341
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:39,208
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't think this is anything that's outside the norm of the power vacuum that we've allowed in the past.

342
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:41,950
[SPEAKER_07]: So I certainly have no problem with it, Mr. President, ultimately.

343
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,378
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we have a number of items on relative to the rules, the rules will be reviewed.

344
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:50,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of, you know, committees and committee structure and the standing committees, I don't think it's.

345
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:59,486
[SPEAKER_07]: worth getting into a hours long debate over it when historically, you know, the flexibility has been there for the President to take such action.

346
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:12,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I certainly wouldn't question the Council President's authority in appointing the subcommittees that are currently standing, the ones that we've, you know, we just transferred all the papers over that are in the standing committees now.

347
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:14,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So those standing committees need to be chaired.

348
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:15,678
[SPEAKER_07]: We just voted on that.

349
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:16,739
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the second paper we did.

350
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So ultimately, at the very least,

351
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:23,306
[SPEAKER_07]: the council president should have the ability to, at the very least, chair those subcommittees.

352
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:26,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if this is going to be an issue we can deal with in the future.

353
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:31,590
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of allowing us the ability to continue conducting business, I don't think that this is something that you get in the way of that.

354
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:43,776
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't want this to be something saying, you know, we can't do anything anymore until we figure out who's going to be the chairman of the rules committee, the licensing committee, because we just took a vote to transfer all those papers that are in those committees over this year.

355
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So those committees right now are already standing committees.

356
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:46,637
[SPEAKER_07]: We took a vote on that.

357
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:49,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're really kind of beating a dead horse.

358
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:57,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. President, if I can, I agree with Councilor Knight saying if it's standing committees, I'd support that.

359
00:25:57,092 --> 00:26:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But I said, I think the question that we had were, if we're allowing the president

360
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:02,444
[SPEAKER_03]: to make some change.

361
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:04,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that has to be a discussion before.

362
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:27,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the standing committees I would support, but as we're moving forward to change or to add different committees, I think it's something that I wasn't privy to Councilor Knight's first few years and Councilor Camuso's, but I know what we've done here has worked in the sense that it's been transparent.

363
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:29,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say that Councilor, President,

364
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:39,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not transparent and what I'm saying is having that extra meeting to talk about the new committees, I think, if there are, that'd be important.

365
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:43,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I agree with Councilor Knight that we can move forward with the standing committees.

366
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:44,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.

367
00:26:45,694 --> 00:26:46,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair, would you like to support that?

368
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:48,617
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may.

369
00:26:51,738 --> 00:26:53,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I would prefer to vote on this tonight.

370
00:26:53,741 --> 00:27:00,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And that doesn't mean even if it were to pass, that we wouldn't have those discussions and they wouldn't come up with a new structure as we review the rules.

371
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to say, so if it goes, if it goes mixed, whatever, it's not unanimous.

372
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say either way, we're going to have the discussion and we're going to.

373
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:09,583
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get it going.

374
00:27:10,204 --> 00:27:11,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it goes both ways.

375
00:27:11,985 --> 00:27:12,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is.

376
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:17,391
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why there are there are seven votes and there's no animosity behind it.

377
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:19,774
[SPEAKER_03]: We just move forward in a positive light.

378
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:24,959
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to give the president the flexibility.

379
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,365
[SPEAKER_12]: to appoint the committees that she feels that she wants to work people in.

380
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:32,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't disagree.

381
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:44,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that Councilor Knight said they'd support all the standing committees, but I'd like to, any new committees is just to have a committee of the whole meeting, just to discuss those few meetings.

382
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:52,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, Councilor Morrell's a voted president, and I think it's just having that layer of discussion.

383
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:54,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So other than that, move forward.

384
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you made a motion.

385
00:27:57,622 --> 00:28:00,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there was a second, but I would move approval unless there's a second on your motion.

386
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scott Pele, you had a motion on the floor.

387
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:04,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't hear a second, so.

388
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:04,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by.

389
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:26,617
[SPEAKER_07]: of the Committee of the Whole is going to be the establishment of what the new committees are going to be, then yeah, I don't have a problem having the Committee of the Whole in that, provided that the existing and standing committees still stand, you know.

390
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:28,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not in favor of that whatsoever.

391
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:31,898
[SPEAKER_07]: We already verb that in standing array, so they're already in place.

392
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:35,799
[SPEAKER_07]: If the councilor has questions and wants to vet it, I don't have a problem providing that opportunity.

393
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:37,519
[SPEAKER_03]: With the new committees.

394
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:42,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd certainly second the motion with the understanding that the other standing committees will still be filled.

395
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be my motion, that the committee

396
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:51,597
[SPEAKER_03]: We think it should be passed and we would have a committee of the whole discuss.

397
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:52,397
[SPEAKER_03]: On the new committees.

398
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:53,077
[SPEAKER_03]: On the new committees.

399
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:53,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

400
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:58,219
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Scapelli, seconded by Councilor Night.

401
00:28:59,019 --> 00:28:59,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further discussion?

402
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,882
[SPEAKER_12]: We refer this to a committee of the whole to discuss the new committees.

403
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:08,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

404

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Three in favor, four against.

419
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:43,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Three in favor, four against, motion fails.

420
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:45,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I would motion to approve as written.

421
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:49,379
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by?

422
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,000
[SPEAKER_12]: To approve.

423

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_04]: No.

432

[SPEAKER_04]: also saying, Yes, Councilor Morrell.

433
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:19,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

434
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:36,155
[SPEAKER_12]: 2-2-0-1-2 offered by Councilor Baez.

[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the rules of the Memphis City Council be reviewed, updated, and modernized.

436
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:43,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Baez.

437
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:44,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

438
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,558
[SPEAKER_06]: This continues kind of the conversation we've been having here.

439
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:56,021
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent of this resolution is to, and I will make a motion at the end of my statement, is to refer this to the Rural Subcommittee to

440
00:30:57,301 --> 00:31:05,645
[SPEAKER_06]: discuss, review the city council rules, you know, maybe at a table of contents, maybe maybe it's time we can officially take out the no smoking behind the rail rule.

441
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Um you know, so, I think we're, I think we're a smoke-free building for sure.

442
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:26,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Um so, so, you know, there's there's quite a bit of stuff we could look into just maybe make it better organized, review what's in there, what's relevant, and again, specifically on these questions of subcommittees, look at and and you know, I think how we'd go, we'd have a real subcommittee, then we'd have committee of the whole, talk about it as a whole council,

443
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:33,020
[SPEAKER_06]: and really look at a structure that reflects what we've been doing going forward.

444
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what this resolution is about.

445
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:39,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a motion to refer this to the rules subcommittee, and thank you, Mr. President.

446
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:45,190
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Vice President Beers, seconded by Councilor Knight.

447
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further discussion?

448
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:48,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

449
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Beers.

450
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:53,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

451
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:54,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

452
00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:55,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

453
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:56,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

454
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

455
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

456
00:31:58,451 --> 00:31:58,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

457
00:31:59,412 --> 00:31:59,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Seng.

458
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:00,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

459
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:01,873
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell.

460
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:02,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

461
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:04,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio.

462
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:04,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

463
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,937
[SPEAKER_12]: 7th affirmative motion passes.

464
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:19,343
[SPEAKER_12]: 22013 offered by Councilor Beas be it resolved that the City Council review the creation of the Election Commission through the acceptance of Mass General Law Chapter 51, Section 16A.

465
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:20,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Beas.

466
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:21,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

467
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:26,123
[SPEAKER_06]: many communities, well, I'll start here.

468
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:38,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Chapter 51, section 16A allows for cities to adopt a piece of mass general law, which would allow us to move to the system of having an elections commission.

469
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:44,656
[SPEAKER_06]: It would move us from having the clerk and the board of registrars model to a formal elections commission.

470
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:50,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a variety of reasons that we that at least I think that would be a good idea.

471
00:32:50,680 --> 00:33:03,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, may also reflect some, some of the changes we've been talking about in general around elections, with it being more work and then we now have an elections coordinator and it really is its own own.

472
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:05,698
[SPEAKER_06]: animal, if you will.

473
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:19,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So part of what this allows this this section of mass general law allows us to do is basically if we were to adopt it, it would immediately transfer our Board of Registrars of voters to becoming a board of election commissioners.

474
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:31,250
[SPEAKER_06]: the clerk position would then come off of that board and any appointments going forward, the mayor would make those appointments subject to the approval of the of the city council.

475
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:41,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Um so, my motion here is to refer this to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss this with the city solicitor, with the clerk, with the relevant folks from from our

476
00:33:47,113 --> 00:33:48,295
[SPEAKER_06]: the way that we should move forward.

477
00:33:48,315 --> 00:34:04,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just say from my reading of the law and also from seeing which communities have adopted this it does seem like this is the way that the state law it's kind of pushing communities towards this model and away from the older clerk registrar voters model at least that's how I read the general law.

478
00:34:05,737 --> 00:34:13,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's another example of something we can do, adopt state law and already allows communities to do this, to move forward on administration of elections.

479
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:16,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, move to refer this to a committee that will refer the discussion.

480
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:21,352
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Vice President Baer, seconded by Councilor Nye.

481
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:29,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Vice President, this is something myself and Clerk Urnaby had a discussion with the Mayor, I think earlier in the year.

482
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:37,395
[SPEAKER_12]: In June, I think, with the Mayor and former Chief of Staff Rodriguez about getting this career, this position created.

483
00:34:38,015 --> 00:34:38,656
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with that.

484
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:39,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is something that should be done.

485
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:45,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it still falls, technically still falls under the clerk's office, but it takes the burden off of him and

486
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:48,189
[SPEAKER_12]: of the clerk and it puts it into another thing.

487
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:50,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I support this.

488
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:51,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes.

489
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:52,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a good idea.

490
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:53,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

491
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,639
[SPEAKER_06]: The clerk would no longer be a registrar.

492
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:02,448
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, the job of the clerk certainly isn't the job that we when we hired

493
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:13,738
[SPEAKER_12]: clerk for four years ago, we weren't doing early voting, we weren't doing weekly voting, so obviously now the job has changed significantly since the clerk has started.

494
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:19,800
[SPEAKER_12]: So on the motion by Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight, any further discussion?

495
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

496
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:23,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs.

497
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:23,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

498
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:25,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

499
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:26,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

500
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:27,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

501
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:27,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

502
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:29,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

503
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:29,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

504
00:35:30,363 --> 00:35:30,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Sang.

505
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:31,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

506
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:32,624
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell.

507
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:33,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

508
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:35,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio.

509
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:52,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, 70 affirmative motion passes to choose everyone for offered by councilor on council appears to be resolved that Memphis City Council, uh, the city explored joining the state's paid family in medical leave program to provide a necessary benefit to the city and school employees.

510
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:56,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Be a further resolved that the Memphis City Council review the relevant state statutes

511
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:04,174
[SPEAKER_12]: for the city solicitor including acceptance of national law chapters 175m section 10 required to join us.

512
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:05,255
[SPEAKER_12]: President Morel.

513
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:07,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio.

514
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:13,260
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a space, apologies, this is a space that Medford can be a leader in.

515
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:22,425
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a program that the state recently passed, something that I'm benefiting from right now that I'm on paid family leave through my day job at MIT and something that

516
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:28,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I think through the political process, unfortunately, municipal employees were sacrificed.

517
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:31,003
[SPEAKER_11]: The cities have to opt into this program.

518
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:32,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford would be among the first.

519
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of the first, I think cities are looking at this.

520
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,084
[SPEAKER_11]: They have the ability to opt in.

521
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:38,264
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of discussion.

522
00:36:38,984 --> 00:36:46,086
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an outline process to join this, but it would allow our municipal pool employees to have those same benefits that are being extended across the state.

523
00:36:46,766 --> 00:36:49,787
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've talked a lot about the value of our city employees.

524
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:52,027
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked a lot about attracting top talent,

525
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, just valuing our employees as human beings with full lives.

526
00:36:56,506 --> 00:37:09,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is something that absolutely would affirm that, would give people the time off they need for expanding their family, for a sick family member, for all of the things outlined in paid family medical leave.

527
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:14,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is something that we absolutely have to look into as a city because it's the right thing to do.

528
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,371
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, as I said, it will attract talent.

529
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:19,091
[SPEAKER_11]: It will give them the chance to be a leader.

530
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:21,792
[SPEAKER_11]: So my motion, I would move to move this to committee of the whole,

531
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:30,437
[SPEAKER_11]: invite, you know, the city solicitor, chief of staff, I think human resources to see how we can implement this as a city.

532
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

533
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:42,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr President, just to add to what Councillor morale was saying, you know,

534
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:56,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in the room, my organization was part of Raise Up Massachusetts when we were negotiating what exactly are we going to look at for paid family medical leave and the $15 minimum wage, and it was kind of a hectic morning.

535
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,566
[SPEAKER_06]: getting phone calls back and forth from the leadership and the legislature back to us, what's in, what's out.

536
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:10,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that was left out on both of those fronts, and we've discussed one of the other ones here before, was city and school employees.

537
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:17,701
[SPEAKER_06]: They were left out of the paid family medical leave, and they were left out of the $15 minimum wage because it was said that this was an unfunded mandate on cities.

538
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,664
[SPEAKER_06]: There is again this chapter 175 M section 10.

539
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:33,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an adoption of state law that this council that gives the authority to councils or whatever the equivalent body is in another community to join the paid family medical leave program for the state.

540
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,671
[SPEAKER_06]: We would be the first in the Commonwealth.

541
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:37,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that

542
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:38,592
[SPEAKER_06]: is a good thing.

543
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:48,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that puts us in a competitive position with a lot of other communities, especially right now in this job market, when top talent is going all over the place and looking for the best thing.

544
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:52,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing too, it puts us in a more competitive position with the private sector.

545
00:38:52,755 --> 00:39:01,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually just was speaking with a family of someone who is now working for the city, previously was in the private sector.

546
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,217
[SPEAKER_06]: When they were in the private sector, they paid into this program,

547
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:15,743
[SPEAKER_06]: now they've moved to the city, they're at a moment in their family history where it'd be great to be able to take advantage of this, and they just found out they're no longer eligible because they work for a municipality.

548
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:27,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So certainly there are things to work out, look at the law, look at the process, and obviously there'll be a budgetary impact, but I think it's something that would be good for our city and school staff 100%.

549
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:32,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would second Councilor Morrell's motion to refer this to Committee of the Whole.

550
00:39:34,198 --> 00:39:34,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

551
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

552
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,680
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that I support wholeheartedly.

553
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Baird has brought up two issues that are very important to me.

554
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:49,606
[SPEAKER_07]: The $15 minimum wage for city and school department employees and also a sick leave bank ordinance for city and school department employees.

555
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:57,290
[SPEAKER_07]: These are two items that I brought up two years ago, asking to draft ordinances from our city solicitor appointment.

556
00:39:58,142 --> 00:40:08,610
[SPEAKER_07]: and they must be very long pieces of municipal legislation, Mr. President, because it's been 24 long months, and this body's not received draft ordinances of either one of these items.

557
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:19,438
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are this evening, and we're gonna have a paper asking us to further fund legal services in the administration, to further fund the legal service line item, to expand the budget for this fiscal year.

558
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:24,362
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a perfect example, Mr. President, of why this council needs its own legal counsel.

559
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:29,475
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an item that should have been addressed long before, long before today.

560
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:37,700
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an item that we could have handled through municipal ordinance that would have provided a sickly bank program for municipal employees and school department employees, just like they offer to state employees.

561
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:47,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Merit on the state legislation of which I printed out, drafted and submitted to the city solicitor's office when this ordinance proposal was made.

562
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,908
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank the councilors for bringing this measure forward.

563
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:56,848
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that will benefit a number of workers here in this community, and it's something that I support wholeheartedly.

564
00:40:56,948 --> 00:41:00,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need a meeting with the solicitor or anybody else to know that this is something I'm going to support.

565
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:05,974
[SPEAKER_07]: What I need a meeting with the solicitor for is to make sure that when I vote for it, we vote for it the right way, so it's implemented properly.

566
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:09,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Capelli.

567
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for, my fellow Councillors, bringing this forward.

568
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:16,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Councillor Knight remembered this very vividly because

569
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:37,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like my, my, my first year colleagues, which I don't know the background yet but I'm fortunate to work in a municipality that that people don't might not understand is that the sick bank is so important for brothers and sisters that you work with.

570
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:50,522
[SPEAKER_03]: that fallen ill for some serious health issues and employees that have occurred sick days that can give back to those that are in need for that.

571
00:41:50,562 --> 00:42:01,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's so important and something that simple, you think that the Family Leave Act is just automatic in different municipalities.

572
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:04,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's enlightening to a few members in the community thinking that

573
00:42:05,297 --> 00:42:06,197
[SPEAKER_03]: don't we already have this?

574
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:13,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that, you know, I appreciate my council's bringing this forward and something I will support and I look forward to the community to hold me.

575
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:14,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

576
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:18,903
[SPEAKER_12]: So on the motion by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Pence.

577
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:23,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor, thanks.

578
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:35,776
[SPEAKER_14]: not to drive the conversation out further, but I just want to thank President Morrell, Councilor Beers for bringing this forward, Councilors Knight and Scarpelli for their words of affirmation.

579
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:40,698
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that this is an issue that really deserves a lot of affirmatory words.

580
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:43,139
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a really essential benefit.

581
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:55,343
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to see this council embrace it, encourage the city to embrace it, because this is a measure that could, through extending this benefit for our city and school employees, help to make the city

582
00:42:56,024 --> 00:43:00,092
[SPEAKER_14]: healthier and stronger and more resilient community, which is what we're here to do.

583
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:01,655
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for bringing it forth.

584
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm excited to advance it.

585
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:05,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

586
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:10,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to thank as well, President Morrell and Vice President bears for bringing this forward.

587
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:15,806
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to reiterate my support for this for this paper.

588
00:43:16,446 --> 00:43:22,168
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wanted to thank my fellow city counselors for, you know, already speaking up on so much that matters to me.

589
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:32,251
[SPEAKER_16]: This is definitely an important piece of important action going forward when we consider how we are going to draw talent to our city to work for our city.

590
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:37,274
[SPEAKER_16]: how we're going to compete with different municipalities and how we're going to compete with the private sector as well.

591
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:51,801
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's important to also remember that, you know, paid paid leave is pivotal, pivotal for the development of children who are future, and that's why this is particularly, particularly important to me.

592
00:43:52,802 --> 00:43:53,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

593
00:43:54,142 --> 00:43:56,964
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, there's some this council has supported in the past and will support again.

594
00:43:57,921 --> 00:44:01,302
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, it's good for the people, it's good for the families.

595
00:44:01,803 --> 00:44:02,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further discussion?

596
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:12,667
[SPEAKER_12]: So on the motion by Councilor Behrs and Council President Morrell and Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

597
00:44:13,147 --> 00:44:14,607
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is to move to Committee of the Whole, correct?

598
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:16,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Move to Committee of the Whole.

599
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:19,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs?

600
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:20,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

601
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:21,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

602
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:21,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

603
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

604
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:23,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

605
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:24,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

606
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:25,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

607
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:26,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Singh?

608
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:26,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

609
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:28,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

610
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:34,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that'd be the affirmative motion passes motion.

611
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:37,915
[SPEAKER_15]: From 18 when whenever Winchester related to GMT pizza.

612
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:43,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping that we can take this item out of order as well.

613
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:06,773
[SPEAKER_06]: One second, everybody.

614
00:45:06,793 --> 00:45:14,276
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we had paper.

615
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:37,300
[SPEAKER_06]: 21-021, petition for a convictual license by Michael LaChapelle, 18 Glenwood Avenue, Winchester, Massachusetts, 01890 for GNP Pizza, 51 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

616
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilors, do I need to open the hearing?

617
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to the Chair of Licensing.

618
00:45:46,606 --> 00:45:47,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

619
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:57,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we see this is just a business that is a pizza restaurant, I believe.

620
00:45:57,407 --> 00:46:00,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the petitioner online?

621
00:46:00,449 --> 00:46:03,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. LaChapelle, are you on the line, or do you have a representative?

622
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:04,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, yes, I'm here.

623
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:06,434
[SPEAKER_13]: It is an existing pizza restaurant.

624
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:09,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we just have your name and address for the record, please?

625
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:12,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, it's Mike LaChapelle at 18 Glenwood Ave.

626
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:13,739
[SPEAKER_13]: in Winchester, Mass.

627
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:14,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

628
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I know my colleagues have some questions.

629
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:24,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I see all the paperwork is present in order for approval, so.

630
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:27,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Councilor.

631
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:32,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I've personally known Michael for a number of years, probably the better part of 10 years, Mr. President.

632
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,455
[SPEAKER_07]: His wife's a business owner here in the community as well.

633
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,456
[SPEAKER_07]: She runs a law office right down in Memphis Square.

634
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:43,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And Michael's looking for an opportunity to continue in his wife's footsteps and be a business owner in the city of Memphis.

635
00:46:44,141 --> 00:46:47,243
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know GNP is a wonderful establishment here.

636
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,065
[SPEAKER_07]: It's some of the best pizza that you can get in the city of Memphis.

637
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:53,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is gonna be a great opportunity for Mr. LaChapelle to partner up.

638
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:58,333
[SPEAKER_07]: with one of our existing successful businesses and expand upon the successes that we've seen there, Mr. President.

639
00:46:58,894 --> 00:47:03,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I certainly have no problem by supporting this document, this paper that's before us.

640
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:10,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I've known the gentleman for a number of years in a professional and personal capacity, and he's someone that I believe will bring a number of great assets to our community.

641
00:47:12,298 --> 00:47:13,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

642
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:14,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

643
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:16,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion approved.

644
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion from Councilor Carviello, seconded by?

645
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:20,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded.

646
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,625
[SPEAKER_06]: second by everybody, but with Councilor Knight.

647
00:47:24,105 --> 00:47:29,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may, just before we call the roll, I used to work at Rosa's in the same location.

648
00:47:29,787 --> 00:47:33,708
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm familiar with the location and I wish you all the best.

649
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:35,408
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know.

650
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:40,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all.

651
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:47,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

652
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:50,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio.

653
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

654
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:52,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

655
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:54,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

656
00:47:54,224 --> 00:47:54,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

657
00:47:55,325 --> 00:47:56,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

658
00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:56,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

659
00:47:56,986 --> 00:47:57,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Seng.

660
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:57,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

661
00:47:58,507 --> 00:47:59,108
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell.

662
00:47:59,548 --> 00:47:59,788

[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Harris.

664
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:01,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

665
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,133
[SPEAKER_06]: That is seven in the affirmative, zero on the negative, and the motion passes.

666
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:15,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion on the floor, revert rec to regular from Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

667
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

668
00:48:25,248 --> 00:48:25,849
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a care bill.

669
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:26,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

670
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:27,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

671
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:28,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

672
00:48:28,817 --> 00:48:29,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Council night.

673
00:48:29,478 --> 00:48:29,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

674
00:48:29,919 --> 00:48:30,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

675
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

676
00:48:31,623 --> 00:48:32,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor saying yes.

677
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:36,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs.

678
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:39,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

679
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:41,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

680
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:43,612
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-005 offered by Councilor Knight.

681
00:48:44,113 --> 00:48:48,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas Medford City Hall closes on Wednesday evening at 7.30 PM and on Friday afternoon at 12.30 PM.

682
00:48:48,716 --> 00:48:51,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I'd be happy to give a brief synopsis if someone would like to waive the reading.

683
00:48:52,398 --> 00:48:53,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to waive the reading?

684
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:58,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved by Councilor Scarpelli.

685
00:48:58,783 --> 00:48:59,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

686
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:05,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President, this is my biannual attempt to have a meeting night change from Tuesdays to Wednesdays.

687
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:18,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, because we have an open meeting while it requires 48 hours of posting, the City Council is required to get its agenda items into the City Clerk by Friday, unless there's a holiday on that Monday, which would require us to get it in on a Thursday.

688
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:28,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we all know that the majority of events in this community in the majority of time that we are able to be free to interact with constituents occurs usually after the working hours on the weekends.

689
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:38,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So the situation I find myself in a lot of times Mister president is that the agenda has been published on a Friday afternoon and I'm down to Matt 7 a cup of coffee and someone comes in asking me to help with some.

690
00:49:38,802 --> 00:49:55,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have the ability to bring that item to the table and put it on the agenda, because the open meeting requires that we have to have the meeting notice posted within 48 hours, because of Saturday and Sunday, not being included in the counting of those 48 hours, we lose two and a half days to get items onto the agenda.

691
00:49:56,237 --> 00:50:04,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is nothing more than really, Mr. President, an attempt to allow us to do business a little bit quicker and to allow us the opportunity to put things on the agenda in a faster fashion.

692
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:09,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, when you think about this building, right, Wednesday night is the night the City Hall is open late.

693
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:20,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of having City Hall being open on Tuesday nights just especially for the City Council meeting to meet this whole building for us to come in here to conduct our business, the building will already be open.

694
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,203
[SPEAKER_07]: The building will already be heated.

695
00:50:21,223 --> 00:50:22,584
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be personnel that's in here already.

696
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:26,500
[SPEAKER_07]: department heads they're already working late.

697
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we do need to talk to somebody we may have the ability to have them come right down and speak to us, Mr. President, we'll be able to get answers a little bit quicker.

698
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:35,967
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have committees as a whole, existing staff will already be on hand.

699
00:50:36,027 --> 00:50:44,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So department heads won't be dragged in there on Tuesday nights to deal with council business and then also be dragged in again on a Wednesday night so that, you know, we can take their life into consideration as well.

700
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:50,878
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that this is really just an opportunity for us to allow us to represent our constituents better because it gives us the opportunity

701
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:54,659
[SPEAKER_07]: to get the freshest items that are in our head and put them on the agenda immediately.

702
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,481
[SPEAKER_07]: After the weekend, we can put something on the agenda on a Monday, and it's gonna show up on the agenda for Wednesday evening.

703
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's just a little bit more efficient and effective.

704
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I bring this matter forward.

705
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:12,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that being said, Councilor Baez and Councilor Morrell have been so generous in their willingness to send items to the committee of the rules.

706
00:51:12,085 --> 00:51:15,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be happy to make a motion to send this item there as well to be further discussed.

707
00:51:16,486 --> 00:51:18,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I have brought it to the table before it has failed before.

708
00:51:19,487 --> 00:51:26,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not like to see this fail again, so I'd be happy to deliberate and discuss with my council colleagues what they feel would be best direction for us to move.

709
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

710
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,651
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion from Councilor Knight to refer this to the Committee on Rules.

711
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:31,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

712
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:33,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

713
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:34,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

714
00:51:34,612 --> 00:51:35,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And any discussion?

715
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I had Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Kerrio, then Councilor Scarpelli.

716
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:42,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate, thank you, Council President.

717
00:51:42,698 --> 00:51:44,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate Councilor and I bringing this forward.

718
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:55,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it makes some valid points, but I think that talking to a few department heads, they've been accustomed to using that Wednesday evening that they are here when it might be a little bit slower.

719
00:51:55,695 --> 00:52:06,766
[SPEAKER_03]: to really do the business that we we pass on on a Tuesday night for them to to to really get ahead of the game where Fridays they have a half a day they lose a half a day.

720
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:11,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of hinders that process so I appreciate that and

721
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:23,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I I think that you know it's something that be interesting to see as we share our thoughts and community that being on that point Mister president.

722
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:28,384
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the mayor still would be bombed by our 10 day requirement to respond items that have passed by the House.

723
00:52:28,904 --> 00:52:32,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So whether the meetings on the Tuesday or Wednesday the administration still about to act within the 10 days.

724
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:39,690
[SPEAKER_07]: The forecast right so if they use Wednesday's you know the employees and the staff is still required to work at 37.5 hours a week.

725
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:42,600
[SPEAKER_07]: whenever it may be, right?

726
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,862
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a time management issue at that point, right?

727
00:52:45,202 --> 00:52:54,731
[SPEAKER_07]: So the night of the council meeting should have no bearing on whether or not members of the administration can conduct the job that they're being paid to do within 37.5 hours a week that they're being paid to do it.

728
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:56,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

729
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:58,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you both.

730
00:52:58,555 --> 00:52:59,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Carballo.

731
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:00,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

732
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:03,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I thank Councilor and I for bringing this forward.

733
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,071
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with Councilor Scott.

734
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:12,472
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think Wednesday nights works for the council meetings.

735
00:53:13,593 --> 00:53:20,836
[SPEAKER_12]: This room is booked many, many Wednesday nights for public hearings, multiple public meetings.

736
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:26,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think to have that on other nights, I think it would be disruptive to the community.

737
00:53:27,138 --> 00:53:30,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, you know, these are the changes that, you know,

738
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,296
[SPEAKER_12]: that the city has been done for many, many years.

739
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:49,527
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying that I'm opposed to change, but I say generally Wednesday nights, many meetings are held in this chamber because of just the fact that it's the biggest room in the city for us to have these meetings.

740
00:53:49,587 --> 00:53:55,692
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I don't oppose discussing this in the committee at all.

741
00:53:56,882 --> 00:54:01,763
[SPEAKER_07]: On that point, Mr. President, I think it's important to point out that the Council meetings are a public meeting as well.

742
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the Council Chamber.

743
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:14,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we talk about the successes of just this past week, for example, we just cut the ribbon on one of Councilor Caviello's greatest accomplishments as a Councilor, the library, which has a beautiful new community space.

744
00:54:14,706 --> 00:54:19,707
[SPEAKER_07]: We look across the parking lot, we do see the Senior Center, which has a beautiful room in there that we've been able to use in the past.

745
00:54:21,806 --> 00:54:23,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Back this way, we see the Shabbat auditorium.

746
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:25,889
[SPEAKER_07]: We get in the car and drive up the street, we see the little theater.

747
00:54:26,149 --> 00:54:30,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are a number of spaces in this community that can host live gatherings.

748
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:33,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is more of an efficiency standpoint for the council and the ability for us to put it on the agenda.

749
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:39,919
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I don't think we need to beat the host to death, but there are some valid arguments for and against Mr. President.

750
00:54:41,721 --> 00:54:42,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

751
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:47,985
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a motion from Councilor Knight to refer to the subcommittee on rules, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

752
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:49,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

753
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:53,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang.

754
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:56,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to quickly thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

755
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:57,969
[SPEAKER_16]: I think he makes valid points.

756
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:03,974
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard from constituents about concerns about public meetings, community meetings being held in the chambers on Wednesdays.

757
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:11,181
[SPEAKER_16]: So I look forward to, I will vote yes on this and I look forward to discussing this even further.

758
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:13,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

759
00:55:13,863 --> 00:55:14,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

760
00:55:15,004 --> 00:55:16,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Any discussion by members of the public?

761
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:24,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not seeing any, so Mr. Clerk, on the motion, could you please call the roll?

762
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is to refer to rules.

763
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,442
[SPEAKER_06]: To refer to the subcommittee on rules.

764
00:55:29,982 --> 00:55:30,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

765
00:55:31,343 --> 00:55:31,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

766
00:55:32,103 --> 00:55:32,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

767
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:33,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

768
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:34,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

769
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:35,264
Yes.

770
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:36,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

771
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:37,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

772
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:38,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Sang?

773
00:55:38,525 --> 00:55:38,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

774
00:55:39,165 --> 00:55:39,806
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell?

775
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:40,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

776
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:42,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs?

777
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:42,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

778
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:46,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, and the motion passes.

779
00:55:49,166 --> 00:56:08,633
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-006 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence in memory of Governor's Counselor Michael J. Callahan, a dedicated public servant who passed on January 6th, 2011, following five decades of public service to the people of Medford, and be it further resolved that this evening's council meeting be dedicated to his memory.

780
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

781
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:11,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

782
00:56:11,126 --> 00:56:18,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael was a mentor and a dear friend to me for a number of years, and I wouldn't be sitting here this evening if it weren't for the guidance that he gave me as a young man.

783
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:23,952
[SPEAKER_07]: He's someone that dedicated his life to public service, a Vietnam veteran, a governor's counselor.

784
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:43,240
[SPEAKER_07]: 48-year state employee, commissioner of racing, chairman of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, founder of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, and most notably, Mr. President, famous in Medford folklore for saving Wrights Pond from being developed into condominiums in the late 70s and early 80s.

785
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:53,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you go up to Wrights Pond to this day, you'll see a memorial there in Michael's honor, recognizing the work that he did in protecting one of Medford's most beautiful natural resources.

786
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:59,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael was someone that served this community, this country, and this commonwealth with dedication and passion.

787
00:56:59,691 --> 00:57:03,173
[SPEAKER_07]: He's someone that would be the life of the party if he walked in the door, you'd know he was here.

788
00:57:03,814 --> 00:57:06,516
[SPEAKER_07]: He was someone that wore his hat and his sleeve and would give you the shirt off his back.

789
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:09,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's someone that's certainly greatly missed, Mr. President.

790
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:13,200
[SPEAKER_07]: He's someone that made a big impact in my life and someone who I think of often.

791
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,484
[SPEAKER_07]: And annually on this day, I bring this metaphor to Juan and my friend Michael, and I ask my council colleagues to join me in doing the same.

792
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:21,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

793
00:57:22,386 --> 00:57:23,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

794
00:57:27,503 --> 00:57:28,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

795
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:29,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

796
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:34,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those people who know Miss Callahan realize how important it was to our community.

797
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:45,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a deep loss when he, when, when he left us, and, but his memory lives on in, in Council night and I applaud that he does this every year.

798
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:51,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you don't know where you go until you know where you came from.

799
00:57:51,614 --> 00:57:54,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely Mike Callahan is a person who

800
00:57:56,378 --> 00:57:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: led the way here in Medford and supported us.

801
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:01,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So I second Councilor Knight's motion.

802
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:03,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

803
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

804
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Just again, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli.

805
00:58:09,022 --> 00:58:10,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

806
00:58:12,963 --> 00:58:14,624
[SPEAKER_06]: We should vote and then have a moment of silence.

807
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:17,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

808
00:58:17,985 --> 00:58:19,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

809
00:58:19,305 --> 00:58:19,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

810
00:58:20,145 --> 00:58:20,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

811
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:21,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

812
00:58:21,746 --> 00:58:21,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

813
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

814
00:58:23,326 --> 00:58:23,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

815
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:24,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

816
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:25,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

817
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:26,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Sang?

818
00:58:26,738 --> 00:58:26,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

819
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:28,279
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell?

820
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:28,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

821
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs?

822
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:31,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

823
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,843
[SPEAKER_06]: If everyone could please stand for a moment of silence.

824
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:45,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all.

825
00:58:49,755 --> 00:58:51,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Resolution 22-007 offered by Councilor Knight.

826
00:58:55,248 --> 00:59:01,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas gas distribution utilities are required to annually report the location of gas leaks to the Department of Public Utilities.

827
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:10,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas as of December 31, 2020, there are reported 235 unrepaired gas leaks generating 104 tons of emissions annually in the city of Medford.

828
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:16,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas independent research shows there are typically 1.5 to 3 times more leaks than reported.

829
00:59:16,973 --> 00:59:27,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that city administration prepare and present a five year plan to address gas leaks in our community and report back to the council counselor night, Mr President, thank you very much.

830
00:59:27,937 --> 00:59:30,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a rather self explanatory resolution.

831
00:59:30,558 --> 00:59:34,919
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a problem in this community with gap with gas leaks, you look at these figures.

832
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,041
[SPEAKER_07]: These aren't figures that I made up the figures that I got right from the Department of Public Utilities.

833
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:44,864
[SPEAKER_07]: The research shows that there are typically 1.5 to 3 times more leaks than reported.

834
00:59:44,904 --> 00:59:45,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something I made up.

835
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:48,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that I got right off the website of the Department of Public Utilities.

836
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:53,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're seeing a situation here in this community where we have a problem and we need to address it.

837
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing a lot of digging being done by our public utilities and we're not holding them accountable.

838
00:59:59,353 --> 01:00:06,718
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not bringing our public utilities back to the table to be sure that they resurface our roadways in a condition that's suitable to the taxpayers in this community.

839
01:00:07,218 --> 01:00:08,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that needs to be addressed, Mr. President.

840
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:19,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So between the environmental issues that we have with the gas leaks, the safety issues that we have with the gas leaks, and the quality of life issues that we have with the condition of our roadways, I think that this is something that should be a priority.

841
01:00:20,106 --> 01:00:22,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm asking that the administration come up with a plan on how to address it.

842
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:28,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to further amend the paper and ask that this be based on the reports due section of the council agenda for 90 days, Mr. President.

843
01:00:31,392 --> 01:00:32,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have that, Mr. Clerk?

844
01:00:40,252 --> 01:00:45,478
[SPEAKER_06]: do section nine days, as my council colleagues to support the resolution I look forward to the administration.

845
01:00:45,758 --> 01:00:50,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, you have a motion from Council right seconded by Councilors Garfield a discussion, Councilor Carvillo.

846
01:00:50,824 --> 01:00:51,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

847
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:53,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

848
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,709
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something that's been discussed at this Council.

849
01:00:56,931 --> 01:01:00,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Many times in the past, the Council made is a percent correct.

850
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:06,573
[SPEAKER_12]: with all the unrepaired gas leaks leaking all over the city.

851
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:11,276
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there's any part of the city that's immune to this, what's been going on.

852
01:01:11,356 --> 01:01:16,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that we should have national grid here when we have the meeting to discuss this.

853
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,461
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they were here last time.

854
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:29,889
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think a couple of years we had a meeting, but the biggest part is that Councilor Lay mentioned is we're over here digging up our streets.

855
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:31,459
[SPEAKER_12]: and not repairing it.

856
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been, I'm gonna tell you now, every time I see it, I call the engineer.

857
01:01:38,563 --> 01:01:43,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, we've got newly done streets that we're digging up.

858
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:57,134
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I think going forward, it's gonna be the job of this council to hold not only the gas company, electric company, the phone company, anybody that's gonna be digging up our streets are gonna be held accountable to pay them correctly.

859
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:00,256
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're not gonna be paid correctly, they're not gonna be getting any more permits.

860
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:03,425
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know I'm gonna stand firm on that.

861
01:02:04,225 --> 01:02:11,428
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm tired of going around the city, seeing holes everywhere, just being left undone.

862
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:17,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's also a sign that we hire a clerk of the works to follow up.

863
01:02:17,531 --> 01:02:21,432
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Tim McGibbon can only do so much work.

864
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:24,674
[SPEAKER_12]: He can't be the engineer, PPW director and be on the street.

865
01:02:24,714 --> 01:02:29,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I think this is something that this council is gonna have to hold strong on.

866
01:02:31,537 --> 01:02:37,421
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're gonna start paving the streets, I think, and they wanna start digging them up, they're gonna be paving crib to crib like they do in other cities.

867
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:39,863
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wholeheartedly support Councilor Knight's motion.

868
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:42,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

869
01:02:43,065 --> 01:02:46,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that an amendment to invite National Grid to the meeting?

870
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:47,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

871
01:02:47,828 --> 01:02:48,008
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

872
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:48,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

873
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:49,569
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could record that.

874
01:02:50,209 --> 01:02:51,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

875
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:54,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go Councilor Collins.

876
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:55,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

877
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:08,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councillor Knight for bringing this forward wholeheartedly support this resolution, as indicated, not only do these leaks account for an outsized amount of methane emissions, particularly potent greenhouse gas.

878
01:03:08,962 --> 01:03:13,083
[SPEAKER_14]: These leaks inhibit our ability to deliver on our public health goals to the community of Medford.

879
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:17,364
[SPEAKER_14]: They also threaten our ability to demonstrate our seriousness about climate change mitigation.

880
01:03:17,484 --> 01:03:25,866
[SPEAKER_14]: So I look forward to supporting the city administration and holding National Grid accountable and seeing what we can do to sustainably address this issue.

881
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:27,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

882
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:29,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

883
01:03:29,827 --> 01:03:33,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have Councilor Morrell and then our President Morrell and then we'll go to Councilor Seng.

884
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:34,048
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morrell.

885
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:35,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Bares.

886
01:03:35,689 --> 01:03:36,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to thank

887
01:03:37,277 --> 01:03:38,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight now I have a squiggly baby.

888
01:03:39,238 --> 01:03:41,360
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

889
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is an issue that, as you said, you hear from residents about this all the time.

890
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:54,128
[SPEAKER_11]: National Grid has their own ranking for how severe these leaks are and you'll have leaks that you can absolutely smell are concerning and they'll say it's not a priority.

891
01:03:54,808 --> 01:04:00,732
[SPEAKER_11]: The Energy and Environment Committee also has a great map detailing the leaks that are all over the city and as you said it's an incredible amount.

892
01:04:01,398 --> 01:04:02,599
[SPEAKER_11]: and a lot of them are unreported.

893
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:07,441
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just, I really appreciate you bringing this paper forward and I look forward to supporting it and getting something done on this.

894
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:11,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

895
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome baby Jack.

896
01:04:13,904 --> 01:04:17,065
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and we'll go to Councilor Sang.

897
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:23,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to thank Councilor Knight on this, and thank Councilor Caravaglia for his amendment.

898
01:04:24,222 --> 01:04:32,085
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's important that we, we hold strong together as a council on this issue that we hold hold people accountable for the work that they do in our city.

899
01:04:33,726 --> 01:04:35,748
[SPEAKER_16]: This is clearly a standard of living issue.

900
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:38,951
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an environmental issue as Councilor Collins so well laid out.

901
01:04:39,011 --> 01:04:46,859
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also an equity issue in terms of the neighborhoods that are affected, the streets that are affected, and the way that we address city services in Medford.

902
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,982
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I will vote to support this.

903
01:04:50,563 --> 01:04:50,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

904
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:52,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

905
01:04:53,426 --> 01:04:56,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion or discussion by members of the public?

906
01:05:00,908 --> 01:05:09,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Morrell, I believe, or we'll go with Councilor Scarpelli.

907
01:05:12,031 --> 01:05:13,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

908
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,051
[SPEAKER_06]: For approval as amended.

909
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:16,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, for approval as amended.

910
01:05:23,273 --> 01:05:24,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

911
01:05:24,274 --> 01:05:24,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

912
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:25,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

913
01:05:25,994 --> 01:05:26,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

914
01:05:26,814 --> 01:05:27,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

915
01:05:27,534 --> 01:05:27,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

916
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:29,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

917
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:29,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

918
01:05:30,238 --> 01:05:30,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Singh.

919
01:05:30,919 --> 01:05:31,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

920
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell.

921
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:33,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

922
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President bears.

923
01:05:35,404 --> 01:05:37,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

924
01:05:37,085 --> 01:05:46,495
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 affirmative zero the negative the motion passes as amended to 022 dash 008 offered by Councillor night.

925
01:05:48,632 --> 01:06:05,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it so resolved that the city administration provide the council with a listing of vacant positions funded in current fiscal year's budget, and be it further resolved that the city council be provided with an organizational chart reflecting the transitional roles and responsibilities of existing employees until the aforementioned vacancies are filled counselor night.

926
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:19,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much again this is a paper that we put on annually requesting that the administration provide us with an update as to what the organizational structure is week after week we're seeing new jobs being proposed to this council new positions being proposed positions being upgraded.

927
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:25,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my hope that we can get an organizational chart to show us exactly who's doing what, when, and where.

928
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:29,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Just last week, I believe we had about $800,000 worth of new positions before us.

929
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:39,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's important for us to understand the financial impact of what's going on with the new positions that are being created in this community, both to the tax dollar and also to our grant funds that are coming from the feds.

930
01:06:40,624 --> 01:06:42,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I would ask that this

931
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:45,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Council resolutions be answered in writing.

932
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:48,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think it's important that our council resolutions be answered in writing.

933
01:06:48,344 --> 01:06:52,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to have a representative from the administration here, but that does not make for my file.

934
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:56,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it comes time for me to pull this out and look at it again later on, it doesn't do me any good.

935
01:06:56,825 --> 01:06:58,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't do me any help.

936
01:06:58,346 --> 01:07:03,951
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really an issue for me to understand who does what, where our money is being spent, and why it's being spent there.

937
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:13,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also allows us as councillors to know who to pick up the phone and call when we need something to get done so that we don't have to bring it to the council floor and to have constituent work be debated on the council floor.

938
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:15,940
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this is an important step moving forward.

939
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,283
[SPEAKER_07]: If we look at our fiscal year's budget, we'll see an organizational chart

940
01:07:20,024 --> 01:07:21,987
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've seen a number of new positions that have been created.

941
01:07:22,007 --> 01:07:24,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen a number of people take on transitionary roles.

942
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:29,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, those transitionary roles, some people are in 2 hats, some people are in 3.

943
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I just want to know where we're at.

944
01:07:32,898 --> 01:07:41,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, we have a number of positions that were funded in the budget that aren't filled right now, so we're gonna have some surplus funds that may require end of the year transfers.

945
01:07:41,104 --> 01:07:42,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a financial issue.

946
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:46,108
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

947
01:07:46,509 --> 01:07:51,372
[SPEAKER_07]: The more we understand about the organizational structure, where the money's being spent, the better job that we can do for the people that we represent.

948
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:53,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Nye.

949
01:07:53,894 --> 01:07:56,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Just FYI, we're having some issues with your microphone.

950
01:07:56,356 --> 01:07:57,297
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not picking everything up.

951
01:07:57,357 --> 01:07:59,318
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could maybe angle it, yeah, a little bit more.

952
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:02,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it might be the loud HVAC system,

953
01:08:03,315 --> 01:08:04,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Councilor Scarpelli.

954
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President.

955
01:08:06,977 --> 01:08:08,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilman, I thank you for bringing this forward.

956
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:10,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that you make some valid points.

957
01:08:10,218 --> 01:08:15,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even, I think the most important point is we have a new committee, a new council here.

958
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

959
01:08:17,118 --> 01:08:28,344
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see that, especially when I first started, having that chart and understanding who to call saved a lot of work for everybody.

960
01:08:29,244 --> 01:08:31,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Something simple as, I'll give you an example.

961
01:08:31,205 --> 01:08:42,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a phone call today from a senior citizen who lives in South Medford, whose son is moving into his home to assist him so he doesn't have to move to assisted living.

962
01:08:43,992 --> 01:08:46,653
[SPEAKER_03]: great gentleman lived has lived here for over 70 years.

963
01:08:47,673 --> 01:08:49,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And question was very simple.

964
01:08:49,934 --> 01:09:04,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with the changes with the traffic and parking, who is who can he call to, to find to ask for another permit, temporary permit while his son is living there with him without getting towed or ticketed.

965
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be as we

966
01:09:08,503 --> 01:09:24,119
[SPEAKER_03]: That being a new department, having that that outline would be so helpful for us to do our job, and more importantly, to help the city administration, assist them and and answering questions I know that.

967
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:27,588
[SPEAKER_03]: We created a whole new department.

968
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:49,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a few years ago with the former mayor that I believe when Mayor Burke came on her biggest problems were the communications, because of the pool and pond permitting system, and really have anything in place to answer the simplest questions, where can I get a, a pond pass and.

969
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:56,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that having that organizational system in place really helped that eliminated that.

970
01:09:57,515 --> 01:10:00,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you remember, during those times.

971
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:08,833
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many issues in Medford but the biggest talk the biggest concern was, how can people get a permit for the pond.

972
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:23,141
[SPEAKER_03]: When all it needed was just a simple phone number and someone to answer that question so I think that's a, you know, every point that Council night brings forward when talking about fiscal responsibility is important but to the simplest form.

973
01:10:25,735 --> 01:10:34,360
[SPEAKER_03]: asset is really to help us and the our citizens navigate who they can call when there is a concern or an issue.

974
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So I second the motion.

975
01:10:37,202 --> 01:10:37,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Council night.

976
01:10:37,702 --> 01:10:38,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

977
01:10:38,803 --> 01:10:41,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

978
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:43,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

979
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:44,966
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you're correct.

980
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:48,308
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lot of positions that are vacant and I think we need to know them.

981
01:10:49,068 --> 01:10:50,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, well, we have the chief of staff here.

982
01:10:50,989 --> 01:10:51,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

983
01:10:54,272 --> 01:11:00,196
[SPEAKER_12]: During the mayor's inauguration, she mentioned that she hired somebody for the opportunity funds.

984
01:11:01,476 --> 01:11:04,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you reveal who was hired for that position?

985
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:14,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Instinctively wanting to, Councilor Caraviello, I assume that the individual has informed her employer, but I haven't asked that question.

986
01:11:14,284 --> 01:11:20,748
[SPEAKER_10]: If you all would be willing so, I'd be happy to notify you all individually tonight before I leave.

987
01:11:21,814 --> 01:11:23,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I want to be sensitive to these types of things.

988
01:11:24,135 --> 01:11:31,559
[SPEAKER_12]: I assume by now it's two weeks before- It was announced on that day and people have been asking and I didn't know what answer to give them.

989
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:37,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll even email you all right now just so you have the information, but I want to be as sensitive as I possibly can be.

990
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:38,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

991
01:11:39,043 --> 01:11:39,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

992
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:40,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

993
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:41,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

994
01:11:41,944 --> 01:11:42,385
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good?

995
01:11:42,605 --> 01:11:42,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

996
01:11:43,545 --> 01:11:45,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other discussion on this item?

997
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion approved.

998
01:11:49,168 --> 01:11:50,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Any discussion from members of the public?

999
01:11:54,255 --> 01:11:58,439
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to approve.

1000
01:11:58,579 --> 01:11:59,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1001
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:01,422

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1003
01:12:02,803 --> 01:12:03,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

1004
01:12:03,604 --> 01:12:03,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1005
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:04,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

1006
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:05,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1007
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:06,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1008
01:12:06,707 --> 01:12:06,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1009
01:12:07,368 --> 01:12:07,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Seng?

1010
01:12:08,068 --> 01:12:08,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1011
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,210
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell?

1012
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:10,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1013
01:12:12,633 --> 01:12:13,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Harris?

1014
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:13,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1015
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:18,506
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes.

1016
01:12:18,526 --> 01:12:38,261
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-009 offered by Councilor Knight, whereas the Massachusetts Municipal Association published its January 2020 article entitled, Best Practice Guide Recommends Promoting the Public Works Profession, and whereas the Medford Public Schools Vocational Technical Education Curriculum provided cooperative education opportunities for our students,

1017
01:12:39,242 --> 01:12:54,273
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all resolved at the Medford City Council request the school administration seek opportunities to educate and promote the public works profession among younger generations by speaking to students at elementary, middle and high schools and expanding vocational programming in the areas of road maintenance drinking water and sewer infrastructure.

1018
01:12:55,093 --> 01:13:09,135
[SPEAKER_06]: urban landscaping and other related concepts, and be it further requested that the school administration identify and explore opportunities to connect classroom learning to career applications by offering hands-on projects, job shadowing, or internships with municipal departments.

1019
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:09,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Knight.

1020
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:12,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1021
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:24,136
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2019, I put forward a resolution asking that we do just this, that we expand our cooperative education opportunities in the vocational school to include some of the trades that fall within the public works sector.

1022
01:13:25,196 --> 01:13:40,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, we have an aging infrastructure and an aging workforce here in the city of Medford, and it would be nice for us to be able to cultivate some homegrown talent to bring them into our public works sphere and our public works sector so that we can continue to fill positions that become vacant.

1023
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:52,510
[SPEAKER_07]: During the Burke administration, I had the opportunity to meet with Chad Fallon, the director of the vocational school, and we had some preliminary discussions about this type of thing and expanding programming over there.

1024
01:13:52,530 --> 01:14:02,016
[SPEAKER_07]: We also met with representatives from the Laborers Program and representatives from the Teamsters Union, who represent the DPW here in the city of Medford.

1025
01:14:02,116 --> 01:14:06,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And the discussions were great, and the project was looking like it was coming around.

1026
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:08,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, the RONA happened,

1027
01:14:09,155 --> 01:14:14,179
[SPEAKER_07]: school got shut down and the expansion of opportunities for children wasn't really on the forefront of the agenda.

1028
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:20,323
[SPEAKER_07]: The agenda was making sure that we could educate our children safely, not expand opportunities.

1029
01:14:21,344 --> 01:14:23,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And this issue kind of fell by the wayside.

1030
01:14:23,185 --> 01:14:25,427
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to make this issue a priority.

1031
01:14:26,468 --> 01:14:36,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fitting that in January of 2020, they found that this is a absolute priority, the best practice from the Massachusetts Municipal Association, a group that this community is a member of.

1032
01:14:37,355 --> 01:14:48,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that this is something that we need to look at, Mr. President, and I might ask that we send it to the school administration and ask them to report back to us within 90 days as to what their findings are and whether or not this is something we can continue to pursue.

1033
01:14:48,941 --> 01:15:01,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something I think that would require some upfront funding, something that I think would be a worthwhile investment here in this community because we're going to be investing in the education of residents in the city who in turn may someday actually become the Director of Public Works.

1034
01:15:02,048 --> 01:15:27,381
[SPEAKER_07]: may actually in turn become the director of uh the superintendent of water um you know individuals that live in the community have a vested interest in the community um i've always been a firm believer in uh in having a department that's beef city residents um you know i don't think it's fair that they get in their car and drive away to where they live and i go to the supermarket and get yelled at for the job but they're not being held accountable i've always said that uh you know i've thought that um department that should be residents in other communities you'll see that as a requirement i'm not saying that's a proposal

1035
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:41,634
[SPEAKER_07]: or anything, but I'm saying if we can take this opportunity to utilize our vocational school to educate students in the public works field and put them to work here in our community, we'll have people that live in this community that have a vested interest in the success of this community, not just the paycheck.

1036
01:15:41,974 --> 01:15:46,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not saying that that's the situation our department has, but you have seen that in other communities.

1037
01:15:46,678 --> 01:15:49,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

1038
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:55,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Councillor say, I wanted to thank Councillor night for bringing this forward.

1039
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I wholeheartedly support this.

1040
01:15:58,673 --> 01:16:03,717
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that trade work is important work for community.

1041
01:16:04,257 --> 01:16:11,282
[SPEAKER_16]: It is also been shown and I think there's a wide consensus on this, that it is trade work is very vital for

1042
01:16:12,203 --> 01:16:13,784
[SPEAKER_16]: for the futures of our children.

1043
01:16:13,984 --> 01:16:22,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it presents a possible profession in the future that is well paying and sets people up for a good future.

1044
01:16:22,048 --> 01:16:28,912
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that it is super important for our city to be pursuing this as a priority.

1045
01:16:29,692 --> 01:16:32,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I also think it's important for our city to be

1046
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:41,064
[SPEAKER_16]: pushing our children or to be recommending our children, different paths in life.

1047
01:16:41,124 --> 01:16:53,009
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's important that we take our focus and bring it to the vocational and trade work as well, especially when it comes, when we consider the fact that much of this work is good union work while paying jobs.

1048
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:56,891
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we need to support our unions and build more connections with them as well.

1049
01:16:57,691 --> 01:17:01,853
[SPEAKER_16]: We also need to address existing stigmas when it comes to trade work and vocational work.

1050
01:17:03,093 --> 01:17:30,849
[SPEAKER_16]: that I know often exist in our communities, and I think stuff like this, where we have school administration building connections with students, promoting trade work, promoting public works, where we have these linkages between our city institutions and our families here in Medford, I believe that that's a way that we can overcome the stigma and to really present trade work as something that is honorable, which it is, and that's why I wholeheartedly support this.

1051
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:34,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councillor saying any further discussion.

1052
01:17:36,325 --> 01:17:53,338
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, from the chair, I definitely agree with the motion with what counts right said what Councillor saying said, and I think also that the work that's been done since I was at Medford High School to bring together the vocational side and the, the high, you know, high school in the vocational technical school together.

1053
01:17:53,825 --> 01:17:58,449
[SPEAKER_06]: and provide those opportunities to everyone that is a good stepping stone, and this could be another one.

1054
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:00,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm definitely supportive of this.

1055
01:18:01,771 --> 01:18:05,494
[SPEAKER_06]: There's motion from Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1056
01:18:06,355 --> 01:18:09,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion as amended?

1057
01:18:10,138 --> 01:18:10,758
[SPEAKER_06]: For 90 days.

1058
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:11,859
[SPEAKER_06]: For 90 days.

1059
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing anyone, any discussion from the public?

1060
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1061
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:28,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

1062
01:18:28,531 --> 01:18:28,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1063
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:30,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

1064
01:18:30,634 --> 01:18:30,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1065
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:32,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

1066
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:32,977
Yes.

1067
01:18:33,357 --> 01:18:34,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1068
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:34,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1069
01:18:35,179 --> 01:18:35,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Sang?

1070
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1071
01:18:36,481 --> 01:18:37,142
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell?

1072
01:18:37,562 --> 01:18:37,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1073
01:18:39,024 --> 01:18:39,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs?

1074
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:41,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1075
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:46,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1076
01:18:46,129 --> 01:18:47,290
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

1077
01:18:47,310 --> 01:19:03,440
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-015 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the mayor provide the council with an update on as to the status of the three cannabis licenses that have yet to be awarded.

1078
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

1079
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:17,261
[SPEAKER_12]: I did see something today that the mayor was negotiating with one of them.

1080
01:19:17,281 --> 01:19:24,085
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I'm getting a little frustrated because I see Somerville keeps adding them.

1081
01:19:24,665 --> 01:19:25,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Arlington has it now.

1082
01:19:26,206 --> 01:19:26,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Melrose has them.

1083
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:30,728
[SPEAKER_12]: We're being surrounded by other cities that have it.

1084
01:19:30,768 --> 01:19:33,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, whether we like it or not, this was voted in by the people, I think, what, 2015?

1085
01:19:36,035 --> 01:19:46,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we're one of the last communities in the Commonwealth that have approved this, that have not, have yet to open one of the campus facilities.

1086
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:56,163
[SPEAKER_12]: And we formed, we did a lot of work, the committee gave recommendations, and I think they finished back in September.

1087
01:19:56,783 --> 01:20:02,065
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're in January, and we still don't have anything concrete or open yet.

1088
01:20:02,725 --> 01:20:04,766
[SPEAKER_12]: We're leaving money on the table.

1089
01:20:06,542 --> 01:20:07,043
[SPEAKER_12]: on these things.

1090
01:20:09,724 --> 01:20:15,868
[SPEAKER_12]: It's money that can be used to fund other projects or services in the city.

1091
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:26,675
[SPEAKER_12]: If the mayor could provide us with an update of where we are with the licenses and how soon they're going to be awarded.

1092
01:20:27,776 --> 01:20:33,519
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there are companies that are paying rents for properties that they're holding and they can't operate.

1093
01:20:35,913 --> 01:20:39,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to see a report showing where we are in the status of these.

1094
01:20:39,975 --> 01:20:45,917
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we could start getting the movement, because other cities and towns are doing them.

1095
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:51,720
[SPEAKER_12]: And if these companies are ever going to build a customer base, they're going elsewhere.

1096
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,161
[SPEAKER_12]: I say Melrose has them, Arlington has it.

1097
01:20:55,221 --> 01:20:57,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Summerville, I think, has eight or nine, maybe 10.

1098
01:20:57,682 --> 01:20:58,082
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1099
01:20:58,162 --> 01:20:59,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know how many they have.

1100
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:01,084
[SPEAKER_12]: They're opening them everywhere over there.

1101
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:04,438
[SPEAKER_12]: We're right on the highway.

1102
01:21:04,518 --> 01:21:06,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, most of the people that wanted it were on the avenue.

1103
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:10,824
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I'd like to see a report.

1104
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:18,252
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know where they are, where we are on these and the status of how soon they can be up and operating.

1105
01:21:18,612 --> 01:21:20,394
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can start generating some funds on this.

1106
01:21:21,455 --> 01:21:23,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

1107
01:21:23,137 --> 01:21:24,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Any discussion from other councilors?

1108
01:21:25,953 --> 01:21:34,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say, I share counselor cables concern and frustration, as the chairman of the ordinance committee that worked long and hard on this.

1109
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:37,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this has gone inordinately too long.

1110
01:21:38,024 --> 01:21:39,605
[SPEAKER_07]: This issue should have been addressed long ago.

1111
01:21:40,185 --> 01:21:46,931
[SPEAKER_07]: These licenses should have been, you know, vetted in the host community agreement should have been negotiated we're leaving a ton of money on the table.

1112
01:21:48,272 --> 01:21:59,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hear in eight months that we don't have the money for something that we're looking for when we could have been collected $3.3 billion a year from the licensees of marijuana dispensaries here in the community.

1113
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:04,259
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the voters voted to have marijuana dispensaries here in Medford.

1114
01:22:04,799 --> 01:22:05,580
[SPEAKER_07]: The voters have spoken.

1115
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:06,480
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be implemented.

1116
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:10,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, for this council to take the steps to properly

1117
01:22:11,486 --> 01:22:27,981
[SPEAKER_07]: that the ordinance put the ordinance in place and then properly adopt the local option tax benefits for this community, so that we can see fiscal gain and still not see those fruits of our labor is frustrating, Mr. President, so I might do share the council's concern I look forward to seeing a license be issued in the near future, hopefully.

1118
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:31,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councillor night, any further discussion.

1119
01:22:31,124 --> 01:22:33,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief of staff is area.

1120
01:22:36,981 --> 01:23:00,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you just just one minor clarification I just wanted to note that the cannabis Advisory Committee voted final rankings on the final applicants not materially different from what was stated but in October, those rankings were transferred to the mayor in October, October, November, and the mayor began meetings with one of the companies in December so I just want to clarify the timeline as far as where we are today and how we got where we are.

1121
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:09,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I do believe it's important to point out that the ordinance did say that the Cannabis Advisory Commission would convene within 45 days of passage and begin the process.

1122
01:23:09,344 --> 01:23:14,725
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that they ended up falling into the compliance windows with the ordinance when it was passed.

1123
01:23:16,226 --> 01:23:16,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

1124
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:27,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And just from the chair, I did want to both say that I agree that it's important to move forward, I think, in due haste on these host community agreements.

1125
01:23:27,808 --> 01:23:30,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also did want to read, we did receive a message from

1126
01:23:30,957 --> 01:23:33,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve Smirni, the Acting Communications Director earlier today.

1127
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:41,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Councillors, in regards to Council Resolution 22-015, please see the below press release regarding potential cannabis licenses that the City will reward.

1128
01:23:42,466 --> 01:23:55,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Press release went out December 30, 2021, and the first paragraph, I won't read the whole thing, it just says, last month, the Cannabis Advisory Commission presented Mary Briana Lugo-Curran with the final ranking of nine applicants seeking to establish retail businesses in Medford.

1129
01:23:55,990 --> 01:24:02,074
[SPEAKER_06]: From this list, the mayor chose to start by interviewing the top five applicants to review and discuss parking traffic, community benefits, and other key priorities.

1130
01:24:02,595 --> 01:24:08,699
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor has already met with the highest ranking company, Theory Wellness, and has been in active discussions with its executives on a host community agreement.

1131
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:12,802
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll be meeting with representatives from the other four companies throughout the month of January.

1132
01:24:12,842 --> 01:24:16,685
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the communication that we received from the administration on that.

1133
01:24:17,906 --> 01:24:21,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion from counselors or from members of the public?

1134
01:24:23,846 --> 01:24:29,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1135
01:24:31,091 --> 01:24:33,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry, Councilor Kerrio, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1136
01:24:34,894 --> 01:24:35,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1137
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:43,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

1138
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:43,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1139
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:44,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

1140
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1141
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:46,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

1142
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:46,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1143
01:24:47,242 --> 01:24:47,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1144
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:48,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1145
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:49,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Singh?

1146
01:24:49,203 --> 01:24:49,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1147
01:24:50,404 --> 01:24:51,005
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell?

1148
01:24:51,405 --> 01:24:51,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1149
01:24:52,909 --> 01:25:07,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Ferris yes 70 affirmative zero negative motion passes 22 dash 016 offered by counselor curve yellow be it resolved that the administration share with the council it's planned to oppose the new 1800 seat arena proposed by encore casino counselor.

1150
01:25:20,663 --> 01:25:35,309
[SPEAKER_12]: For people who aren't familiar with this, Encore had agreed in their original agreements with the state not to build an arena of certain size within its domain.

1151
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:44,513
[SPEAKER_12]: And now Encore is trying to pull an end around, going around saying that they no longer,

1152
01:25:45,327 --> 01:25:50,473
[SPEAKER_12]: doing that, but a private company is going to be building this venue for them.

1153
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:56,200
[SPEAKER_12]: But it'll be convenient that this venue is going to have a walkway over to the casino.

1154
01:25:56,641 --> 01:25:59,564
[SPEAKER_12]: So they can talk all they want.

1155
01:26:00,725 --> 01:26:01,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope that

1156
01:26:02,903 --> 01:26:13,749
[SPEAKER_12]: When the Gaming Commission meets in the next couple of weeks, I hope to speak at that meeting, that they realize that all this is a sham by the wind people to hurt other communities.

1157
01:26:15,109 --> 01:26:22,173
[SPEAKER_12]: As we all know, Chevalier has been a welcome addition to our community.

1158
01:26:23,383 --> 01:26:33,146
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't just hurt your body, it hurts Lynn, it hurts Lowell, it hurts the Cabot, it hurts all these other small theaters who depend on this revenue for their downtown areas.

1159
01:26:33,186 --> 01:26:42,348
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think everyone has seen on show nights over the last three or four years that here, every restaurant in town is full, the square is alive.

1160
01:26:43,249 --> 01:26:48,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, again, it's an integral part to the downtown

1161
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,472
[SPEAKER_12]: growth of this whole city.

1162
01:26:51,172 --> 01:27:03,503
[SPEAKER_12]: And to have ONCO go in with deep pockets, and they've shown when they tried to pull this fast one before, they were hiring entertainment and they were giving away tickets.

1163
01:27:04,164 --> 01:27:08,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So all they've been trying to do is just hurt the communities that they agreed they would.

1164
01:27:08,928 --> 01:27:11,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, shame on the gaming commission for letting this happen.

1165
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:14,673
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other, the worst part of it is,

1166
01:27:16,103 --> 01:27:17,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Our legal team is represented effort.

1167
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:27,302
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't we have no legal counsel to represent the city of Medford because KP Laura also represent Everett, and they can't represent us if it's conflict of interest for them.

1168
01:27:27,863 --> 01:27:29,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So and I know.

1169
01:27:30,724 --> 01:27:45,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Blumenreit has gone out and hired his own attorney to help fight this, and I'd like to make a motion that the city propose some funding, and the mayor sent me an email earlier saying $2,500.

1170
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:47,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I correct with that amount?

1171
01:27:47,411 --> 01:27:49,411
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's what the email said.

1172
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:53,793
[SPEAKER_12]: And at least to help Mr. Blumenreit

1173
01:27:59,796 --> 01:28:06,939
[SPEAKER_12]: with his legal defense to fight this and hopefully we can form a pack with the other entities also.

1174
01:28:07,419 --> 01:28:12,661
[SPEAKER_12]: And myself being chairman of the mitigation committee for our area, I would hope that the mayor

1175
01:28:14,518 --> 01:28:24,801
[SPEAKER_12]: would go after some of that $17 million that is in the mitigation funds to, again, this is definitely damaging the city and that's what those funds are there for.

1176
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:28,123
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, I would hope that everybody weighs in.

1177
01:28:28,563 --> 01:28:32,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the gaming commission meets, not this week, but I think it's the following week.

1178
01:28:33,044 --> 01:28:35,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna try to go there to speak myself on this.

1179
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:42,567
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, all this is is an end around by the Encore people to hurt all the communities,

1180
01:28:42,963 --> 01:28:44,104
[SPEAKER_12]: that they said they weren't gonna hurt.

1181
01:28:44,564 --> 01:28:48,506
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, I would hope my fellow councilors would support this.

1182
01:28:49,186 --> 01:28:51,608
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you for the mayor for proposing some funds.

1183
01:28:52,188 --> 01:28:53,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

1184
01:28:53,389 --> 01:28:57,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the discussion of funding, is that an amendment or a B paper?

1185
01:28:58,932 --> 01:29:00,252
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a B paper.

1186
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:01,933
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you.

1187
01:29:02,033 --> 01:29:03,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Any discussion by other councilors?

1188
01:29:06,356 --> 01:29:07,997
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can, thank you.

1189
01:29:08,017 --> 01:29:10,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do respect.

1190
01:29:11,232 --> 01:29:16,394
[SPEAKER_03]: You have probably one of the wealthiest gentlemen who's asking $2,500 from the city.

1191
01:29:17,495 --> 01:29:18,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

1192
01:29:18,676 --> 01:29:19,716
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not asking for any money.

1193
01:29:21,849 --> 01:29:23,251
[SPEAKER_03]: You just said that he's asking the city.

1194
01:29:24,852 --> 01:29:29,757
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm asking that the city will help help him with, with his legal legal funds.

1195
01:29:30,538 --> 01:29:31,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, I apologize.

1196
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:33,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't even think of doing that.

1197
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:35,944
[SPEAKER_03]: When he, when he bought on listen I agree 1000%.

1198
01:29:37,025 --> 01:29:41,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I think encore is, this is a disgrace, but I also think.

1199
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:55,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a city's responsibility that if we feel that it's affecting our downtown area if this happens, and they're breaking the agreement that they had with our neighbors, then this is something the city should have our own attorney our own city solicitor at the table.

1200
01:29:55,963 --> 01:29:58,885
[SPEAKER_03]: or as well as unfortunately law represents separate.

1201
01:29:58,925 --> 01:30:00,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know, but we do have a city solicitor.

1202
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:19,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So before I vote on any money being handed off to anybody, there's gotta be some clarification that if the city solicitor can represent the city of Medford in these talks, making sure that the city of Medford is represented at this table, because it's definitely a disgrace what they're trying to do.

1203
01:30:19,821 --> 01:30:22,043
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to manipulate what the agreement was

1204
01:30:22,863 --> 01:30:33,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to hurt like you said, I care about our community but it does hurt all these small, small theaters across Massachusetts, it's going to, it's going to destroy something very very important.

1205
01:30:34,323 --> 01:30:36,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think instead of.

1206
01:30:37,402 --> 01:30:44,445
[SPEAKER_03]: assisting with $2,500 have have the representative from the Chevalier go at them their way.

1207
01:30:44,525 --> 01:30:57,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the city should really take an active approach and hire a either have the city solicitor or bring on legal team that's not KP law that's going to share

1208
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:00,019
[SPEAKER_03]: our concerns and move forward with that.

1209
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:13,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the more people that are attacking this organization and Encore, whether it's the private entity, whether it's the cities and towns that have the neighbor's agreement, that we should all focus on that.

1210
01:31:13,825 --> 01:31:14,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel that

1211
01:31:15,306 --> 01:31:33,497
[SPEAKER_03]: You know all the respect I know you're saying I just I'd rather I'd rather if you ask for money that we asked the city to go out and get a representative that will be will work for the city at the table, I'll agree with that, giving the representative Chevalier $2,500 to.

1212
01:31:34,538 --> 01:31:36,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't I can't support that we get $1 ticket.

1213
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we're getting manipulated there too.

1214
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:43,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't agree.

1215
01:31:43,982 --> 01:32:04,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't be supporting the B paper, but if it's something that we're asking the city to file and work with and ask for funding from this council to approve, to move some sort of money to the budget so they can get legal representation other than KP law to fight, I'm behind that a thousand percent.

1216
01:32:05,424 --> 01:32:12,766
[SPEAKER_12]: If I don't, I'm not opposed to having the city go out and hire an attorney that's an expert on that type of law.

1217
01:32:12,886 --> 01:32:17,727
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't, again, I don't know if the city, if they're willing to do that.

1218
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:29,589
[SPEAKER_12]: In communication with the mayor today, she was willing to help with Mr. Bloomwright's legal costs.

1219
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:35,002
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know $2,500 is not a lot of money, but it's something.

1220
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:41,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair, we heard the mayor speak, and we're so excited that the focus is going to be focusing on Meffitt Square.

1221
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:47,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're finding out that they're taking away the only piece that brings vibrant life to this community.

1222
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:52,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not going to have a standalone representative

1223
01:32:53,363 --> 01:32:57,746
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think it waters down how we truly feel about this issue.

1224
01:32:58,267 --> 01:32:59,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you agree or don't agree with me.

1225
01:32:59,948 --> 01:33:03,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree that we should have legal representation.

1226
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:10,896
[SPEAKER_03]: My recommendation is that you take that off the table, Councillor, and we ask for the mayor to hire an attorney

1227
01:33:11,376 --> 01:33:26,861
[SPEAKER_03]: or a team that's going to fight for this, this issue as a standalone issue as a representative of the city and that did not a $2,500 and we're going to follow the coattails of the gentleman who's making millions off of this community.

1228
01:33:27,421 --> 01:33:28,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you.

1229
01:33:28,622 --> 01:33:32,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a problem doing that, um, you know, there is funds I think that are available

1230
01:33:33,217 --> 01:33:45,603
[SPEAKER_12]: And from the mitigation fund that I think that we should be going after, as I say, this is definitely gonna be, if this passes, it's definitely damages our community and many other communities also.

1231
01:33:46,483 --> 01:33:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So being a partnership, I think it belittles it, to be honest.

1232
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:59,309
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's how you wanna do it that way, I don't have a problem changing it to having the mayor go out and hire a legal team.

1233
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:02,011
[SPEAKER_12]: I would support that a thousand percent.

1234
01:34:03,878 --> 01:34:04,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you both.

1235
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go with Councilor Collins.

1236
01:34:08,124 --> 01:34:08,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1237
01:34:09,466 --> 01:34:12,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Through the chair, I guess I'd like to ask for a clarification.

1238
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:17,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if that would be from Councilor Carviello and Scarpelli or Chief of Staff Mina.

1239
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,162
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my understanding that the

1240
01:34:22,162 --> 01:34:29,924
[SPEAKER_14]: $2,500 that the mayor is requesting the appropriate is for a distinct attorney to represent.

1241
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:40,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Bloom is gone out and he's had to hire an attorney that is an expert in this particular field.

1242
01:34:41,507 --> 01:34:43,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Not his regular attorney.

1243
01:34:45,629 --> 01:34:52,485
[SPEAKER_12]: again, to fight this, to fight the casino, again, who has deep pockets and

1244
01:34:54,368 --> 01:35:05,215
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, unfortunately, this is the bad part, but when you use these outside law firms, KP law, which represents us, also represents the city of Medford.

1245
01:35:05,495 --> 01:35:06,495
[SPEAKER_14]: So- Understood.

1246
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:15,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I think my confusion is around, is the sticking point here, whether this is attorney that's contracted with the city of Medford, or if it's an attorney that we are in effect sharing.

1247
01:35:15,841 --> 01:35:22,685
[SPEAKER_12]: We would be helping Mr. Blumeroy with his defense, with his legal costs.

1248
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:29,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's, you know, it's not $2,500, not a lot of money, but it is a little bit of a help for all this.

1249
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:35,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, you know, Chevalier is an integral part of our downtown community here.

1250
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:46,312
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I say, you know, if the mayor wants to go out and hire another law firm to team up with Mr. Blumwright's firm, I don't have a problem with that.

1251
01:35:46,332 --> 01:35:52,274
[SPEAKER_12]: If she wants to maybe contact the city of Lynn, Beverly, Lowell, or maybe the three cities can,

1252
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:56,288
[SPEAKER_12]: pool their money and hire an attorney.

1253
01:35:56,448 --> 01:36:17,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in favor of that also, but I do think we can't sit back and let this happen and let the people from Encore just come in and just take this away by sidestepping the law, by saying a private person is gonna build this under their auspice with a bridge

1254
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,560
[SPEAKER_12]: delivering everybody to the casino.

1255
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:27,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, if the gaming commission's foolish enough not to realize that, then shame on them also.

1256
01:36:29,263 --> 01:36:32,184
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, there is millions of dollars in the mitigation fund.

1257
01:36:32,964 --> 01:36:44,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the mayor should ask for some of that money because the mitigation fund was developed to mitigate the damages caused by the casino.

1258
01:36:44,808 --> 01:36:47,149
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I chaired that committee.

1259
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:55,088
[SPEAKER_12]: for the Gaming Commission, and I will do everything I can to help divert some of those funds this way also.

1260
01:36:56,951 --> 01:36:57,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1261
01:36:58,973 --> 01:37:02,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel like your question's been, do you have a clear understanding of what the request is?

1262
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:04,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Or would you like to hear from the Chief of Staff?

1263
01:37:05,081 --> 01:37:06,463
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to hear from the Chief of Staff, thank you.

1264
01:37:06,643 --> 01:37:07,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief of Staff Nazarian.

1265
01:37:10,009 --> 01:37:10,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1266
01:37:11,249 --> 01:37:13,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, for the question.

1267
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:26,975
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding is that the Economic Development Director, Victor Schrader, is on the Zoom call, and I'm sure he can go into further detail, but my understanding is that this is a joint agreement to be able to represent this issue jointly from all fronts.

1268
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:37,539
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding further is that there's $2,500 that's being requested at the city, $2,500 that's coming from the Chevalier Commission, $2,500 that's coming from the Chevalier Commission, and $5,000 from Mr.

1269
01:37:40,077 --> 01:37:41,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Blumenberg.

1270
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:42,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to say that wrong.

1271
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:44,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1272
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:50,028
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mr. President, I would defer to we do have Victor Schrader.

1273
01:37:55,825 --> 01:37:57,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, good evening, Council.

1274
01:37:57,486 --> 01:38:02,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chief of Staff Victor Schrader, Director of Economic Development.

1275
01:38:03,231 --> 01:38:04,872
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chief of Staff summarized that well.

1276
01:38:05,432 --> 01:38:07,254
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a joint retainer.

1277
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:17,702
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's important to join forces with Bill Blumenreich presents the commission and show a unified front.

1278
01:38:19,823 --> 01:38:23,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And really fighting for, you know, for the theater.

1279
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:31,907
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of an existential crisis and we think it's important to pull together so happy to answer any further questions you may have.

1280
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:39,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you close before you have further questions.

1281
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:40,430
[SPEAKER_14]: No further questions.

1282
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:41,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for the clarification.

1283
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:46,192
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm gonna go to Councilor Knight and then President Morrell.

1284
01:38:47,385 --> 01:38:48,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1285
01:38:49,447 --> 01:38:55,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is a perfect example why contracting out city law services is not in the best interest of our community.

1286
01:38:56,892 --> 01:38:57,173
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1287
01:38:57,713 --> 01:38:58,954
[SPEAKER_07]: The administration needs to own this.

1288
01:38:59,695 --> 01:39:00,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1289
01:39:01,076 --> 01:39:10,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, when entered into an agreement, and the agreement had a non compete clause in it that said that they would not open up an entertainment venue.

1290
01:39:10,923 --> 01:39:15,727
[SPEAKER_07]: We signed this agreement as a city, Bill Blumenreich did not sign it, the city of Medford signed it.

1291
01:39:18,026 --> 01:39:28,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we signed this mitigation agreement, that led to the city of Medford putting out an RFP for the operations of Chevalier Auditorium, because there was a non-compete in it, which led to us investing money into the auditorium, because we had a non-compete.

1292
01:39:30,093 --> 01:39:33,015
[SPEAKER_07]: The operator operates that auditorium on behalf of the city.

1293
01:39:33,195 --> 01:39:36,697
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't own it, he operates it on behalf of the city, right?

1294
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:44,942
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the agreement's been violated, or if the terms of the agreements are being stretched, it should be owned by the administration.

1295
01:39:45,633 --> 01:39:48,575
[SPEAKER_07]: because the administration's the one that signed the mitigation agreement.

1296
01:39:48,676 --> 01:39:50,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Bill Blumenreich did not sign that mitigation agreement.

1297
01:39:51,478 --> 01:39:52,439
[SPEAKER_07]: The city of Medford signed it.

1298
01:39:52,819 --> 01:39:54,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So the city of Medford should own this issue.

1299
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,742
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we shouldn't say, oh, sorry, Bill, you're on your own.

1300
01:39:57,463 --> 01:40:02,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And we certainly shouldn't say, here's 2,500 bucks, because that's not going to get you very far.

1301
01:40:02,567 --> 01:40:05,689
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you're going against Wynn Casino, where's 2,500 bucks going to get you?

1302
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:08,472
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll give you a free toaster after you go down there and put it in the slot machines.

1303
01:40:08,512 --> 01:40:11,034
[SPEAKER_07]: On Sunday, they'll call you down, have you stand in line and give you a free price.

1304
01:40:11,134 --> 01:40:12,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's not going to get us very far, 2,500.

1305
01:40:12,455 --> 01:40:13,716
[SPEAKER_07]: 5,000 isn't going to get us very far.

1306
01:40:15,502 --> 01:40:20,907
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so I can understand the need and the desire to partner with somebody that has deep pockets in Mr. Blumenreich.

1307
01:40:20,967 --> 01:40:24,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that he has a vested interest in what's happening here.

1308
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:28,334
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we need to take a step back and look at this from a little bit of a different perspective.

1309
01:40:29,168 --> 01:40:32,591
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the mitigation agreement, we never would have put out the RFP.

1310
01:40:33,272 --> 01:40:36,454
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we never put out the RFP, then Blumenreich never would have been there.

1311
01:40:36,755 --> 01:40:38,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he never would have been in the situation he's in.

1312
01:40:38,776 --> 01:40:42,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that we really need to take a bigger role and a bigger responsibility in this than just a joint partnership.

1313
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:49,586
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is something that we've been championing as elected officials as politicians as people behind this rail we've been championing.

1314
01:40:50,146 --> 01:40:52,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Shavia is everyone's greatest success story.

1315
01:40:52,468 --> 01:40:53,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's everybody.

1316
01:40:53,549 --> 01:40:54,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I built it on my back.

1317
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:55,610
[SPEAKER_07]: He built it on his back.

1318
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:56,691
[SPEAKER_07]: You brought the air conditioner.

1319
01:40:56,711 --> 01:40:57,472
[SPEAKER_07]: You brought the chairs.

1320
01:40:57,492 --> 01:41:02,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, every time anybody gets a chance to talk about Shavia, we're over here, we're giving ourselves the biggest pat on the back.

1321
01:41:02,996 --> 01:41:05,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's own the issue because now's the time to put our money where our mouth is.

1322
01:41:06,778 --> 01:41:07,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Now's the time.

1323
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:09,180
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be the catalyst for our downtown.

1324
01:41:09,781 --> 01:41:11,041
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't be pattering up with anybody.

1325
01:41:11,282 --> 01:41:13,323
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be taking the bull by the horns and we should be driving the truck.

1326
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:17,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that we're seeing a lot of that because we're subcontracting on services.

1327
01:41:20,347 --> 01:41:21,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have that institutional knowledge anymore.

1328
01:41:22,008 --> 01:41:27,932
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna end up moving backwards, not forwards.

1329
01:41:28,533 --> 01:41:32,855
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest and greatest success story of Memphis Square in the past 15 years has been Chevalier Auditorium.

1330
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:34,497
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't let this slip through our hands.

1331
01:41:35,037 --> 01:41:39,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And a payment of $5,000 or a partnership with the operator, I don't think is gonna cut it.

1332
01:41:40,012 --> 01:41:42,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to get our state delegation involved.

1333
01:41:42,994 --> 01:41:44,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I also think we need to approach this regionally.

1334
01:41:44,696 --> 01:41:48,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Councilor Caviello made up some great, great suggestions.

1335
01:41:48,599 --> 01:41:51,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the gaming commission has to be on board with this and we have to address it regionally.

1336
01:41:52,082 --> 01:41:55,865
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only a number of communities that are eligible to receive funds through the mitigation agreement.

1337
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:56,866
[SPEAKER_07]: We happen to be one of them.

1338
01:41:56,886 --> 01:41:58,727
[SPEAKER_07]: We happen to be very fortunate to be one of them.

1339
01:41:58,747 --> 01:42:02,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be capitalizing on that and we should be doing it today, not tomorrow, not later on.

1340
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:06,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And certainly not in partnership and certainly not in second seat.

1341
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:09,582
[SPEAKER_07]: because this city signed the agreement, nobody else.

1342
01:42:10,062 --> 01:42:10,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's own the issue.

1343
01:42:11,863 --> 01:42:13,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to talking about this issue further.

1344
01:42:13,724 --> 01:42:15,485
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is something that we need to address.

1345
01:42:15,845 --> 01:42:16,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate Victor's office.

1346
01:42:17,025 --> 01:42:21,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that Victor's been on top of a lot of the things that are happening in this community when it comes to economic development.

1347
01:42:21,668 --> 01:42:25,430
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very big concern for me, a very big concern for me.

1348
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:28,091
[SPEAKER_07]: If Chevalier fails, the square fails.

1349
01:42:30,082 --> 01:42:34,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And quite frankly, it's only hanging on by a thread right now we haven't seen too much going on down here.

1350
01:42:35,365 --> 01:42:44,888
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor announced a big plan at her State of the Union inauguration the other day about putting out an RFI for what we can do to this downtown to redevelop it.

1351
01:42:45,269 --> 01:42:48,250
[SPEAKER_07]: The linchpin of the redevelopment of this downtown is that auditorium.

1352
01:42:49,031 --> 01:42:56,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to do all that we can and invest whatever resources we have and pursue whatever funding possibilities are available to us to make sure that it remains successful.

1353
01:42:57,238 --> 01:42:58,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1354
01:42:58,459 --> 01:43:00,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello for bringing this issue forward.

1355
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1356
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:02,402
[SPEAKER_07]: President Morrell.

1357
01:43:03,303 --> 01:43:04,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Baird.

1358
01:43:04,964 --> 01:43:07,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I echo some of the same concerns of my fellow councilors.

1359
01:43:08,327 --> 01:43:15,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate your efforts in this Councilor Caviello and I of course have no, you know, $2,500 is very much small potatoes.

1360
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:40,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, as my counselors fellow counselors have said I have great concerns that we're not seeing a full plan of how this is being addressed how the city is leading in this issue so I wouldn't feel comfortable taking a vote on any appropriation until we know what the full plan of approaches and how we're going to deal with this, and my fellow counselors have said it better than I could, but I just want to agree with them and say that it's not anti your efforts around this but it's just

1361
01:43:41,121 --> 01:43:47,923
[SPEAKER_11]: there needs to be much more work to make sure we do this right and we fight this in the right way and the council's aware of how this is being approached.

1362
01:43:48,323 --> 01:43:49,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's all I have.

1363
01:43:49,684 --> 01:43:50,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1364
01:43:52,225 --> 01:43:57,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you President Morrell, just if I may, from the chair before we everyone's had a shot I haven't been able to say anything.

1365
01:43:58,087 --> 01:44:01,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm learning very quickly what this means to be sitting up here.

1366
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:05,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna say that I actually agree with everything.

1367
01:44:05,201 --> 01:44:08,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with everyone on probably most of what everybody said.

1368
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:11,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do think we're kind of in a bit of a conundrum here, cause I think this is important.

1369
01:44:11,803 --> 01:44:12,623
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta fight this.

1370
01:44:13,123 --> 01:44:15,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we need to find the best path forward to fight this.

1371
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:23,325
[SPEAKER_06]: My one, I think we may be graced by the fact that there is not an appropriation on the agenda tonight.

1372
01:44:23,445 --> 01:44:29,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that we can vote on money that hasn't been requested by the mayor and put on the agenda.

1373
01:44:29,126 --> 01:44:30,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we have until,

1374
01:44:32,026 --> 01:44:46,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we don't have much time but we have, if, if we want to get to an answer here, you know, a motion could be put forward from the mayor to appropriate certain funds on our next agenda but I just wanted to put it out there that we do not have an appropriation on the agenda tonight, I don't think we do not have the power to create one.

1375
01:44:47,176 --> 01:44:53,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just wanted to say that I then saw, Councilor Carvialho we do have some members of the public who want to speak but you first Councilor.

1376
01:44:56,022 --> 01:44:56,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1377
01:44:57,932 --> 01:45:05,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had the opportunity to speak representative Donato, and I know he's been in touch with the members of the gaming commission I've talked with Joe Delaney.

1378
01:45:06,794 --> 01:45:13,195
[SPEAKER_12]: He's my contact that the gaming commission on the mitigation funds, but Victor is Victor still on the call.

1379
01:45:14,815 --> 01:45:15,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1380
01:45:18,676 --> 01:45:20,756
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on he's he should be on mute.

1381
01:45:21,356 --> 01:45:21,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1382
01:45:21,577 --> 01:45:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

1383
01:45:25,233 --> 01:45:26,594
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've talked to Victor many times.

1384
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:29,036
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Victor's been working diligently on this.

1385
01:45:29,516 --> 01:45:40,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Victor, are we talking to the other communities also, like Lane and Lowell and Beverly, to form some type of a coalition or something like that also?

1386
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:42,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We are.

1387
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Outreach has been made.

1388
01:45:43,651 --> 01:45:45,011
[SPEAKER_01]: John Costas is on the call.

1389
01:45:45,031 --> 01:45:47,212
[SPEAKER_01]: He's helped us reach out to those communities.

1390
01:45:47,252 --> 01:45:49,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a call tomorrow at 5 p.m.

1391
01:45:50,073 --> 01:45:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: with the managers of the theaters in those communities to strategize.

1392
01:45:55,495 --> 01:45:57,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this goes to President

1393
01:45:57,756 --> 01:45:59,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Morales question about what the bigger picture is.

1394
01:46:01,358 --> 01:46:02,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that effort.

1395
01:46:03,219 --> 01:46:13,744
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, we've been in touch with the Gaming Commission encouraging them to allow to hear this issue and allow for public input on this issue.

1396
01:46:14,504 --> 01:46:17,646
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a meeting of the Gaming Commission.

1397
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:19,307
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's next.

1398
01:46:20,688 --> 01:46:26,914
[SPEAKER_01]: January 12th to hear from Encore about their plans for this theater.

1399
01:46:28,696 --> 01:46:40,548
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that's an important opportunity to kind of make our initial statement and state our case with respect to the Gaming Act and why this should not be allowed.

1400
01:46:41,609 --> 01:46:42,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we were

1401
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hopeful that we can move forward with bringing on some legal help to make that case, because time is of the essence.

1402
01:46:55,990 --> 01:47:02,471
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a public comment period, but the Gaming Commission is acting quickly.

1403
01:47:02,651 --> 01:47:06,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And we learned about this proposal

1404
01:47:07,132 --> 01:47:11,696
[SPEAKER_01]: In late December, it's already before the Everett Zoning Board.

1405
01:47:12,597 --> 01:47:14,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are moving quickly.

1406
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:16,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Victor.

1407
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:21,404
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like you said, you know, Encore is driving the bus on this.

1408
01:47:21,985 --> 01:47:24,127
[SPEAKER_12]: And meanwhile, they're telling you they're not driving the bus on this.

1409
01:47:24,747 --> 01:47:27,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, they're saying, well, we don't have anything to do with it.

1410
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:30,372
[SPEAKER_12]: But they're the ones proposing this theater.

1411
01:47:30,712 --> 01:47:33,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, they tried to do this

1412
01:47:35,653 --> 01:47:41,994
[SPEAKER_12]: pre pandemic and, and it kind of got quelled and now like I said, it's red, it's like we had again.

1413
01:47:42,514 --> 01:47:52,336
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this is like Councilor Knight said, you know, we signed the agreement not building right with them and we have to, we have to own this.

1414
01:47:52,876 --> 01:47:58,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, you know, if this is as vital as everybody says it is, it needs immediate attention now.

1415
01:47:59,117 --> 01:48:01,017
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, you know, these, this is moving quick.

1416
01:48:01,978 --> 01:48:03,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Every, every schooling for this.

1417
01:48:04,672 --> 01:48:25,392
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, y'all, again, to have them do this and overpay for acts that none of these other cities are ever gonna be able to get again is an out and out disgrace and shame on the gaming commission if they allow this to happen and they should all be fired if they do allow this to happen.

1418
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:35,743
[SPEAKER_01]: President Caravaglia, if I may, I think the strategy on Encore's part is to hope that no one notices.

1419
01:48:36,603 --> 01:48:50,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to notice and make sure they know that we're aware of it and that they're acting outside of the parameters of the gaming act and come with a solid legal argument against what they're doing.

1420
01:48:50,486 --> 01:48:55,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means we need to act now because that meeting is, the initial meeting is next week.

1421
01:48:56,562 --> 01:48:57,043
[SPEAKER_12]: That's correct.

1422
01:48:57,103 --> 01:48:58,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it is.

1423
01:48:58,326 --> 01:49:03,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I think on the meeting that I was on with you a few weeks ago, I think they said it was going to be on the 12th.

1424
01:49:03,957 --> 01:49:06,342
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, time is of the essence here.

1425
01:49:07,302 --> 01:49:13,766
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I think we need to rally up and make sure that our state delegation also fights for us on this.

1426
01:49:13,826 --> 01:49:19,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Representative Donato has had conversation with the Gaming Commission people already.

1427
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:25,553
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, this is a really important issue here.

1428
01:49:26,774 --> 01:49:31,777
[SPEAKER_12]: To sit back and do nothing would be an out and out shame for us and to allow this to happen.

1429
01:49:34,417 --> 01:49:42,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody sees what it's done for the community when it was working the way it was supposed to be working, and hopefully it will continue to work the way it is.

1430
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:51,463
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the money that we got in meal taxes during the time that the theater was operating, we saw.

1431
01:49:51,843 --> 01:50:00,866
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, an investment in legal fees, the money would only come back in revenue into the city.

1432
01:50:02,577 --> 01:50:07,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councillor, just, I'm going to go to Council, but I just want to make this point clear.

1433
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:24,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand time is of the essence, I understand this was found out in late December and this is our first council meeting since then, there's no appropriation before this council tonight, we cannot create an appropriation, regardless of the timeframe, so, so we cannot appropriate money tonight for this effort, because it just

1434
01:50:25,736 --> 01:50:28,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have the American come back with a paper next week.

1435
01:50:28,299 --> 01:50:28,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1436
01:50:28,599 --> 01:50:30,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that was an appropriation on it.

1437
01:50:30,322 --> 01:50:30,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1438
01:50:30,642 --> 01:50:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, you know, I want to make it clear to everybody tonight that we can't.

1439
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:36,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1440
01:50:36,829 --> 01:50:39,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President, I think that to reiterate

1441
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:53,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important that we as a council stand together and strong and asking the mayor to not come back with $2,500 next week, but to come back as a standalone battle against Encore and the gaming commission.

1442
01:50:54,009 --> 01:51:01,274
[SPEAKER_03]: So they know that there are two different entities coming out of this community going after what they're trying to do here.

1443
01:51:01,394 --> 01:51:02,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's that important.

1444
01:51:02,895 --> 01:51:04,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the other piece looking down the line,

1445
01:51:07,322 --> 01:51:19,611
[SPEAKER_03]: If this doesn't work in our favor, who's to say the person we're going into partnership with to battle this issue doesn't want to break a contract and then we find ourselves in a legal battle with that group.

1446
01:51:20,211 --> 01:51:25,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think working together would be a huge, huge disservice to our community.

1447
01:51:25,415 --> 01:51:26,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, again,

1448
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:40,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't as articulate and obviously it's Councilor Council night, but it's imperative that we are a standalone entity as a city of Medford fighting for the agreement that was put together and.

1449
01:51:41,844 --> 01:51:50,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I were the mayor, I would really love to have a conversation with with Mayor de Maria over and ever and ask him, is this the way we want to do business because I think that.

1450
01:51:54,008 --> 01:51:58,150
[SPEAKER_03]: They realize the impact the negative impact their paint these neighbor communities.

1451
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:02,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the way partnership I want to work with the neighboring neighboring administration.

1452
01:52:02,632 --> 01:52:03,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you, Mr. President.

1453
01:52:04,973 --> 01:52:05,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1454
01:52:06,114 --> 01:52:18,520
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to members of the public in a minute but I would agree that, you know, considering this hearing is on the 12th our next meeting is on the 11th, I think it would be probably a good move in the short term to have the city

1455
01:52:19,038 --> 01:52:26,041
[SPEAKER_06]: solicitor represent us, at least in that initial engagement while we get another plan back here to address this fully.

1456
01:52:26,061 --> 01:52:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my opinion.

1457
01:52:27,162 --> 01:52:29,723
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got two members of the public who want to speak.

1458
01:52:30,003 --> 01:52:33,665
[SPEAKER_06]: First, Mr. John Costas, please give your name and address for the record.

1459
01:52:37,467 --> 01:52:38,508
[SPEAKER_06]: You can unmute yourself, John.

1460
01:52:38,908 --> 01:52:39,268
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1461
01:52:39,308 --> 01:52:39,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1462
01:52:40,208 --> 01:52:40,789
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

1463
01:52:41,189 --> 01:52:41,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1464
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:45,471
[SPEAKER_00]: John Costas, 19 Salem Street, Medford.

1465
01:52:46,788 --> 01:52:54,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay, so I've been involved in the theater since 1981 when they were going to make a parking lot out of the entire high school.

1466
01:52:55,835 --> 01:53:00,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we worked really, really hard for over 40 years to get it to where it is today.

1467
01:53:00,799 --> 01:53:13,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the civic commission did a really great job bringing it up to a level of professionalism and having Bill Blumenreich presents run and operate the theater just brought it that much further.

1468
01:53:14,484 --> 01:53:19,227
[SPEAKER_00]: For many, many, many years, we were getting a lot of complaints, so when can we do more with the theater?

1469
01:53:19,247 --> 01:53:20,468
[SPEAKER_00]: The theater's not doing enough.

1470
01:53:21,649 --> 01:53:28,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we've had a very, very successful run, it's really disappointing to hear what Encore wants to do.

1471
01:53:29,393 --> 01:53:42,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've been in touch with Lynn Lowell, the Cabot Theater, and they're all very, very much concerned about what Encore could do to all the surrounding theaters, including some of the smaller Boston theaters.

1472
01:53:44,423 --> 01:53:50,906
[SPEAKER_00]: 1800 seats is kind of a good number for them, but it will put out, it's not just a City of Medford issue.

1473
01:53:51,686 --> 01:53:53,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Lynn and Lowell has a lot to lose by it.

1474
01:53:54,447 --> 01:53:56,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to participate somehow.

1475
01:53:57,189 --> 01:54:01,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having, as Victor said, we have, I set up a meeting with them for tomorrow.

1476
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:07,853
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ideas was to get the theater managers together to summarize a plan

1477
01:54:08,796 --> 01:54:21,862
[SPEAKER_00]: and have each theater manager of each city talk to their respective mayors and discuss a plan on getting together, because I think that separating it is not a good idea.

1478
01:54:22,402 --> 01:54:34,508
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if we can get all the surrounding communities involved and show up as one large group of people, A, we'll have a lot more money to deal with and we can get more bang for our buck.

1479
01:54:35,833 --> 01:54:43,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three or four cities coming before the Gaming Commission as a unified front is the best approach we can go with right now.

1480
01:54:44,599 --> 01:55:01,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to see us pursue the rest of the legal work through the professional attorney that was just suggested to us that as of right now, the fee is going to be split between Bill and the commission.

1481
01:55:02,583 --> 01:55:05,624
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully the city can add part of their funds to it as well.

1482
01:55:07,125 --> 01:55:14,367
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also agree that this isn't just a Bill Blumenberg problem, because we need them, they need us.

1483
01:55:15,288 --> 01:55:23,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to work well with them and we can't throw Bill Blumenberg under the bus and say, well, you get more money than we do, so you do it.

1484
01:55:24,051 --> 01:55:26,052
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all of us working together.

1485
01:55:26,752 --> 01:55:31,814
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever funding the mayor requests, I think it'd be to the city's best interest

1486
01:55:32,692 --> 01:55:37,116
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with one attorney and hopefully the surrounding communities.

1487
01:55:37,616 --> 01:55:37,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1488
01:55:39,938 --> 01:55:41,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Kostas.

1489
01:55:41,179 --> 01:55:41,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Navarro?

1490
01:55:42,701 --> 01:55:44,402
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the surrounding communities.

1491
01:55:44,903 --> 01:55:45,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1492
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1493
01:55:47,465 --> 01:55:50,027
[SPEAKER_09]: William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1494
01:55:50,688 --> 01:55:52,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to make a quick point.

1495
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:55,972
[SPEAKER_09]: It was echoing what Councillor Knight said.

1496
01:55:56,998 --> 01:56:10,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's worth taking the opportunity sometime before the budget happens to to look at the KP law situation, because I remember that was this relationship with KP law was established right before the pandemic.

1497
01:56:10,904 --> 01:56:12,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it got a lot of attention.

1498
01:56:12,264 --> 01:56:16,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember it was sort of one of those things that we were sort of iffy on and it sort of happened.

1499
01:56:17,077 --> 01:56:19,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think very many members of the public are aware of it.

1500
01:56:20,421 --> 01:56:23,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it probably even the new councilors aren't.

1501
01:56:23,825 --> 01:56:31,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think it'd be good if there was sort of a discussion to evaluate how that's going, especially from the perspective of the city council.

1502
01:56:31,474 --> 01:56:34,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that was proposed by the city to have this KP law.

1503
01:56:34,818 --> 01:56:38,702
[SPEAKER_09]: But from the perspective of the city council, it seems like every time we hear about it, it's bad news.

1504
01:56:39,283 --> 01:56:47,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'd be worth hearing about that, updating the public and just enumerating how that's working for you guys.

1505
01:56:47,571 --> 01:56:47,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

1506
01:56:48,812 --> 01:56:49,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Navarro.

1507
01:56:50,013 --> 01:56:53,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ken Kraus, name and address for the record once I unmute you.

1508
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,481
[SPEAKER_06]: All yours, Ken.

1509
01:56:58,529 --> 01:57:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street, Medford.

1510
01:57:02,395 --> 01:57:11,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also the treasurer of the Francis Schweier Auditorium and the president of the Schweier Theater Organ Society and have been engaged in this

1511
01:57:13,249 --> 01:57:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: issue for the last six weeks or so when it came to light actually in the newspaper.

1512
01:57:18,693 --> 01:57:33,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank Councilor Caraballo for bringing this up and also agree with the sentiment that the city needs to be aggressive in the lead on this in terms of opposing this from whatever angles that needs to legally or otherwise.

1513
01:57:34,297 --> 01:57:48,487
[SPEAKER_02]: The city owns the building, of course, and the city has the agreement with Wynn that Wynn agreed to provide ongoing support for Shibata Theater, and clearly it's not doing this in this case.

1514
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with what John said as well, that it's important that we work together with Bill Blumenreich.

1515
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:04,602
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done a sensational job operating this building, and we would do well to continue to have that relationship.

1516
01:58:04,682 --> 01:58:15,905
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a five-year initial contract that's approaching the fifth year, and it would be good for this relationship, I think, to remain strong.

1517
01:58:16,546 --> 01:58:21,667
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the option to not stay on as the operator after five years.

1518
01:58:22,157 --> 01:58:39,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, if the wind project goes through, it'll be hard to get anybody, I think, to run Chevalier Theatre, because the gambling casino rules state that the licensee cannot build a

1519
01:58:40,565 --> 01:58:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: venue for entertainment purposes of between 1,000 seats and 3,500.

1520
01:58:46,650 --> 01:58:48,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be less than that or more.

1521
01:58:48,792 --> 01:59:05,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Councilor Caravaglia mentioned in 2019, Wynn started to book shows in their ballroom like the B-52s and Smokey Robinson acts paying twice and three times as much what Bill Blumenreich would pay for them here.

1522
01:59:05,925 --> 01:59:09,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was Bill actually that called this to the attention of the gaming commission.

1523
01:59:10,609 --> 01:59:13,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And Encore backed down on that.

1524
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:30,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But subsequently, they began to purchase, Wynn Resorts began to purchase parcel after parcel across the street from the casino with the intention of creating an entertainment and restaurant district, which is what you see being presented right now.

1525
01:59:31,677 --> 01:59:39,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I attended the Everett Planning Board meeting in December when Wynn Casino made one of its presentations.

1526
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:43,421
[SPEAKER_02]: They made no bones about that they were Wynn Resorts.

1527
01:59:43,701 --> 01:59:50,484
[SPEAKER_02]: The president, Chris Gordon, introduced himself as Wynn Resorts, and that Wynn Resorts was building the development.

1528
01:59:50,664 --> 01:59:54,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said the key piece is the pedestrian walkway that connects both venues.

1529
01:59:55,586 --> 02:00:01,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's clearly a connection in addition to the casino complex.

1530
02:00:02,008 --> 02:00:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: The law, again, states that the licensee cannot build

1531
02:00:06,545 --> 02:00:08,426
[SPEAKER_02]: a entertainment venue of that size.

1532
02:00:08,506 --> 02:00:19,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the way I and many others read this law, they can build the entertainment venue, but it has to be either 999 seats or 3,501 seats.

1533
02:00:20,175 --> 02:00:32,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just think that it's important that we, as a city, fight this every way possible, in partnership with Bell, Bloom, and Rice, and that we do it

1534
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:37,153
[SPEAKER_02]: hastily because the meetings are coming up in the next week and two weeks.

1535
02:00:37,513 --> 02:00:37,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1536
02:00:42,276 --> 02:00:45,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion from the council.

1537
02:00:47,218 --> 02:00:48,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion from members of the public.

1538
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:54,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I see more Carol, I'm going to unmute you please give us your name and address for the record.

1539
02:01:01,586 --> 02:01:05,329
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also president of the Chamber of Commerce.

1540
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:11,434
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd like to thank Councilor Caravaglio and the fellow councilors for bringing this issue up.

1541
02:01:12,174 --> 02:01:21,141
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't emphasize enough on the economic factor that Chevalier has brought, not only just to Memphis Square, but the outlining squares also.

1542
02:01:21,161 --> 02:01:24,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone has reaped benefits from it.

1543
02:01:24,904 --> 02:01:27,426
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it behooves the city

1544
02:01:28,569 --> 02:01:41,361
[SPEAKER_15]: to work in any way in conjunction either with Bill Blumeride or on their own, but to be able to make a stand against this kind of venue that Wynn is proposing.

1545
02:01:43,663 --> 02:01:44,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for bringing it up.

1546
02:01:47,166 --> 02:01:48,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Carroll.

1547
02:01:48,287 --> 02:01:50,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

1548
02:01:50,189 --> 02:01:52,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Vic, your hand's still up.

1549
02:01:52,171 --> 02:01:53,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to speak again?

1550
02:01:53,332 --> 02:01:54,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Vic.

1551
02:01:59,312 --> 02:01:59,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1552
02:02:00,233 --> 02:02:03,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Just two points that I think are important that I forgot to mention.

1553
02:02:04,295 --> 02:02:14,182
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the legal agreement in partnership with Bill Bumenreich and the commission, it would be a limited engagement.

1554
02:02:14,242 --> 02:02:20,566
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just an opportunity to act quickly and get a response in

1555
02:02:22,287 --> 02:02:24,289
[SPEAKER_01]: conjunction with the timing of the gaming commission.

1556
02:02:24,349 --> 02:02:36,001
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to pursue a more in-depth legal action, we can change course at any point and certainly work with the council on that.

1557
02:02:36,742 --> 02:02:38,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to mention that.

1558
02:02:38,244 --> 02:02:42,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the source of funds for this would be

1559
02:02:43,409 --> 02:02:45,430
[SPEAKER_01]: through the city solicitor's office.

1560
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:54,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as a point of clarification, I'm not sure if that's requires an appropriation or if it's just general support of the council.

1561
02:02:54,996 --> 02:03:02,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave that to folks that maybe understand that a little bit more than me, but I just want to bring that up as a point.

1562
02:03:02,621 --> 02:03:02,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1563
02:03:07,088 --> 02:03:07,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start earlier.

1564
02:03:08,549 --> 02:03:08,809
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1565
02:03:09,689 --> 02:03:10,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Victor.

1566
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:31,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean if the money has already been appropriated, then, then it's at the discretion of the mayor to use that money for this effort if she so chooses, or to come back before us in the future with an appropriation and additional appropriation so given that, I think, Councilor Kerrio that would mean that you would draw the big paper.

1567
02:03:33,326 --> 02:03:41,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have on the initial paper, be it resolved, and again, just from the chair, I agree that we should strongly be opposing this effort.

1568
02:03:43,289 --> 02:03:44,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Councilor Kerriolo.

1569
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:52,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I think we all got an email from the mayor earlier suggesting that she'd be willing to put in funds.

1570
02:03:53,332 --> 02:03:55,653
[SPEAKER_12]: I think everyone should have gotten that email earlier today.

1571
02:03:56,173 --> 02:03:57,634
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thank the mayor for stepping up.

1572
02:03:58,234 --> 02:04:00,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's not a lot of money, but it's a start.

1573
02:04:03,725 --> 02:04:07,969
[SPEAKER_12]: to sit back and do nothing would be a disgrace to the community.

1574
02:04:09,410 --> 02:04:15,015
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just vital for the growth of our community.

1575
02:04:15,035 --> 02:04:28,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And the small amount of money we put up, we certainly got more than that back when meals taxes and people just coming into the community, spending money here on all avenues.

1576
02:04:28,066 --> 02:04:29,106
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1577
02:04:29,227 --> 02:04:30,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, just from the chair, I think

1578
02:04:31,713 --> 02:04:38,539
[SPEAKER_06]: We all agree on the benefit of Chevalier that need to fight this, the fact that Encore should not be doing this, and it's a clear violation of their agreement.

1579
02:04:38,919 --> 02:04:47,246
[SPEAKER_06]: There may be some, I tend to agree with Councilor Scarpelli on some of the questions around who's paying for what, but certainly I personally am supportive.

1580
02:04:47,406 --> 02:04:53,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, like Mr. Crow said, Mr. Blumleit's agreement is up.

1581
02:04:53,110 --> 02:04:53,951
[SPEAKER_12]: We're on the fifth year.

1582
02:04:53,971 --> 02:04:56,313
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd hate to see the guy walk out of town.

1583
02:04:56,333 --> 02:05:01,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I'd say if this goes through, I mean, it's essentially,

1584
02:05:02,165 --> 02:05:04,346
[SPEAKER_12]: The guys that the guys that have business in the city of metric.

1585
02:05:05,006 --> 02:05:05,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Gotcha.

1586
02:05:06,707 --> 02:05:26,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio any further discussion, seeing none online see now in the room on the motion of Councilor Caravaglio the a paper be it resolved that the administration share with the council it's planned to oppose the new 1800 seat arena proposed by the encore casino proposed by Councilor Caravaglio seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1587
02:05:33,373 --> 02:05:33,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1588
02:05:33,573 --> 02:05:33,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1589
02:05:34,034 --> 02:05:34,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1590
02:05:44,242 --> 02:06:03,876

02:06:06,924 --> 02:06:11,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to send my condolences to former Mayor Burke on the passing of her mother.

1593
02:06:12,066 --> 02:06:16,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the years, I got to meet her mother on several occasions, a wonderful woman.

1594
02:06:17,108 --> 02:06:20,530
[SPEAKER_12]: She lived a nice life, I think 96 years old.

1595
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:29,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I just wanted to send my condolences to the Burke family and their presence in our community will be missed.

[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1599
02:06:33,164 --> 02:06:36,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I echo Councilor Caviello's sentiments.

1600
02:06:36,607 --> 02:06:41,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the opportunity to meet Nina over the years, and she was a wonderful person, a joy to be around, and she always lit up the room.

1601
02:06:42,471 --> 02:06:44,272
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't know it, but she had quite the sense of humor.

1602
02:06:45,493 --> 02:06:48,475
[SPEAKER_07]: My condolences to Stephen and Stephanie, and Brian, Ryan, and Brie.

1603
02:06:49,055 --> 02:06:51,777
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a tough time, and just know that we're thinking of you.

1604
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:54,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1605
02:06:54,579 --> 02:06:55,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight and Councilor

1608
02:07:02,678 --> 02:07:07,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that losing my mommy, you realize the perspective you have.

1609
02:07:07,999 --> 02:07:14,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially when you're an elected official, I think that you realize that your mom is your number one fan.

1610
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:25,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that Mia Burke's mom was definitely her number one fan, and we send our condolences and best wishes.

1611
02:07:27,467 --> 02:07:29,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion, Councilor Sagan?

1612
02:07:29,908 --> 02:07:36,231
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think I ever got to meet Lena, but I know Mayor Burke very well, former Mayor Burke very well.

1613
02:07:36,691 --> 02:07:38,632
[SPEAKER_16]: I know how dedicated she is to our city.

1614
02:07:38,672 --> 02:07:40,473
[SPEAKER_16]: I know how excellent of a person she is.

1615
02:07:40,813 --> 02:07:47,116
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, it takes parents to make someone such an incredible person.

1616
02:07:47,156 --> 02:07:54,880
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I know that mothers are important and I send her my deepest condolences.

1617
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:08,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councillor, and from the Chair, I also, you know, am friends with the former Mayor Burke and the Burke family, and I know that the role that Lena played in their life.

1618
02:08:09,148 --> 02:08:17,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very grateful to see a great grandchild recently, and just a very loving and kind family and caring family to each other.

1619
02:08:17,414 --> 02:08:19,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So I extend my condolences as well.

1620
02:08:19,936 --> 02:08:22,037
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a couple other condolence resolutions.

1621
02:08:22,097 --> 02:08:27,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if we could go through them and then take a moment of silence after we go through those, if everyone's okay with that.

1622
02:08:28,075 --> 02:08:28,775
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you.

1623
02:08:29,295 --> 02:08:31,236

[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1645
02:09:12,643 --> 02:09:16,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, Barbara Sloan was the matriarch of the Sloan family.

1646
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:21,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Sloan family was a long time business, Century Bank in Medford.

1647
02:09:21,925 --> 02:09:25,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've got to meet Mrs. Sloan on many occasions.

1648
02:09:27,998 --> 02:09:33,284
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to talk with Barry and his family when their mother passed.

1649
02:09:33,624 --> 02:09:39,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, just want to send our condolences from the city to the Sloan family and the passing of Barbara.

1650
02:09:40,438 --> 02:09:41,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

1651
02:09:41,819 --> 02:09:42,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

1652
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nye.

1653
02:09:44,321 --> 02:09:47,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President, I echo, again, Councilor Carviello's sentiments.

1654
02:09:48,644 --> 02:10:06,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, had the pleasure of meeting Barbara on a number of occasions throughout my tenure in service, and she was a great person, someone who certainly put her community first, someone who gave a lot to the City of Metroton and the City of Somerville as the matriarch of the Sloan family in Century Bank.

1655
02:10:07,519 --> 02:10:08,180
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at

1656
02:10:09,287 --> 02:10:16,050
[SPEAKER_07]: and the beautiful job that they did out in front of Century Bank, the old Century Bank location used to be Papageno's.

1657
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:22,452
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see that that's dedicated to her and it's just a beautiful testament to that person that she was and what was important to her community.

1658
02:10:23,092 --> 02:10:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, my condolences also go out to the Sloan family during that time of need.

1659
02:10:27,634 --> 02:10:28,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1660
02:10:28,494 --> 02:10:29,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

1661
02:10:31,995 --> 02:10:36,337
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Kerrio and seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1662
02:10:39,262 --> 02:10:39,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1663
02:10:39,342 --> 02:10:39,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1664
02:10:39,422 --> 02:10:39,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1665
02:10:51,398 --> 02:10:52,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President bears.

1666
02:10:52,379 --> 02:10:58,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none of the negative promotion passes 22 dash 020 offered by counselor night.

1667
02:10:58,922 --> 02:11:06,026
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so resolved that the Medford City Council extended deep and sincere condolences to the family of Eugene martini on his recent past and counselor night.

1668
02:11:06,406 --> 02:11:14,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, yes I'd like to take an opportunity to extend my condolences and ask my council colleagues to do the same to the family of Eugene McKinney.

1669
02:11:14,611 --> 02:11:17,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of us behind this rail have been involved in the challenge of baseball tournament.

1670
02:11:18,877 --> 02:11:21,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the product of the McKinney-Falasca family.

1671
02:11:22,239 --> 02:11:37,830
[SPEAKER_07]: The McKinneys and the Falascas have done a great job in this community, dedicating themselves, helping run the Challenger League for the last 25 years, raising countless funds for the Challenger League, and making sure that it was able to continue for the better part of 30 years, Mr. President.

1672
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:45,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, they recently lost their father, and I'd like to extend this offer of condolences to the family during that time.

1673
02:11:47,747 --> 02:11:49,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you counselor night any further discussion.

1674
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:58,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing that on the motion of counselor night seconded by saying to my counselor scar Pelley Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1675
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:05,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1676
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:06,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1677
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:06,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1678
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:07,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1679
02:12:17,855 --> 02:12:18,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Ferris.

1680
02:12:18,837 --> 02:12:20,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative.

1681
02:12:21,763 --> 02:12:22,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1682
02:12:22,445 --> 02:12:23,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone could rise for a moment of silence.

1683
02:12:46,417 --> 02:12:49,999
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-019 offered by Councilor Carviello.

1684
02:12:50,059 --> 02:12:54,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council provide COVID home tests to the residents of Medford.

1685
02:12:54,922 --> 02:12:56,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Carviello.

1686
02:12:57,583 --> 02:12:58,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1687
02:13:00,424 --> 02:13:07,028
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is something I think everyone's out, CVS, Walgreens, everyone's looking to go out and buy these.

1688
02:13:07,108 --> 02:13:12,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think residents of the community are a little upset that other communities have gotten them.

1689
02:13:14,291 --> 02:13:16,112
[SPEAKER_12]: And we haven't gotten any, and we haven't gotten them.

1690
02:13:18,333 --> 02:13:33,984
[SPEAKER_12]: I would hope that the mayor, through her contact with ABLE and through the APRA funds, can hopefully arrange to purchase some home testing kits to give out to the residents of Medford so they can stay on top of this during this tough time.

1691
02:13:34,004 --> 02:13:41,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're a little bit pricey, $25 to $35 to go out and buy one, if you can even find them.

1692
02:13:42,411 --> 02:13:45,077
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, I know the community is giving it for free.

1693
02:13:45,578 --> 02:13:47,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I know people in New Hampshire are getting them.

1694
02:13:47,541 --> 02:13:48,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Every family got eight in New Hampshire.

1695
02:13:50,217 --> 02:14:04,221
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would hope that the mayor, through her contacts, would be able to go out and purchase some and make them available to the residents of Memphis, so we can stay on top of the situation and try to keep it under control.

1696
02:14:04,461 --> 02:14:07,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we can't keep running up to the hospital to get these done.

1697
02:14:07,602 --> 02:14:13,704
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I said, the availability of CVS and drugstores throughout the whole area, next to impossible to find.

1698
02:14:13,724 --> 02:14:16,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So I reach out to the mayor,

1699
02:14:16,672 --> 02:14:21,375
[SPEAKER_12]: to use your contacts to the state or whatever to buy them.

1700
02:14:21,415 --> 02:14:24,637
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, we've got money in the APRA accounts.

1701
02:14:25,177 --> 02:14:25,898
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what it's for.

1702
02:14:26,778 --> 02:14:32,642
[SPEAKER_12]: So the residents can do self-testing and keep everybody safe.

1703
02:14:33,843 --> 02:14:35,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

1704
02:14:36,144 --> 02:14:42,028
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may from the chair, as it's been widely reported,

1705
02:14:42,795 --> 02:14:50,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Governor Baker made a decision there were 102 communities that were the highest need communities somehow meant for did not fall into that category I truly don't understand that.

1706
02:14:52,441 --> 02:14:54,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And to editorialize for a minute I think it's.

1707
02:14:55,025 --> 02:14:59,428
[SPEAKER_06]: between that and what's been going on with Desi regarding schools and tests and opening.

1708
02:15:00,249 --> 02:15:06,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just another example of Governor Baker throwing a problem back on municipalities when it's a problem that he should have solved.

1709
02:15:06,953 --> 02:15:10,015
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will read, there was a response from the mayor today.

1710
02:15:10,035 --> 02:15:14,278
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, the state only provided 102 communities with rapid tests.

1711
02:15:14,298 --> 02:15:16,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're exploring the purchase of those tests.

1712
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:21,603
[SPEAKER_06]: The governor did say that they would try to work with the vendors to make it available to the communities who were not included in that group of 102.

1713
02:15:22,924 --> 02:15:28,808
[SPEAKER_06]: but it says shipping is two weeks out approximately while at the same time exploring setting up a testing site in the very near future.

1714
02:15:29,208 --> 02:15:33,091
[SPEAKER_06]: We may do one or the other or a combination of both.

1715
02:15:33,151 --> 02:15:35,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be in touch with more info as we work through the details.

1716
02:15:36,493 --> 02:15:37,554
[SPEAKER_06]: That was from the mayor today.

1717
02:15:39,355 --> 02:15:42,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any further discussion on this resolution?

1718
02:15:44,898 --> 02:15:46,940
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by?

1719
02:15:48,567 --> 02:15:49,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

1720
02:15:50,347 --> 02:15:52,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1721
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:55,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerrio?

1722
02:15:55,329 --> 02:15:55,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1723
02:15:56,389 --> 02:15:57,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins?

1724
02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:57,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1725
02:15:58,569 --> 02:15:59,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight?

1726
02:15:59,129 --> 02:15:59,610
Yes.

1727
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:01,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1728
02:16:06,231 --> 02:16:07,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli has just entered the room.

1729
02:16:08,392 --> 02:16:12,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, are you in favor of the resolution for COVID home testing?

1730
02:16:13,293 --> 02:16:13,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1731
02:16:14,173 --> 02:16:14,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1732
02:16:17,074 --> 02:16:17,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Sang?

1733
02:16:17,814 --> 02:16:18,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1734
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:19,928
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morrell?

1735
02:16:20,436 --> 02:16:20,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1736
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:23,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Behrs.

1737
02:16:23,770 --> 02:16:25,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1738
02:16:25,511 --> 02:16:28,172
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

1739
02:16:28,192 --> 02:16:30,813
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-022, communications from, oh sorry, communications from the mayor.

1740
02:16:30,833 --> 02:16:37,736
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-022, December 30th, 2021 by electronic delivery to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council.

1741
02:16:38,296 --> 02:16:39,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Read budget amendment.

1742
02:16:39,277 --> 02:16:45,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Mr. President and councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the city council approve the following amendment to the fiscal year 2022 budget.

1743
02:16:45,459 --> 02:16:47,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Line item 0101515032, contract legal services,

1744
02:16:52,362 --> 02:16:53,704
[SPEAKER_06]: FY 22 budgeted amount $26,600 proposed amended amount $81,600.

1745
02:16:53,744 --> 02:16:57,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Following the passage of the fiscal year 22 budget by the city council I engaged in conversations with Council President

1746
02:17:06,558 --> 02:17:13,361
[SPEAKER_06]: City Solicitor Kim Scanlon and KP Law to develop a process where the Council can avail themselves of KP Law services and Council as needed.

1747
02:17:13,882 --> 02:17:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: In those discussions, it was agreed that requests for Council attendance or advice will be submitted by the City Council through the Council President, who will coordinate with the City Solicitor, who will schedule meetings with KP Law to get whatever legal resources are needed to address the City Council's request.

1748
02:17:28,929 --> 02:17:31,871
[SPEAKER_06]: respectfully submitted, Brianna Lugo-Kern, Mayor.

1749
02:17:32,352 --> 02:17:34,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing Councilor Kerrio-Viello.

1750
02:17:34,814 --> 02:17:41,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I had the opportunity to read this, and this conversation did take place.

1751
02:17:42,459 --> 02:17:50,405
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that the sticking point on this particular measure was the contact wanted its own direct contact with KP Law.

1752
02:17:50,745 --> 02:17:52,567
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't want to have to go through someone else.

1753
02:17:54,088 --> 02:17:57,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that was the only holdup

1754
02:17:59,051 --> 02:17:59,892
[SPEAKER_12]: in that thing there.

1755
02:17:59,952 --> 02:18:08,275
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I would still support this as long as we have a direct contact, so we didn't have to go through a third party to get the KP law.

1756
02:18:08,796 --> 02:18:14,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how my other counselors feel, but I think that was the feeling of the council last year.

1757
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:19,580
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, if that's changed that they wanna go through a third party, that's fine.

1758
02:18:19,620 --> 02:18:22,742
[SPEAKER_12]: But I thought that it was in the best interest

1759
02:18:23,705 --> 02:18:33,352
[SPEAKER_12]: that we had a direct contact and that contact with if they couldn't handle it, they were referred that to whatever, whatever avenue in KP law that they felt necessary.

1760
02:18:33,993 --> 02:18:35,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Cabrillo.

1761
02:18:35,614 --> 02:18:36,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nye?

1762
02:18:36,575 --> 02:18:37,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President.

1763
02:18:38,076 --> 02:18:46,563
[SPEAKER_07]: This started out as a council priority for the council to receive independent legal counsel.

1764
02:18:48,464 --> 02:18:51,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And that proposal and priority arose from

1765
02:18:52,622 --> 02:19:04,046
[SPEAKER_07]: the fact that there were an inordinate number of requests for opinions, the draft pieces of legislation this council makes that we don't receive, for whatever reason, that may be.

1766
02:19:05,607 --> 02:19:17,132
[SPEAKER_07]: When the budget was debated, a motion was made to reduce the contracted legal services line item by about 50,000 bucks.

1767
02:19:18,952 --> 02:19:20,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason that that motion was made

1768
02:19:21,313 --> 02:19:28,738
[SPEAKER_07]: was because of a dissatisfaction with the level of service that we were being provided as a governmental body.

1769
02:19:29,959 --> 02:19:37,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And as part of that discussion, Councilor Caviello was authorized to go negotiate with the mayor in terms of an agreement.

1770
02:19:39,065 --> 02:19:40,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the council wanted its own lawyer.

1771
02:19:41,967 --> 02:19:45,610
[SPEAKER_07]: The council wanted its own person that they could go to, an assistant city solicitor to the city council.

1772
02:19:47,391 --> 02:19:48,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was taken off the table immediately.

1773
02:19:49,844 --> 02:19:58,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And what the council got was the ability to get permission from the city solicitor to talk to a third party vendor for legal services.

1774
02:19:59,489 --> 02:20:01,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not what we were asking for.

1775
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:02,370
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what we were looking for.

1776
02:20:02,671 --> 02:20:04,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not something I'm going to support tonight.

1777
02:20:05,172 --> 02:20:05,512
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1778
02:20:06,172 --> 02:20:08,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the narrative is false.

1779
02:20:08,554 --> 02:20:09,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a false narrative.

1780
02:20:09,894 --> 02:20:14,016
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, um, sometimes the press release sounds a lot better than the real story.

1781
02:20:14,597 --> 02:20:17,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And the real story is the council has been begging for legal counsel.

1782
02:20:17,847 --> 02:20:21,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we've gotten that one time we've gotten legal counsel that's been my proposal.

1783
02:20:22,210 --> 02:20:25,233
[SPEAKER_07]: We've moved this community 15 years forward in six months.

1784
02:20:26,494 --> 02:20:27,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we've gotten our own legal counsel.

1785
02:20:28,655 --> 02:20:30,597
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an issue I'm not willing to budge on Mr. President.

1786
02:20:31,377 --> 02:20:35,540
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't been able to negotiate terms of an agreement that were agreeable to the previous council.

1787
02:20:36,061 --> 02:20:36,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happened.

1788
02:20:37,482 --> 02:20:41,565
[SPEAKER_07]: The first meeting with a new council, the appropriation paper comes on the table.

1789
02:20:42,147 --> 02:20:50,613
[SPEAKER_07]: and two counselors that don't have the institutional knowledge of the background of this issue that happened are gonna be put on the spot to take a vote for a $50,000 appropriation on their first day of work.

1790
02:20:51,554 --> 02:20:53,815
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not right, that's not fair, number one.

1791
02:20:54,576 --> 02:21:06,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, we still haven't addressed the overall issue that this council has relative to its ability to retain and attain efficient, effective, and immediate legal services.

1792
02:21:08,186 --> 02:21:11,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, this is a paper I cannot support tonight.

1793
02:21:11,892 --> 02:21:14,334
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing paper after paper come before this body.

1794
02:21:14,954 --> 02:21:20,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look at the ad to $190 million budget, the largest budget in the city's history.

1795
02:21:20,299 --> 02:21:24,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And every week we're getting hit with papers saying, give us more, give us more, give us more.

1796
02:21:27,164 --> 02:21:28,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the financial plan?

1797
02:21:29,526 --> 02:21:31,408
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on in this community?

1798
02:21:32,188 --> 02:21:35,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't just spend, spend, spend because that sounds like a good idea and see what sticks to the wall.

1799
02:21:36,812 --> 02:21:37,853
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how you run government.

1800
02:21:37,873 --> 02:21:40,295
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how you run government.

1801
02:21:41,243 --> 02:21:44,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, this is an item that I cannot support this evening.

1802
02:21:45,445 --> 02:21:59,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank Councilor Capiello for giving it a great effort, but the negotiations moved nowhere in terms of what the administration offered at the beginning, what the council wanted, and where we ended up.

1803
02:21:59,454 --> 02:22:02,095
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no moving of the needle.

1804
02:22:02,395 --> 02:22:03,336
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I'm gonna give you.

1805
02:22:03,356 --> 02:22:04,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it or leave it.

1806
02:22:05,017 --> 02:22:05,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave it.

1807
02:22:05,477 --> 02:22:10,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna put out the press release saying that this is what I did, even though it's not what I did, and you guys can go and try to explain that.

1808
02:22:13,117 --> 02:22:19,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and they have two new freshman counselors that are here that are gonna have to go out there and explain how come you don't want the city to have a lawyer.

1809
02:22:20,447 --> 02:22:26,675
[SPEAKER_07]: How come you don't want, how come you don't want to spend $50,000 for the city to have legal counsel and you're just talking about the supplier auditorium and what's going on.

1810
02:22:27,809 --> 02:22:30,330
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to give the Shavaya auditorium 2500 bucks.

1811
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:38,293
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to come here and increase the budget by $50,000 to pay KP law, a third party vendor can't represent us in this in this big issue that we're just talking about tonight.

1812
02:22:39,053 --> 02:22:41,634
[SPEAKER_07]: This doesn't make sense to me Mr. President, this doesn't make sense to me.

1813
02:22:42,914 --> 02:22:47,796
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I stand on the issue I certainly would love to hear what my council colleagues have to say about it.

1814
02:22:48,776 --> 02:22:52,298
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm telling you, I don't see this item coming up for a vote tonight.

1815
02:22:53,769 --> 02:22:54,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1816
02:22:56,054 --> 02:23:02,547
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to start by saying I'm keeping an open mind on the subject, and that I understand

1817
02:23:03,911 --> 02:23:21,443
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, that this is under fiscal year 22, but I do have concerns about, I mean, that I think all of my fellow counselors have raised both in this meeting and in meetings previous last year with regards to cost, conflict of interest, immediacy, our direct counsel.

1818
02:23:21,643 --> 02:23:23,625
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I wanted to ask through the chair,

1819
02:23:24,525 --> 02:23:49,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Um I wanted to ask Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian if uh the mayor's office um has a plan to explore hiring an assistant city civil so there in the upcoming year because when we think about budgets it's important that we are planning ahead um um so that we're not bumping into situations that uh Councilor Knight and Councilor Caravillo described tonight um and I do believe that it's important for us to um

1820
02:23:50,363 --> 02:23:58,729
[SPEAKER_16]: to recognize that there has been a downscaling of city government in the last few decades and that we not fall fall into that trap.

1821
02:23:59,469 --> 02:24:01,891
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I pose a question.

1822
02:24:02,655 --> 02:24:02,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1823
02:24:02,975 --> 02:24:14,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information just on when we speak about the downscaling of government, one of those things, you know, coming from the labor movement, one of those big things that we're very concerned about in the downscaling government is the privatization of services and the lack of institutional knowledge, right?

1824
02:24:15,103 --> 02:24:19,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we're talking about the downsizing of government, the downscaling of government, we're talking about the race to the bottom, right?

1825
02:24:19,906 --> 02:24:20,986
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the race to the bottom, right?

1826
02:24:21,006 --> 02:24:28,511
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take this job that someone was getting a good pay, a good health benefit, and a good pension benefit, and we're going to take it out of government's hands.

1827
02:24:28,531 --> 02:24:30,112
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to subcontract it to somebody else.

1828
02:24:30,132 --> 02:24:31,053
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to pay them less money.

1829
02:24:31,759 --> 02:24:33,840
[SPEAKER_07]: give them less benefits, right?

1830
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:36,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And not give them a solid retirement opportunities, right?

1831
02:24:37,081 --> 02:24:40,562
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're gonna be able to reap the rewards of that business decision.

1832
02:24:41,423 --> 02:24:43,403
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not equitable, in my opinion.

1833
02:24:43,683 --> 02:24:45,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you're saying, it's a race to the bottom.

1834
02:24:45,584 --> 02:24:46,344
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a race to the bottom.

1835
02:24:46,804 --> 02:24:47,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Agreed.

1836
02:24:47,405 --> 02:24:48,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilman.

1837
02:24:48,505 --> 02:24:49,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Chief of Staff Nazarian.

1838
02:24:52,366 --> 02:24:53,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1839
02:24:53,327 --> 02:24:55,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the question, Councilor Sang.

1840
02:24:55,708 --> 02:24:56,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I am

1841
02:24:57,575 --> 02:25:01,976
[SPEAKER_10]: The city has found a considerable amount of benefit from working with KP law.

1842
02:25:02,016 --> 02:25:08,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason for that is because they provide depth and breadth in many different subjects.

1843
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:13,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And in my experience in other communities, it's helpful to have special counsel.

1844
02:25:13,139 --> 02:25:22,602
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the answer from my understanding at this point is no, we have not specifically discussed an assistant city solicitor because we have found that the

1845
02:25:23,012 --> 02:25:33,214
[SPEAKER_10]: relationship with KP Law has been very successful because they're able to provide niche-specific guidance on really intricate issues that relate across the gamut.

1846
02:25:33,894 --> 02:25:42,675
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you will see in common practice and industry, there is a tremendous amount of specialty in law and with many fields, obviously.

1847
02:25:43,335 --> 02:25:52,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the size of the city, the needs of the city, in my opinion, and I don't want to speak for the mayor, certainly, I believe, dictate a need for

1848
02:25:53,542 --> 02:25:58,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Council to have an extensive reach on discipline specific issues.

1849
02:25:59,426 --> 02:26:00,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that answers your question.

1850
02:26:02,448 --> 02:26:05,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also, Mr President, if I may, I apologize Councilor Singh.

1851
02:26:06,991 --> 02:26:08,693
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing I want to clarify is that

1852
02:26:09,832 --> 02:26:13,536
[SPEAKER_10]: This paper, as written, isn't proposing permission.

1853
02:26:13,676 --> 02:26:26,048
[SPEAKER_10]: It's proposing keeping the department head, who is the center and core of the city's legal department, informed of matters that are being presented to KP law.

1854
02:26:26,088 --> 02:26:27,890
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really, it's not a permission matter.

1855
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:29,912
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a keeping informed matter.

1856
02:26:30,513 --> 02:26:30,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1857
02:26:31,369 --> 02:26:33,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1858
02:26:33,370 --> 02:26:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, does that answer your question, Councilor Seng?

1859
02:26:36,251 --> 02:26:37,271
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have one more question.

1860
02:26:37,511 --> 02:26:37,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1861
02:26:37,912 --> 02:26:39,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go back to you.

1862
02:26:39,772 --> 02:26:40,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is feedback.

1863
02:26:40,513 --> 02:26:42,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So folks can just shut off their microphones when they're done speaking.

1864
02:26:42,653 --> 02:26:42,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1865
02:26:44,954 --> 02:26:45,695
[SPEAKER_05]: The point of information.

1866
02:26:48,556 --> 02:26:49,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1867
02:26:57,008 --> 02:27:01,150
[SPEAKER_07]: we had Jonathan Silverman from KP law here before us.

1868
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:03,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was posed the question.

1869
02:27:06,012 --> 02:27:06,613
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not work.

1870
02:27:06,653 --> 02:27:07,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you work for us?

1871
02:27:07,533 --> 02:27:08,473
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we do not work for you.

1872
02:27:08,513 --> 02:27:09,354
[SPEAKER_07]: We work for the mayor.

1873
02:27:10,794 --> 02:27:11,515
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't work for you.

1874
02:27:11,555 --> 02:27:16,897
[SPEAKER_07]: We work for the mayor that came right out of his mouth on that TV screen and on that TV screen, right in these chambers.

1875
02:27:18,458 --> 02:27:20,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And to that point, to that point,

1876
02:27:23,900 --> 02:27:45,375
[SPEAKER_03]: and to my fellow councils that are new, I think that the frustrating point was when we were posed questions and we needed guidance, we sat here looking very, very bad because the city solicitor responded back to us and said, I cannot answer your questions.

1877
02:27:46,415 --> 02:27:47,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of conflict of interest.

1878
02:27:48,617 --> 02:28:02,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why the, the importance was that we had our own legal representation and it wasn't wasn't put forth at the time was like us against the mayor, it wasn't, it was to get guidance and how to proceed with an issue.

1879
02:28:03,232 --> 02:28:05,173
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat here I believe for two separate days.

1880
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:15,768
[SPEAKER_03]: over a meeting that we did nothing but look at each other because nobody could answer the question because our legal representation, which is our city solicitor, couldn't guide us.

1881
02:28:16,529 --> 02:28:18,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what was the frustrating point for me.

1882
02:28:19,131 --> 02:28:30,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I appreciate the mayor trying this, but this brings us to the same concern, which is it goes to the city solicitor, which is a conflict when we have concerns dealing with issues that are brought to us

1883
02:28:31,363 --> 02:28:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: with, you know, with the city.

1884
02:28:32,644 --> 02:28:38,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, that's a winded point of information, but I wanted to make sure that that was, that was my biggest concern.

1885
02:28:38,728 --> 02:28:47,435
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that we look like, we look like amateurs, and it looked really bad on us and this governing body in our community, that we didn't have that guidance.

1886
02:28:48,355 --> 02:29:00,344
[SPEAKER_07]: So on that point, Mr. President, when you think about all the things that KP law touched during the past term, 5g nightmare, marijuana nightmare, the only thing we got done was the

1887
02:29:01,037 --> 02:29:02,658
[SPEAKER_07]: clothing collection bins, I think, right?

1888
02:29:05,321 --> 02:29:07,082
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, right?

1889
02:29:07,162 --> 02:29:08,784
[SPEAKER_06]: And roaches, rodents and roaches, yeah.

1890
02:29:10,065 --> 02:29:10,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1891
02:29:10,745 --> 02:29:12,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor, Councilor Scarpelli.

1892
02:29:12,387 --> 02:29:13,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sen, you have the floor.

1893
02:29:14,769 --> 02:29:18,772
[SPEAKER_16]: I was wondering if, I guess, do I have to do this through the chair?

1894
02:29:18,993 --> 02:29:19,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1895
02:29:19,333 --> 02:29:22,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1896
02:29:22,476 --> 02:29:24,137
[SPEAKER_16]: I was wondering if the chief of staff could,

1897
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:35,346
[SPEAKER_16]: perhaps quickly address some of these points tonight about the immediacy of a legal aid to the city council.

1898
02:29:37,129 --> 02:29:37,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Chief of staff Nazarian.

1899
02:29:39,083 --> 02:29:40,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1900
02:29:40,704 --> 02:29:41,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1901
02:29:42,544 --> 02:30:05,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the simplest way for me to answer that question is that the immediacy is that if we're unable to make progress on this paper in short order, we may need to cease services with KP Law because we wanna make sure we've got the budget in place and we may then be constraining our resources down to only one support staff.

1902
02:30:07,572 --> 02:30:11,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councillor saying, is that support stuff you refer to the city solicitor.

1903
02:30:12,097 --> 02:30:15,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr President to answer Council nights question yes.

1904
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:15,981
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1905
02:30:19,302 --> 02:30:45,793
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to express my view, which is that when when the city approaches the next budgeting cycle we should, I would recommend that the mayor's office take a look at re reconsider their stance on this issue and I understand where the mayor's office is coming from I understand the benefits of having KP law and with the work that they've done but I also want to make sure that my fellow counselors concerns and my concerns are addressed as well.

1906
02:30:46,313 --> 02:30:46,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1907
02:30:46,993 --> 02:30:47,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1908
02:30:50,380 --> 02:31:07,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, and through the chair, thank you for your response tonight for being here to help clarify some of the issues surrounding this in considering this paper I think for me it's a matter of balancing or what's in my mind is the short term necessity of not having a service interruption when it comes to having.

1909
02:31:08,730 --> 02:31:25,435
[SPEAKER_14]: legal counsel available to the city available to the city council, even if in an inadequate way with the long term need to deliver on the priority to have more readily accessible legal counsel to the city council which I agree fully agree should be a priority and in general strongly.

1910
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:29,622
[SPEAKER_14]: proponent of bringing more services in-house to the city.

1911
02:31:29,822 --> 02:31:43,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I do plan on voting in favor of this paper tonight, but I do just want to say that I think that doesn't take away from the very strong need to reconsider where access to council lies for the city council going forward.

1912
02:31:44,972 --> 02:31:48,594
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to see a service interruption or a greater

1913
02:31:52,055 --> 02:31:59,559
[SPEAKER_14]: lack of access to legal counsel for anybody in the city administration or the city council through the remainder of this fiscal year.

1914
02:31:59,579 --> 02:32:03,281
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be, you know, harmful.

1915
02:32:03,321 --> 02:32:18,489
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that would be productive in the short term, but in the long term, I do agree that we need to, you know, support the city administration, support the mayor in figuring out how to get to a more sustainable situation in terms of the city council's access to legal counsel.

1916
02:32:19,150 --> 02:32:19,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1917
02:32:20,563 --> 02:32:23,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Kerrio.

1918
02:32:23,866 --> 02:32:26,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1919
02:32:26,628 --> 02:32:31,071
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 minutes ago, we sat here and belated appoints about spending $2,500 for an attorney.

1920
02:32:31,451 --> 02:32:36,795
[SPEAKER_12]: And here we're asking for $81,600 for an attorney who can't even represent us.

1921
02:32:39,117 --> 02:32:46,663
[SPEAKER_12]: How in the world could you expect me to vote on this tonight when we don't have, when we have an attorney representing another city against us?

1922
02:32:51,202 --> 02:32:53,384
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm missing something in this, please let me know.

1923
02:32:53,424 --> 02:32:58,167
[SPEAKER_12]: But KP Law is obviously not doing the job for us.

1924
02:32:58,187 --> 02:32:59,168
[SPEAKER_12]: They're doing it for Everett now.

1925
02:32:59,868 --> 02:33:04,131
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're arguing for about $2,500 to go out and hire another law firm.

1926
02:33:08,154 --> 02:33:11,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't see the rationality of this here right now.

1927
02:33:12,938 --> 02:33:13,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Craviello.

1928
02:33:14,559 --> 02:33:15,960
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morrell is there.

1929
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:17,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see your hand up.

1930
02:33:17,281 --> 02:33:20,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ask if you wanted to chime in before I chime in.

1931
02:33:21,687 --> 02:33:41,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, thank you, Vice President bears I want to echo what counselor Collins said I understand, you know, the, the concerns of the council I have the same concerns I absolutely would like to see this as an assistant city solicitor position and build up that institutional knowledge and, you know, have that office at a staffing level it's historically had.

1932
02:33:42,204 --> 02:33:47,589
[SPEAKER_11]: But with that said, I don't want to interrupt service and the support that's being provided to the city solicitor at this time.

1933
02:33:48,348 --> 02:34:06,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, I'm definitely conflicted and I would like to see at the budget that as Councilor Collins said, really considering the assistant city solicitor position so that we're not at this crossroads where our hands are, um, in some way tied where I don't want to remove support from solicitor Scanlon and all the work she has before her.

1934
02:34:06,155 --> 02:34:09,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I, I'd love to see it not done by KP law.

1935
02:34:10,277 --> 02:34:12,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so that's all I have for that.

1936
02:34:12,598 --> 02:34:12,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1937
02:34:15,479 --> 02:34:16,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1938
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:27,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I may, from the chair, I am of a similar mind that we shouldn't hamstring the work of city government at this point.

1939
02:34:28,027 --> 02:34:36,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that, you know, I would have preferred a different resolution and proposal before us tonight than what is before us now.

1940
02:34:37,052 --> 02:34:40,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And as it comes to the fiscal 23 budget, you know,

1941
02:34:41,919 --> 02:34:47,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not support the law office structure as constituted as the city solicitor and KP law only.

1942
02:34:47,723 --> 02:35:02,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you on the benefits of KP law, I think you could create a structure where we actually have a full time assistant city solicitor, the current city solicitor, and an amount of money set aside for when we need special counsel, I think that would be a much more appropriate

1943
02:35:03,375 --> 02:35:04,536
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, way to move forward.

1944
02:35:04,836 --> 02:35:06,396
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that's not what's before us tonight.

1945
02:35:06,876 --> 02:35:26,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so in a similar fashion to Councillor Collins, I would agree, uh, I would agree to move this forward tonight, uh, but with the understanding that, you know, in the next budget round, it's going to have to be different, um, or we're not going to, you know, if we get this again, I think you're going to see what happened last time, except maybe instead of going down to 26,000, it goes down to zero.

1946
02:35:26,842 --> 02:35:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, just want to put that out there.

1947
02:35:28,583 --> 02:35:31,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, is there any further discussion, uh, from members of the council?

1948
02:35:31,844 --> 02:35:32,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor

1949
02:35:34,483 --> 02:35:42,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I am, after listening to all the comments being made, I believe I am of a similar mind with what Zach said.

1950
02:35:43,569 --> 02:35:49,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight, I think it's not worth it to answering the city government in terms of what it needs to do.

1951
02:35:50,795 --> 02:35:54,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand the reality of the situation and I think we need to move forward.

1952
02:35:55,138 --> 02:35:59,941
[SPEAKER_16]: But when it comes to fiscal 23, I believe it's important that

1953
02:36:01,082 --> 02:36:17,145
[SPEAKER_16]: we consider structuring the office as actually as Councilor Behrs, as Vice President Behrs has proposed, perhaps having a solicitor, assistant solicitor, and maybe some money set aside for special counsel if needed.

1954
02:36:18,305 --> 02:36:26,446
[SPEAKER_16]: But for tonight, I'll vote to move this forward, but I do believe it's important to consider that in the future.

1955
02:37:00,785 --> 02:37:01,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, rule 20.

1956
02:37:01,866 --> 02:37:06,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1957
02:37:07,629 --> 02:37:14,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any city councilor.

1958
02:37:15,254 --> 02:37:19,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight has invoked rule 20 therefore this paper is laid upon the table for one week.

1959
02:37:34,199 --> 02:37:35,123
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to vote on that, right?

1960
02:37:36,288 --> 02:37:36,529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1961
02:37:38,116 --> 02:37:38,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper two.

1962
02:37:43,178 --> 02:38:06,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper 22 dash 023 December 30 2020 re personnel ordinance dear Mr. President and counselors, I respectfully request and recommend that the city council approves the following amendments the revised ordinances entitled personnel article to classification and compensation plan section 66 dash 33 entitled officers and employees, hyphen non union by adopting the following changes.

1963
02:38:07,031 --> 02:38:35,126
[SPEAKER_06]: amendment a that the language of CAF 20 shall be amended to remove the following position of the language of CAF 21 shall be amended to include the following position, quote, finance director slash auditor, amendment B, the language of CAF 19 shall be amended to include the following position, human resources director, additional positions may be added to the existing compensation plan following the upcoming compensation plan and salary study being undertaken by the city through the community compact grant program, respectfully submitted, Brianna Lugo-Kern, mayor.

1964
02:38:37,242 --> 02:38:44,725
[SPEAKER_07]: If chief of staff would like to present the paper or if there's a council night, let's have a question on them and be, I think the paper was before us for the last 90 days.

1965
02:38:46,085 --> 02:38:48,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was prior to 90 days.

1966
02:38:55,509 --> 02:38:56,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that came before us.

1967
02:38:57,849 --> 02:38:58,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost.

1968
02:38:58,170 --> 02:38:59,170
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1969
02:38:59,730 --> 02:39:00,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1970
02:39:00,050 --> 02:39:04,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, any further discussion or chiefs time is Aaron.

1971
02:39:04,132 --> 02:39:05,032
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to present the paper.

1972
02:39:08,294 --> 02:39:10,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr President, members of the Council.

1973
02:39:10,654 --> 02:39:13,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to keep my comments brief.

1974
02:39:14,735 --> 02:39:23,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, a number of members of the City Council have heard some parts of this, but I'll just point out the new items and update the new Councillors.

1975
02:39:24,237 --> 02:39:37,020
[SPEAKER_10]: For the first item, Amendment A, for modifying the CAF for the Finance Director slash Auditor, we have a 22-step scale here in the City for non-union personnel that fall into the CAF.

1976
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:42,001
[SPEAKER_10]: editorially, we have a lot of work to do to revise this calf system.

1977
02:39:42,461 --> 02:39:47,723
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is, as noted with the classification and compensation study for which the mayor has secured a grant.

1978
02:39:48,424 --> 02:39:52,545
[SPEAKER_10]: But beyond that, there's a 22 step scale, the mayor's at step 22.

1979
02:39:53,086 --> 02:39:55,807
[SPEAKER_10]: There are two employees at step 21.

1980
02:39:56,007 --> 02:40:01,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Presently, that is the chief of staff and the city solicitor, and then at calf

1981
02:40:02,660 --> 02:40:04,922
[SPEAKER_10]: 20 presently the finance director and auditor sits.

1982
02:40:05,782 --> 02:40:16,450
[SPEAKER_10]: The city has reviewed other communities and I have the data here today, and I'd be happy to review it with you all for equivalent positions in adjacent communities and nearby communities.

1983
02:40:16,930 --> 02:40:23,374
[SPEAKER_10]: We've also posted this position we have found very limited candidates, frankly that what's happening is there's a limitation on

1984
02:40:24,335 --> 02:40:35,303
[SPEAKER_10]: experienced municipal finance directors in the field and we're finding that we really need to raise our salary to be competitive, so I'll leave my comments they're happy to answer any questions.

1985
02:40:35,823 --> 02:40:37,625
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, Mr President, I'll go to amendment be.

1986
02:40:38,750 --> 02:40:39,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1987
02:40:39,910 --> 02:40:44,651
[SPEAKER_10]: The last time this matter came up, the item was titled a Chief People Officer.

1988
02:40:44,771 --> 02:40:56,334
[SPEAKER_10]: We're presenting this as Human Resources Director, understanding some of the comments that were made previously with regard to this item relative to the Council feeling that a Human Resources Director may be more appropriate.

1989
02:40:56,714 --> 02:41:00,315
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're trying to strike a compromise here and move this matter forward.

1990
02:41:01,015 --> 02:41:02,156
[SPEAKER_10]: So happy to answer any questions.

1991
02:41:02,196 --> 02:41:02,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1992
02:41:03,496 --> 02:41:04,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1993
02:41:05,036 --> 02:41:05,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Any discussion?

1994
02:41:05,716 --> 02:41:06,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1995
02:41:06,617 --> 02:41:07,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I do believe that

1996
02:41:08,703 --> 02:41:15,608
[SPEAKER_07]: The Finance Director Auditor position was upgraded relatively recently, was it not?

1997
02:41:16,229 --> 02:41:17,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Under the previous administration, I believe.

1998
02:41:20,132 --> 02:41:20,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1999
02:41:22,193 --> 02:41:23,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I don't have that history.

2000
02:41:23,654 --> 02:41:24,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

2001
02:41:24,515 --> 02:41:26,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief of Staff doesn't have that answer.

2002
02:41:28,663 --> 02:41:32,405
[SPEAKER_07]: My recommendation would be to hold off until we get this classification study complete.

2003
02:41:32,425 --> 02:41:36,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like every week we get the new position that we wanna upgrade, we wanna upgrade, we wanna upgrade.

2004
02:41:36,807 --> 02:41:38,967
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the ability to look at the total picture right now.

2005
02:41:39,208 --> 02:41:40,368
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not looking at the big picture.

2006
02:41:40,788 --> 02:41:42,849
[SPEAKER_07]: We're handling things in a piecemeal approach.

2007
02:41:43,429 --> 02:41:44,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's gonna work.

2008
02:41:44,450 --> 02:41:46,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's fiscally responsible.

2009
02:41:47,371 --> 02:41:53,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So tonight we had a paper before us that asked to increase the city's budget by 50,000 or so dollars.

2010
02:41:54,182 --> 02:41:58,365
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have a paper before us that's asking to increase the salary, which is going to have a budgetary impact.

2011
02:41:59,186 --> 02:42:02,789
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple weeks ago, we got another paper that was upgrading another position.

2012
02:42:03,869 --> 02:42:16,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're seeing these job classifications that people are sitting in being upgraded, people getting raises in the salaries are causing the budget to go up.

2013
02:42:17,135 --> 02:42:19,736
[SPEAKER_07]: At some point, we need to take a look at what's going on.

2014
02:42:19,796 --> 02:42:23,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Our budget right now is already over 80% salary in benefits, right?

2015
02:42:24,599 --> 02:42:28,320
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's look at our spending a little bit before we move forward.

2016
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:43,708
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have a grant for a classification study, and one of the most important positions that we have in the community would be the chief financial officer and auditor, I think we should probably let the study take place so that the experts can tell us exactly where that position needs to fall.

2017
02:42:44,848 --> 02:42:46,249
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason I say that is because

2018
02:42:47,399 --> 02:42:56,886
[SPEAKER_07]: If we keep doing what we're doing, they're not going to have anything to study because we're going through every single position that we have here and we're creating caps and classifications for them.

2019
02:42:57,146 --> 02:43:00,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel as though, you know, we're kind of putting the cat before the horse.

2020
02:43:01,029 --> 02:43:01,989
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about a grant.

2021
02:43:02,750 --> 02:43:07,113
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about having the call and set to come in and do a classification study.

2022
02:43:07,633 --> 02:43:08,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them do it.

2023
02:43:09,335 --> 02:43:12,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not move people to where we think they should be and then have them come in and do it.

2024
02:43:12,537 --> 02:43:13,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get our back for our buck.

2025
02:43:14,238 --> 02:43:16,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's let the grant work these issues out.

2026
02:43:17,912 --> 02:43:34,038
[SPEAKER_07]: because I'd be much more inclined to support a comprehensive review that has a report attached to it saying this is where our deficiencies are, this is where we can do better than coming at a piecemeal week by week and saying this is the position we want this week, this is the position next week we want to do.

2027
02:43:34,478 --> 02:43:39,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand the administration said that they're going to be bringing positions forward and that they're also going to be doing the classification study.

2028
02:43:40,361 --> 02:43:41,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's the right way to do it.

2029
02:43:41,861 --> 02:43:42,722
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my opinion.

2030
02:43:42,902 --> 02:43:46,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if we have the grant to do a classification study, let's utilize the grant.

2031
02:43:46,504 --> 02:43:47,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's for.

2032
02:43:47,124 --> 02:43:51,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's let these experts in the field come back and give us a work product so that we can make an informed decision.

2033
02:43:52,366 --> 02:43:53,387
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I'm coming from on this.

2034
02:43:55,588 --> 02:43:56,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2035
02:43:56,528 --> 02:43:57,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Further discussion?

2036
02:43:57,309 --> 02:44:00,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Vice President?

2037
02:44:01,591 --> 02:44:02,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, President Morrell.

2038
02:44:03,827 --> 02:44:04,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2039
02:44:04,207 --> 02:44:12,592
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, through the chair, just Chief of Staff Nazarian, do we know when we're expecting results from that classification study?

2040
02:44:12,612 --> 02:44:15,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure I've asked this before.

2041
02:44:15,374 --> 02:44:15,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

2042
02:44:18,142 --> 02:44:19,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam President.

2043
02:44:19,743 --> 02:44:20,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2044
02:44:21,404 --> 02:44:36,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not entirely sure how to address the council members this evening, but anyway, we are entering into the contract agreement and I could pull up the contract agreement quickly and answer that question to be able to identify the timeframe, but I don't have that answer immediately.

2045
02:44:38,776 --> 02:44:42,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and that's like, go ahead.

2046
02:44:43,299 --> 02:44:44,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Council Member.

2047
02:44:46,161 --> 02:44:47,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if it could be done, that would be great.

2048
02:44:52,598 --> 02:44:54,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if I can.

2049
02:44:54,279 --> 02:44:56,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well well well the team is definitely.

2050
02:44:56,361 --> 02:45:02,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just think that it's just the common denominator that we've been talking about.

2051
02:45:04,008 --> 02:45:13,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to stick to what I've been talking about with the proposal for the traffic and parking, not truly having a plan in place for moving forward with funding.

2052
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:37,472
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we did that, when we're looking at what we talked about in the last, the last time we're here about funding for different positions and we talked about not really going through the understanding where we're going with the ARPA money, and why we just spending without having a plan.

2053
02:45:38,873 --> 02:45:43,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess Council and I, I've been talking about the situation from the get go.

2054
02:45:44,396 --> 02:45:58,764
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I understand that the, that the chief of staff has comparable salary structures from neighboring communities but

2055
02:45:59,923 --> 02:46:11,286
[SPEAKER_03]: just the biggest question that we had here that has still yet to be answered was that the chief people officer at the time that we looked at the salary was overseeing two big departments.

2056
02:46:11,566 --> 02:46:17,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one of those department was taken away, but yet we're now going up on that salary line.

2057
02:46:18,128 --> 02:46:20,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know where we're going.

2058
02:46:20,989 --> 02:46:22,009
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my confusion.

2059
02:46:22,149 --> 02:46:23,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, I haven't got an answer.

2060
02:46:23,889 --> 02:46:29,311
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to common sense when we're talking about your own home and your finances and budgeting your own home.

2061
02:46:30,490 --> 02:46:33,532
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have answers to answer these basic questions.

2062
02:46:34,913 --> 02:46:42,138
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were hiring a painter to paint the wall and he was doing the carpentry work and you were paying X amount of dollars, perfect.

2063
02:46:42,218 --> 02:46:49,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But that carpenter now came in and said, all he's gonna do is paint, but we're still gonna ask you to paint, pay that person that same money.

2064
02:46:50,543 --> 02:46:51,764
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna question it, aren't we?

2065
02:46:51,864 --> 02:46:52,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody here will.

2066
02:46:53,445 --> 02:46:54,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I've done.

2067
02:46:54,606 --> 02:46:58,029
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still have yet to get a true understanding where, well, he's worth it.

2068
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:10,307
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't help me answer the questions that constituents have put me here that said, Councilor Scott Kelly, again, traffic and parking.

2069
02:47:11,168 --> 02:47:14,590
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about where this situation is going as we're moving forward traffic and parking.

2070
02:47:14,610 --> 02:47:15,911
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not taking it over tomorrow.

2071
02:47:16,712 --> 02:47:22,396
[SPEAKER_03]: We've approved vehicles, we've approved positions, people getting paid, car payments are gonna be made.

2072
02:47:23,256 --> 02:47:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what the plan is.

2073
02:47:24,357 --> 02:47:26,819
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be sitting in the garage for six months.

2074
02:47:28,469 --> 02:47:30,031
[SPEAKER_03]: You know plans for the opera money.

2075
02:47:30,431 --> 02:47:36,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about who else is at the table, did we have other departments at that table like other communities have.

2076
02:47:36,759 --> 02:47:47,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So we said, the person that's higher that person that's going to be in charge of setting the tone that's going to facilitate that that'll have the expertise to do that that's the step we wanted.

2077
02:47:48,084 --> 02:47:49,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a step that we have to go forward.

2078
02:47:49,344 --> 02:47:50,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a plan in place.

2079
02:47:50,785 --> 02:47:51,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't see a plan.

2080
02:47:52,746 --> 02:48:04,489
[SPEAKER_03]: All I keep seeing right now are piecemeals that keep coming back to a slowly small, not small, but numbers every week with additional 50,000, 250,000, and there is no plan.

2081
02:48:04,990 --> 02:48:14,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made a comment that the frustration comes in that I have yet to have a true conversation with anybody from the administration with a guidance of where we're going.

2082
02:48:16,603 --> 02:48:37,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be totally honest as a city councilor, I feel belittled in the process because it's gonna get pushed through, it's gonna be moved forward, they're gonna find a way to get it through and nothing is gonna be discussed and we're still gonna be sitting here trying to answer questions to the people that put us in these seats without any answers.

2083
02:48:39,730 --> 02:48:40,910
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my frustration.

2084
02:48:41,932 --> 02:48:42,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm frustrated.

2085
02:48:42,813 --> 02:48:43,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I gonna vote for that?

2086
02:48:43,693 --> 02:48:45,114
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm gonna stick to what I've been doing.

2087
02:48:45,495 --> 02:48:46,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna vote for any money paper.

2088
02:48:46,595 --> 02:48:47,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you realize this.

2089
02:48:48,077 --> 02:48:59,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna vote for any money paper until somebody sits with me from the administration and shows me what steps were taken, which direction we're going to as a community.

2090
02:49:00,225 --> 02:49:01,326
[SPEAKER_03]: This shouldn't be a secret.

2091
02:49:04,148 --> 02:49:04,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2092
02:49:05,289 --> 02:49:06,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2093
02:49:06,810 --> 02:49:07,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

2094
02:49:10,698 --> 02:49:11,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2095
02:49:11,338 --> 02:49:18,122
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I just want to begin by thanking the Councillor Knight and Councillor Spadafore for your comments on this so far.

2096
02:49:18,202 --> 02:49:27,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I'm very aware of my position as, you know, this paper coming before me and I haven't been behind the rail for the previous discussions on this.

2097
02:49:27,367 --> 02:49:31,829
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand that your perspective on it is seasoned with more meetings than mine.

2098
02:49:31,869 --> 02:49:35,071
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to be really respectful and observant of that.

2099
02:49:37,258 --> 02:49:58,404
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, looking at this paper before us and hearing Chief of Staff Nazarian's comments on it, some of the analogies to me that come to mind, and especially having heard from some constituents, you know, even just before my first meeting about, you know, the impatience and eagerness to see a lot of these positions get filled, including positions that have been tabled in previous meetings.

2100
02:49:58,944 --> 02:50:08,306
[SPEAKER_14]: coming into the meeting with that perspective and I think with some of the plans that we do really urgently need to see and I know people are very impatiently waiting for.

2101
02:50:08,326 --> 02:50:22,310
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that in certain cases we need the people behind desks in order to make efficient progress on those plans and I feel that perhaps the finance director slash auditor is a great example of that perhaps.

2102
02:50:22,330 --> 02:50:24,070
[SPEAKER_14]: You know I'm not

2103
02:50:24,550 --> 02:50:30,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not privy to the nuts and bolts of the reclassification study, to what extent the auditor would actually be involved in that process.

2104
02:50:30,591 --> 02:50:37,153
[SPEAKER_14]: But it strikes me as the type of thing where we kind of have to make some steps forward to accelerate our steps forward.

2105
02:50:37,233 --> 02:50:51,416
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm, after some reflection, I'm planning on voting in favor of these papers tonight, because I think that that is our best, it seems to me that's our best way to make efficient progress forward.

2106
02:50:51,436 --> 02:50:52,276
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that that is,

2107
02:50:53,435 --> 02:50:56,217
[SPEAKER_14]: know, certainly what we need to be clamoring for.

2108
02:50:56,597 --> 02:51:02,520
[SPEAKER_14]: At the same time, I fully respect the, you know, the sense of wanting for a plan.

2109
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:17,348
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope that having, you know, kind of reacting to the market forces that we're observing, and perhaps the difficulty of finding applicants for these positions could help us get to a place where we're getting that communication information that we desperately need and have been waiting for.

2110
02:51:17,468 --> 02:51:18,429
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

2111
02:51:19,049 --> 02:51:23,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's fun just quickly before we move to counselor did you were able to find the answer.

2112
02:51:23,311 --> 02:51:23,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2113
02:51:23,612 --> 02:51:43,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I was not able to find the answer but I would provide an estimate is the best I can do at this stage, based on having gone through to classification and compensation studies I can bore you with the details if you want them but I would estimate approximately six months roughly, I want to find the information and get you more solid and I'd be happy to email the council tomorrow on that matter.

2114
02:51:44,773 --> 02:51:45,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2115
02:51:45,494 --> 02:52:01,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President, you know, I agree that you know that you know these positions are needed and, but, you know, where are we with our finance and audit, I mean, are we interviewing people I mean, I mean this is this position has been open.

2116
02:52:01,923 --> 02:52:05,645
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm seven areas, but six seven months now.

2117
02:52:06,737 --> 02:52:08,378
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, where are we with this?

2118
02:52:08,438 --> 02:52:12,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is one of the most important people in the administration.

2119
02:52:12,340 --> 02:52:16,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going on seven months without anybody.

2120
02:52:16,143 --> 02:52:18,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, is anybody applying for the job?

2121
02:52:18,664 --> 02:52:20,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Have we interviewed anybody for the job?

2122
02:52:21,686 --> 02:52:22,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you.

2123
02:52:25,262 --> 02:52:33,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm instinctively trying not to say President carabiello counselor carabiello, I agree with you, this is a mission critical position for the organization.

2124
02:52:34,125 --> 02:52:44,429
[SPEAKER_10]: We, we had advertised for the position, we got limited candidates, and the end we were left with one candidate, it's really never ideal to hire one candidate.

2125
02:52:46,974 --> 02:52:53,538
[SPEAKER_10]: without identifying that candidate because it's in a confidential process, I would say I didn't think that that candidate was a good fit for this organization.

2126
02:52:54,118 --> 02:52:56,420
[SPEAKER_10]: And we needed to go back.

2127
02:52:56,660 --> 02:52:58,941
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't have a proper applicant pool.

2128
02:52:59,021 --> 02:53:03,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that that stems directly from the fact that we don't have a competitive salary.

2129
02:53:04,164 --> 02:53:09,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So you believe that going from a CAF 20 to a 21 is going to bring a better candidate?

2130
02:53:11,308 --> 02:53:11,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President,

2131
02:53:14,008 --> 02:53:20,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Calvillo, I do believe it's gonna get us closer, and I do believe it's gonna make us certainly more competitive.

2132
02:53:23,890 --> 02:53:32,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly something we have to do because we're at a point where, to your point, we don't wanna go on further here without a finance director.

2133
02:53:32,572 --> 02:53:34,552
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to get a finance director as quickly as possible.

2134
02:53:35,072 --> 02:53:42,474
[SPEAKER_12]: No disrespect to the gentleman who's here on a temporary basis, but I don't understand why we can't hire anybody

2135
02:53:43,782 --> 02:53:44,922
[SPEAKER_12]: to come work for us.

2136
02:53:46,163 --> 02:53:48,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President?

2137
02:53:48,303 --> 02:53:49,224
[SPEAKER_12]: It really befuddles me.

2138
02:53:49,244 --> 02:53:55,585
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, in the finance sector, as I say, that's probably one of the most important jobs in the whole city.

2139
02:53:56,505 --> 02:54:00,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And here we are, we're making all kinds of financial decisions without a financial director.

2140
02:54:03,207 --> 02:54:05,668
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really the part that befuddles me.

2141
02:54:09,049 --> 02:54:10,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep adding jobs, keep adding jobs.

2142
02:54:12,280 --> 02:54:13,341
[SPEAKER_12]: No one's applying for these jobs.

2143
02:54:15,763 --> 02:54:18,084
[SPEAKER_12]: How many jobs we have open now.

2144
02:54:18,785 --> 02:54:23,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I would estimate probably under a dozen at the moment posted but that doesn't mean how many we have open.

2145
02:54:25,149 --> 02:54:27,691
[SPEAKER_10]: But Mr. President, through you, I would say.

2146
02:54:29,567 --> 02:54:50,754
[SPEAKER_10]: sure I'm not telling the council anything you don't know but there's a material issue with labor availability and resignations and people moving from job to job across the region, the nation, perhaps the world I'm not sure, but we have been talking about shortages within the finance director profession in the profession of municipal management.

2147
02:54:51,467 --> 02:54:53,028
[SPEAKER_10]: for nearly half a decade.

2148
02:54:53,488 --> 02:54:55,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And this issue is only getting further exacerbated.

2149
02:54:55,649 --> 02:55:00,692
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to get competitive with our salary to be able to attract a qualified candidate to this organization.

2150
02:55:02,974 --> 02:55:04,975
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the difference between the 20 and 21 in Bay?

2151
02:55:07,096 --> 02:55:08,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what that was.

2152
02:55:12,880 --> 02:55:18,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, through you, the low end of 20 is

2153
02:55:21,443 --> 02:55:25,526
[SPEAKER_10]: 107 call it 108 to 125 roughly the low end of 21 is 115 roughly to 132 roughly.

2154
02:55:25,707 --> 02:55:28,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I really don't know anymore.

2155
02:55:46,825 --> 02:55:53,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, also happy to provide town's comparative numbers if the council would like.

2156
02:55:55,985 --> 02:56:01,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President, if I may, if I may actually tell us what's been waiting.

2157
02:56:02,027 --> 02:56:02,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2158
02:56:02,827 --> 02:56:05,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I certainly hear the rest of the council.

2159
02:56:06,388 --> 02:56:06,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't.

2160
02:56:07,388 --> 02:56:14,350
[SPEAKER_16]: I think as Councilor Collins has acknowledged we haven't been here for, for, for those meetings, but we haven't been behind the rail.

2161
02:56:14,890 --> 02:56:21,332
[SPEAKER_16]: So, there's, there must be a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of meeting knowledge that we just haven't had.

2162
02:56:22,252 --> 02:56:37,936
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, haven't been in the privileged position of being privy to, but I look at this and I think, you know, having a finance director slash auditor, that's, I mean, I think we all agree it is super important for our city.

2163
02:56:38,757 --> 02:56:40,397
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think there's any disagreement on that.

2164
02:56:41,778 --> 02:56:50,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just can't help but think that we would be better off with a lot of the concerns being stated tonight if we had a finance director or auditor in position.

2165
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:53,323
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm someone who believes that we get what we pay for.

2166
02:56:54,044 --> 02:56:58,930
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have to be, we have to make Medford more competitive with other municipalities.

2167
02:56:59,951 --> 02:57:08,361
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and that's why I'm, I'm, while I understand a lot of the concerns that our council has tonight, I would support this paper.

2168
02:57:10,283 --> 02:57:12,766
[SPEAKER_16]: And because I believe that this is time sensitive as well.

2169
02:57:13,226 --> 02:57:22,836
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we have a lot of a lot of concerns not just on this paper but on other papers that the city's putting forward the administration putting forward right.

2170
02:57:23,277 --> 02:57:31,044
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's important that we have that we have people working in the office as, as Councillor Collins put it, I'm sitting by the desk.

2171
02:57:31,825 --> 02:57:37,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, in order to address those concerns better in order to create that on those plans that we're asking for.

2172
02:57:38,291 --> 02:57:39,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I believe that's important.

2173
02:57:40,072 --> 02:57:47,959
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe that it's I mean, finance director, human resources director, these are pivotal positions in any organization.

2174
02:57:48,553 --> 02:57:56,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, in the case of this paper I will move to, I support the move to push this forward.

2175
02:57:56,821 --> 02:58:09,054
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do believe that there is, there are a lot of people I've talked to throughout the city with concerns, not only related to personnel, but they have concerns about how the city government operates that

2176
02:58:10,275 --> 02:58:25,370
[SPEAKER_16]: These, these two hires or these, these two changes would would do would at least cut into and then into an addressing any further discussion.

2177
02:58:29,449 --> 02:58:39,633
[SPEAKER_07]: With all due respect, Mr. President, I don't think that $5,000 a year is gonna make us go from getting nobody to get Warren Buffett to walk through the door and start managing the city of Medford's finances, first of all, all right?

2178
02:58:41,394 --> 02:58:44,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the issue might not be the salary, it might be the culture in the office.

2179
02:58:46,416 --> 02:58:51,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very small, small group of people that perform municipal management, municipal financial management.

2180
02:58:52,918 --> 02:58:54,299
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a very small network of people.

2181
02:58:54,719 --> 02:58:59,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's one of the reasons why we can't get applicants to want to work here.

2182
02:59:00,451 --> 02:59:13,158
[SPEAKER_07]: When you look at these positions, you look at this human resources director's position, the incumbent in the position in a 12-month period got a 61% pay raise without council approval.

2183
02:59:13,598 --> 02:59:15,199
[SPEAKER_07]: 61% pay raise.

2184
02:59:15,219 --> 02:59:21,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know anybody in the world that gets a 61% pay raise in a year.

2185
02:59:22,323 --> 02:59:25,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in the world that gets a 61% pay raise in a year.

2186
02:59:27,887 --> 02:59:42,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that certainly flies in the face of a lot of the issues that have been raised by some of my colleagues when it comes to being able to have a living wage, having people pay their fair way, equity, and the like.

2187
02:59:43,517 --> 02:59:44,258
[SPEAKER_07]: A 61% salary increase.

2188
02:59:46,844 --> 02:59:48,365
[SPEAKER_07]: is something I've never heard of in my life.

2189
02:59:48,605 --> 02:59:55,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I represented union employees across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and negotiated countless collective bargaining agreements.

2190
02:59:55,991 --> 02:59:59,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen a 61% pay increase in a 12-month period.

2191
03:00:04,038 --> 03:00:05,479
[SPEAKER_07]: The spending plan needs to be looked at.

2192
03:00:05,819 --> 03:00:10,763
[SPEAKER_07]: The classification study needs to be performed before we start spending taxpayer dollars without a plan.

2193
03:00:11,503 --> 03:00:11,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2194
03:00:13,185 --> 03:00:13,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2195
03:00:13,825 --> 03:00:14,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

2196
03:00:16,163 --> 03:00:16,423
President?

2197
03:00:16,964 --> 03:00:17,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Chief Administrator.

2198
03:00:17,924 --> 03:00:23,849
[SPEAKER_10]: I could be mistaken about this, but I just ran a quick calculation and I'm seeing a percent of 35%.

2199
03:00:24,149 --> 03:00:33,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will say, Mr. President, members of the council, that this position, the person in this position was previously working as diversity director.

2200
03:00:33,736 --> 03:00:38,700
[SPEAKER_10]: They took on human resources director, which is a different position and has different duties and responsibilities.

2201
03:00:39,461 --> 03:00:41,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll keep my comments brief, thank you.

2202
03:00:42,103 --> 03:00:42,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2203
03:00:42,423 --> 03:00:42,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion?

2204
03:00:42,844 --> 03:00:43,704

[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

2274
03:06:16,388 --> 03:06:23,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just since you were the one to review them, it seems like Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli have said that they felt that was tabled for a certain purpose.

2275
03:06:24,130 --> 03:06:27,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not believe that to be true, but I'm happy to review.

2276
03:06:28,632 --> 03:06:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tabled for, yeah.

2277
03:06:30,761 --> 03:06:40,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that we tabled the positions that weren't filled so that we could have a committee of the whole of them to discuss the entire spending plan if I'm not mistaken, but it could be crazy, but that was in the motion.

2278
03:06:40,705 --> 03:06:49,728
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk is telling us there was there was there was discussion yesterday.

2280
03:06:52,709 --> 03:06:53,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I do not believe.

2281
03:06:57,595 --> 03:07:01,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a ruling of the chair that there was just a motion to table and we could take that back up at this time.

2282
03:07:04,419 --> 03:07:06,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair is that the matters were not tabled for any particular reason.

2283
03:07:06,660 --> 03:07:08,941
[SPEAKER_07]: They were just tabled so that we wouldn't have to vote on them last time.

2284
03:07:09,261 --> 03:07:09,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

2285
03:07:10,402 --> 03:07:10,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2286
03:07:11,603 --> 03:07:12,883

2287
03:07:12,923 --> 03:07:14,744
[SPEAKER_07]: They must've been waiting to get rid of a couple of guys.

[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion to take that paper off the table and approve it for first reading by Councilor Morrell.

2298
03:08:27,839 --> 03:08:32,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk on the motion of Councilor morale, seconded by Mr. President, just a quick question.

2299
03:08:32,984 --> 03:08:40,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So tonight, I'm trying to I'm just wrecking my brain tournament so this was the one way like we had the $, new jobs that were being created right.

2300
03:08:40,993 --> 03:08:45,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and then we have the, we have like 49 million in our for money.

2301
03:08:45,558 --> 03:08:47,541
[SPEAKER_07]: We spent 8.5 to balance the budget.

2302
03:08:48,041 --> 03:08:57,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we got these new, these $800,000 worth of jobs that came before us to be filled that are outside the budget that we're going to use APA money to fund, right?

2303
03:08:57,848 --> 03:08:58,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so.

2304
03:08:58,208 --> 03:09:01,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to try to fund these positions, I think, for the next four years, right?

2305
03:09:01,310 --> 03:09:02,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Or three years?

2306
03:09:02,190 --> 03:09:02,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Three years.

2307
03:09:02,971 --> 03:09:04,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like another $2.4 million.

2308
03:09:04,972 --> 03:09:07,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had like $49 million of APA money and we spent $8.5 already.

2309
03:09:09,133 --> 03:09:12,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this is another 2.4 that we're going to spend on that Apple money.

2310
03:09:12,979 --> 03:09:18,628
[SPEAKER_06]: That math sounds right to me, but I mean, it seems like we're just approving them for the cash, not for the budget.

2311
03:09:18,728 --> 03:09:21,031
[SPEAKER_07]: We've spent like 25% of our Apple money already.

2312
03:09:21,773 --> 03:09:22,954
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like I'd go more with 20.

2313
03:09:23,856 --> 03:09:47,794
[SPEAKER_03]: close to the 20 okay but we do have the federal funds manager hopefully coming on board so yes okay excellent i just wanted to be clear on that one i won't know thank you the point of information too with that because i believe that the conversation we had with this was to have a meeting with the other departments that weren't at the table this is where my confusion comes in that we tabled it for the purpose

2314
03:09:48,418 --> 03:10:02,726
[SPEAKER_03]: to go to committee of the whole meeting to bring all the departments that weren't at the table, because I believe what we talked about were the only people that were at the table, the health department and the, what is it?

2315
03:10:03,567 --> 03:10:05,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Community development, the only two department heads.

2316
03:10:06,509 --> 03:10:11,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And where we said, I think it was council Mark said, that, you know,

2317
03:10:13,833 --> 03:10:16,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the fire department eligible for ARPA money?

2318
03:10:16,313 --> 03:10:16,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2319
03:10:16,634 --> 03:10:17,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the police eligible?

2320
03:10:17,654 --> 03:10:17,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2321
03:10:18,294 --> 03:10:19,454
[SPEAKER_03]: DPW, yes.

2322
03:10:20,074 --> 03:10:21,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Seniors, senior center, yes.

2323
03:10:22,454 --> 03:10:26,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Then how can we proceed with this until we sit at the table with everybody?

2324
03:10:26,875 --> 03:10:29,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was the concern.

2325
03:10:29,196 --> 03:10:34,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm gonna bring it up again to my freshman colleagues.

2326
03:10:35,117 --> 03:10:39,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, you're approving a lot of money without a plan.

2327
03:10:41,018 --> 03:10:42,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is,

2328
03:10:44,220 --> 03:10:57,750
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something I will not support again, because until I get a better understanding of what we're doing in this community with all of our money, I'm not voting for anything to do with money.

2329
03:10:58,811 --> 03:10:59,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Make that known.

2330
03:11:00,593 --> 03:11:01,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Vice President, if I could.

2331
03:11:01,733 --> 03:11:03,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2332
03:11:03,735 --> 03:11:04,396
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morrell.

2333
03:11:05,616 --> 03:11:06,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

2334
03:11:06,737 --> 03:11:10,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to reiterate the point that this is about the CAF approval, not appropriation.

2335
03:11:10,820 --> 03:11:13,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do believe there is some debate whether

2336
03:11:14,494 --> 03:11:26,462
[SPEAKER_11]: positions of this, you know that I know it's not grant funding it's a special funding from the federal government whether they even need calf approval so I appreciate the count, the administration coming forward for the approval of these positions.

2337
03:11:27,123 --> 03:11:34,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it's a proof of the calf not an appropriation approval point of information, Councilor scarpelli.

2338
03:11:43,350 --> 03:11:45,972
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my fear to my council president.

2339
03:11:48,194 --> 03:11:49,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2340
