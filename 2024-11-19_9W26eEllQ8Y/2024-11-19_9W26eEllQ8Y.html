    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1054.118s">Absolutely,</a>  so the intention here is that the current subcommittees don't, what is in the council rules don't reflect the current subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1061.475s">So</a>  this would allow us to update those subcommittees and also allow us to be nimble in the sense of, you know, reflecting the names of offices in city hall and just appointing people related to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1074.186s">So</a>  just modernizing the subcommittees, especially since they don't actually reflect the current subcommittees that are doled out.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1116.809s">Hey,</a>  I can Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1120.79s">Also,</a>  like, if we can maybe entertain tabling this for committed a whole meeting where we can <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1127.732s">really</a>  get the input of residents and we can really vet this process as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1135.939s">I</a>  know that there are some of these subcommittees that, you know, I'd like to, as we just started, maybe, you know, bring in the school committee and ask their opinions, especially when, as a former member of the school committee, whenever you <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1152.785s">not</a>  that I felt this way, but some council, some committee members felt that when you did a combined subcommittee, a committee that it might overstep a bound and there might be some animosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1168.535s">Now</a>  that not saying that it is or isn't, but this is something that it'd be nice to sit with, you know, sit with the committee members and I get some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1176.379s">I</a>  know that I did get one city school committee member called me to remind me <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1181.723s">when</a>  we tried to do that years ago, which I didn't, I didn't see it being a problem, but it is, it is a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1189.065s">And</a>  I think that it's something that I like to see in, you know, in a process where we could just discuss this as just this being the topic of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1199.329s">So,</a>  you know, making a motion to- Yeah, if I could send this to, I mean, rules or the committee of the whole- Yeah, with this involves all councilors should go to the committee.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1210.696s">So,</a>  if I may, just to say that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1218.103s">these</a>  do not reflect the current committees and subcommittees in 2020, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1221.965s">And</a>  the intent here is really to say, hey, I think personally, how I feel is to actually put into the rules what we have done for the past two years and say, you know, the president will create subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1236.672s">Some</a>  of them are certainly, we certainly have some of these, but we don't have a school buildings, we don't have a school racial balance, we don't have public utilities, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1246.416s">And</a>  there are some subcommittees we do have right now that aren't reflected in this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1250.337s">So,</a>  so you know the intent here is, is, I agree with you to have a discussion about this in the future that's actually what my next resolution is about, but just in between now and then, to make sure that the current president can appoint subcommittees in the interim, so it's not meant to be a permanent, you know, this is how it's going to go from here on out it's just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1270.076s">I</a>  think it could be argued, right, that last term, Councilor Caraviello appointed a set of committees that aren't reflected in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1277.26s">Is</a>  that against the council rules, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1279.461s">So</a>  that's all this is meant to be, is kind of temporary to say, we can appoint committees for now, and then we can also have those discussions.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1286.765s">Right,</a>  I completely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1288.706s">And</a>  I agree with, you know, with most of the subcommittee, the new subcommittee, you know, changes, but I think that really it's understanding each one with the vision of the President and what direction <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1302.21s">we're</a>  looking to go with when you're, you're talking and getting the input from, you know, our residents that that elected us to say, for instance, the school and racial balance, I think that's, you know, something that we need.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1317.046s">Those</a>  are old.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1318.268s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1318.688s">So</a>  we want to change those two.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1320.61s">All</a>  this does this is actually taking all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1323.333s">uh</a>  listed committees out of the current rules right and just changing it to the president shall form committees and the subcommittees and appoint chairpersons and members right okay so i think that's my confusion is like the the understanding of what</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1335.447s">what</a>  is the change going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1339.128s">And</a>  if we're allowing the president to do that, and it's presented in a way that might have some animosity toward another city body, I think that's the concern that before doing that is understanding what the president's definition <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1359.48s">of</a>  each new title is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1360.94s">So</a>  I think that would be my only... Well, common practice is the president usually asks the members what committees they'd like to be on.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1367.662s">You</a>  don't want to put people on a committee they don't want to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1370.042s">So</a>  I know when I was president, I'd always ask everybody, what committee do you want to be on? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1374.844s">And</a>  the president hopefully tries to make everybody happy.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1382.845s">Yeah,</a>  if I could, Councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1386.192s">And</a>  I absolutely hear what you're saying, Councilor Scarpella, and I think that's valid, and those are conversations that need to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1391.215s">I</a>  just don't want to, I think Councilor, Vice President Bears has the same concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1394.777s">I</a>  don't want to inhibit, somehow inhibit ourselves from being able to form the subcommittees, particularly if we're sending things to rules right now, get stuck in kind of a catch-22 where we can't have that rules subcommittee because we're trying to hold for this committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1408.786s">So</a>  I'm curious if the language, if you would be satisfied the language were clarified, that this is something we'll <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1415.762s">you</a>  know, have a meeting about down the road, but it doesn't inhibit the president from forming subcommittees, you know, in the interim.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1425.745s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, I see this nothing more as, you know, streamlining the way that we do business a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1435.128s">Ultimately,</a>  I think it's safe to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1439.218s">The</a>  President has always been given some flexibility and leeway in establishing subcommittees, whether or not they outlined in the rules or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1447.229s">So</a>  I think what we're really doing is kind of splitting hairs a little bit over an issue here that's not really that big of a deal right ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1453.073s">We</a>  have a number of subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1454.454s">My</a>  first term, when I was elected, Councilor Camuso and I went over the list, and I recommended that he create a number of different subcommittees, and he just created them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1464.44s">We</a>  didn't have to go through rules change or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1466.981s">So</a>  when I'm looking at this, I think, you know, we talk about some of the ad hoc committees that we've voted on to allow the president to have discretion to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1474.265s">You</a>  know, I don't think this is anything that's outside the norm of the power vacuum that we've allowed in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1479.268s">So</a>  I certainly have no problem with it, Mr. President, ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1482.23s">You</a>  know, we have a number of items on relative to the rules, the rules will be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1486.779s">But</a>  in terms of, you know, committees and committee structure and the standing committees, I don't think it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1492.04s">worth</a>  getting into a hours long debate over it when historically, you know, the flexibility has been there for the President to take such action. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1499.926s">So</a>  with that being said, I certainly wouldn't question the Council President's authority in appointing the subcommittees that are currently standing, the ones that we've, you know, we just transferred all the papers over that are in the standing committees now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1513.056s">So</a>  those standing committees need to be chaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1514.937s">We</a>  just voted on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1515.698s">That</a>  was the second paper we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1517.159s">So</a>  ultimately, at the very least, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1519.084s">the</a>  council president should have the ability to, at the very least, chair those subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1523.366s">And</a>  then if this is going to be an issue we can deal with in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1526.047s">But</a>  in terms of allowing us the ability to continue conducting business, I don't think that this is something that you get in the way of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1532.47s">So</a>  I don't want this to be something saying, you know, we can't do anything anymore until we figure out who's going to be the chairman of the rules committee, the licensing committee, because we just took a vote to transfer all those papers that are in those committees over this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1544.076s">So</a>  those committees right now are already standing committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1545.977s">We</a>  took a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1547.197s">So</a>  I think we're really kind of beating a dead horse.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1549.44s">So</a>  Mr. President, if I can, I agree with Councilor Knight saying if it's standing committees, I'd support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1557.092s">But</a>  I said, I think the question that we had were, if we're allowing the president <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1561.743s">to</a>  make some change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1562.504s">I</a>  think that has to be a discussion before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1564.565s">I</a>  think the standing committees I would support, but as we're moving forward to change or to add different committees, I think it's something that I wasn't privy to Councilor Knight's first few years and Councilor Camuso's, but I know what we've done here has worked in the sense that it's been transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1587.198s">I'd</a>  say that Councilor, President, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1589.759s">I</a>  was not transparent and what I'm saying is having that extra meeting to talk about the new committees, I think, if there are, that'd be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1599.128s">Other</a>  than that, I agree with Councilor Knight that we can move forward with the standing committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1604.033s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1605.694s">Chair,</a>  would you like to support that?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1606.775s">If</a>  I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1611.738s">I</a>  would prefer to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1613.741s">And</a>  that doesn't mean even if it were to pass, that we wouldn't have those discussions and they wouldn't come up with a new structure as we review the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1620.43s">And</a>  I just want to say, so if it goes, if it goes mixed, whatever, it's not unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1624.456s">I</a>  just want to say either way, we're going to have the discussion and we're going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1628.802s">We're</a>  going to get it going.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1630.204s">And</a>  I think it goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1631.985s">So</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1632.706s">That's</a>  why there are there are seven votes and there's no animosity behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1637.531s">We</a>  just move forward in a positive light.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1639.934s">You</a>  have to give the president the flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1645.86s">to</a>  appoint the committees that she feels that she wants to work people in.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1651.485s">Don't</a>  disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1652.145s">I</a>  think that Councilor Knight said they'd support all the standing committees, but I'd like to, any new committees is just to have a committee of the whole meeting, just to discuss those few meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1664.775s">And</a>  again, Councilor Morell's a voted president, and I think it's just having that layer of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1672.762s">So</a>  other than that, move forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1676.281s">I</a>  believe you made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1677.622s">I</a>  don't know if there was a second, but I would move approval unless there's a second on your motion.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1681.306s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, you had a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1683.487s">I</a>  didn't hear a second, so.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1684.608s">Seconded</a>  by.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1695.874s">of</a>  the Committee of the Whole is going to be the establishment of what the new committees are going to be, then yeah, I don't have a problem having the Committee of the Whole in that, provided that the existing and standing committees still stand, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1706.957s">I'm</a>  not in favor of that whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1708.577s">We</a>  already verb that in standing array, so they're already in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1711.998s">If</a>  the councilor has questions and wants to vet it, I don't have a problem providing that opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1715.999s">With</a>  the new committees.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1717.719s">I'd</a>  certainly second the motion with the understanding that the other standing committees will still be filled.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1722.38s">And</a>  that would be my motion, that the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1726.075s">We</a>  think it should be passed and we would have a committee of the whole discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1731.837s">On</a>  the new committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1732.437s">On</a>  the new committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1733.197s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1940.623s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1944.482s">many</a>  communities, well, I'll start here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1946.724s">Chapter</a>  51, section 16A allows for cities to adopt a piece of mass general law, which would allow us to move to the system of having an elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1958.832s">It</a>  would move us from having the clerk and the board of registrars model to a formal elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1966.937s">I</a>  think there's a variety of reasons that we that at least I think that would be a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1970.68s">And,</a>  you know, may also reflect some, some of the changes we've been talking about in general around elections, with it being more work and then we now have an elections coordinator and it really is its own own. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1984.837s">animal,</a>  if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1986.818s">So</a>  part of what this allows this this section of mass general law allows us to do is basically if we were to adopt it, it would immediately transfer our Board of Registrars of voters to becoming a board of election commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2000.766s">the</a>  clerk position would then come off of that board and any appointments going forward, the mayor would make those appointments subject to the approval of the of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2011.61s">Um</a>  so, my motion here is to refer this to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss this with the city solicitor, with the clerk, with the relevant folks from from our <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2027.113s">the</a>  way that we should move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2028.315s">I</a>  can just say from my reading of the law and also from seeing which communities have adopted this it does seem like this is the way that the state law it's kind of pushing communities towards this model and away from the older clerk registrar voters model at least that's how I read the general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2045.737s">I</a>  just think it's another example of something we can do, adopt state law and already allows communities to do this, to move forward on administration of elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2053.725s">So</a>  again, move to refer this to a committee that will refer the discussion.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2095.859s">And</a>  again, the job of the clerk certainly isn't the job that we when we hired <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2103.135s">clerk</a>  for four years ago, we weren't doing early voting, we weren't doing weekly voting, so obviously now the job has changed significantly since the clerk has started. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2113.758s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight, any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2120.9s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2166.636s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2167.817s">So</a>  this is a space, apologies, this is a space that Medford can be a leader in. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2173.34s">So</a>  this is a program that the state recently passed, something that I'm benefiting from right now that I'm on paid family leave through my day job at MIT and something that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2183.001s">I</a>  think through the political process, unfortunately, municipal employees were sacrificed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2188.622s">The</a>  cities have to opt into this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2191.803s">Medford</a>  would be among the first. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2192.943s">I</a>  think one of the first, I think cities are looking at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2195.944s">They</a>  have the ability to opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2197.104s">There's</a>  a lot of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2198.984s">There's</a>  an outline process to join this, but it would allow our municipal pool employees to have those same benefits that are being extended across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2206.766s">And</a>  we've talked a lot about the value of our city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2209.827s">We've</a>  talked a lot about attracting top talent, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2212.585s">And,</a>  you know, just valuing our employees as human beings with full lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2216.506s">And</a>  this is something that absolutely would affirm that, would give people the time off they need for expanding their family, for a sick family member, for all of the things outlined in paid family medical leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2229.689s">And</a>  I think this is something that we absolutely have to look into as a city because it's the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2234.31s">But</a>  also, as I said, it will attract talent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2237.311s">It</a>  will give them the chance to be a leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2239.211s">So</a>  my motion, I would move to move this to committee of the whole, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2242.649s">invite,</a>  you know, the city solicitor, chief of staff, I think human resources to see how we can implement this as a city.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2256.963s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, just to add to what Councilor Morell was saying, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2263.639s">I</a>  was in the room, my organization was part of Raise Up Massachusetts when we were negotiating what exactly are we going to look at for paid family medical leave and the $15 minimum wage, and it was kind of a hectic morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2277.4s">getting</a>  phone calls back and forth from the leadership and the legislature back to us, what's in, what's out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2283.987s">And</a>  one of the things that was left out on both of those fronts, and we've discussed one of the other ones here before, was city and school employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2290.654s">They</a>  were left out of the paid family medical leave, and they were left out of the $15 minimum wage because it was said that this was an unfunded mandate on cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2298.922s">There</a>  is again this chapter 175 M section 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2302.224s">It's</a>  an adoption of state law that this council that gives the authority to councils or whatever the equivalent body is in another community to join the paid family medical leave program for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2314.49s">We</a>  would be the first in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2316.932s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2318.032s">is</a>  a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2319.452s">I</a>  think that puts us in a competitive position with a lot of other communities, especially right now in this job market, when top talent is going all over the place and looking for the best thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2328.694s">And</a>  the other thing too, it puts us in a more competitive position with the private sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2332.755s">I</a>  actually just was speaking with a family of someone who is now working for the city, previously was in the private sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2341.876s">When</a>  they were in the private sector, they paid into this program, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2344.977s">now</a>  they've moved to the city, they're at a moment in their family history where it'd be great to be able to take advantage of this, and they just found out they're no longer eligible because they work for a municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2356.343s">So</a>  certainly there are things to work out, look at the law, look at the process, and obviously there'll be a budgetary impact, but I think it's something that would be good for our city and school staff 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2368.669s">So</a>  I would second Councilor Morell's motion to refer this to Committee of the Whole.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2374.198s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2374.999s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2376.459s">This</a>  is something that I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2378.82s">Councilor</a>  Bears has brought up two issues that are very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2382.482s">The</a>  $15 minimum wage for city and school department employees and also a sick leave bank ordinance for city and school department employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2389.626s">These</a>  are two items that I brought up two years ago, asking to draft ordinances from our city solicitor appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2398.142s">and</a>  they must be very long pieces of municipal legislation, Mr. President, because it's been 24 long months, and this body's not received draft ordinances of either one of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2409.531s">So</a>  here we are this evening, and we're gonna have a paper asking us to further fund legal services in the administration, to further fund the legal service line item, to expand the budget for this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2419.998s">This</a>  is a perfect example, Mr. President, of why this council needs its own legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2425.393s">This</a>  is an item that should have been addressed long before, long before today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2429.876s">This</a>  is an item that we could have handled through municipal ordinance that would have provided a sickly bank program for municipal employees and school department employees, just like they offer to state employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2438.5s">Merit</a>  on the state legislation of which I printed out, drafted and submitted to the city solicitor's office when this ordinance proposal was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2448.546s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I thank the councilors for bringing this measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2452.465s">It's</a>  something that will benefit a number of workers here in this community, and it's something that I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2456.948s">I</a>  don't need a meeting with the solicitor or anybody else to know that this is something I'm going to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2460.671s">What</a>  I need a meeting with the solicitor for is to make sure that when I vote for it, we vote for it the right way, so it's implemented properly.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2467.575s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2469.136s">Thank</a>  you for, my fellow Councilors, bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2471.818s">I</a>  think Councilor Knight remembered this very vividly because <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2478.337s">I'm</a>  like my, my, my first year colleagues, which I don't know the background yet but I'm fortunate to work in a municipality that that people don't might not understand is that the sick bank is so important for brothers and sisters that you work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2497.614s">that</a>  fallen ill for some serious health issues and employees that have occurred sick days that can give back to those that are in need for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2510.562s">So</a>  I think it's so important and something that simple, you think that the Family Leave Act is just automatic in different municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2521.148s">And</a>  so it's enlightening to a few members in the community thinking that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2525.297s">don't</a>  we already have this? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2526.357s">And</a>  it's something that, you know, I appreciate my council's bringing this forward and something I will support and I look forward to the community to hold me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2533.841s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2536.122s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Morell and Councilor Pence.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2541.264s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2546.113s">not</a>  to drive the conversation out further, but I just want to thank President Morell, Councilor Bears for bringing this forward, Councilors Knight and Scarpelli for their words of affirmation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2556.276s">I</a>  think that this is an issue that really deserves a lot of affirmatory words. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2560.718s">I</a>  think this is a really essential benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2563.239s">I</a>  would love to see this council embrace it, encourage the city to embrace it, because this is a measure that could, through extending this benefit for our city and school employees, help to make the city <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2576.024s">healthier</a>  and stronger and more resilient community, which is what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2580.172s">So</a>  thank you for bringing it forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2581.715s">I'm</a>  excited to advance it.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2584.443s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2585.563s">I</a>  wanted to thank as well, President Morell and Vice President Bears for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2590.905s">I</a>  wanted to reiterate my support for this for this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2596.446s">And</a>  I wanted to thank my fellow city Councilors for, you know, already speaking up on so much that matters to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2603.248s">This</a>  is definitely an important piece of important action going forward when we consider how we are going to draw talent to our city to work for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2612.631s">how</a>  we're going to compete with different municipalities and how we're going to compete with the private sector as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2617.854s">I</a>  think it's important to also remember that, you know, paid paid leave is pivotal, pivotal for the development of children who are future, and that's why this is particularly, particularly important to me.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2632.802s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2634.142s">And</a>  again, there's some this council has supported in the past and will support again. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2637.921s">And</a>  again, it's good for the people, it's good for the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2641.803s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2643.623s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Bears and Council President Morell and Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2653.147s">And</a>  this is to move to Committee of the Whole, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2655.128s">Move</a>  to Committee of the Whole.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2928.716s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd be happy to give a brief synopsis if someone would like to waive the reading.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2932.398s">Is</a>  there a motion to waive the reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2937.302s">So</a>  moved by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2938.783s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2939.933s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, this is my biannual attempt to have a meeting night change from Tuesdays to Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2947.056s">Ultimately,</a>  because we have an open meeting while it requires 48 hours of posting, the City Council is required to get its agenda items into the City Clerk by Friday, unless there's a holiday on that Monday, which would require us to get it in on a Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2958.95s">Now</a>  we all know that the majority of events in this community in the majority of time that we are able to be free to interact with constituents occurs usually after the working hours on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2969.458s">So</a>  the situation I find myself in a lot of times Mister president is that the agenda has been published on a Friday afternoon and I'm down to Matt 7 a cup of coffee and someone comes in asking me to help with some. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2978.802s">And</a>  I don't have the ability to bring that item to the table and put it on the agenda, because the open meeting requires that we have to have the meeting notice posted within 48 hours, because of Saturday and Sunday, not being included in the counting of those 48 hours, we lose two and a half days to get items onto the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2996.237s">So</a>  this is nothing more than really, Mr. President, an attempt to allow us to do business a little bit quicker and to allow us the opportunity to put things on the agenda in a faster fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3005.779s">Also,</a>  when you think about this building, right, Wednesday night is the night the City Hall is open late. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3010.201s">So</a>  instead of having City Hall being open on Tuesday nights just especially for the City Council meeting to meet this whole building for us to come in here to conduct our business, the building will already be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3020.183s">The</a>  building will already be heated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3021.223s">There'll</a>  be personnel that's in here already. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3024.358s">department</a>  heads they're already working late. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3026.54s">So</a>  if we do need to talk to somebody we may have the ability to have them come right down and speak to us, Mr. President, we'll be able to get answers a little bit quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3032.924s">If</a>  we have committees as a whole, existing staff will already be on hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3036.027s">So</a>  department heads won't be dragged in there on Tuesday nights to deal with council business and then also be dragged in again on a Wednesday night so that, you know, we can take their life into consideration as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3044.253s">But</a>  I think that this is really just an opportunity for us to allow us to represent our constituents better because it gives us the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3051.318s">to</a>  get the freshest items that are in our head and put them on the agenda immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3054.719s">After</a>  the weekend, we can put something on the agenda on a Monday, and it's gonna show up on the agenda for Wednesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3059.541s">And</a>  I think that that's just a little bit more efficient and effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3061.841s">So</a>  that's why I bring this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3063.582s">And</a>  with that being said, Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell have been so generous in their willingness to send items to the committee of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3072.085s">I</a>  would be happy to make a motion to send this item there as well to be further discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3076.486s">I</a>  have brought it to the table before it has failed before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3079.487s">I</a>  would not like to see this fail again, so I'd be happy to deliberate and discuss with my council colleagues what they feel would be best direction for us to move.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3086.89s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3087.53s">There's</a>  a motion from Councilor Knight to refer this to the Committee on Rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3090.731s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3092.692s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3094.332s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3094.612s">And</a>  any discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3095.713s">I</a>  had Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Caraviello, then Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3100.475s">I</a>  appreciate, thank you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3102.698s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor and I bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3104.24s">I</a>  think that it makes some valid points, but I think that talking to a few department heads, they've been accustomed to using that Wednesday evening that they are here when it might be a little bit slower. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3115.695s">to</a>  really do the business that we we pass on on a Tuesday night for them to to to really get ahead of the game where Fridays they have a half a day they lose a half a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3127.186s">So</a>  it kind of hinders that process so I appreciate that and <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3132.895s">You</a>  know I I think that you know it's something that be interesting to see as we share our thoughts and community that being on that point Mister president.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3143.641s">You</a>  know the mayor still would be bombed by our 10 day requirement to respond items that have passed by the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3148.904s">So</a>  whether the meetings on the Tuesday or Wednesday the administration still about to act within the 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3153.667s">The</a>  forecast right so if they use Wednesday's you know the employees and the staff is still required to work at 37.5 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3161.619s">whenever</a>  it may be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3162.62s">It's</a>  just a time management issue at that point, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3165.202s">So</a>  the night of the council meeting should have no bearing on whether or not members of the administration can conduct the job that they're being paid to do within 37.5 hours a week that they're being paid to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3176.333s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3177.574s">Thank</a>  you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3178.555s">Councilor</a>  Carballo.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3180.077s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3180.857s">Again,</a>  I thank Councilor and I for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3187.07s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3189.171s">I</a>  don't think Wednesday nights works for the council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3193.593s">This</a>  room is booked many, many Wednesday nights for public hearings, multiple public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3201.576s">And</a>  I think to have that on other nights, I think it would be disruptive to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3207.138s">Again,</a>  you know, these are the changes that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3212.834s">that</a>  the city has been done for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3215.416s">I'm</a>  not saying that I'm opposed to change, but I say generally Wednesday nights, many meetings are held in this chamber because of just the fact that it's the biggest room in the city for us to have these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3229.587s">And</a>  again, I don't oppose discussing this in the committee at all.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3236.882s">On</a>  that point, Mr. President, I think it's important to point out that the Council meetings are a public meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3242.223s">And</a>  this is the Council Chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3244.744s">And</a>  when we talk about the successes of just this past week, for example, we just cut the ribbon on one of Councilor Caraviello's greatest accomplishments as a Councilor, the library, which has a beautiful new community space. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3254.706s">We</a>  look across the parking lot, we do see the Senior Center, which has a beautiful room in there that we've been able to use in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3261.806s">Back</a>  this way, we see the Shabbat auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3263.908s">We</a>  get in the car and drive up the street, we see the little theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3266.149s">So</a>  there are a number of spaces in this community that can host live gatherings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3270.112s">Again,</a>  this is more of an efficiency standpoint for the council and the ability for us to put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3273.875s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't think we need to beat the host to death, but there are some valid arguments for and against Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3281.721s">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3282.762s">There</a>  was a motion from Councilor Knight to refer to the subcommittee on rules, seconded by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3288.906s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3292.323s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3293.084s">I</a>  just wanted to quickly thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3296.527s">I</a>  think he makes valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3298.169s">I've</a>  heard from constituents about concerns about public meetings, community meetings being held in the chambers on Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3305.335s">So</a>  I look forward to, I will vote yes on this and I look forward to discussing this even further.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3311.201s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3313.863s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3315.004s">Any</a>  discussion by members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3320.939s">I</a>  am not seeing any, so Mr. Clerk, on the motion, could you please call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3325.621s">And</a>  this is to refer to rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3326.821s">To</a>  refer to the subcommittee on rules.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3369.845s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3371.126s">Michael</a>  was a mentor and a dear friend to me for a number of years, and I wouldn't be sitting here this evening if it weren't for the guidance that he gave me as a young man. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3378.849s">He's</a>  someone that dedicated his life to public service, a Vietnam veteran, a governor's Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3384.966s">48-year</a>  state employee, commissioner of racing, chairman of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, founder of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, and most notably, Mr. President, famous in Medford folklore for saving Wrights Pond from being developed into condominiums in the late 70s and early 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3403.66s">And</a>  if you go up to Wrights Pond to this day, you'll see a memorial there in Michael's honor, recognizing the work that he did in protecting one of Medford's most beautiful natural resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3414.007s">Michael</a>  was someone that served this community, this country, and this commonwealth with dedication and passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3419.691s">He's</a>  someone that would be the life of the party if he walked in the door, you'd know he was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3423.814s">He</a>  was someone that wore his hat and his sleeve and would give you the shirt off his back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3426.876s">And</a>  he's someone that's certainly greatly missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3429.438s">He's</a>  someone that made a big impact in my life and someone who I think of often. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3433.68s">And</a>  annually on this day, I bring this metaphor to Juan and my friend Michael, and I ask my council colleagues to join me in doing the same.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3529.755s">Resolution</a>  22-007 offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3535.248s">Whereas</a>  gas distribution utilities are required to annually report the location of gas leaks to the Department of Public Utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3541.85s">And</a>  whereas as of December 31, 2020, there are reported 235 unrepaired gas leaks generating 104 tons of emissions annually in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3551.672s">And</a>  whereas independent research shows there are typically 1.5 to 3 times more leaks than reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3556.973s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that city administration prepare and present a five year plan to address gas leaks in our community and report back to the council Councilor Knight, Mr. President, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3567.937s">I</a>  think this is a rather self explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3570.558s">We</a>  do have a problem in this community with gap with gas leaks, you look at these figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3575.42s">These</a>  aren't figures that I made up the figures that I got right from the Department of Public Utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3580.221s">The</a>  research shows that there are typically 1.5 to 3 times more leaks than reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3584.904s">It's</a>  not something I made up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3585.945s">It's</a>  something that I got right off the website of the Department of Public Utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3589.287s">So</a>  we're seeing a situation here in this community where we have a problem and we need to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3594.49s">We're</a>  seeing a lot of digging being done by our public utilities and we're not holding them accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3599.353s">We're</a>  not bringing our public utilities back to the table to be sure that they resurface our roadways in a condition that's suitable to the taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3607.218s">It's</a>  something that needs to be addressed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3609.54s">So</a>  between the environmental issues that we have with the gas leaks, the safety issues that we have with the gas leaks, and the quality of life issues that we have with the condition of our roadways, I think that this is something that should be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3620.106s">So</a>  I'm asking that the administration come up with a plan on how to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3622.927s">And</a>  I'd like to further amend the paper and ask that this be based on the reports due section of the council agenda for 90 days, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3631.392s">Do</a>  you have that, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3640.252s">do</a>  section nine days, as my council colleagues to support the resolution I look forward to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3645.758s">Second,</a>  you have a motion from Council right seconded by Councilors Garfield a discussion, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3650.824s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3652.165s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3653.867s">This</a>  is something that's been discussed at this Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3656.931s">Many</a>  times in the past, the Council made is a percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3662.27s">with</a>  all the unrepaired gas leaks leaking all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3666.653s">I</a>  don't think there's any part of the city that's immune to this, what's been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3671.356s">And</a>  I think that we should have national grid here when we have the meeting to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3677.9s">I</a>  think they were here last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3679.501s">And</a>  I think a couple of years we had a meeting, but the biggest part is that Councilor Lay mentioned is we're over here digging up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3690.779s">and</a>  not repairing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3692.56s">And</a>  I've been, I'm gonna tell you now, every time I see it, I call the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3698.563s">Again,</a>  we've got newly done streets that we're digging up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3703.846s">So</a>  again, I think going forward, it's gonna be the job of this council to hold not only the gas company, electric company, the phone company, anybody that's gonna be digging up our streets are gonna be held accountable to pay them correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3717.414s">If</a>  they're not gonna be paid correctly, they're not gonna be getting any more permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3720.904s">So</a>  I know I'm gonna stand firm on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3724.225s">I'm</a>  tired of going around the city, seeing holes everywhere, just being left undone. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3731.928s">And</a>  I think it's also a sign that we hire a clerk of the works to follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3737.531s">I</a>  mean, Tim McGibbon can only do so much work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3741.472s">He</a>  can't be the engineer, PPW director and be on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3744.714s">So</a>  again, I think this is something that this council is gonna have to hold strong on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3751.537s">If</a>  we're gonna start paving the streets, I think, and they wanna start digging them up, they're gonna be paving crib to crib like they do in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3757.441s">So</a>  I wholeheartedly support Councilor Knight's motion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3761.544s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3763.065s">Is</a>  that an amendment to invite National Grid to the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3767.287s">Yes,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3767.828s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3768.508s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3768.888s">If</a>  you could record that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3770.209s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3771.77s">I'm</a>  gonna go Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3775.019s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3775.559s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight for bringing this forward wholeheartedly support this resolution, as indicated, not only do these leaks account for an outsized amount of methane emissions, particularly potent greenhouse gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3788.962s">These</a>  leaks inhibit our ability to deliver on our public health goals to the community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3793.543s">They</a>  also threaten our ability to demonstrate our seriousness about climate change mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3797.484s">So</a>  I look forward to supporting the city administration and holding National Grid accountable and seeing what we can do to sustainably address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3807.207s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3808.507s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3809.827s">I</a>  actually have Councilor Morell and then our President Morell and then we'll go to Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3813.508s">President</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3814.648s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3815.689s">I</a>  just want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3817.277s">Councilor</a>  Knight now I have a squiggly baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3819.238s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3821.42s">I</a>  mean, this is an issue that, as you said, you hear from residents about this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3826.103s">National</a>  Grid has their own ranking for how severe these leaks are and you'll have leaks that you can absolutely smell are concerning and they'll say it's not a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3834.808s">The</a>  Energy and Environment Committee also has a great map detailing the leaks that are all over the city and as you said it's an incredible amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3841.398s">and</a>  a lot of them are unreported. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3842.659s">So</a>  I just, I really appreciate you bringing this paper forward and I look forward to supporting it and getting something done on this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3850.462s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3852.643s">Welcome</a>  baby Jack. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3853.904s">And,</a>  and we'll go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3857.719s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Knight on this, and thank Councilor Caraviello for his amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3864.222s">I</a>  think it's important that we, we hold strong together as a council on this issue that we hold hold people accountable for the work that they do in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3873.726s">This</a>  is clearly a standard of living issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3876.088s">It's</a>  an environmental issue as Councilor Collins so well laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3879.011s">It's</a>  also an equity issue in terms of the neighborhoods that are affected, the streets that are affected, and the way that we address city services in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3887.34s">And</a>  so I will vote to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3890.563s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3965.451s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much again this is a paper that we put on annually requesting that the administration provide us with an update as to what the organizational structure is week after week we're seeing new jobs being proposed to this council new positions being proposed positions being upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3980.417s">It's</a>  my hope that we can get an organizational chart to show us exactly who's doing what, when, and where. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3985.679s">Just</a>  last week, I believe we had about $800,000 worth of new positions before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3989.98s">So</a>  I think it's important for us to understand the financial impact of what's going on with the new positions that are being created in this community, both to the tax dollar and also to our grant funds that are coming from the feds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4000.624s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I would ask that this <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4003.479s">Council</a>  resolutions be answered in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4005.421s">I</a>  do think it's important that our council resolutions be answered in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4008.344s">It's</a>  great to have a representative from the administration here, but that does not make for my file. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4013.042s">And</a>  when it comes time for me to pull this out and look at it again later on, it doesn't do me any good. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4016.825s">It</a>  doesn't do me any help. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4018.346s">It's</a>  really an issue for me to understand who does what, where our money is being spent, and why it's being spent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4024.331s">And</a>  it also allows us as councillors to know who to pick up the phone and call when we need something to get done so that we don't have to bring it to the council floor and to have constituent work be debated on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4033.759s">So</a>  I think this is an important step moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4035.96s">If</a>  we look at our fiscal year's budget, we'll see an organizational chart <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4040.024s">But</a>  we've seen a number of new positions that have been created. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4042.007s">We've</a>  seen a number of people take on transitionary roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4044.712s">And</a>  right now, those transitionary roles, some people are in 2 hats, some people are in 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4049.479s">So,</a>  I just want to know where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4052.898s">Ultimately,</a>  we have a number of positions that were funded in the budget that aren't filled right now, so we're gonna have some surplus funds that may require end of the year transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4061.104s">It's</a>  really a financial issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4063.126s">So</a>  with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4066.509s">The</a>  more we understand about the organizational structure, where the money's being spent, the better job that we can do for the people that we represent.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4072.633s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4073.894s">Just</a>  FYI, we're having some issues with your microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4076.356s">It's</a>  not picking everything up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4077.357s">If</a>  you could maybe angle it, yeah, a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4079.799s">I</a>  don't know, it might be the loud HVAC system, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4083.315s">I</a>  saw Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4085.456s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4086.977s">Councilman,</a>  I thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4088.338s">I</a>  think that you make some valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4090.218s">I</a>  think even, I think the most important point is we have a new committee, a new council here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4095.221s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4097.118s">We'll</a>  see that, especially when I first started, having that chart and understanding who to call saved a lot of work for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4109.244s">Something</a>  simple as, I'll give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4111.205s">I</a>  got a phone call today from a senior citizen who lives in South Medford, whose son is moving into his home to assist him so he doesn't have to move to assisted living. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4123.992s">great</a>  gentleman lived has lived here for over 70 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4127.673s">And</a>  question was very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4129.934s">Now</a>  with the changes with the traffic and parking, who is who can he call to, to find to ask for another permit, temporary permit while his son is living there with him without getting towed or ticketed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4144.799s">So</a>  it would be as we <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4148.503s">That</a>  being a new department, having that that outline would be so helpful for us to do our job, and more importantly, to help the city administration, assist them and and answering questions I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4166.067s">We</a>  created a whole new department. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4168.309s">I</a>  think it was a few years ago with the former mayor that I believe when Mayor Burke came on her biggest problems were the communications, because of the pool and pond permitting system, and really have anything in place to answer the simplest questions, where can I get a, a pond pass and. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4191.163s">I</a>  think that having that organizational system in place really helped that eliminated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4197.515s">And</a>  if you remember, during those times. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4202.21s">There</a>  are so many issues in Medford but the biggest talk the biggest concern was, how can people get a permit for the pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4210.234s">When</a>  all it needed was just a simple phone number and someone to answer that question so I think that's a, you know, every point that Council night brings forward when talking about fiscal responsibility is important but to the simplest form. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4225.735s">asset</a>  is really to help us and the our citizens navigate who they can call when there is a concern or an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4234.4s">So</a>  I second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4237.202s">Council</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4237.702s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4242.465s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4243.845s">I</a>  think you're correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4245.606s">We</a>  have a lot of positions that are vacant and I think we need to know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4249.068s">Um,</a>  well, we have the chief of staff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4250.989s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4254.272s">During</a>  the mayor's inauguration, she mentioned that she hired somebody for the opportunity funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4261.476s">Can</a>  you reveal who was hired for that position?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4266.679s">Instinctively</a>  wanting to, Councilor Caraviello, I assume that the individual has informed her employer, but I haven't asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4274.284s">If</a>  you all would be willing so, I'd be happy to notify you all individually tonight before I leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4281.814s">I</a>  just, I want to be sensitive to these types of things.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4284.135s">I</a>  assume by now it's two weeks before- It was announced on that day and people have been asking and I didn't know what answer to give them.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4292.54s">I'll</a>  even email you all right now just so you have the information, but I want to be as sensitive as I possibly can be.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4391.11s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4393.551s">In</a>  2019, I put forward a resolution asking that we do just this, that we expand our cooperative education opportunities in the vocational school to include some of the trades that fall within the public works sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4405.196s">Ultimately,</a>  we have an aging infrastructure and an aging workforce here in the city of Medford, and it would be nice for us to be able to cultivate some homegrown talent to bring them into our public works sphere and our public works sector so that we can continue to fill positions that become vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4421.183s">During</a>  the Burke administration, I had the opportunity to meet with Chad Fallon, the director of the vocational school, and we had some preliminary discussions about this type of thing and expanding programming over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4432.53s">We</a>  also met with representatives from the Laborers Program and representatives from the Teamsters Union, who represent the DPW here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4442.116s">And</a>  the discussions were great, and the project was looking like it was coming around. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4446.559s">And</a>  then, you know, the RONA happened, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4449.155s">school</a>  got shut down and the expansion of opportunities for children wasn't really on the forefront of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4454.279s">The</a>  agenda was making sure that we could educate our children safely, not expand opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4461.344s">And</a>  this issue kind of fell by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4463.185s">And</a>  I'd like to make this issue a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4466.468s">It's</a>  fitting that in January of 2020, they found that this is a absolute priority, the best practice from the Massachusetts Municipal Association, a group that this community is a member of. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4477.355s">So</a>  I think that this is something that we need to look at, Mr. President, and I might ask that we send it to the school administration and ask them to report back to us within 90 days as to what their findings are and whether or not this is something we can continue to pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4488.941s">It's</a>  something I think that would require some upfront funding, something that I think would be a worthwhile investment here in this community because we're going to be investing in the education of residents in the city who in turn may someday actually become the Director of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4502.048s">may</a>  actually in turn become the director of uh the superintendent of water um you know individuals that live in the community have a vested interest in the community um i've always been a firm believer in uh in having a department that's beef city residents um you know i don't think it's fair that they get in their car and drive away to where they live and i go to the supermarket and get yelled at for the job but they're not being held accountable i've always said that uh you know i've thought that um department that should be residents in other communities you'll see that as a requirement i'm not saying that's a proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4527.881s">or</a>  anything, but I'm saying if we can take this opportunity to utilize our vocational school to educate students in the public works field and put them to work here in our community, we'll have people that live in this community that have a vested interest in the success of this community, not just the paycheck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4541.974s">And</a>  I'm not saying that that's the situation our department has, but you have seen that in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4546.678s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4551.667s">Councilor</a>  say, I wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4556.031s">I</a>  wholeheartedly support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4558.673s">I</a>  believe that trade work is important work for community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4564.257s">It</a>  is also been shown and I think there's a wide consensus on this, that it is trade work is very vital for <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4572.203s">for</a>  the futures of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4573.984s">I</a>  think it presents a possible profession in the future that is well paying and sets people up for a good future. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4582.048s">So</a>  I think that it is super important for our city to be pursuing this as a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4589.692s">I</a>  also think it's important for our city to be <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4596.342s">pushing</a>  our children or to be recommending our children, different paths in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4601.124s">And</a>  I think it's important that we take our focus and bring it to the vocational and trade work as well, especially when it comes, when we consider the fact that much of this work is good union work while paying jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4613.349s">I</a>  think we need to support our unions and build more connections with them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4617.691s">We</a>  also need to address existing stigmas when it comes to trade work and vocational work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4623.093s">that</a>  I know often exist in our communities, and I think stuff like this, where we have school administration building connections with students, promoting trade work, promoting public works, where we have these linkages between our city institutions and our families here in Medford, I believe that that's a way that we can overcome the stigma and to really present trade work as something that is honorable, which it is, and that's why I wholeheartedly support this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4651.982s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng any further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4656.325s">If</a>  I may, from the chair, I definitely agree with the motion with what counts right said what Councilor Tseng said, and I think also that the work that's been done since I was at Medford High School to bring together the vocational side and the, the high, you know, high school in the vocational technical school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4673.825s">and</a>  provide those opportunities to everyone that is a good stepping stone, and this could be another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4678.529s">So</a>  I'm definitely supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4681.771s">There's</a>  motion from Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4686.355s">Any</a>  further discussion as amended? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4690.138s">For</a>  90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4691.159s">For</a>  90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4692.6s">Seeing</a>  anyone, any discussion from the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4699.945s">Seeing</a>  none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4753.979s">I</a>  did see something today that the mayor was negotiating with one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4757.281s">But,</a>  you know, I'm getting a little frustrated because I see Somerville keeps adding them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4764.665s">Arlington</a>  has it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4766.206s">Melrose</a>  has them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4767.467s">We're</a>  being surrounded by other cities that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4770.768s">Listen,</a>  whether we like it or not, this was voted in by the people, I think, what, 2015? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4776.035s">And</a>  I think we're one of the last communities in the Commonwealth that have approved this, that have not, have yet to open one of the campus facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4788.54s">And</a>  we formed, we did a lot of work, the committee gave recommendations, and I think they finished back in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4796.783s">And</a>  now we're in January, and we still don't have anything concrete or open yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4802.725s">We're</a>  leaving money on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4806.542s">on</a>  these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4809.724s">It's</a>  money that can be used to fund other projects or services in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4819.55s">If</a>  the mayor could provide us with an update of where we are with the licenses and how soon they're going to be awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4827.776s">And</a>  I know there are companies that are paying rents for properties that they're holding and they can't operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4835.913s">I'd</a>  like to see a report showing where we are in the status of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4839.975s">And</a>  if we could start getting the movement, because other cities and towns are doing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4845.957s">And</a>  if these companies are ever going to build a customer base, they're going elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4851.76s">I</a>  say Melrose has them, Arlington has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4855.221s">Summerville,</a>  I think, has eight or nine, maybe 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4857.682s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4858.162s">I</a>  don't even know how many they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4859.923s">They're</a>  opening them everywhere over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4863.197s">We're</a>  right on the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4864.518s">I</a>  mean, most of the people that wanted it were on the avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4867.921s">So</a>  again, I'd like to see a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4870.844s">So</a>  I know where they are, where we are on these and the status of how soon they can be up and operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4878.612s">So</a>  we can start generating some funds on this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4881.455s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4883.137s">Any</a>  discussion from other councilors?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4885.953s">I</a>  just want to say, I share Councilor cables concern and frustration, as the chairman of the ordinance committee that worked long and hard on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4894.681s">I</a>  think that this has gone inordinately too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4898.024s">This</a>  issue should have been addressed long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4900.185s">These</a>  licenses should have been, you know, vetted in the host community agreement should have been negotiated we're leaving a ton of money on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4908.272s">I</a>  don't want to hear in eight months that we don't have the money for something that we're looking for when we could have been collected $3.3 billion a year from the licensees of marijuana dispensaries here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4919.457s">You</a>  know, the voters voted to have marijuana dispensaries here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4924.799s">The</a>  voters have spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4925.74s">It</a>  should be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4927.34s">And,</a>  you know, for this council to take the steps to properly <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4931.486s">that</a>  the ordinance put the ordinance in place and then properly adopt the local option tax benefits for this community, so that we can see fiscal gain and still not see those fruits of our labor is frustrating, Mr. President, so I might do share the council's concern I look forward to seeing a license be issued in the near future, hopefully.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4949.082s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight, any further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4951.124s">Chief</a>  of staff is area.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4956.981s">Thank</a>  you just just one minor clarification I just wanted to note that the cannabis Advisory Committee voted final rankings on the final applicants not materially different from what was stated but in October, those rankings were transferred to the mayor in October, October, November, and the mayor began meetings with one of the companies in December so I just want to clarify the timeline as far as where we are today and how we got where we are.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4981.723s">I</a>  do believe it's important to point out that the ordinance did say that the Cannabis Advisory Commission would convene within 45 days of passage and begin the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4989.344s">And</a>  I don't think that they ended up falling into the compliance windows with the ordinance when it was passed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4996.226s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4997.146s">And</a>  just from the chair, I did want to both say that I agree that it's important to move forward, I think, in due haste on these host community agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5007.808s">But</a>  I also did want to read, we did receive a message from <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5010.957s">Steve</a>  Smirni, the Acting Communications Director earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5014.44s">Hello,</a>  Councilors, in regards to Council Resolution 22-015, please see the below press release regarding potential cannabis licenses that the City will reward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5022.466s">Press</a>  release went out December 30, 2021, and the first paragraph, I won't read the whole thing, it just says, last month, the Cannabis Advisory Commission presented Mary Briana Lungo-Koehn with the final ranking of nine applicants seeking to establish retail businesses in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5035.99s">From</a>  this list, the mayor chose to start by interviewing the top five applicants to review and discuss parking traffic, community benefits, and other key priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5042.595s">The</a>  mayor has already met with the highest ranking company, Theory Wellness, and has been in active discussions with its executives on a host community agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5049.159s">She'll</a>  be meeting with representatives from the other four companies throughout the month of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5052.842s">So</a>  that is the communication that we received from the administration on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5057.906s">Any</a>  further discussion from Councilors or from members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5063.846s">Seeing</a>  none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5071.091s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5074.894s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5346.356s">If</a>  I can, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5348.017s">I'll</a>  do respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5351.232s">You</a>  have probably one of the wealthiest gentlemen who's asking $2,500 from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5357.495s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5358.676s">He's</a>  not asking for any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5361.849s">You</a>  just said that he's asking the city.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5364.852s">I'm</a>  asking that the city will help help him with, with his legal legal funds.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5370.538s">I</a>  can't, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5371.699s">I</a>  just can't even think of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5374.062s">When</a>  he, when he bought on listen I agree 1000%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5377.025s">I</a>  think encore is, this is a disgrace, but I also think. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5382.01s">It's</a>  a city's responsibility that if we feel that it's affecting our downtown area if this happens, and they're breaking the agreement that they had with our neighbors, then this is something the city should have our own attorney our own city solicitor at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5395.963s">or</a>  as well as unfortunately law represents separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5398.925s">Well,</a>  I know, but we do have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5400.967s">So</a>  before I vote on any money being handed off to anybody, there's gotta be some clarification that if the city solicitor can represent the city of Medford in these talks, making sure that the city of Medford is represented at this table, because it's definitely a disgrace what they're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5419.821s">They're</a>  trying to manipulate what the agreement was <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5422.863s">And</a>  it's going to hurt like you said, I care about our community but it does hurt all these small, small theaters across Massachusetts, it's going to, it's going to destroy something very very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5434.323s">And</a>  I think instead of. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5437.402s">assisting</a>  with $2,500 have have the representative from the Chevalier go at them their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5444.525s">But</a>  I think the city should really take an active approach and hire a either have the city solicitor or bring on legal team that's not KP law that's going to share <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5458.238s">our</a>  concerns and move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5461.139s">I</a>  think the more people that are attacking this organization and Encore, whether it's the private entity, whether it's the cities and towns that have the neighbor's agreement, that we should all focus on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5473.825s">I</a>  don't feel that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5475.306s">You</a>  know all the respect I know you're saying I just I'd rather I'd rather if you ask for money that we asked the city to go out and get a representative that will be will work for the city at the table, I'll agree with that, giving the representative Chevalier $2,500 to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5494.538s">I</a>  can't I can't support that we get $1 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5498.54s">I</a>  think that we're getting manipulated there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5501.281s">So</a>  I don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5503.982s">So</a>  I wouldn't be supporting the B paper, but if it's something that we're asking the city to file and work with and ask for funding from this council to approve, to move some sort of money to the budget so they can get legal representation other than KP law to fight, I'm behind that a thousand percent.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5525.424s">If</a>  I don't, I'm not opposed to having the city go out and hire an attorney that's an expert on that type of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5532.886s">I</a>  don't, again, I don't know if the city, if they're willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5539.767s">In</a>  communication with the mayor today, she was willing to help with Mr. Bloomwright's legal costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5550.958s">I</a>  mean, I know $2,500 is not a lot of money, but it's something.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5555.263s">Through</a>  the chair, we heard the mayor speak, and we're so excited that the focus is going to be focusing on Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5562.55s">And</a>  now we're finding out that they're taking away the only piece that brings vibrant life to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5567.916s">And</a>  we're not going to have a standalone representative <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5573.363s">that</a>  I think it waters down how we truly feel about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5578.267s">Maybe</a>  you agree or don't agree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5579.948s">I</a>  agree that we should have legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5583.431s">My</a>  recommendation is that you take that off the table, Councilor, and we ask for the mayor to hire an attorney <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5591.376s">or</a>  a team that's going to fight for this, this issue as a standalone issue as a representative of the city and that did not a $2,500 and we're going to follow the coattails of the gentleman who's making millions off of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5607.421s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5608.622s">I</a>  don't have a problem doing that, um, you know, there is funds I think that are available <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5613.217s">And</a>  from the mitigation fund that I think that we should be going after, as I say, this is definitely gonna be, if this passes, it's definitely damages our community and many other communities also.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5626.483s">So</a>  being a partnership, I think it belittles it, to be honest.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5630.825s">If</a>  that's how you wanna do it that way, I don't have a problem changing it to having the mayor go out and hire a legal team. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5639.73s">I</a>  would support that a thousand percent.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5643.878s">Thank</a>  you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5644.939s">I'm</a>  gonna go with Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5648.124s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5649.466s">Through</a>  the chair, I guess I'd like to ask for a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5652.31s">I'm</a>  not sure if that would be from Councilor Caraviello and Scarpelli or Chief of Staff Mina. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5659.76s">It's</a>  my understanding that the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5662.162s">$2,500</a>  that the mayor is requesting the appropriate is for a distinct attorney to represent.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5670.144s">Mr.</a>  Bloom is gone out and he's had to hire an attorney that is an expert in this particular field. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5681.507s">Not</a>  his regular attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5685.629s">again,</a>  to fight this, to fight the casino, again, who has deep pockets and <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5694.368s">And</a>  again, unfortunately, this is the bad part, but when you use these outside law firms, KP law, which represents us, also represents the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5705.495s">So-</a>  Understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5706.535s">I</a>  think my confusion is around, is the sticking point here, whether this is attorney that's contracted with the city of Medford, or if it's an attorney that we are in effect sharing.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5715.841s">We</a>  would be helping Mr. Blumeroy with his defense, with his legal costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5723.385s">I</a>  mean, that's, you know, it's not $2,500, not a lot of money, but it is a little bit of a help for all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5729.667s">Again,</a>  you know, Chevalier is an integral part of our downtown community here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5735.829s">And</a>  again, I say, you know, if the mayor wants to go out and hire another law firm to team up with Mr. Blumwright's firm, I don't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5746.332s">If</a>  she wants to maybe contact the city of Lynn, Beverly, Lowell, or maybe the three cities can, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5753.525s">pool</a>  their money and hire an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5756.448s">I'm</a>  in favor of that also, but I do think we can't sit back and let this happen and let the people from Encore just come in and just take this away by sidestepping the law, by saying a private person is gonna build this under their auspice with a bridge <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5778.439s">delivering</a>  everybody to the casino. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5781.04s">Again,</a>  if the gaming commission's foolish enough not to realize that, then shame on them also. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5789.263s">But</a>  again, there is millions of dollars in the mitigation fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5792.964s">I</a>  think the mayor should ask for some of that money because the mitigation fund was developed to mitigate the damages caused by the casino. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5804.808s">And</a>  again, I chaired that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5810.042s">for</a>  the Gaming Commission, and I will do everything I can to help divert some of those funds this way also.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5816.951s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5818.973s">Do</a>  you feel like your question's been, do you have a clear understanding of what the request is? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5823.639s">Or</a>  would you like to hear from the Chief of Staff?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5825.081s">I'd</a>  like to hear from the Chief of Staff, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5826.643s">Chief</a>  of Staff Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5830.009s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5831.249s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5834.271s">My</a>  understanding is that the Economic Development Director, Victor Schrader, is on the Zoom call, and I'm sure he can go into further detail, but my understanding is that this is a joint agreement to be able to represent this issue jointly from all fronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5848.056s">My</a>  understanding further is that there's $2,500 that's being requested at the city, $2,500 that's coming from the Chevalier Commission, $2,500 that's coming from the Chevalier Commission, and $5,000 from Mr. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5860.077s">Blumenberg.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5861.639s">I'm</a>  going to say that wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5863.701s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5864.542s">So</a>  Mr. President, I would defer to we do have Victor Schrader.</p>

    <p>[Schrader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5875.825s">Yes,</a>  good evening, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5877.486s">Thank</a>  you, Chief of Staff Victor Schrader, Director of Economic Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5883.231s">The</a>  Chief of Staff summarized that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5885.432s">This</a>  would be a joint retainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5887.674s">We</a>  think it's important to join forces with Bill Blumenreich presents the commission and show a unified front. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5899.823s">And</a>  really fighting for, you know, for the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5903.564s">This</a>  is sort of an existential crisis and we think it's important to pull together so happy to answer any further questions you may have.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5915.708s">Are</a>  you close before you have further questions.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5919.71s">No</a>  further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5920.47s">Thank</a>  you very much for the clarification.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5921.81s">All</a>  right, I'm gonna go to Councilor Knight and then President Morell.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5927.385s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5929.447s">Again,</a>  this is a perfect example why contracting out city law services is not in the best interest of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5936.892s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5937.713s">The</a>  administration needs to own this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5939.695s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5941.076s">Ultimately,</a>  when entered into an agreement, and the agreement had a non compete clause in it that said that they would not open up an entertainment venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5950.923s">We</a>  signed this agreement as a city, Bill Blumenreich did not sign it, the city of Medford signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5958.026s">Because</a>  we signed this mitigation agreement, that led to the city of Medford putting out an RFP for the operations of Chevalier Auditorium, because there was a non-compete in it, which led to us investing money into the auditorium, because we had a non-compete. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5970.093s">The</a>  operator operates that auditorium on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5973.195s">He</a>  doesn't own it, he operates it on behalf of the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5976.837s">So</a>  if the agreement's been violated, or if the terms of the agreements are being stretched, it should be owned by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5985.633s">because</a>  the administration's the one that signed the mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5988.676s">Bill</a>  Blumenreich did not sign that mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5991.478s">The</a>  city of Medford signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5992.819s">So</a>  the city of Medford should own this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5994.78s">All</a>  right, we shouldn't say, oh, sorry, Bill, you're on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5997.463s">And</a>  we certainly shouldn't say, here's 2,500 bucks, because that's not going to get you very far. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6002.567s">All</a>  right, you're going against Wynn Casino, where's 2,500 bucks going to get you? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6005.93s">They'll</a>  give you a free toaster after you go down there and put it in the slot machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6008.512s">On</a>  Sunday, they'll call you down, have you stand in line and give you a free price. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6011.134s">I</a>  mean, that's not going to get us very far, 2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6012.455s">5,000</a>  isn't going to get us very far. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6015.502s">All</a>  right, so I can understand the need and the desire to partner with somebody that has deep pockets in Mr. Blumenreich. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6020.967s">And</a>  I understand that he has a vested interest in what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6024.19s">But</a>  I think we need to take a step back and look at this from a little bit of a different perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6029.168s">But</a>  for the mitigation agreement, we never would have put out the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6033.272s">And</a>  if we never put out the RFP, then Blumenreich never would have been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6036.755s">And</a>  then he never would have been in the situation he's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6038.776s">So</a>  I think that we really need to take a bigger role and a bigger responsibility in this than just a joint partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6043.46s">You</a>  know, this is something that we've been championing as elected officials as politicians as people behind this rail we've been championing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6050.146s">Shavia</a>  is everyone's greatest success story. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6052.468s">Everyone's</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6053.549s">I</a>  built it on my back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6054.65s">He</a>  built it on his back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6055.65s">You</a>  brought the air conditioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6056.711s">You</a>  brought the chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6057.492s">I</a>  mean, every time anybody gets a chance to talk about Shavia, we're over here, we're giving ourselves the biggest pat on the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6062.996s">Let's</a>  own the issue because now's the time to put our money where our mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6066.778s">Now's</a>  the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6067.519s">That's</a>  going to be the catalyst for our downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6069.781s">We</a>  shouldn't be pattering up with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6071.282s">We</a>  should be taking the bull by the horns and we should be driving the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6073.984s">And</a>  I think that we're seeing a lot of that because we're subcontracting on services. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6080.347s">We</a>  don't have that institutional knowledge anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6082.008s">We're</a>  gonna end up moving backwards, not forwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6088.533s">The</a>  biggest and greatest success story of Medford Square in the past 15 years has been Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6092.916s">We</a>  can't let this slip through our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6095.037s">And</a>  a payment of $5,000 or a partnership with the operator, I don't think is gonna cut it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6100.012s">I</a>  think we need to get our state delegation involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6102.994s">I</a>  also think we need to approach this regionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6104.696s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello made up some great, great suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6108.599s">I</a>  mean, the gaming commission has to be on board with this and we have to address it regionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6112.082s">There's</a>  only a number of communities that are eligible to receive funds through the mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6115.985s">We</a>  happen to be one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6116.886s">We</a>  happen to be very fortunate to be one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6118.747s">We</a>  should be capitalizing on that and we should be doing it today, not tomorrow, not later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6122.69s">And</a>  certainly not in partnership and certainly not in second seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6127.681s">because</a>  this city signed the agreement, nobody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6130.062s">So</a>  let's own the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6131.863s">I</a>  look forward to talking about this issue further. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6133.724s">I</a>  think that this is something that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6135.845s">I</a>  appreciate Victor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6137.025s">I</a>  know that Victor's been on top of a lot of the things that are happening in this community when it comes to economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6141.668s">This</a>  is a very big concern for me, a very big concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6145.57s">If</a>  Chevalier fails, the square fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6150.082s">And</a>  quite frankly, it's only hanging on by a thread right now we haven't seen too much going on down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6155.365s">The</a>  mayor announced a big plan at her State of the Union inauguration the other day about putting out an RFI for what we can do to this downtown to redevelop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6165.269s">The</a>  linchpin of the redevelopment of this downtown is that auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6169.031s">And</a>  we need to do all that we can and invest whatever resources we have and pursue whatever funding possibilities are available to us to make sure that it remains successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6177.238s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6178.459s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6180.44s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6181.842s">President</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6183.303s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6184.964s">I</a>  echo some of the same concerns of my fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6188.327s">I</a>  appreciate your efforts in this Councilor Caraviello and I of course have no, you know, $2,500 is very much small potatoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6196.648s">I</a>  have, as my Councilors fellow Councilors have said I have great concerns that we're not seeing a full plan of how this is being addressed how the city is leading in this issue so I wouldn't feel comfortable taking a vote on any appropriation until we know what the full plan of approaches and how we're going to deal with this, and my fellow Councilors have said it better than I could, but I just want to agree with them and say that it's not anti your efforts around this but it's just <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6221.121s">there</a>  needs to be much more work to make sure we do this right and we fight this in the right way and the council's aware of how this is being approached. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6228.323s">So,</a>  that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6229.684s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6232.225s">Thank</a>  you President Morell, just if I may, from the chair before we everyone's had a shot I haven't been able to say anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6238.087s">I'm</a>  learning very quickly what this means to be sitting up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6243.261s">I</a>  just wanna say that I actually agree with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6245.201s">I</a>  agree with everyone on probably most of what everybody said. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6248.542s">So</a>  I do think we're kind of in a bit of a conundrum here, cause I think this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6251.803s">We</a>  gotta fight this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6253.123s">And</a>  I think we need to find the best path forward to fight this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6257.083s">My</a>  one, I think we may be graced by the fact that there is not an appropriation on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6263.445s">I</a>  don't think that we can vote on money that hasn't been requested by the mayor and put on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6269.126s">So</a>  I think we have until, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6272.026s">I</a>  mean, we don't have much time but we have, if, if we want to get to an answer here, you know, a motion could be put forward from the mayor to appropriate certain funds on our next agenda but I just wanted to put it out there that we do not have an appropriation on the agenda tonight, I don't think we do not have the power to create one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6287.176s">So,</a>  just wanted to say that I then saw, Councilor Caraviello we do have some members of the public who want to speak but you first Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6296.022s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6297.932s">I've</a>  had the opportunity to speak representative Donato, and I know he's been in touch with the members of the gaming commission I've talked with Joe Delaney. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6306.794s">He's</a>  my contact that the gaming commission on the mitigation funds, but Victor is Victor still on the call.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6314.815s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6318.676s">He's</a>  on he's he should be on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6321.356s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6321.577s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6325.233s">And</a>  I've talked to Victor many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6326.654s">I</a>  know Victor's been working diligently on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6329.516s">Victor,</a>  are we talking to the other communities also, like Lane and Lowell and Beverly, to form some type of a coalition or something like that also?</p>

    <p>[Schrader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6341.51s">We</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6342.17s">Outreach</a>  has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6343.651s">John</a>  Costas is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6345.031s">He's</a>  helped us reach out to those communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6347.252s">And</a>  there's a call tomorrow at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6350.073s">with</a>  the managers of the theaters in those communities to strategize. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6355.495s">I</a>  think this goes to President <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6357.756s">Morales</a>  question about what the bigger picture is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6361.358s">So</a>  there's that effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6363.219s">In</a>  addition, we've been in touch with the Gaming Commission encouraging them to allow to hear this issue and allow for public input on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6374.504s">There</a>  is a meeting of the Gaming Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6377.666s">We</a>  think it's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6380.688s">January</a>  12th to hear from Encore about their plans for this theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6388.696s">We</a>  think that's an important opportunity to kind of make our initial statement and state our case with respect to the Gaming Act and why this should not be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6401.609s">So</a>  that's why we were <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6404.147s">We're</a>  hopeful that we can move forward with bringing on some legal help to make that case, because time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6415.99s">There'll</a>  be a public comment period, but the Gaming Commission is acting quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6422.651s">And</a>  we learned about this proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6427.132s">In</a>  late December, it's already before the Everett Zoning Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6432.597s">Things</a>  are moving quickly.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6435.86s">Thank</a>  you, Victor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6436.46s">You</a>  know, like you said, you know, Encore is driving the bus on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6441.985s">And</a>  meanwhile, they're telling you they're not driving the bus on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6444.747s">So,</a>  you know, they're saying, well, we don't have anything to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6447.73s">But</a>  they're the ones proposing this theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6450.712s">Again,</a>  they tried to do this <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6455.653s">pre</a>  pandemic and, and it kind of got quelled and now like I said, it's red, it's like we had again. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6462.514s">And</a>  again, this is like Councilor Knight said, you know, we signed the agreement not building right with them and we have to, we have to own this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6472.876s">And</a>  again, you know, if this is as vital as everybody says it is, it needs immediate attention now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6479.117s">And</a>  again, you know, these, this is moving quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6481.978s">Every,</a>  every schooling for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6484.672s">But</a>  again, y'all, again, to have them do this and overpay for acts that none of these other cities are ever gonna be able to get again is an out and out disgrace and shame on the gaming commission if they allow this to happen and they should all be fired if they do allow this to happen.</p>

    <p>[Schrader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6507.841s">President</a>  Caraviello, if I may, I think the strategy on Encore's part is to hope that no one notices. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6516.603s">And</a>  so we need to notice and make sure they know that we're aware of it and that they're acting outside of the parameters of the gaming act and come with a solid legal argument against what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6530.486s">And</a>  that means we need to act now because that meeting is, the initial meeting is next week.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6536.562s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6537.103s">I</a>  think it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6538.326s">I</a>  think on the meeting that I was on with you a few weeks ago, I think they said it was going to be on the 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6543.957s">So</a>  again, time is of the essence here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6547.302s">And</a>  again, I think we need to rally up and make sure that our state delegation also fights for us on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6553.826s">I</a>  know Representative Donato has had conversation with the Gaming Commission people already. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6560.45s">So</a>  again, this is a really important issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6566.774s">To</a>  sit back and do nothing would be an out and out shame for us and to allow this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6574.417s">Everybody</a>  sees what it's done for the community when it was working the way it was supposed to be working, and hopefully it will continue to work the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6582.62s">I</a>  mean, the money that we got in meal taxes during the time that the theater was operating, we saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6591.843s">So,</a>  I mean, an investment in legal fees, the money would only come back in revenue into the city.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6602.577s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, just, I'm going to go to Council, but I just want to make this point clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6607.801s">I</a>  understand time is of the essence, I understand this was found out in late December and this is our first council meeting since then, there's no appropriation before this council tonight, we cannot create an appropriation, regardless of the timeframe, so, so we cannot appropriate money tonight for this effort, because it just <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6625.736s">We</a>  do not have the American come back with a paper next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6628.299s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6628.599s">Yes,</a>  that was an appropriation on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6630.322s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6630.642s">I'm</a>  just saying, you know, I want to make it clear to everybody tonight that we can't.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6636.429s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6636.829s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, I think that to reiterate <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6639.759s">I</a>  think it's important that we as a council stand together and strong and asking the mayor to not come back with $2,500 next week, but to come back as a standalone battle against Encore and the gaming commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6654.009s">So</a>  they know that there are two different entities coming out of this community going after what they're trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6661.394s">I</a>  think it's that important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6662.895s">And</a>  I think the other piece looking down the line, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6667.322s">If</a>  this doesn't work in our favor, who's to say the person we're going into partnership with to battle this issue doesn't want to break a contract and then we find ourselves in a legal battle with that group. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6680.211s">So</a>  I think working together would be a huge, huge disservice to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6685.415s">So</a>  I think, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6688.3s">I</a>  wasn't as articulate and obviously it's Councilor Council night, but it's imperative that we are a standalone entity as a city of Medford fighting for the agreement that was put together and. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6701.844s">And</a>  if I were the mayor, I would really love to have a conversation with with Mayor de Maria over and ever and ask him, is this the way we want to do business because I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6714.008s">They</a>  realize the impact the negative impact their paint these neighbor communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6718.67s">That's</a>  not the way partnership I want to work with the neighboring neighboring administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6722.632s">So,</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6724.973s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6726.114s">We're</a>  going to go to members of the public in a minute but I would agree that, you know, considering this hearing is on the 12th our next meeting is on the 11th, I think it would be probably a good move in the short term to have the city <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6739.038s">solicitor</a>  represent us, at least in that initial engagement while we get another plan back here to address this fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6746.061s">That's</a>  just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6747.162s">We've</a>  got two members of the public who want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6750.003s">First,</a>  Mr. John Costas, please give your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6757.467s">You</a>  can unmute yourself, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6758.908s">There</a>  you go.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6759.308s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6760.208s">How</a>  you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6761.189s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6762.69s">John</a>  Costas, 19 Salem Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6766.788s">Um,</a>  okay, so I've been involved in the theater since 1981 when they were going to make a parking lot out of the entire high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6775.835s">Um,</a>  and we worked really, really hard for over 40 years to get it to where it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6780.799s">And,</a>  you know, the civic commission did a really great job bringing it up to a level of professionalism and having Bill Blumenreich presents run and operate the theater just brought it that much further. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6794.484s">For</a>  many, many, many years, we were getting a lot of complaints, so when can we do more with the theater? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6799.247s">The</a>  theater's not doing enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6801.649s">And</a>  now that we've had a very, very successful run, it's really disappointing to hear what Encore wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6809.393s">Now,</a>  I've been in touch with Lynn Lowell, the Cabot Theater, and they're all very, very much concerned about what Encore could do to all the surrounding theaters, including some of the smaller Boston theaters. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6824.423s">1800</a>  seats is kind of a good number for them, but it will put out, it's not just a City of Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6831.686s">Lynn</a>  and Lowell has a lot to lose by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6834.447s">And</a>  they want to participate somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6837.189s">And</a>  we're having, as Victor said, we have, I set up a meeting with them for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6842.451s">And</a>  one of the ideas was to get the theater managers together to summarize a plan <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6848.796s">and</a>  have each theater manager of each city talk to their respective mayors and discuss a plan on getting together, because I think that separating it is not a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6862.402s">I</a>  think that if we can get all the surrounding communities involved and show up as one large group of people, A, we'll have a lot more money to deal with and we can get more bang for our buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6875.833s">I</a>  think three or four cities coming before the Gaming Commission as a unified front is the best approach we can go with right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6884.599s">So</a>  I would like to see us pursue the rest of the legal work through the professional attorney that was just suggested to us that as of right now, the fee is going to be split between Bill and the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6902.583s">and</a>  hopefully the city can add part of their funds to it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6907.125s">But</a>  I also agree that this isn't just a Bill Blumenberg problem, because we need them, they need us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6915.288s">And</a>  so we have to work well with them and we can't throw Bill Blumenberg under the bus and say, well, you get more money than we do, so you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6924.051s">It's</a>  all of us working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6926.752s">So</a>  whatever funding the mayor requests, I think it'd be to the city's best interest <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6932.692s">to</a>  work with one attorney and hopefully the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6937.616s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6939.938s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Kostas. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6941.179s">Mr.</a>  Navarre?</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6947.465s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6950.688s">I</a>  just wanted to make a quick point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6952.75s">It</a>  was echoing what Councilor Knight said. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6956.998s">I</a>  think that it's worth taking the opportunity sometime before the budget happens to to look at the KP law situation, because I remember that was this relationship with KP law was established right before the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6970.904s">I</a>  don't think it got a lot of attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6972.264s">I</a>  remember it was sort of one of those things that we were sort of iffy on and it sort of happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6977.077s">And</a>  I don't think very many members of the public are aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6980.421s">And</a>  so it probably even the new councilors aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6983.825s">And</a>  so I think it'd be good if there was sort of a discussion to evaluate how that's going, especially from the perspective of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6991.474s">Something</a>  that was proposed by the city to have this KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6994.818s">But</a>  from the perspective of the city council, it seems like every time we hear about it, it's bad news. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6999.283s">So</a>  it'd be worth hearing about that, updating the public and just enumerating how that's working for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7007.571s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7008.812s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Navarre. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7010.013s">Mr.</a>  Ken Kraus, name and address for the record once I unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7016.96s">All</a>  yours, Ken.</p>

    <p>[NqJnNNyD4Uw_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7018.529s">Thank</a>  you, Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7022.395s">I'm</a>  also the treasurer of the Francis Schweier Auditorium and the president of the Schweier Theater Organ Society and have been engaged in this <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7033.249s">issue</a>  for the last six weeks or so when it came to light actually in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7038.693s">I</a>  thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up and also agree with the sentiment that the city needs to be aggressive in the lead on this in terms of opposing this from whatever angles that needs to legally or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7054.297s">The</a>  city owns the building, of course, and the city has the agreement with Wynn that Wynn agreed to provide ongoing support for Shibata Theater, and clearly it's not doing this in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7069.688s">I</a>  do agree with what John said as well, that it's important that we work together with Bill Blumenreich. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7076.92s">He's</a>  done a sensational job operating this building, and we would do well to continue to have that relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7084.682s">They</a>  have a five-year initial contract that's approaching the fifth year, and it would be good for this relationship, I think, to remain strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7096.546s">They</a>  have the option to not stay on as the operator after five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7102.157s">And</a>  frankly, if the wind project goes through, it'll be hard to get anybody, I think, to run Chevalier Theatre, because the gambling casino rules state that the licensee cannot build a <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7120.565s">venue</a>  for entertainment purposes of between 1,000 seats and 3,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7126.65s">It</a>  has to be less than that or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7128.792s">And</a>  as Councilor Caraviello mentioned in 2019, Wynn started to book shows in their ballroom like the B-52s and Smokey Robinson acts paying twice and three times as much what Bill Blumenreich would pay for them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7145.925s">And</a>  it was Bill actually that called this to the attention of the gaming commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7150.609s">And</a>  Encore backed down on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7154.09s">But</a>  subsequently, they began to purchase, Wynn Resorts began to purchase parcel after parcel across the street from the casino with the intention of creating an entertainment and restaurant district, which is what you see being presented right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7171.677s">I</a>  attended the Everett Planning Board meeting in December when Wynn Casino made one of its presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7179.86s">They</a>  made no bones about that they were Wynn Resorts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7183.701s">The</a>  president, Chris Gordon, introduced himself as Wynn Resorts, and that Wynn Resorts was building the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7190.664s">And</a>  they said the key piece is the pedestrian walkway that connects both venues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7195.586s">So</a>  it's clearly a connection in addition to the casino complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7202.008s">The</a>  law, again, states that the licensee cannot build <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7206.545s">a</a>  entertainment venue of that size. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7208.506s">So,</a>  the way I and many others read this law, they can build the entertainment venue, but it has to be either 999 seats or 3,501 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7220.175s">So,</a>  I just think that it's important that we, as a city, fight this every way possible, in partnership with Bell, Bloom, and Rice, and that we do it <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7233.351s">hastily</a>  because the meetings are coming up in the next week and two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7237.513s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7242.276s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7247.218s">Any</a>  further discussion from members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7250.7s">I</a>  see more Carol, I'm going to unmute you please give us your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7307.166s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Carroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7308.287s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7310.189s">Vic,</a>  your hand's still up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7312.171s">Do</a>  you want to speak again? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7313.332s">Go</a>  ahead, Vic.</p>

    <p>[Schrader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7319.312s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7320.233s">Just</a>  two points that I think are important that I forgot to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7324.295s">In</a>  terms of the legal agreement in partnership with Bill Bumenreich and the commission, it would be a limited engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7334.242s">It's</a>  really just an opportunity to act quickly and get a response in <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7342.287s">conjunction</a>  with the timing of the gaming commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7344.349s">If</a>  we were to pursue a more in-depth legal action, we can change course at any point and certainly work with the council on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7356.742s">So</a>  I just wanted to mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7358.244s">Also,</a>  the source of funds for this would be <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7363.409s">through</a>  the city solicitor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7365.51s">So</a>  just as a point of clarification, I'm not sure if that's requires an appropriation or if it's just general support of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7374.996s">So</a>  I'll leave that to folks that maybe understand that a little bit more than me, but I just want to bring that up as a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7382.621s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7387.088s">I'll</a>  start earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7388.549s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7389.689s">Thank</a>  you, Victor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7390.69s">I</a>  mean if the money has already been appropriated, then, then it's at the discretion of the mayor to use that money for this effort if she so chooses, or to come back before us in the future with an appropriation and additional appropriation so given that, I think, Councilor Caraviello that would mean that you would draw the big paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7413.326s">And</a>  so we have on the initial paper, be it resolved, and again, just from the chair, I agree that we should strongly be opposing this effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7423.289s">Go</a>  ahead, Councilor Caraviellolo.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7424.31s">Mr.</a>  President, I think we all got an email from the mayor earlier suggesting that she'd be willing to put in funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7433.332s">I</a>  think everyone should have gotten that email earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7436.173s">And</a>  I thank the mayor for stepping up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7438.234s">I</a>  mean, that's not a lot of money, but it's a start. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7443.725s">to</a>  sit back and do nothing would be a disgrace to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7449.41s">It's</a>  just vital for the growth of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7455.035s">And</a>  the small amount of money we put up, we certainly got more than that back when meals taxes and people just coming into the community, spending money here on all avenues.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7468.066s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7469.227s">And</a>  again, just from the chair, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7471.713s">We</a>  all agree on the benefit of Chevalier that need to fight this, the fact that Encore should not be doing this, and it's a clear violation of their agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7478.919s">There</a>  may be some, I tend to agree with Councilor Scarpelli on some of the questions around who's paying for what, but certainly I personally am supportive.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7487.406s">And</a>  like I said, like Mr. Crow said, Mr. Blumleit's agreement is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7493.11s">We're</a>  on the fifth year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7493.971s">I'd</a>  hate to see the guy walk out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7496.333s">I</a>  guess I'd say if this goes through, I mean, it's essentially, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7502.165s">The</a>  guys that the guys that have business in the city of metric. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7505.006s">Gotcha.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7506.707s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello any further discussion, seeing none online see now in the room on the motion of Councilor Caraviello the a paper be it resolved that the administration share with the council it's planned to oppose the new 1800 seat arena proposed by the encore casino proposed by Councilor Caraviello seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7977.583s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7980.424s">I</a>  think this is something I think everyone's out, CVS, Walgreens, everyone's looking to go out and buy these. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7987.108s">And</a>  I think residents of the community are a little upset that other communities have gotten them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7994.291s">And</a>  we haven't gotten any, and we haven't gotten them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7998.333s">I</a>  would hope that the mayor, through her contact with ABLE and through the APRA funds, can hopefully arrange to purchase some home testing kits to give out to the residents of Medford so they can stay on top of this during this tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8014.004s">I</a>  mean, they're a little bit pricey, $25 to $35 to go out and buy one, if you can even find them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8022.411s">And</a>  like I said, I know the community is giving it for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8025.578s">I</a>  know people in New Hampshire are getting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8027.541s">Every</a>  family got eight in New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8030.217s">So</a>  I would hope that the mayor, through her contacts, would be able to go out and purchase some and make them available to the residents of Medford, so we can stay on top of the situation and try to keep it under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8044.461s">I</a>  mean, we can't keep running up to the hospital to get these done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8047.602s">And</a>  as I said, the availability of CVS and drugstores throughout the whole area, next to impossible to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8053.724s">So</a>  I reach out to the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8056.672s">to</a>  use your contacts to the state or whatever to buy them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8061.415s">So</a>  again, we've got money in the APRA accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8065.177s">This</a>  is what it's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8066.778s">So</a>  the residents can do self-testing and keep everybody safe.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8254.814s">Mr.</a>  President, I had the opportunity to read this, and this conversation did take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8262.459s">And</a>  I think that the sticking point on this particular measure was the contact wanted its own direct contact with KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8270.745s">They</a>  didn't want to have to go through someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8274.088s">And</a>  I think that was the only holdup <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8279.051s">in</a>  that thing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8279.952s">And</a>  again, I would still support this as long as we have a direct contact, so we didn't have to go through a third party to get the KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8288.796s">I</a>  don't know how my other Councilors feel, but I think that was the feeling of the council last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8295.439s">And</a>  again, if that's changed that they wanna go through a third party, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8299.62s">But</a>  I thought that it was in the best interest <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8303.705s">that</a>  we had a direct contact and that contact with if they couldn't handle it, they were referred that to whatever, whatever avenue in KP law that they felt necessary.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8316.575s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8318.076s">This</a>  started out as a council priority for the council to receive independent legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8328.464s">And</a>  that proposal and priority arose from <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8332.622s">the</a>  fact that there were an inordinate number of requests for opinions, the draft pieces of legislation this council makes that we don't receive, for whatever reason, that may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8345.607s">When</a>  the budget was debated, a motion was made to reduce the contracted legal services line item by about 50,000 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8358.952s">And</a>  the reason that that motion was made <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8361.313s">was</a>  because of a dissatisfaction with the level of service that we were being provided as a governmental body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8369.959s">And</a>  as part of that discussion, Councilor Caraviello was authorized to go negotiate with the mayor in terms of an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8379.065s">Now,</a>  the council wanted its own lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8381.967s">The</a>  council wanted its own person that they could go to, an assistant city solicitor to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8387.391s">And</a>  that was taken off the table immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8389.844s">And</a>  what the council got was the ability to get permission from the city solicitor to talk to a third party vendor for legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8399.489s">And</a>  that's not what we were asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8401.25s">That's</a>  not what we were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8402.671s">And</a>  that's not something I'm going to support tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8405.172s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8406.172s">Um,</a>  the narrative is false. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8408.554s">It's</a>  a false narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8409.894s">You</a>  know, um, sometimes the press release sounds a lot better than the real story. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8414.597s">And</a>  the real story is the council has been begging for legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8417.847s">Since</a>  we've gotten that one time we've gotten legal counsel that's been my proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8422.21s">We've</a>  moved this community 15 years forward in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8426.494s">Since</a>  we've gotten our own legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8428.655s">This</a>  is an issue I'm not willing to budge on Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8431.377s">We</a>  haven't been able to negotiate terms of an agreement that were agreeable to the previous council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8436.061s">So</a>  what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8437.482s">The</a>  first meeting with a new council, the appropriation paper comes on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8442.147s">and</a>  two Councilors that don't have the institutional knowledge of the background of this issue that happened are gonna be put on the spot to take a vote for a $50,000 appropriation on their first day of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8451.554s">That's</a>  not right, that's not fair, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8454.576s">Number</a>  two, we still haven't addressed the overall issue that this council has relative to its ability to retain and attain efficient, effective, and immediate legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8468.186s">So</a>  with that being said, this is a paper I cannot support tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8471.892s">We're</a>  seeing paper after paper come before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8474.954s">Let's</a>  look at the ad to $190 million budget, the largest budget in the city's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8480.299s">And</a>  every week we're getting hit with papers saying, give us more, give us more, give us more. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8487.164s">Where's</a>  the financial plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8489.526s">What's</a>  going on in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8492.188s">We</a>  can't just spend, spend, spend because that sounds like a good idea and see what sticks to the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8496.812s">That's</a>  not how you run government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8497.873s">That's</a>  not how you run government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8501.243s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, this is an item that I cannot support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8505.445s">I</a>  thank Councilor Capiello for giving it a great effort, but the negotiations moved nowhere in terms of what the administration offered at the beginning, what the council wanted, and where we ended up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8519.454s">There</a>  was no moving of the needle. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8522.395s">This</a>  is what I'm gonna give you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8523.356s">Take</a>  it or leave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8525.017s">Leave</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8525.477s">I'm</a>  gonna put out the press release saying that this is what I did, even though it's not what I did, and you guys can go and try to explain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8533.117s">Right,</a>  and they have two new freshman Councilors that are here that are gonna have to go out there and explain how come you don't want the city to have a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8540.447s">How</a>  come you don't want, how come you don't want to spend $50,000 for the city to have legal counsel and you're just talking about the supplier auditorium and what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8547.809s">We're</a>  going to give the Shavaya auditorium 2500 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8550.87s">We're</a>  going to come here and increase the budget by $50,000 to pay KP law, a third party vendor can't represent us in this in this big issue that we're just talking about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8559.053s">This</a>  doesn't make sense to me Mr. President, this doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8562.914s">That's</a>  where I stand on the issue I certainly would love to hear what my council colleagues have to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8568.776s">But</a>  I'm telling you, I don't see this item coming up for a vote tonight.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8573.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8576.054s">I</a>  just wanted to start by saying I'm keeping an open mind on the subject, and that I understand <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8583.911s">you</a>  know, that this is under fiscal year 22, but I do have concerns about, I mean, that I think all of my fellow Councilors have raised both in this meeting and in meetings previous last year with regards to cost, conflict of interest, immediacy, our direct counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8601.643s">And</a>  so I wanted to ask through the chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8604.525s">Um</a>  I wanted to ask Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian if uh the mayor's office um has a plan to explore hiring an assistant city civil so there in the upcoming year because when we think about budgets it's important that we are planning ahead um um so that we're not bumping into situations that uh Councilor Knight and Councilor Caravillo described tonight um and I do believe that it's important for us to um <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8630.363s">to</a>  recognize that there has been a downscaling of city government in the last few decades and that we not fall fall into that trap. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8639.469s">And</a>  so I pose a question.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8642.655s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8642.975s">Point</a>  of information just on when we speak about the downscaling of government, one of those things, you know, coming from the labor movement, one of those big things that we're very concerned about in the downscaling government is the privatization of services and the lack of institutional knowledge, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8655.103s">So</a>  when we're talking about the downsizing of government, the downscaling of government, we're talking about the race to the bottom, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8659.906s">It's</a>  the race to the bottom, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8661.006s">We're</a>  going to take this job that someone was getting a good pay, a good health benefit, and a good pension benefit, and we're going to take it out of government's hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8668.531s">We're</a>  going to subcontract it to somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8670.132s">We're</a>  going to pay them less money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8671.759s">give</a>  them less benefits, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8673.94s">And</a>  not give them a solid retirement opportunities, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8677.081s">But</a>  we're gonna be able to reap the rewards of that business decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8681.423s">That's</a>  not equitable, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8683.683s">Like</a>  you're saying, it's a race to the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8685.584s">It's</a>  a race to the bottom.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8686.804s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8687.405s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8688.505s">Chief</a>  of Staff Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8692.366s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8693.327s">Thank</a>  you for the question, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8695.708s">I</a>  am <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8697.575s">The</a>  city has found a considerable amount of benefit from working with KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8702.016s">And</a>  the reason for that is because they provide depth and breadth in many different subjects. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8708.398s">And</a>  in my experience in other communities, it's helpful to have special counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8713.139s">And</a>  so the answer from my understanding at this point is no, we have not specifically discussed an assistant city solicitor because we have found that the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8723.012s">relationship</a>  with KP Law has been very successful because they're able to provide niche-specific guidance on really intricate issues that relate across the gamut. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8733.894s">And</a>  as you will see in common practice and industry, there is a tremendous amount of specialty in law and with many fields, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8743.335s">And</a>  so the size of the city, the needs of the city, in my opinion, and I don't want to speak for the mayor, certainly, I believe, dictate a need for <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8753.542s">Council</a>  to have an extensive reach on discipline specific issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8759.426s">I</a>  hope that answers your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8762.448s">And</a>  I also, Mr. President, if I may, I apologize Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8766.991s">The</a>  only thing I want to clarify is that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8769.832s">This</a>  paper, as written, isn't proposing permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8773.676s">It's</a>  proposing keeping the department head, who is the center and core of the city's legal department, informed of matters that are being presented to KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8786.088s">It's</a>  really, it's not a permission matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8788.03s">It's</a>  a keeping informed matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8790.513s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8791.369s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8793.37s">If</a>  I may, does that answer your question, Councilor Tseng?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8796.251s">I</a>  do have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8797.511s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8797.912s">I'll</a>  go back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8799.772s">And</a>  there is feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8800.513s">So</a>  folks can just shut off their microphones when they're done speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8802.653s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8804.954s">The</a>  point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8808.556s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8817.008s">we</a>  had Jonathan Silverman from KP law here before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8821.91s">And</a>  he was posed the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8826.012s">We</a>  do not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8826.653s">Do</a>  you work for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8827.533s">No,</a>  we do not work for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8828.513s">We</a>  work for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8830.794s">We</a>  don't work for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8831.555s">We</a>  work for the mayor that came right out of his mouth on that TV screen and on that TV screen, right in these chambers.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8838.458s">And</a>  to that point, to that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8843.9s">and</a>  to my fellow councils that are new, I think that the frustrating point was when we were posed questions and we needed guidance, we sat here looking very, very bad because the city solicitor responded back to us and said, I cannot answer your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8866.415s">Because</a>  of conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8868.617s">So</a>  that's why the, the importance was that we had our own legal representation and it wasn't wasn't put forth at the time was like us against the mayor, it wasn't, it was to get guidance and how to proceed with an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8883.232s">We</a>  sat here I believe for two separate days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8886.239s">over</a>  a meeting that we did nothing but look at each other because nobody could answer the question because our legal representation, which is our city solicitor, couldn't guide us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8896.529s">And</a>  that's what was the frustrating point for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8899.131s">And</a>  I think I appreciate the mayor trying this, but this brings us to the same concern, which is it goes to the city solicitor, which is a conflict when we have concerns dealing with issues that are brought to us <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8911.363s">with,</a>  you know, with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8912.644s">So</a>  again, that's a winded point of information, but I wanted to make sure that that was, that was my biggest concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8918.728s">That's</a>  that we look like, we look like amateurs, and it looked really bad on us and this governing body in our community, that we didn't have that guidance.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8928.355s">So</a>  on that point, Mr. President, when you think about all the things that KP law touched during the past term, 5g nightmare, marijuana nightmare, the only thing we got done was the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8941.037s">clothing</a>  collection bins, I think, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8945.321s">At</a>  the end of the day, right?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8947.162s">And</a>  roaches, rodents and roaches, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8950.065s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8950.745s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8952.387s">Councilor</a>  Sen, you have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8954.769s">I</a>  was wondering if, I guess, do I have to do this through the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8958.993s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8959.333s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8962.476s">I</a>  was wondering if the chief of staff could, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8965.63s">perhaps</a>  quickly address some of these points tonight about the immediacy of a legal aid to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8977.129s">Chief</a>  of staff Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8979.083s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8980.704s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8982.544s">I</a>  mean, the simplest way for me to answer that question is that the immediacy is that if we're unable to make progress on this paper in short order, we may need to cease services with KP Law because we wanna make sure we've got the budget in place and we may then be constraining our resources down to only one support staff.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9007.572s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng, is that support stuff you refer to the city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9012.097s">Mr.</a>  President to answer Council nights question yes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9015.42s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9019.302s">I</a>  just wanted to express my view, which is that when when the city approaches the next budgeting cycle we should, I would recommend that the mayor's office take a look at re reconsider their stance on this issue and I understand where the mayor's office is coming from I understand the benefits of having KP law and with the work that they've done but I also want to make sure that my fellow Councilors concerns and my concerns are addressed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9046.313s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9046.993s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9050.38s">Thank</a>  you, and through the chair, thank you for your response tonight for being here to help clarify some of the issues surrounding this in considering this paper I think for me it's a matter of balancing or what's in my mind is the short term necessity of not having a service interruption when it comes to having. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9068.73s">legal</a>  counsel available to the city available to the city council, even if in an inadequate way with the long term need to deliver on the priority to have more readily accessible legal counsel to the city council which I agree fully agree should be a priority and in general strongly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9086.04s">proponent</a>  of bringing more services in-house to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9089.822s">I</a>  do plan on voting in favor of this paper tonight, but I do just want to say that I think that doesn't take away from the very strong need to reconsider where access to council lies for the city council going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9104.972s">I</a>  don't want to see a service interruption or a greater <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9112.055s">lack</a>  of access to legal counsel for anybody in the city administration or the city council through the remainder of this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9119.579s">I</a>  think that would be, you know, harmful. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9123.321s">I</a>  don't think that would be productive in the short term, but in the long term, I do agree that we need to, you know, support the city administration, support the mayor in figuring out how to get to a more sustainable situation in terms of the city council's access to legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9139.15s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9140.563s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9143.866s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9146.628s">10</a>  minutes ago, we sat here and belated appoints about spending $2,500 for an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9151.451s">And</a>  here we're asking for $81,600 for an attorney who can't even represent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9159.117s">How</a>  in the world could you expect me to vote on this tonight when we don't have, when we have an attorney representing another city against us? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9171.202s">If</a>  I'm missing something in this, please let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9173.424s">But</a>  KP Law is obviously not doing the job for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9178.187s">They're</a>  doing it for Everett now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9179.868s">And</a>  we're arguing for about $2,500 to go out and hire another law firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9188.154s">I</a>  just don't see the rationality of this here right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9192.938s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Craviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9194.559s">President</a>  Morell is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9196.52s">I</a>  don't see your hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9197.281s">I</a>  just wanted to ask if you wanted to chime in before I chime in.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9201.687s">Um,</a>  yeah, thank you, Vice President Bears I want to echo what Councilor Collins said I understand, you know, the, the concerns of the council I have the same concerns I absolutely would like to see this as an assistant city solicitor position and build up that institutional knowledge and, you know, have that office at a staffing level it's historically had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9222.204s">But</a>  with that said, I don't want to interrupt service and the support that's being provided to the city solicitor at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9228.348s">Um,</a>  you know, I'm definitely conflicted and I would like to see at the budget that as Councilor Collins said, really considering the assistant city solicitor position so that we're not at this crossroads where our hands are, um, in some way tied where I don't want to remove support from solicitor Scanlon and all the work she has before her. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9246.155s">Um,</a>  but I, I'd love to see it not done by KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9250.277s">Um,</a>  so that's all I have for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9252.598s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9255.479s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9257.14s">And</a>  if I may, from the chair, I am of a similar mind that we shouldn't hamstring the work of city government at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9268.027s">I</a>  would say that, you know, I would have preferred a different resolution and proposal before us tonight than what is before us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9277.052s">And</a>  as it comes to the fiscal 23 budget, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9281.919s">I</a>  would not support the law office structure as constituted as the city solicitor and KP law only. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9287.723s">I</a>  can hear you on the benefits of KP law, I think you could create a structure where we actually have a full time assistant city solicitor, the current city solicitor, and an amount of money set aside for when we need special counsel, I think that would be a much more appropriate <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9303.375s">uh,</a>  way to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9304.836s">However,</a>  that's not what's before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9306.876s">Um,</a>  so in a similar fashion to Councilor Collins, I would agree, uh, I would agree to move this forward tonight, uh, but with the understanding that, you know, in the next budget round, it's going to have to be different, um, or we're not going to, you know, if we get this again, I think you're going to see what happened last time, except maybe instead of going down to 26,000, it goes down to zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9326.842s">So,</a>  um, just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9328.583s">Uh,</a>  is there any further discussion, uh, from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9331.844s">Councilor</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9334.483s">I</a>  am, after listening to all the comments being made, I believe I am of a similar mind with what Zach said. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9343.569s">Tonight,</a>  I think it's not worth it to answering the city government in terms of what it needs to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9350.795s">I</a>  understand the reality of the situation and I think we need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9355.138s">But</a>  when it comes to fiscal 23, I believe it's important that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9361.082s">we</a>  consider structuring the office as actually as Councilor Bears, as Vice President Bears has proposed, perhaps having a solicitor, assistant solicitor, and maybe some money set aside for special counsel if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9378.305s">But</a>  for tonight, I'll vote to move this forward, but I do believe it's important to consider that in the future.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9420.785s">All</a>  right, rule 20.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9421.866s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9427.629s">Any</a>  finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9435.254s">Councilor</a>  Knight has invoked rule 20 therefore this paper is laid upon the table for one week.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9458.116s">Paper</a>  two. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9463.178s">Paper</a>  22-023 December 30 2020 re personnel ordinance dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the city council approves the following amendments the revised ordinances entitled personnel article to classification and compensation plan section 66 dash 33 entitled officers and employees, hyphen non union by adopting the following changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9487.031s">amendment</a>  a that the language of CAF 20 shall be amended to remove the following position of the language of CAF 21 shall be amended to include the following position, quote, finance director slash auditor, amendment B, the language of CAF 19 shall be amended to include the following position, human resources director, additional positions may be added to the existing compensation plan following the upcoming compensation plan and salary study being undertaken by the city through the community compact grant program, respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, mayor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9526.085s">I</a>  believe it was prior to 90 days.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9548.294s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9550.654s">I'm</a>  going to keep my comments brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9554.735s">Obviously,</a>  a number of members of the City Council have heard some parts of this, but I'll just point out the new items and update the new Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9564.237s">For</a>  the first item, Amendment A, for modifying the CAF for the Finance Director slash Auditor, we have a 22-step scale here in the City for non-union personnel that fall into the CAF. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9578.8s">editorially,</a>  we have a lot of work to do to revise this calf system. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9582.461s">And</a>  that is, as noted with the classification and compensation study for which the mayor has secured a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9588.424s">But</a>  beyond that, there's a 22 step scale, the mayor's at step 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9593.086s">There</a>  are two employees at step 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9596.007s">Presently,</a>  that is the chief of staff and the city solicitor, and then at calf <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9602.66s">20</a>  presently the finance director and auditor sits. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9605.782s">The</a>  city has reviewed other communities and I have the data here today, and I'd be happy to review it with you all for equivalent positions in adjacent communities and nearby communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9616.93s">We've</a>  also posted this position we have found very limited candidates, frankly that what's happening is there's a limitation on <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9624.335s">experienced</a>  municipal finance directors in the field and we're finding that we really need to raise our salary to be competitive, so I'll leave my comments they're happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9635.823s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President, I'll go to amendment be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9638.75s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9639.91s">The</a>  last time this matter came up, the item was titled a Chief People Officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9644.771s">We're</a>  presenting this as Human Resources Director, understanding some of the comments that were made previously with regard to this item relative to the Council feeling that a Human Resources Director may be more appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9656.714s">So</a>  we're trying to strike a compromise here and move this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9661.015s">So</a>  happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9662.196s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9663.496s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9665.036s">Any</a>  discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9665.716s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9666.617s">I</a>  do believe that</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9668.703s">The</a>  Finance Director Auditor position was upgraded relatively recently, was it not? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9676.229s">Under</a>  the previous administration, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9680.132s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9682.193s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't have that history. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9683.654s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9684.515s">Chief</a>  of Staff doesn't have that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9688.663s">My</a>  recommendation would be to hold off until we get this classification study complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9692.425s">It</a>  seems like every week we get the new position that we wanna upgrade, we wanna upgrade, we wanna upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9696.807s">We</a>  don't have the ability to look at the total picture right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9699.208s">We're</a>  not looking at the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9700.788s">We're</a>  handling things in a piecemeal approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9703.429s">I</a>  don't think it's gonna work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9704.45s">I</a>  don't think it's fiscally responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9707.371s">So</a>  tonight we had a paper before us that asked to increase the city's budget by 50,000 or so dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9714.182s">We</a>  also have a paper before us that's asking to increase the salary, which is going to have a budgetary impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9719.186s">A</a>  couple weeks ago, we got another paper that was upgrading another position. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9723.869s">So</a>  we're seeing these job classifications that people are sitting in being upgraded, people getting raises in the salaries are causing the budget to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9737.135s">At</a>  some point, we need to take a look at what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9739.796s">Our</a>  budget right now is already over 80% salary in benefits, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9744.599s">So</a>  let's look at our spending a little bit before we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9748.34s">If</a>  we have a grant for a classification study, and one of the most important positions that we have in the community would be the chief financial officer and auditor, I think we should probably let the study take place so that the experts can tell us exactly where that position needs to fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9764.848s">The</a>  reason I say that is because <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9767.399s">If</a>  we keep doing what we're doing, they're not going to have anything to study because we're going through every single position that we have here and we're creating caps and classifications for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9777.146s">And</a>  I feel as though, you know, we're kind of putting the cat before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9781.029s">We're</a>  talking about a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9782.75s">We're</a>  talking about having the call and set to come in and do a classification study. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9787.633s">Let</a>  them do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9789.335s">Let's</a>  not move people to where we think they should be and then have them come in and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9792.537s">Let's</a>  get our back for our buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9794.238s">Let's</a>  let the grant work these issues out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9797.912s">because</a>  I'd be much more inclined to support a comprehensive review that has a report attached to it saying this is where our deficiencies are, this is where we can do better than coming at a piecemeal week by week and saying this is the position we want this week, this is the position next week we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9814.478s">I</a>  understand the administration said that they're going to be bringing positions forward and that they're also going to be doing the classification study. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9820.361s">I</a>  don't think that's the right way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9821.861s">That's</a>  just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9822.902s">I</a>  think if we have the grant to do a classification study, let's utilize the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9826.504s">That's</a>  what it's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9827.124s">Let's</a>  let these experts in the field come back and give us a work product so that we can make an informed decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9832.366s">That's</a>  where I'm coming from on this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9835.588s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9836.528s">Further</a>  discussion?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9843.827s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9844.207s">If</a>  I could, through the chair, just Chief of Staff Nazarian, do we know when we're expecting results from that classification study? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9852.612s">I'm</a>  sure I've asked this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9855.374s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9858.142s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9859.743s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9861.404s">I'm</a>  not entirely sure how to address the council members this evening, but anyway, we are entering into the contract agreement and I could pull up the contract agreement quickly and answer that question to be able to identify the timeframe, but I don't have that answer immediately.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9878.776s">Okay,</a>  and that's like, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9883.299s">Sorry,</a>  Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9886.161s">Yeah,</a>  if it could be done, that would be great.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9892.598s">Yeah,</a>  if I can.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9894.279s">Yeah,</a>  well well well the team is definitely.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9896.361s">Yeah,</a>  I just think that it's just the common denominator that we've been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9904.008s">And</a>  I'm going to stick to what I've been talking about with the proposal for the traffic and parking, not truly having a plan in place for moving forward with funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9915.14s">We,</a>  we did that, when we're looking at what we talked about in the last, the last time we're here about funding for different positions and we talked about not really going through the understanding where we're going with the ARPA money, and why we just spending without having a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9938.873s">And</a>  I guess Council and I, I've been talking about the situation from the get go. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9944.396s">You</a>  know, I understand that the, that the chief of staff has comparable salary structures from neighboring communities but <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9959.923s">just</a>  the biggest question that we had here that has still yet to be answered was that the chief people officer at the time that we looked at the salary was overseeing two big departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9971.566s">And</a>  then one of those department was taken away, but yet we're now going up on that salary line. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9978.128s">So</a>  I don't know where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9980.989s">This</a>  is my confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9982.149s">It's</a>  not, I haven't got an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9983.889s">We're</a>  going to common sense when we're talking about your own home and your finances and budgeting your own home. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9990.49s">You</a>  have to have answers to answer these basic questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9994.913s">If</a>  you were hiring a painter to paint the wall and he was doing the carpentry work and you were paying X amount of dollars, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10002.218s">But</a>  that carpenter now came in and said, all he's gonna do is paint, but we're still gonna ask you to paint, pay that person that same money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10010.543s">We're</a>  gonna question it, aren't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10011.864s">I</a>  think everybody here will. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10013.445s">And</a>  that's what I've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10014.606s">And</a>  we still have yet to get a true understanding where, well, he's worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10019.66s">That</a>  doesn't help me answer the questions that constituents have put me here that said, Councilor Scarpelli, again, traffic and parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10031.168s">We're</a>  talking about where this situation is going as we're moving forward traffic and parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10034.61s">We're</a>  not taking it over tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10036.712s">We've</a>  approved vehicles, we've approved positions, people getting paid, car payments are gonna be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10043.256s">We</a>  don't know what the plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10044.357s">They</a>  could be sitting in the garage for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10048.469s">You</a>  know plans for the opera money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10050.431s">We</a>  talked about who else is at the table, did we have other departments at that table like other communities have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10056.759s">So</a>  we said, the person that's higher that person that's going to be in charge of setting the tone that's going to facilitate that that'll have the expertise to do that that's the step we wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10068.084s">That's</a>  a step that we have to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10069.344s">So</a>  we have a plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10070.785s">I</a>  just don't see a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10072.746s">All</a>  I keep seeing right now are piecemeals that keep coming back to a slowly small, not small, but numbers every week with additional 50,000, 250,000, and there is no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10084.99s">So</a>  I made a comment that the frustration comes in that I have yet to have a true conversation with anybody from the administration with a guidance of where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10096.603s">And</a>  I'll be totally honest as a city councilor, I feel belittled in the process because it's gonna get pushed through, it's gonna be moved forward, they're gonna find a way to get it through and nothing is gonna be discussed and we're still gonna be sitting here trying to answer questions to the people that put us in these seats without any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10119.73s">So</a>  that's my frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10121.932s">I'm</a>  frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10122.813s">Am</a>  I gonna vote for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10123.693s">No,</a>  I'm gonna stick to what I've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10125.495s">I'm</a>  not gonna vote for any money paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10126.595s">I</a>  don't know if you realize this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10128.077s">I'm</a>  not gonna vote for any money paper until somebody sits with me from the administration and shows me what steps were taken, which direction we're going to as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10140.225s">This</a>  shouldn't be a secret.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10144.148s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10145.289s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10146.81s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10150.698s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10151.338s">And</a>  yeah, I just want to begin by thanking the Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for your comments on this so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10158.202s">And,</a>  you know, I'm very aware of my position as, you know, this paper coming before me and I haven't been behind the rail for the previous discussions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10167.367s">So</a>  I understand that your perspective on it is seasoned with more meetings than mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10171.869s">And</a>  I just want to be really respectful and observant of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10177.258s">you</a>  know, looking at this paper before us and hearing Chief of Staff Nazarian's comments on it, some of the analogies to me that come to mind, and especially having heard from some constituents, you know, even just before my first meeting about, you know, the impatience and eagerness to see a lot of these positions get filled, including positions that have been tabled in previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10198.944s">coming</a>  into the meeting with that perspective and I think with some of the plans that we do really urgently need to see and I know people are very impatiently waiting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10208.326s">I</a>  know that in certain cases we need the people behind desks in order to make efficient progress on those plans and I feel that perhaps the finance director slash auditor is a great example of that perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10222.33s">You</a>  know I'm not <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10224.55s">I'm</a>  not privy to the nuts and bolts of the reclassification study, to what extent the auditor would actually be involved in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10230.591s">But</a>  it strikes me as the type of thing where we kind of have to make some steps forward to accelerate our steps forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10237.233s">So</a>  I'm, after some reflection, I'm planning on voting in favor of these papers tonight, because I think that that is our best, it seems to me that's our best way to make efficient progress forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10251.436s">And</a>  I think that that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10253.435s">know,</a>  certainly what we need to be clamoring for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10256.597s">At</a>  the same time, I fully respect the, you know, the sense of wanting for a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10262.56s">And</a>  I hope that having, you know, kind of reacting to the market forces that we're observing, and perhaps the difficulty of finding applicants for these positions could help us get to a place where we're getting that communication information that we desperately need and have been waiting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10277.468s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10279.049s">I</a>  think that's fun just quickly before we move to Councilor did you were able to find the answer.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10283.311s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10283.612s">I</a>  was not able to find the answer but I would provide an estimate is the best I can do at this stage, based on having gone through to classification and compensation studies I can bore you with the details if you want them but I would estimate approximately six months roughly, I want to find the information and get you more solid and I'd be happy to email the council tomorrow on that matter.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10304.773s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10305.494s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, you know, I agree that you know that you know these positions are needed and, but, you know, where are we with our finance and audit, I mean, are we interviewing people I mean, I mean this is this position has been open. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10321.923s">I'm</a>  seven areas, but six seven months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10326.737s">I</a>  mean, where are we with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10328.438s">And</a>  this is one of the most important people in the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10332.34s">And</a>  we're going on seven months without anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10336.143s">I</a>  mean, is anybody applying for the job? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10338.664s">Have</a>  we interviewed anybody for the job?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10341.686s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10345.262s">I'm</a>  instinctively trying not to say President carabiello Councilor carabiello, I agree with you, this is a mission critical position for the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10354.125s">We,</a>  we had advertised for the position, we got limited candidates, and the end we were left with one candidate, it's really never ideal to hire one candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10366.974s">without</a>  identifying that candidate because it's in a confidential process, I would say I didn't think that that candidate was a good fit for this organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10374.118s">And</a>  we needed to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10376.66s">We</a>  didn't have a proper applicant pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10379.021s">And</a>  I believe that that stems directly from the fact that we don't have a competitive salary.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10384.164s">So</a>  you believe that going from a CAF 20 to a 21 is going to bring a better candidate?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10391.308s">Mr.</a>  President, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10394.008s">Councilor</a>  Calvillo, I do believe it's gonna get us closer, and I do believe it's gonna make us certainly more competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10403.89s">It's</a>  certainly something we have to do because we're at a point where, to your point, we don't wanna go on further here without a finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10412.572s">We</a>  need to get a finance director as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10415.072s">No</a>  disrespect to the gentleman who's here on a temporary basis, but I don't understand why we can't hire anybody <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10423.782s">to</a>  come work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10426.163s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10428.303s">It</a>  really befuddles me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10429.244s">And</a>  again, in the finance sector, as I say, that's probably one of the most important jobs in the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10436.505s">And</a>  here we are, we're making all kinds of financial decisions without a financial director. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10443.207s">That's</a>  really the part that befuddles me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10449.049s">Keep</a>  adding jobs, keep adding jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10452.28s">No</a>  one's applying for these jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10455.763s">How</a>  many jobs we have open now.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10458.785s">I</a>  would estimate probably under a dozen at the moment posted but that doesn't mean how many we have open. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10465.149s">But</a>  Mr. President, through you, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10469.567s">sure</a>  I'm not telling the council anything you don't know but there's a material issue with labor availability and resignations and people moving from job to job across the region, the nation, perhaps the world I'm not sure, but we have been talking about shortages within the finance director profession in the profession of municipal management. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10491.467s">for</a>  nearly half a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10493.488s">And</a>  this issue is only getting further exacerbated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10495.649s">So</a>  we need to get competitive with our salary to be able to attract a qualified candidate to this organization.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10502.974s">What</a>  is the difference between the 20 and 21 in Bay?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10507.096s">I</a>  don't remember what that was.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10512.88s">Mr.</a>  President, through you, the low end of 20 is <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10521.443s">107</a>  call it 108 to 125 roughly the low end of 21 is 115 roughly to 132 roughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10525.707s">I</a>  mean, I really don't know anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10546.825s">Mr.</a>  President, also happy to provide town's comparative numbers if the council would like.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10562.027s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10562.827s">Um,</a>  I certainly hear the rest of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10566.388s">I</a>  haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10567.388s">I</a>  think as Councilor Collins has acknowledged we haven't been here for, for, for those meetings, but we haven't been behind the rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10574.89s">So,</a>  there's, there must be a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of meeting knowledge that we just haven't had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10582.252s">you</a>  know, haven't been in the privileged position of being privy to, but I look at this and I think, you know, having a finance director slash auditor, that's, I mean, I think we all agree it is super important for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10598.757s">I</a>  don't think there's any disagreement on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10601.778s">And</a>  I just can't help but think that we would be better off with a lot of the concerns being stated tonight if we had a finance director or auditor in position. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10610.96s">And</a>  I'm someone who believes that we get what we pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10614.044s">And</a>  we have to be, we have to make Medford more competitive with other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10619.951s">And,</a>  and that's why I'm, I'm, while I understand a lot of the concerns that our council has tonight, I would support this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10630.283s">And</a>  because I believe that this is time sensitive as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10633.226s">I</a>  think we have a lot of a lot of concerns not just on this paper but on other papers that the city's putting forward the administration putting forward right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10643.277s">And</a>  I think it's important that we have that we have people working in the office as, as Councilor Collins put it, I'm sitting by the desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10651.825s">Um,</a>  in order to address those concerns better in order to create that on those plans that we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10658.291s">And</a>  so I believe that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10660.072s">And</a>  I believe that it's I mean, finance director, human resources director, these are pivotal positions in any organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10668.553s">And</a>  so, in the case of this paper I will move to, I support the move to push this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10676.821s">And</a>  I do believe that there is, there are a lot of people I've talked to throughout the city with concerns, not only related to personnel, but they have concerns about how the city government operates that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10690.275s">These,</a>  these two hires or these, these two changes would would do would at least cut into and then into an addressing any further discussion.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10709.449s">With</a>  all due respect, Mr. President, I don't think that $5,000 a year is gonna make us go from getting nobody to get Warren Buffett to walk through the door and start managing the city of Medford's finances, first of all, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10721.394s">I</a>  think that the issue might not be the salary, it might be the culture in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10726.416s">It's</a>  a very small, small group of people that perform municipal management, municipal financial management. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10732.918s">They're</a>  a very small network of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10734.719s">Maybe</a>  that's one of the reasons why we can't get applicants to want to work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10740.451s">When</a>  you look at these positions, you look at this human resources director's position, the incumbent in the position in a 12-month period got a 61% pay raise without council approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10753.598s">61%</a>  pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10755.219s">I</a>  don't know anybody in the world that gets a 61% pay raise in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10762.323s">Anybody</a>  in the world that gets a 61% pay raise in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10767.887s">I</a>  know that certainly flies in the face of a lot of the issues that have been raised by some of my colleagues when it comes to being able to have a living wage, having people pay their fair way, equity, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10783.517s">A</a>  61% salary increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10786.844s">is</a>  something I've never heard of in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10788.605s">I</a>  represented union employees across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and negotiated countless collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10795.991s">I've</a>  never seen a 61% pay increase in a 12-month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10804.038s">The</a>  spending plan needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10805.819s">The</a>  classification study needs to be performed before we start spending taxpayer dollars without a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10811.503s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10813.185s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10817.924s">I</a>  could be mistaken about this, but I just ran a quick calculation and I'm seeing a percent of 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10824.149s">And</a>  I will say, Mr. President, members of the council, that this position, the person in this position was previously working as diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10833.736s">They</a>  took on human resources director, which is a different position and has different duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10839.461s">I'll</a>  keep my comments brief, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11312.984s">So</a>  tonight, I'm trying to I'm just wrecking my brain tournament so this was the one way like we had the $, new jobs that were being created right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11320.993s">Yes,</a>  and then we have the, we have like 49 million in our for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11325.558s">We</a>  spent 8.5 to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11328.041s">Then</a>  we got these new, these $800,000 worth of jobs that came before us to be filled that are outside the budget that we're going to use APA money to fund, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11337.848s">I</a>  believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11338.208s">And</a>  then we're going to try to fund these positions, I think, for the next four years, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11341.31s">Or</a>  three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11342.19s">Three</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11342.971s">That's</a>  like another $2.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11344.972s">So</a>  we had like $49 million of APA money and we spent $8.5 already. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11349.133s">And</a>  then this is another 2.4 that we're going to spend on that Apple money.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11352.979s">That</a>  math sounds right to me, but I mean, it seems like we're just approving them for the cash, not for the budget.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11358.728s">We've</a>  spent like 25% of our Apple money already. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11361.773s">It</a>  looks like I'd go more with 20.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11363.856s">close</a>  to the 20 okay but we do have the federal funds manager hopefully coming on board so yes okay excellent i just wanted to be clear on that one i won't know thank you the point of information too with that because i believe that the conversation we had with this was to have a meeting with the other departments that weren't at the table this is where my confusion comes in that we tabled it for the purpose <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11388.418s">to</a>  go to committee of the whole meeting to bring all the departments that weren't at the table, because I believe what we talked about were the only people that were at the table, the health department and the, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11403.567s">Community</a>  development, the only two department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11406.509s">And</a>  where we said, I think it was council Mark said, that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11413.833s">Is</a>  the fire department eligible for ARPA money? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11416.313s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11416.634s">Is</a>  the police eligible? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11417.654s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11418.294s">DPW,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11420.074s">Seniors,</a>  senior center, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11422.454s">Then</a>  how can we proceed with this until we sit at the table with everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11426.875s">And</a>  I think that was the concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11429.196s">Again,</a>  I'm gonna bring it up again to my freshman colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11435.117s">Remember,</a>  you're approving a lot of money without a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11441.018s">So</a>  again, this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11444.22s">This</a>  is something I will not support again, because until I get a better understanding of what we're doing in this community with all of our money, I'm not voting for anything to do with money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11458.811s">Make</a>  that known.</p>
