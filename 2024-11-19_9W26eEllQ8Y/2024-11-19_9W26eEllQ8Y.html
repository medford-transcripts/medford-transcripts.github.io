    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1054.118s">Absolutely,</a>  so the intention here is that the current subcommittees don't, what is in the council rules don't reflect the current subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1061.475s">So</a>  this would allow us to update those subcommittees and also allow us to be nimble in the sense of, you know, reflecting the names of offices in city hall and just appointing people related to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1074.186s">So</a>  just modernizing the subcommittees, especially since they don't actually reflect the current subcommittees that are doled out.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1116.809s">Hey,</a>  I can Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1120.79s">Also,</a>  like, if we can maybe entertain tabling this for committed a whole meeting where we can <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1127.732s">really</a>  get the input of residents and we can really vet this process as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1135.939s">I</a>  know that there are some of these subcommittees that, you know, I'd like to, as we just started, maybe, you know, bring in the school committee and ask their opinions, especially when, as a former member of the school committee, whenever you <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1152.785s">not</a>  that I felt this way, but some council, some committee members felt that when you did a combined subcommittee, a committee that it might overstep a bound and there might be some animosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1168.535s">Now</a>  that not saying that it is or isn't, but this is something that it'd be nice to sit with, you know, sit with the committee members and I get some input. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1176.379s">I</a>  know that I did get one city school committee member called me to remind me <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1181.723s">when</a>  we tried to do that years ago, which I didn't, I didn't see it being a problem, but it is, it is a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1189.065s">And</a>  I think that it's something that I like to see in, you know, in a process where we could just discuss this as just this being the topic of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1199.329s">So,</a>  you know, making a motion to- Yeah, if I could send this to, I mean, rules or the committee of the whole- Yeah, with this involves all councilors should go to the committee.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1210.696s">So,</a>  if I may, just to say that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1218.103s">these</a>  do not reflect the current committees and subcommittees in 2020, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1221.965s">And</a>  the intent here is really to say, hey, I think personally, how I feel is to actually put into the rules what we have done for the past two years and say, you know, the president will create subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1236.672s">Some</a>  of them are certainly, we certainly have some of these, but we don't have a school buildings, we don't have a school racial balance, we don't have public utilities, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1246.416s">And</a>  there are some subcommittees we do have right now that aren't reflected in this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1250.337s">So,</a>  so you know the intent here is, is, I agree with you to have a discussion about this in the future that's actually what my next resolution is about, but just in between now and then, to make sure that the current president can appoint subcommittees in the interim, so it's not meant to be a permanent, you know, this is how it's going to go from here on out it's just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1270.076s">I</a>  think it could be argued, right, that last term, Councilor Caraviello appointed a set of committees that aren't reflected in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1277.26s">Is</a>  that against the council rules, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1279.461s">So</a>  that's all this is meant to be, is kind of temporary to say, we can appoint committees for now, and then we can also have those discussions.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1286.765s">Right,</a>  I completely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1288.706s">And</a>  I agree with, you know, with most of the subcommittee, the new subcommittee, you know, changes, but I think that really it's understanding each one with the vision of the President and what direction <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1302.21s">we're</a>  looking to go with when you're, you're talking and getting the input from, you know, our residents that that elected us to say, for instance, the school and racial balance, I think that's, you know, something that we need.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1317.046s">Those</a>  are old.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1318.268s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1318.688s">So</a>  we want to change those two.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1320.61s">All</a>  this does this is actually taking all of the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1323.333s">uh</a>  listed committees out of the current rules right and just changing it to the president shall form committees and the subcommittees and appoint chairpersons and members right okay so i think that's my confusion is like the the understanding of what</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1335.447s">what</a>  is the change going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1339.128s">And</a>  if we're allowing the president to do that, and it's presented in a way that might have some animosity toward another city body, I think that's the concern that before doing that is understanding what the president's definition <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1359.48s">of</a>  each new title is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1360.94s">So</a>  I think that would be my only... Well, common practice is the president usually asks the members what committees they'd like to be on.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1367.662s">You</a>  don't want to put people on a committee they don't want to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1370.042s">So</a>  I know when I was president, I'd always ask everybody, what committee do you want to be on? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1374.844s">And</a>  the president hopefully tries to make everybody happy.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1382.845s">Yeah,</a>  if I could, Councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1386.192s">And</a>  I absolutely hear what you're saying, Councilor Scarpella, and I think that's valid, and those are conversations that need to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1391.215s">I</a>  just don't want to, I think Councilor, Vice President Bears has the same concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1394.777s">I</a>  don't want to inhibit, somehow inhibit ourselves from being able to form the subcommittees, particularly if we're sending things to rules right now, get stuck in kind of a catch-22 where we can't have that rules subcommittee because we're trying to hold for this committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1408.786s">So</a>  I'm curious if the language, if you would be satisfied the language were clarified, that this is something we'll <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1415.762s">you</a>  know, have a meeting about down the road, but it doesn't inhibit the president from forming subcommittees, you know, in the interim.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1425.745s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, I see this nothing more as, you know, streamlining the way that we do business a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1435.128s">Ultimately,</a>  I think it's safe to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1439.218s">The</a>  President has always been given some flexibility and leeway in establishing subcommittees, whether or not they outlined in the rules or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1447.229s">So</a>  I think what we're really doing is kind of splitting hairs a little bit over an issue here that's not really that big of a deal right ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1453.073s">We</a>  have a number of subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1454.454s">My</a>  first term, when I was elected, Councilor Camuso and I went over the list, and I recommended that he create a number of different subcommittees, and he just created them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1464.44s">We</a>  didn't have to go through rules change or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1466.981s">So</a>  when I'm looking at this, I think, you know, we talk about some of the ad hoc committees that we've voted on to allow the president to have discretion to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1474.265s">You</a>  know, I don't think this is anything that's outside the norm of the power vacuum that we've allowed in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1479.268s">So</a>  I certainly have no problem with it, Mr. President, ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1482.23s">You</a>  know, we have a number of items on relative to the rules, the rules will be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1486.779s">But</a>  in terms of, you know, committees and committee structure and the standing committees, I don't think it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1492.04s">worth</a>  getting into a hours long debate over it when historically, you know, the flexibility has been there for the President to take such action. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1499.926s">So</a>  with that being said, I certainly wouldn't question the Council President's authority in appointing the subcommittees that are currently standing, the ones that we've, you know, we just transferred all the papers over that are in the standing committees now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1513.056s">So</a>  those standing committees need to be chaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1514.937s">We</a>  just voted on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1515.698s">That</a>  was the second paper we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1517.159s">So</a>  ultimately, at the very least, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1519.084s">the</a>  council president should have the ability to, at the very least, chair those subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1523.366s">And</a>  then if this is going to be an issue we can deal with in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1526.047s">But</a>  in terms of allowing us the ability to continue conducting business, I don't think that this is something that you get in the way of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1532.47s">So</a>  I don't want this to be something saying, you know, we can't do anything anymore until we figure out who's going to be the chairman of the rules committee, the licensing committee, because we just took a vote to transfer all those papers that are in those committees over this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1544.076s">So</a>  those committees right now are already standing committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1545.977s">We</a>  took a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1547.197s">So</a>  I think we're really kind of beating a dead horse.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1549.44s">So</a>  Mr. President, if I can, I agree with Councilor Knight saying if it's standing committees, I'd support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1557.092s">But</a>  I said, I think the question that we had were, if we're allowing the president <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1561.743s">to</a>  make some change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1562.504s">I</a>  think that has to be a discussion before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1564.565s">I</a>  think the standing committees I would support, but as we're moving forward to change or to add different committees, I think it's something that I wasn't privy to Councilor Knight's first few years and Councilor Camuso's, but I know what we've done here has worked in the sense that it's been transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1587.198s">I'd</a>  say that Councilor, President, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1589.759s">I</a>  was not transparent and what I'm saying is having that extra meeting to talk about the new committees, I think, if there are, that'd be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1599.128s">Other</a>  than that, I agree with Councilor Knight that we can move forward with the standing committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1604.033s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1605.694s">Chair,</a>  would you like to support that?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1606.775s">If</a>  I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1611.738s">I</a>  would prefer to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1613.741s">And</a>  that doesn't mean even if it were to pass, that we wouldn't have those discussions and they wouldn't come up with a new structure as we review the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1620.43s">And</a>  I just want to say, so if it goes, if it goes mixed, whatever, it's not unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1624.456s">I</a>  just want to say either way, we're going to have the discussion and we're going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1628.802s">We're</a>  going to get it going.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1630.204s">And</a>  I think it goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1631.985s">So</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1632.706s">That's</a>  why there are there are seven votes and there's no animosity behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1637.531s">We</a>  just move forward in a positive light.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1639.934s">You</a>  have to give the president the flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1645.86s">to</a>  appoint the committees that she feels that she wants to work people in.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1651.485s">Don't</a>  disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1652.145s">I</a>  think that Councilor Knight said they'd support all the standing committees, but I'd like to, any new committees is just to have a committee of the whole meeting, just to discuss those few meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1664.775s">And</a>  again, Councilor Morell's a voted president, and I think it's just having that layer of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1672.762s">So</a>  other than that, move forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1676.281s">I</a>  believe you made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1677.622s">I</a>  don't know if there was a second, but I would move approval unless there's a second on your motion.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1681.306s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, you had a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1683.487s">I</a>  didn't hear a second, so.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1684.608s">Seconded</a>  by.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1695.874s">of</a>  the Committee of the Whole is going to be the establishment of what the new committees are going to be, then yeah, I don't have a problem having the Committee of the Whole in that, provided that the existing and standing committees still stand, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1706.957s">I'm</a>  not in favor of that whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1708.577s">We</a>  already verb that in standing array, so they're already in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1711.998s">If</a>  the councilor has questions and wants to vet it, I don't have a problem providing that opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1715.999s">With</a>  the new committees.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1717.719s">I'd</a>  certainly second the motion with the understanding that the other standing committees will still be filled.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1722.38s">And</a>  that would be my motion, that the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1726.075s">We</a>  think it should be passed and we would have a committee of the whole discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1731.837s">On</a>  the new committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1732.437s">On</a>  the new committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1733.197s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1924.715s">7th</a>  affirmative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1929.957s">22013</a>  offered by Councilor Bears be it resolved that the City Council review the creation of the Election Commission through the acceptance of Mass General Law Chapter 51, Section 16A. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1939.663s">Vice</a>  President Beas.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1940.623s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1944.482s">many</a>  communities, well, I'll start here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1946.724s">Chapter</a>  51, section 16A allows for cities to adopt a piece of mass general law, which would allow us to move to the system of having an elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1958.832s">It</a>  would move us from having the clerk and the board of registrars model to a formal elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1966.937s">I</a>  think there's a variety of reasons that we that at least I think that would be a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1970.68s">And,</a>  you know, may also reflect some, some of the changes we've been talking about in general around elections, with it being more work and then we now have an elections coordinator and it really is its own own. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1984.837s">animal,</a>  if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1986.818s">So</a>  part of what this allows this this section of mass general law allows us to do is basically if we were to adopt it, it would immediately transfer our Board of Registrars of voters to becoming a board of election commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2000.766s">the</a>  clerk position would then come off of that board and any appointments going forward, the mayor would make those appointments subject to the approval of the of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2011.61s">Um</a>  so, my motion here is to refer this to a committee of the whole so that we can discuss this with the city solicitor, with the clerk, with the relevant folks from from our <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2027.113s">the</a>  way that we should move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2028.315s">I</a>  can just say from my reading of the law and also from seeing which communities have adopted this it does seem like this is the way that the state law it's kind of pushing communities towards this model and away from the older clerk registrar voters model at least that's how I read the general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2045.737s">I</a>  just think it's another example of something we can do, adopt state law and already allows communities to do this, to move forward on administration of elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2053.725s">So</a>  again, move to refer this to a committee that will refer the discussion.</p>
