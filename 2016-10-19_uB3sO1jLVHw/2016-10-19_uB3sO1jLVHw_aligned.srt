1
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,851
The Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,611
The Secretary will call the roll.

3
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,132
Mr. Estudio?

4
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:27,752
Here.

5
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:28,872
Mrs. Valdero?

6
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:29,493
Present.

7
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:30,273
Mr. Pence?

8
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:30,753
Here.

9
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:32,073
Mr. Stone?

10
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:32,334
Here.

11
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:32,394
Ms.

12
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:33,074
Gary, present.

13
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,474
Mr. Nunez, present.

14
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:34,854
Present.

15
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:35,975
Seven present, none absent.

16
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,575
All please rise and salute our flag.

17
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:43,217
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

18
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:51,493
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,256
I would now like to invite Ms.

20
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:05,821
Caldwell up to give a brief synopsis of the Columbus School Student Office's inauguration ceremony.

21
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:06,662
Ms.

22
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:07,082
Caldwell.

23
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:08,377
Thank you.

24
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:09,538
Good evening, everybody.

25
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:21,567
And I'd like to welcome our parents, our students, our grandparents, and friends of the Columbus School, as well as Mr. Plattie, the fourth grade teacher.

26
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:23,729
Oh, thanks, Joe.

27
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,531
Miss Kay, the principal.

28
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,534
Miss Sherman Hudson, the assistant principal of the Columbus School.

29
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,316
And I believe I saw Miss Ross here as well.

30
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,277
Thank you for coming.

31
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,779
So very briefly, Mr. Plattie's

32
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,738
The fourth grade class at the Columbus Elementary School learned all about the electoral process this fall.

33
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:54,863
After completing a social studies unit on our system of government, citizenship, which included rights and responsibilities, and the U.S.

34
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:58,925
electoral process, the class held its own election.

35
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:09,274
To coincide with the presidential election, Mr. Plattie provided the students with a virtual experience of our country's electoral process.

36
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:16,121
His fourth grade class held their own election for a class president and a vice president.

37
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:22,471
The students followed the same procedures used in our national presidential election.

38
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:26,593
There was a primary, and then there was also a final election.

39
00:07:27,153 --> 00:07:29,434
The process began with nominations.

40
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:39,419
Students could name or nominate a fellow student for either office, providing the nomination was supported by two fellow students.

41
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:45,976
There were nine students nominated for president and three for vice president.

42
00:07:46,776 --> 00:08:08,931
The nominated students had to complete the following, write and give a two-minute speech, which was a persuasive writing assignment, explaining, convincing classmates why they should be elected, make one to two 24 by 30-inch campaign posters, and create campaign flyers and or buttons.

43
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,354
The issues students addressed included the following.

44
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:27,641
The students wanted more independent reading time in class, an extra recess when class follows PBIS 100%, and PBIS is positive behavior for students.

45
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:34,764
Persuade Mr. Plattie for one homework-free night when students complete a classroom job.

46
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:48,549
Be available to listen to concerns or ideas a classmate might have, and to advocate for the student with the teacher, and to become a role model for the class.

47
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,793
Some candidates put their names on pencils and candy bars, which were distributed to the electorate.

48
00:08:57,017 --> 00:09:02,678
The two top vote getters for president and vice president went into the final election.

49
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:06,359
Once again, the candidates presented to their classmates.

50
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,040
Secret ballots were cast.

51
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:21,363
And I'd like to call Mr. Clady up to the podium right now because I believe he should do the honors of announcing the winners of the presidential and vice presidential election of the Columbus Elementary School.

52
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:22,543
Thank you.

53
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:35,338
Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, Superintendent Beltson, Assistant Superintendent Ms.

54
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:39,739
Caldwell, Deputy Superintendent, Principal of the Columbus School, Ms.

55
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,160
Kay, Assistant Principal Nancy Sherman-Hudson, my first piano teacher.

56
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:56,003
It is with great pleasure that I am pleased to announce the president of the class of room 307, fourth grade at the Columbus Elementary is Mariah Mattel.

57
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,357
And our class vice president, hiding behind the flag bearer, is Alex Lombardo.

58
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:17,207
The colors will now be presented by Joelle Ritchie.

59
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:19,190
Please present the colors, Mr. Ritchie.

60
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:37,558
Mr. Ritchie is accompanied by President-Elect Mariah Mattel and Vice President-Elect Alexandra Lombardo.

61
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:42,082
Mr. Superintendent, could you hold the officials?

62
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:47,267
Could you please place your right hand on the Bible and repeat after me?

63
00:10:58,529 --> 00:10:59,490
I, say your name.

64
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:05,874
I, Mariah R. Mitchell, having been duly elected as President of our 4th grade class at the Columbus Elementary School,

65
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:30,634
solemnly swear that I shall faithfully represent the interest of the students in our class, uphold the rules of my school, my classroom,

66
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,361
And those of my teacher.

67
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:39,841
And those of my teacher.

68
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,702
I will uphold the laws of the United States.

69
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,483
I will uphold the laws of the United States.

70
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:46,964
The state of Massachusetts.

71
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:48,345
The state of Massachusetts.

72
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:49,465
The city of Medford.

73
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:50,806
The city of Medford.

74
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,046
And especially.

75
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,287
And especially.

76
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,548
My teacher's classroom rules.

77
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:57,448
My teacher's classroom rules.

78
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,569
And homework policies.

79
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:00,950
And homework policies.

80
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:14,357
I will serve at all times as a positive role model, leader, and voice for my fellow students.

81
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,778
So help me God.

82
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:17,778
Congratulations.

83
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:28,384
Madam Vice President, it's your turn.

84
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:32,557
Raise your right hand, repeat after me.

85
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,659
I, say your name.

86
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:57,153
I, Alexandra W. Lombardo, having been duly elected, having been duly elected, as vice president of our fourth grade class, as vice president of our fourth grade class, at the Columbus Elementary School, at the Columbus Elementary School, solemnly swear, solemnly swear, that I shall faithfully represent, that I shall faithfully represent,

87
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:10,787
represent the interest of the students in our class, the interest of our students in the class, the rules of my school, the rules of my school, my classroom, my classroom, and those of my teacher, and those of my teacher.

88
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:24,199
I will uphold the laws of the United States, I will uphold the laws of the United States, the state of Massachusetts, the state of Massachusetts, the city of Medford, the city of Medford, and especially my teachers,

89
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:29,018
and especially my teachers, classroom rules and homework policies.

90
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:34,143
I will serve at all times as a positive role model, leader, and voice for my fellow students.

91
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:35,184
So help me God.

92
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:03,084
And at this time, we'd like to invite our president to say a few words, if you'd like to.

93
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:21,711
Som presidenta de clase, prometo hacer mi mejor para mis compañeros de clase y trabajar con el vicepresidente Alexandra en crear ideas para hacer que este sea un buen año de cuarto grado.

94
00:14:22,432 --> 00:14:26,013
Alexandra y yo tenemos algunos grandes acompañamientos ya.

95
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:34,557
El primero es que comenzamos a financiar Penny Drive y ganamos $62 para el Fondo Mundial de la Tierra para salvar a dos animales peligrosos.

96
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:50,327
The second one is that we successfully petitioned our teacher to give us a reading coupon.

97
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:56,391
If we do all our homework, we get to sit and enjoy some pleasure reading on our own.

98
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:59,854
And we get to sit in Mr. Potty's special chair.

99
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:07,100
Thank you.

100
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:16,351
The third one is that we successfully petitioned our teacher for extra recess when we make progress with our positive behavior goals.

101
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:19,133
We have won two recesses so far.

102
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:37,316
The fourth one is that we came up with a coupon system which helps save the environment by cutting down on wasting classroom paper towels.

103
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:38,137
Very good.

104
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:53,646
And finally, on behalf of myself, Vice President Alexandra, and our entire class, we want to thank Mariburg for making this amazing grant possible.

105
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,311
She's already made quite a few accomplishments in such a short time.

106
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,813
And on behalf of the school committee, we'd like to present you with pennies for your penny drive.

107
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,322
Mr. Flagg here, please retire the colors.

108
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,076
Thank you ladies, great job.

109
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:55,603
Madam Mayor, I have to say that without any question of a doubt, and I'm sure the audience will all agree, that is the most positive thing that has happened during this election season.

110
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,683
Thank you very much.

111
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:22,353
Madam Mayor, without taking any positions in the upcoming election, Medford is certainly right out front.

112
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:25,376
We've just elected two females to the top jobs.

113
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,258
We're ahead of the curve.

114
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,186
Thank you all so much for being here tonight.

115
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:40,731
This is a very special event for us, as well as for all of you parents, students, teachers, and administrators.

116
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:42,512
So thank you all for being a part of this tonight.

117
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:53,262
Mrs. Cuno.

118
00:17:54,235 --> 00:18:05,544
Now, this was refreshing, I have to say, and this is why you sit here sometimes, well, why we sit here sometimes, and I'll speak for myself, and this was very well, very well worth why we're here.

119
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:20,655
Just want to say thank you to everyone, but I also want to congratulate Mr. Plattie for really bringing the ideas to our children, letting them come to school happy, letting them come to school because they want to learn.

120
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,576
I know, I get emotional for all this stuff.

121
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:28,697
But it really, you know, people think maybe this isn't important.

122
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:36,101
It's very important because these children have learned so much about our governmental process that they don't even know they've learned.

123
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:37,501
So, thank you.

124
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:37,921
Very good.

125
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,082
Thank you, Mr. Pratt.

126
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:46,405
Did you want to say a few words?

127
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:51,970
I just want to make some thank yous, and I hope I get everybody in the list here.

128
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,031
Because I do want to first start with the mayor.

129
00:18:54,351 --> 00:19:01,495
Because this was originally supposed to start off as just something at six o'clock before the meeting started, and we were going to come in and out without being obtrusive.

130
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:08,198
And Mayor Burke turned this into a fantastic extravaganza and event that these girls and their families will never ever forget.

131
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:10,900
So I would like to thank you for doing such a great job.

132
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,062
And your two staff members, Linda Colletti, Lauren Felch,

133
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:26,938
And I'd like to give a shout-out of thanks to our superintendent, Belson, and to our school principal, Kathy Kay, and our assistant principal, Nancy Sherman-Hudson, for all your support in getting this and helping in endorsing all of this.

134
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:31,320
And, I almost forgot, our assistant superintendent of schools, Diane Caldwell.

135
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:37,544
And thanks to the committee for inviting us in.

136
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:38,364
Thank you very, very much.

137
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:39,265
Thank you, Mr. Clady.

138
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:42,696
Van der Kloot?

139
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,319
Trudde du att de kan hjälpa oss med vårt kandidatval?

140
00:19:55,449 --> 00:20:00,311
I already scoped out the talent before the meeting and a few people have already volunteered on my campaign.

141
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:04,933
I'm sure there's a few that will be here someday, so great job students.

142
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:10,275
Have a great evening, get home and finish your homework so that Mr. Platt is happy with you tomorrow.

143
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:16,998
Could someone make a motion for suspension of the rules so that we can present the math students?

144
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,173
Motion for suspension of the rules by Ms.

145
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,593
Van de Kloot, is there a second?

146
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:22,353
By Ms.

147
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:22,933
Benedetto.

148
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:23,754
All those in favor?

149
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,374
All those opposed?

150
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:26,394
Suspension is granted.

151
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:30,475
It's item 7-1.

152
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:35,337
Presentation of Mass Student Achievement Awards.

153
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:36,337
Mr. Superintendent.

154
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:45,560
Madam Mayor and members of the committee and ladies and gentlemen, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents each year

155
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:53,859
recognizes outstanding students in each community for which there is a superintendent who is a member of mass.

156
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:53,939
Now,

157
00:20:55,723 --> 00:21:04,510
These awards are not given lightly, they're given to individuals who have not only accomplished academic excellence, but have done other terrific things in their school environments.

158
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:15,738
So this evening we have two presentations, one to a member of Medford High School, and one to a member of the Medford Vocational Technical High School, both seniors and both outstanding individuals.

159
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:23,424
So at this time, it's my great pleasure to read you about the first one, and then we'll bring that person up, and then we'll do the second, and do the same.

160
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:28,410

231
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,282
I was the chair.

232
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:10,046

00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:32,079
All of our principals, teachers, Ms.

239
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:39,805
Cole Sanford, and parents, Alexandra Laurie, Alicia Karen, Melanie McLaughlin, Michelle Ciccolo, and Jen Lewis.

240
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,209
The purpose of the meeting was to review and discuss the 2000 state test results.

241
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:50,734
We were each provided with the reports on the test results in all areas which are attached to this report.

242
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:57,965
Deputy Nelson and Assistant Superintendent Caldwell discussed the state testing and the variables affecting the testing.

243
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:04,490
They explained that the discussion would focus on subgroup data for park rates 3 to 8 and MCAS.

244
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:10,655
Deputy Superintendent introduced Nicole Chiesa, Caroline Joy, and Rocky Cieri.

245
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:11,896
Ms.

246
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,157
Caldwell gave a brief history of MCAS.

247
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:17,200
It was also stated there was no state data available this year.

248
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:23,416
Vi har en overview av ELA MCAS grad 10 result.

249
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:29,019
Superintendent Belson clarified the Asian subgroup population.

250
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,619
It is not homogeneous.

251
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,062
It includes a wide range of groups from across the continent, and it varies from city to city.

252
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:42,565
We continued with an overview of the MCAS grade 10 results, and then we went to the science results for grades 5, 8, and 10.

253
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:52,205
Discussion was held about the difficulty of disaggregating grade 10 science as students were taking different content areas and are in different grade levels.

254
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:55,085
They also discussed the low scores for grade 5.

255
00:27:55,646 --> 00:28:00,967
Mr. Cieri said that grade 5 scores were low across the board and he plans research programs this year.

256
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:06,488
They also need to look at the budget for material supplies and additional professional development for elementary students.

257
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:17,282
A view of PARC ELA Mathematics for Grades 3 to 8, PARC N to ELA Mathematics for Grades 3 to 8 followed with a review of the highlights and the subgroup data.

258
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:22,525
Discussion was held regarding computer-based testing at the Andrew School and paper testing.

259
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:27,347
It was determined that more time is needed for elementary staff to learn how to use computers when testing.

260
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,989
Dr. Riccadeli explained the PARC assessments.

261
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:31,750
This is Medford's first year.

262
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:36,712
Students are required to not only answer the question, but also to explain how they got there.

263
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:40,729
Mr. Benedetto asked about comparison of like districts to Medford.

264
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:42,430
A report will be generated.

265
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:42,910
Ms.

266
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,733
Nelson described the five-point scale park uses and the four-point MCAS scale.

267
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:48,293
Ms.

268
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:54,877
Nelson also reviewed student report inconsistencies around the following changes in numbers between levels, plus or minus

269
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:58,687
7.4 range and the explanation of the legend.

270
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:01,809
I asked what was the takeaway from the evening.

271
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:08,715
Superintendent Belson said that we need to get better, improve science and math scores, review and purchase a new elementary science program.

272
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,252
and look hard at our specialized population.

273
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:15,234
There's a lot of transition statewide, and the state is still sorting it out.

274
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:15,994
Ms.

275
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:20,476
Mastone would like to look at the Brooks School to collaborate on effective teaching strategies around science.

276
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:24,598
The number of ELL students at the Brooks is much less than the other schools.

277
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,440
Testing in 2017 was discussed.

278
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,381
The high school will continue to use MCAS.

279
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:35,386
MKS 2.0 is untimed, no long compositions, and will resemble park questions.

280
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:39,551
Grades 4 and 8 will have online testing of all students.

281
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:42,814
The Andrews will be online testing for all grades.

282
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:48,900
A meeting with Revere and Burlington Public Schools is planned to look at infrastructure needs for technology.

283
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:49,780
Ms.

284
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,682
McLaughlin raised concerns around students with disabilities taking MCAS 2.0.

285
00:29:54,982 --> 00:29:56,503
It will be discussed in the weeks ahead.

286
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,643
Our meeting was adjourned at 9 p.m.

287
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,045
Respectfully submitted myself as chair.

288
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:03,205
Thank you, Ms.

289
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:03,745
Van de Kloot.

290
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:05,366
Mr. Benedetto.

291
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:06,006
Thank you.

292
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:09,227
Thank you for the report, and I apologize for coming in late that evening.

293
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:16,530
So I missed a little bit about the MCAS scores for math in ELA.

294
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:18,800
for our 10th graders.

295
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,185
Do we do a comparison from this year to the last few years?

296
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:25,907
Do we get a graph of that?

297
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:28,810
Because I didn't get it that evening and I don't see it tonight.

298
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,891
Mr. Superintendent?

299
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:37,999
This report was basically a follow-up on things that we didn't cover in the first time.

300
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,140
We did give you a report

301
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,891
You report here, you've got this last piece here which does that.

302
00:30:59,151 --> 00:30:59,431
Okay.

303
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:01,532
Also, do you have weekend?

304
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:10,615
Okay, we show the graph for the high school and the junior high for the last few years of MCAS for 10th and 8th and 4th grade.

305
00:31:11,855 --> 00:31:13,856
Well, you can see this in this in these charts.

306
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,036
That's where that's right.

307
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:18,598
I see some is if the high school as well.

308
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:19,198
Okay, great.

309
00:31:19,718 --> 00:31:19,958
Okay.

310
00:31:20,348 --> 00:31:20,949
Yes, thank you.

311
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:24,692
I just didn't see it when I was looking through it and I was late that evening.

312
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:26,313
Again, I apologize for that.

313
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:31,317
Also, the district comparison, I know you'll need some time to get that to us.

314
00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:41,406
Could you add that to the list of outstanding items on our agenda so that way within the next few meetings you'd be able to until that's covered?

315
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:42,487
We can do that.

316
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:43,828
We're working on that now.

317
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:47,086
Okay, so just add it to our agenda.

318
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:47,847
Yes, 11.

319
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:49,289
Thank you very much.

320
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:51,532
Thank you Mr. Benedetto.

321
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,255
Is there a motion on the floor to accept the report?

322
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:55,617
Motion to accept.

323
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:58,781
Motion to accept offered by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

324
00:31:58,801 --> 00:31:59,281
Van de Kloot.

325
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:00,002
All those in favor?

326
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:01,663
All those opposed?

327
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:04,885
Motion passes with the report being added to our list.

328
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:06,545
Mayor Burke, can I say one more thing?

329
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:06,986
Certainly.

330
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:13,448
So my understanding, Mr. Superintendent, is that we are now a level 2 school district.

331
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:14,008
We are.

332
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:22,332
So I was the one that yelled quite a few times that when we were level 3, so I would like to congratulate everybody who worked so hard last year.

333
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,874
to move us back to the level two district.

334
00:32:25,294 --> 00:32:36,922
That's a great accomplishment for everybody that works in this community and for our students as well as our parents and the children that also have really tried hard on these exams.

335
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:39,464
So we are a level two district.

336
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:44,647
I'd like everybody to know we are now a level, and I'm very proud to say that and very happy to say that.

337
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:49,370
And I would probably say it all year, just like I said, I was worried when we were level three.

338
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,612
I'm glad to see us moving in the right direction.

339
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:52,533
Great work.

340
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:53,474
Thank you very much.

341
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:53,994
Thank you.

342
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:56,175
Ms.

343
00:32:56,215 --> 00:32:56,575
Cuno.

344
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,256
Just a point of information.

345
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:15,043
As far as subcommittee meetings, I'd like to have people that are watching and people that are in the audience to understand also is that when we have subcommittee meetings, the people that are on those subcommittees are the people that are responsible for those meetings to ask questions that evening and to request anything.

346
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:21,724
If we as school committee members do go to a subcommittee meeting, we go as residents of the city.

347
00:33:22,144 --> 00:33:26,705
We do not hold the hat of a school committee member.

348
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:34,087
So therefore, sometimes it's kind of hard to go without really overlapping that.

349
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:38,008
So that's really something that I want people to understand.

350
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:42,929
So it's not, if we're going to have subcommittee meetings, that is the purpose of the subcommittee meeting.

351
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:49,343
for the people on those committees to bring that information to us and people understand that.

352
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:50,884
Very good.

353
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,128
Community participation.

354
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:56,670
Melanie McLaughlin, President of the CPAC.

355
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:57,011
Ms.

356
00:33:57,031 --> 00:33:57,551
McLaughlin.

357
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:01,516
Good evening.

358
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,597
Good evening.

359
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:04,907
Hello, Madam Mayor.

360
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:08,130
Hello, Superintendent Belson, school committee members.

361
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,571
Thank you for having me here tonight.

362
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:17,718
I am coming on behalf of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council, but also on behalf of high-need students in Medford.

363
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:23,343
For those of you who may be watching who don't know who I am, my name is Melanie Perkins McLaughlin.

364
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:29,189
I am the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council, but also sort of on a personal note, I want to share that

365
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:33,609
I also happen to grow up in an economically disadvantaged home.

366
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,270
I went to Lawrence Public Schools.

367
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,231
I have some background in that area as well, as well as having a daughter with a disability.

368
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:52,315
So when we talk about high-need students, as most of you here know, but perhaps others don't, high-need students would be economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English language students.

369
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:57,997
So at the end of last year for the school committee, I brought a report to the members here

370
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:00,593
in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.

371
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:04,536
And I just wanted to take a moment for the recommendations on that PowerPoint.

372
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:19,708
At the end of the PowerPoint, we had some recommendations that we made to the school committee, and there was a suggestion after the recommendation that perhaps there would be a subcommittee of the whole that could be created to talk more about some of the recommendations.

373
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:23,351
Unfortunately, four or five months have gone by, that hasn't happened.

374
00:35:23,772 --> 00:35:27,455
So we're here to revisit that, number one, that's sort of one of our priorities here, but also

375
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:45,554
Having had some time to review the presentation that we did and also having had some time to see and hear from families with additional concerns around high-need students, we made some addendum to the recommendations specifically to the high-need student population as well and also related to the district goals.

376
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:48,537
So I just want to take one moment to sort of look at that.

377
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:57,820
I also wanted to say, regarding the last school committee meeting, I came into that meeting after a parent had got up and spoken.

378
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,221
I was out of context.

379
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,761
I did not know what the context of the parent's presentation was.

380
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:03,922
I found out subsequently.

381
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:15,325
But what I did see when I came in, and it was very confusing for an outsider, what I saw when I came in was a lot of discussion around students with disabilities without any sort of context of what that discussion was.

382
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:16,405
And it was alarming to me.

383
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:23,228
como padre de una estudiante con disabilidad, pero tambien como co-presidente de la asociación especial de educación de padres.

384
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:34,293
Fui contactado por varias familias que también se sentían muy alarmadas por la retórica que sentían aquí esa noche sobre los estudiantes con disabilidades y algunas de las conversaciones que se tuvieron.

385
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:41,737
Una cosa que quiero recordarles aquí es que cuando hablamos de todos los estudiantes, espero que estamos hablando de estudiantes con disabilidades.

386
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:43,958
Estudiantes con disabilidades, estudiantes de Yale,

387
00:36:45,118 --> 00:36:48,060
ekonomically disadvantaged students are all students, I would think.

388
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,801
So I just wanted to mention that.

389
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:55,905
Regarding the recommendations that we had, I won't bore you with some of the report that we did last year.

390
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:58,547
You all have copies of the report, that PowerPoint.

391
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:03,670
It was titled the State of Special Education in Medford.

392
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:07,593
It is available on the district website for folks who would like to see it.

393
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,634
I believe it's under the CPAC heading.

394
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,575
It has been modified.

395
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:13,757
I will send the superintendent's office and

396
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:17,350
Allison Goldsberry, the modification, so that they can share that.

397
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:20,972
And I just talked about the high-need students.

398
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:26,575
I had a clip of the high-need students and some information on that with a graphic of the high-need students.

399
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:34,358
And then, Superintendent Bellson, I actually was hoping for your advice here, because I'm trying to understand some of these numbers, and I'm hoping you might be able to help me out.

400
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,120
For the high-need students, I know that it's defined as economically disadvantaged

401
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:40,899
Students with disabilities and English language learners.

402
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:50,783
So when I go to the DESE website and I look at the data on our website regarding our school district profile and it says economically disadvantaged is 25.3%.

403
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:57,146
Students with disabilities 18% and English language learners 7.5%.

404
00:37:58,186 --> 00:38:05,309
So I'm wondering if I'm adding that up correctly, would that mean that our total high needs population in the city of Medford is 50%?

405
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:05,449
No.

406
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:05,609
Okay.

407
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:12,919
What the state has done is they've created a high-needs category.

408
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,860
And in that category, an individual might fit in more than one activity.

409
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:24,402
A youngster might be a person who doesn't speak English as a first language, might be special needs, and might also be economically disadvantaged.

410
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:29,763
So one person might be in three categories, multiple categories.

411
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:32,464
So you could find that, you know,

412
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:38,601
Different scores, different activities are skewed by the fact that an individual repeats themselves in multiple categories.

413
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:46,748
So we have to break those out periodically as we go just to see exactly what's the dominant category that's driving a particular result.

414
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:56,216
So high needs is sort of an accumulation or cumulative amount of all the students who fall into any one of those categories as opposed to one.

415
00:38:56,236 --> 00:38:57,497
So 50% would be too high.

416
00:38:58,038 --> 00:38:58,218
Okay.

417
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,141
What would you say would be a fair percentage?

418
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:15,011
I want to look at the latest because basically the other thing that took place is Title I, which normally defined economically disadvantaged, the rule was changed.

419
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:20,835
And because it was changed, the numbers came way down and it affected communities across the state.

420
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:25,078
So I don't want to speculate at this point in time, but we certainly are going to break it out.

421
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:26,124
Okay, that's great.

422
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:26,964
Thank you.

423
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:45,157
And also I would say that it's fair to say that there's a, you know, we see a lot on the states from reports from DESE and the state of special education in the state of Massachusetts anyway, that there's a lot of disproportionality certainly around minorities and English language learners being identified as special education or more highly identified or not.

424
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:54,443
And also according to Tom Hare's report that I shared with the school committee a week or two ago, a couple of weeks ago, and also regarding their achievement, the achievement gap.

425
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:55,084
Is that right?

426
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:59,956
Well, you know, disproportionality or what they call prima facie denial in some instances.

427
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:07,825
There is a tendency in school districts across and almost any institution if a youngster is not doing well.

428
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:19,411
som kan spekulerar om om det är en ungdom som har en lärnings- eller språkbaserad ungdom, om det är en temporär distraktion som ungdom har, eller om det är en familjedysfunktion, eller om det är andra saker som händer i deras liv.

429
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:22,333
Så det är väldigt svårt att veta om identifikationen är 100%.

430
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:27,257
Men vi må klart betala mycket att sikta på att ungdom som inte pratar engelsk som den första språken,

431
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,171
som som som som som som som som som som som

432
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:09,073
the economically disadvantaged, the students with disabilities, and the English language learners.

433
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:16,457
Our summary for our report last year talked about the substantial achievement gap between typical students and high need students in Medford.

434
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:28,562
For those who are watching or in the audience who don't know what achievement gap is, I would venture, I'm not an educator yet, but I would venture to say that the achievement gap is for success rates for students on MCAS

435
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:43,176
Typical students and the gap would be for minority students or economically disadvantaged students or English language learners might look somewhere around this if you're talking people who are proficient on MCAS and people who are not.

436
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:44,357
Is that accurate?

437
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:51,522
Well, the gap is between the youngsters who don't necessarily fall into these subgroup categories and those youngsters who do.

438
00:41:52,620 --> 00:42:04,890
Det är viktigt att nåta, och det kom ut i vårt sista samarbete, att Medfords uppnivån i dessa subgrupper var eller ökade statens mängder i varje av dessa kategorier.

439
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:13,156
Så vad det verkligen betyder, det är om staten använder ett instrument som propertiskt analyserar den tillräcklige utvecklingen av dessa ungdomar.

440
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:16,319
Är det rejält att ge ungdomar en test i engelsk?

441
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,431
in their first year in this country not speaking English.

442
00:42:20,892 --> 00:42:23,933
And then trying to determine whether this youngster knows enough.

443
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:42,281
I think that the assessment system really deserves a work over because it's inappropriate to ask youngsters to do things for which they are not particularly good at it at this point in their life because of their genesis, where they are at that point in time.

444
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:45,763
So a youngster who might be progressing at a nice level for

445
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:53,098
his or her situation might take an extra year or two to get to that level.

446
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:53,898
What's wrong with that?

447
00:42:54,358 --> 00:43:00,841
The goal is to get to the achievement level as much as possible, and if it takes a little longer, fine.

448
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:02,922
Some people learn faster, some people learn slower.

449
00:43:03,443 --> 00:43:07,745
Some people are more skilled in a mathematical area, some people are more skilled in a language area.

450
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:15,108
And so we need to have a better assessment system than the vanilla that we're getting right now

451
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:22,624
and that's going to be a topic of discussion among superintendents, school committee members, and others as we approach our meetings coming forward.

452
00:43:23,324 --> 00:43:28,606
ESSA, and we'll have that discussion tonight as part of it, makes some changes in NCLB, but not enough.

453
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:38,108
Yeah, I couldn't agree more, and I think Universal Design for Learning hopefully will help with that, but I think there's a lot more that we agree on than we realize sometimes, and I'm glad to hear that's the case.

454
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:44,250
I also wanted to say that I was very happy to see tonight the self-advocates, the students who are self-advocates here,

455
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,752
and being recognized for their achievements.

456
00:43:47,812 --> 00:43:53,175
That was wonderful to see, and it is very important for us to focus on positive things that are happening in our district as well.

457
00:43:53,655 --> 00:44:01,079
For the students that were able to speak for themselves tonight, I couldn't have felt prouder, but I also want us to remember for the students who cannot speak for themselves.

458
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:12,785
We have a significant population in this community that is not able to speak on their behalf, whether they are students with disabilities, whether they are economically disadvantaged families, or whether they're English language learners.

459
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:20,450
And because of my passion and because of my background, I am fortunate enough to be able to speak on their behalf, and that's what I want to do, and that's what I'll continue to do.

460
00:44:21,071 --> 00:44:29,936
So I also just want to ask the full inclusion rates for, I wanted to add sort of our summary on a report, the full inclusion rates were a little bit less than state average, at least on last year's data.

461
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:35,259
Dropout rates were a little bit higher, and the substantially separate setting was a little bit higher than state average.

462
00:44:35,919 --> 00:44:38,301
Now getting to the district priority goals and SMART goals.

463
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:41,983
So I know that the district just published their priority goals and SMART goals, is that right?

464
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:53,416
And I was really excited to see that District Priority Goal 2, District Priority Goal 7, and District Priority Goal 6 are all aligned with the recommendations that we have for the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

465
00:44:53,456 --> 00:45:00,798
Specifically, District Priority Goal 2 was to expand efforts to meet the academic, emotional, social, and physical needs of Medford's diverse student population.

466
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:09,821
And there were some recommendations from the, I assume from the committee on how that would be done, including hours of training on implementation of social-emotional curriculum,

467
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:14,318
Three outreach events that allow for community staff and family partnerships.

468
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:19,860
Alternative educational supports for students using positive behavioral intervention supports and credit recovery.

469
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,462
And this is also published on the district website, the district goals and SMART goals for educators.

470
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:28,423
District priority goal six, which is differentiated instruction.

471
00:45:29,023 --> 00:45:33,725
We are very happy to see to promote differentiated instruction within a tiered model so that the needs of all students are met.

472
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:39,287
The suggestion was two professional development workshops, teacher training for

473
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:47,953
U or NI teachers, and then revised units of instruction using understanding by design, also in align with our goals, which was really great.

474
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:51,433
And district goals, priority seven, family engagement.

475
00:45:52,354 --> 00:46:01,616
The family engagement piece, to continue to promote communication between home and school in order to strengthen the link between parents and educators, community members, and other stakeholders.

476
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:06,717
And the two items on there were educators would be trained in the school brains,

477
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:15,081
initiative with a parent portal, and this is a software program that allows parents and educators to be able to access data on their students.

478
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:17,162
That should be rolling out soon, I hear.

479
00:46:17,602 --> 00:46:30,169
And then item number two is collaboration between school and community will increase by 10% district wide during the school year over the previous year as evidenced by sign in sheets and other attendance taking methods.

480
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:37,033
And while we're happy to see that family engagement is part of the district goals for this coming year.

481
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,793
Ten percent feels really short, and we're concerned about that.

482
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:48,221
And we're also concerned about how the measure of that family engagement is really happening, and especially how it's really happening for families that aren't speaking English.

483
00:46:49,222 --> 00:47:00,813
So, again, we would love the CPAC to be brought to the table at some of these events to be able to offer our input and our advice, and also other community stakeholders, stakeholders from the EL community, stakeholders from the economically disadvantaged community.

484
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:18,120
I just want to mention that teachers in a 2014 TELMAS educator survey, the teachers were given a survey and they were asked the question, in which of the following areas, if any, do you need professional development to teach your students more effectively?

485
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:26,583
60% of teachers in the TELMAS educator survey said closing the achievement gap.

486
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:28,404
56% said teaching students with disabilities.

487
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:31,145
52% said differentiating instruction.

488
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:37,350
51% said co-teaching, collaborative teaching, and 45% said promoting cultural competency.

489
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,553
And again, promoting cultural competency we believe goes hand in hand with family engagement.

490
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:47,699
I'm not going to read the rest of the report because I've given, I've left a copy of it here with you folks.

491
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:54,284
I did, we did add a couple of items in our CPAC recommendations for improved family and community engagement.

492
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,906
We had about 10 recommendations.

493
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:57,367
We also added,

494
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:12,701
family ambassadors per subgroup in EL, SES, and SWD, which is what we said, and then also potentially outside consultation, whether it be from places like the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Lesley University, or Tufts University.

495
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:23,465
Finally, our two big asks for tonight, and this is something that we're actually hoping we can get an answer on tonight so that we're not waiting another five months or six months to get an answer.

496
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:24,786
We have two asks tonight.

497
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:43,704
The specific ask for tonight is we are asking the school committee, Madam Mayor and the superintendent to create and endorse a high needs subcommittee of the school committee where we can answer some of the questions that are part of this report and hopefully we can bring stakeholders to the table that can provide more information and move the needle in Medford forward for all of us.

498
00:48:44,484 --> 00:48:47,165
And then the other is, the other ask that we have is

499
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:59,427
You know, we had a few parents here at the last school committee meeting and there was some discussion around cultural competency at one of our schools in particular, although I would venture to say that it's probably at a lot of our schools is an issue.

500
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:07,532
And I think you know that we were talking about piloting the Understanding Our Differences Disability Awareness Program at the Brooks Elementary School this year.

501
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:14,116
The Brooks teachers had decided for fifth grade teachers to pilot the autism unit for the fifth grade at our school.

502
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:18,924
The Understanding Our Differences program can be found on understandingourdifferences.org.

503
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:23,226
It's a program that is run through Newton Public Schools and through a lot of schools in our community.

504
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:37,795
We would recommend that that Understanding Our Differences program be used in other community schools here in Medford so that we can have sensitivity around students with disabilities, students with high needs including medical needs, diabetes, asthma, allergies, etc.

505
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:39,576
And I think that's it.

506
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:41,163
Thank you, Ms.

507
00:49:41,203 --> 00:49:41,503
McLaughlin.

508
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:42,244
Sure, any questions?

509
00:49:42,824 --> 00:49:42,984
Ms.

510
00:49:43,004 --> 00:49:44,545
Kratz, you're blinking.

511
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:44,965
No?

512
00:49:45,345 --> 00:49:45,885
I was.

513
00:49:45,965 --> 00:49:46,505
No, did you?

514
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:47,646
I'm sorry.

515
00:49:47,826 --> 00:49:47,966
Ms.

516
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:48,166
Cunha.

517
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:48,526
You're welcome.

518
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:49,026
Oh, no problem.

519
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,927
Thank you, Melanie, for your report.

520
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:51,307
You're welcome.

521
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:52,448
Just a couple things.

522
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:55,729
You were speaking about a survey that was given.

523
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:59,931
Could you reiterate who gave out the survey and where it was given?

524
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,552
Yep, that's the, do you want to share that, Superintendent?

525
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:03,592
Go ahead.

526
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:08,674
Oh, okay, it's the 2014 TELMAS survey, so it's a Department of Education Survey of Educators.

527
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:12,486
Okay, and they're random educators throughout the whole state of Massachusetts, correct?

528
00:50:12,586 --> 00:50:13,347
That's correct.

529
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:22,070
And the other thing, you were also speaking about the piloting, understanding our differences program.

530
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:22,370
Yes.

531
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,391
That you're saying that you're piloting now at the Brooks?

532
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:27,792
Well, we are intending to pilot it this year at the Brooks, yes.

533
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:30,193
We had teachers trained at the end of last year.

534
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:37,075
We had the understanding our differences trainer come out and work with our fifth grade teachers, and now it's implementing the program.

535
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:38,176
And it's about a two hour

536
00:50:38,696 --> 00:50:45,222
Disability awareness program within our 5th grade classrooms and it has a sort of

537
00:50:46,105 --> 00:50:51,787
loosely, I wouldn't call it curriculum, but a sort of directive on how to apply this two hours of learning with your students.

538
00:50:51,827 --> 00:50:55,989
And we actually had, I was part of the training at the end of last year, and it was actually very interesting.

539
00:50:56,029 --> 00:51:01,331
We did some things you could even try at home, or folks could try at home, try to do a family game without using any words.

540
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:10,414
Try to, you know, do a, I don't know, a scrabble, but you can't speak to each other, and see how you communicate, give yourself a chance to communicate.

541
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,516
So there were some exercises and activities that really helped sensitize people to differences.

542
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:28,194
I'm just trying to think back if this was something that was brought to us, that we had any part of saying of what schools were going to be piloted or what schools weren't going to be piloted through the mayor to the superintendent.

543
00:51:29,074 --> 00:51:30,975
So let me make a suggestion.

544
00:51:30,995 --> 00:51:32,716
There's a lot of material here.

545
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:39,399
It can't be discussed in the robust way it needs to be discussed in a forum like this because, you know, there's too much involved.

546
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:41,300
Schedule a committee of the whole meeting.

547
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,661
Let's get to it.

548
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,962
We'll get in the background and then we can decide which items

549
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:47,833
can be done in what sequence and where.

550
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:52,495
But if we do try to do it here, we'll be back and forth for a long period of time and it's not really going to do it.

551
00:51:52,535 --> 00:51:57,777
So, let's schedule a committee of the whole meeting, let's look at some dates and I'll get back to you with some possible dates and we can do that.

552
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:02,038
But, excuse me, but this seems like it's already happening.

553
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:08,041
Well, it's happening in one school, but remember, we're asking our faculty and people to do an awful lot right now.

554
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:11,242
They're taking school brains, they're doing a million different workshops,

555
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:13,530
They've also got to teach their classes.

556
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:21,337
I want to make sure that we sit down and we actually roll things out in a very very digestible way and we get everybody on board.

557
00:52:21,697 --> 00:52:25,060
Otherwise we're just running a program and it won't work, it won't stick.

558
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:30,645
So let's have a meeting, let's go over it, let's decide how we can roll things out intelligently.

559
00:52:31,226 --> 00:52:35,890
Let's see which things can be integrated with other initiatives that are already going on.

560
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,891
I think we're in a better place if we do that.

561
00:52:38,932 --> 00:52:39,753
I'm not saying no.

562
00:52:39,813 --> 00:52:41,314
I understand that the teachers have a lot.

563
00:52:41,354 --> 00:52:44,856
I guess my question is who chose the Brooks and when did that happen?

564
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:50,821
Principals have a certain amount of autonomy to do things that respond to what they see in their buildings.

565
00:52:51,522 --> 00:52:55,485
But when someone does something and it works, we're naturally interested in it.

566
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:58,547
But what works in one building may not work in another.

567
00:52:59,255 --> 00:53:00,276
We just need to talk about it.

568
00:53:00,296 --> 00:53:00,676
That's all.

569
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:11,801
Okay, because I mean the way it was explained is that this was a two-hour program that was taught to our teachers that I think we should have at least have known about, so at least we know what was going on in the school.

570
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,022
Again, principals have a certain amount of autonomy.

571
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,572
We don't micromanage everything that happens every day in the buildings.

572
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:20,853
We let people do some of the things that they think are appropriate.

573
00:53:21,373 --> 00:53:25,474
You know, and when it becomes something that the whole district is interested in, then maybe we bring it here.

574
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:27,875
We could be talking about every program.

575
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:30,716
Not every school had a mock election.

576
00:53:31,156 --> 00:53:33,337
Not every school had another thing going on.

577
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:35,097
Schools have their own identities.

578
00:53:35,137 --> 00:53:36,598
We want them to have their own identities.

579
00:53:37,058 --> 00:53:44,220
But let's take a look at this as a gestalt and a committee of the whole, and I think you might have a better way to decide which things should move forward.

580
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,322
I think committee of the whole is the way to go initially.

581
00:53:52,262 --> 00:54:04,309
Melanie, just to respond to your big ask, I think we should start that way because I know one of the concerns is when we get into who's going to be on the subcommittee, and we all want to be, or we have a subcommittee and then we all show up anyway.

582
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:10,233
But then some people aren't really voting members versus whatever, so I think by starting

583
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:19,296
this with a committee of the whole makes a lot of sense, and then perhaps we can move to decide whether a subcommittee makes a lot of sense.

584
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:23,597
I'm not anti-subcommittee by any means, focused on this.

585
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:27,939
I just understand what some of the challenges are.

586
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,399
It's a lot of information.

587
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,260
And I think everybody's interested.

588
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,961
That's one of the things, is we're all interested.

589
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:40,303
Well, I think that was evident from what we saw tonight, and it's the children that are our main interest, and that can be seen for sure.

590
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:42,952
Mr. Benedetto, thank you.

591
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,052
Thank you for your report.

592
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:50,255
It's always very informative, very quick, a lot of information, and I learn a lot.

593
00:54:51,635 --> 00:55:05,681
I also agree that we need to have a subcommittee meeting, so at this point, I'm making a motion to move this item to subcommittee, to committee of the whole, rather, sorry, committee of the whole within the next two weeks.

594
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:07,922
Is that too soon?

595
00:55:08,322 --> 00:55:08,762
Two months?

596
00:55:08,842 --> 00:55:10,723
I think you've got a lot going on right now.

597
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:13,656
You've got another meeting, you're going to be touring Capitol Hill.

598
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:15,236
Let's do it in a reasonable time frame.

599
00:55:15,256 --> 00:55:16,417
I'll get back to you with dates.

600
00:55:16,957 --> 00:55:19,198
Let's make sure that we can prepare for it properly.

601
00:55:19,558 --> 00:55:21,059
We meet with CPAC, we meet with others.

602
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:28,502
Let's get an agenda that's sequenced, that's coherent, and then we can move forward in a positive kind of way.

603
00:55:28,922 --> 00:55:32,043
To just simply get it in just to get it in is not, I don't think, productive.

604
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:36,777
So, can we put within the next two months, Mr. Superintendent?

605
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:37,638
Certainly, certainly.

606
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:38,839
Sooner than that.

607
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:41,441
Okay, so my motion is on the floor.

608
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:42,602
It needs a second.

609
00:55:43,763 --> 00:55:48,346
On the motion that a committee of the whole be held in the next two months, which we promise you it will not be two months.

610
00:55:48,406 --> 00:55:49,207
All those in favor?

611
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:50,708
All those opposed?

612
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:52,109
Motion passes.

613
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:52,890
Thank you.

614
00:55:52,950 --> 00:56:01,537
And I just wanted to add if there are any folks watching that are from the EL population or the economically disadvantaged population, we would welcome you to the committee of the whole meeting as well, of course.

615
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:01,917
Thank you.

616
00:56:02,448 --> 00:56:02,848
Thank you.

617
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:09,009
Report of the superintendent.

618
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:11,309
Report on Roberts Elementary School grants.

619
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:12,370
Mr. Superintendent.

620
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:19,451
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we're going to call on our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, to talk about this report.

621
00:56:21,071 --> 00:56:21,951
Good evening again.

622
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:25,312
I'm just going to correct the title of this report.

623
00:56:25,892 --> 00:56:31,873
Although the Roberts School is involved, this is a report on all elementary school grants.

624
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:38,859
So we are pleased to inform you that several grants have been awarded to our elementary schools.

625
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,441
So I'd like to talk to you about a few of them.

626
00:56:42,262 --> 00:56:50,848
Joanne McKay is a third grade teacher at the Roberts Elementary School, and she applied for a grant through the Medford Educational Foundation during the spring

627
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:52,423
of 2016.

628
00:56:53,164 --> 00:56:59,852
She was awarded $600 to host a math night for families of the Roberts Elementary School.

629
00:57:00,593 --> 00:57:05,399
Some activities will be for children in grades kindergarten through grade five.

630
00:57:05,879 --> 00:57:09,323
There'll be math board games and larger math man-made games.

631
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:17,568
And some examples of this could include beanbag hopscotch, dance grids, and multiplication basketball.

632
00:57:17,588 --> 00:57:25,292
So I can't wait to actually go to the Roberts Elementary School on November 17th to participate in these games.

633
00:57:26,412 --> 00:57:36,898
Mikayla Kelly, JP Cormier, and Christina Federico, who are teachers at the Roberts Elementary School, are brainstorming to come up with an evening of fun for our students and our families.

634
00:57:37,900 --> 00:58:03,943
In addition to that, Katie Rockwell, who is an EL teacher at the Columbus Elementary School, was also awarded a Medford Educational Foundation grant for Enhanced ELL Solutions, a program produced by the makers of Reading A to Z. This program is a computer-based program that will support our EL students, including support for content vocabulary,

635
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:14,137
in math, science, and in social studies, and additional printable readers for students that they can take home and do some reading practice at home.

636
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:23,306
The program will complement the resources we already have in our journeys program, which was a question that some of our school committee had.

637
00:58:23,346 --> 00:58:25,508
We just wanted to make sure it was aligned with our journeys.

638
00:58:26,494 --> 00:58:36,298
The additional data that we can collect by using these assessments should help make EL instruction even more targeted to students' greatest areas of need.

639
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:48,202
In short, the program that we purchase with this grant will allow us to offer even more reading resources targeted for our ELL students, which is something that we desperately need.

640
00:58:49,325 --> 00:59:03,272
And I'd also like to mention that Cynthia Griffin is a grade three teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School, and she wrote and received a grant for $200 towards a school field trip to Plymouth Plantation.

641
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:12,176
This grant is offered once per year for any K-12 school that applies in early September and is provided through the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

642
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,558
The trip must be a nonprofit cultural activity.

643
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:19,951
or institution in Massachusetts, within Massachusetts.

644
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:29,899
And I also know that Michael Coates, who is our third grade teacher at the Brooks Elementary School, will be applying for another Medford Educational Foundation grant.

645
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,521
You know that he's written his book already.

646
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:41,448
And now he's going to pilot building boats and then putting them on the Mystic River and watching

647
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:48,083
The boats float away and the children will build the boats in his grade three classroom and then go off to the Mystic River.

648
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:53,125
He will be writing a grant with Medford Education Foundation, obviously.

649
00:59:53,670 --> 01:00:00,015
We owe a debt of gratitude to the MEF for always being so supportive of Medford Public Schools.

650
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:01,356
And I'm happy to take any questions.

651
01:00:01,376 --> 01:00:01,717
Thank you, Ms.

652
01:00:01,737 --> 01:00:01,997
Caldwell.

653
01:00:02,117 --> 01:00:04,539
And if I could, from the chair, just thank the co-chair, Ms.

654
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:11,685
Van de Kloet, for all of her hard work on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation in bringing it back to life in a productive way.

655
01:00:11,725 --> 01:00:11,905
Ms.

656
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:12,485
Van de Kloet.

657
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:13,026
Thank you.

658
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:23,134
I just wanted to mention that, in fact, that this is only a small part of the grants that we gave out in these funding cycles, and President

659
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:40,358
Ann Frenning-Cassooth and David Sayers, who's been the head of the Grants Committee, will be coming forward in a couple of weeks' time to tell you about some of the other grants that we funded either in the spring cycle or we are collecting grants right now and the applications are open.

660
01:00:40,478 --> 01:00:42,419
We decided to extend it to the end of October.

661
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,640
It's very exciting.

662
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,100
It's great.

663
01:00:47,221 --> 01:01:03,028
It's really kind of fun to do something positive like this and we really, really appreciate all the teachers who write the grants and also it's been very, very helpful to be working so closely with the school district so that when

664
01:01:03,408 --> 01:01:07,751
There is a question about is this consistent with our goals, educational goals.

665
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:13,995
We have great people and great support, including helping everything work, so I really appreciate that.

666
01:01:14,776 --> 01:01:15,256
Great job.

667
01:01:15,877 --> 01:01:16,557
Congratulations.

668
01:01:16,597 --> 01:01:16,978
Thank you.

669
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:20,360
Motion to receive and place on file this report.

670
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,401
All those in favor?

671
01:01:22,503 --> 01:01:23,104
All those opposed?

672
01:01:23,124 --> 01:01:23,824
Motion passes.

673
01:01:24,425 --> 01:01:27,548
Report on TB response and follow-up action steps.

674
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:36,636
And before the superintendent gives his report, I just really want to thank him and his staff for the outstanding job that was done during this issue.

675
01:01:37,196 --> 01:01:42,241
Also, the City of Medford Health Department, which played a major role, as well as the Department of Public Health.

676
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:46,965
A lot of people came to the table in order to provide information to the families so that

677
01:01:47,945 --> 01:01:50,186
People would not be fearful and scared.

678
01:01:50,286 --> 01:01:53,467
So thank you all for the amazing work that you did, in particular, Ms.

679
01:01:53,487 --> 01:01:53,847
Vento.

680
01:01:53,907 --> 01:01:54,227
Thank you.

681
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:55,007
Mr. Superintendent.

682
01:01:55,027 --> 01:01:56,708
Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.

683
01:01:56,728 --> 01:02:00,609
Tony Vento is with us this evening, and we'll just go through some of it.

684
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:02,890
If you have any specific questions, Tony is here to answer.

685
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,973
I provide you with documents that have been produced and gone out to parents.

686
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:14,917
From the outset, we've worked closely with MassDPH, with the Medford Board of Health.

687
01:02:14,957 --> 01:02:15,978
We appreciate all their help.

688
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:25,865
They've done a great job right on the spot, helping us right away, making sure we did things the way we needed to, as well as our own medical team under Tony's direction here at the schools.

689
01:02:28,216 --> 01:02:39,539
On Wednesday, October 26th, there will be a TB testing of individuals who have been identified as being in close contact with the individual who was diagnosed with TB.

690
01:02:40,399 --> 01:02:47,240
There were 194 MHS students who were identified, 5 middle school students, and 14 adult personnel.

691
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:55,382
On the 20th, in the Cowan Theater, we will have a public information night available to everyone from 7 o'clock on,

692
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:58,094
to answer any questions that anyone might have.

693
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:07,338
Individuals may choose to have the test conducted by their own physician, and then we would ask them to provide us with the information that would indicate that it was done.

694
01:03:09,198 --> 01:03:15,601
If there is a finding, then there would be some follow-up antibiotic activity.

695
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:24,345
If there is no finding, it would be a second round of testing during the winter period to see if something emerged subsequent to.

696
01:03:26,476 --> 01:03:35,184
Since the original case was diagnosed, there have been no further identifications, and the DPH procedure has been followed precisely to ensure due diligence.

697
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:44,073
We have letters here, but I'm happy to take any questions or have the questions referred to Tony, so that if you have any

698
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:48,328
gaps in your understanding of what's taken place, we can answer them this evening.

699
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:51,892
And then again, on the 20th, we encourage anyone who really has some questions.

700
01:03:52,373 --> 01:03:54,435
I have not received a lot of phone calls.

701
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:56,097
I did originally receive the handful.

702
01:03:56,878 --> 01:04:05,668
I know Tony received a handful, but once they were done, it was pretty quiet, and most people were satisfied with the information they received.

703
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:08,850
But Tony is here and you might want to direct questions to him.

704
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:09,191
Maybe Ms.

705
01:04:09,231 --> 01:04:15,696
Vento, if you could just speak to the symptoms, just so the people watching at home understand what to look for.

706
01:04:15,776 --> 01:04:21,820
The symptoms of active, well there's a difference between latent infection and active tuberculosis.

707
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:28,245
So you really demonstrate symptoms when you cross into an active tuberculosis state.

708
01:04:29,026 --> 01:04:32,849
That would include severe fatigue, weight loss,

709
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:35,910
A cough that persists longer than three weeks.

710
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:38,774
Oftentimes the cough becomes a bloody cough.

711
01:04:40,016 --> 01:04:42,299
Night sweats, fever, chills.

712
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:49,047
So those would be mostly what you would see with an active TB infection.

713
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:50,189
Thank you.

714
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:52,492
Mrs. Coño.

715
01:04:53,113 --> 01:04:53,573
Thank you.

716
01:04:54,014 --> 01:04:54,834
Just a couple of questions.

717
01:04:54,974 --> 01:05:04,061
One is, I know that the superintendent said that parents, if they choose to do this on their own as far as the testing, how about if they have to pay out of pocket?

718
01:05:05,082 --> 01:05:06,023
No, there's no payment.

719
01:05:06,063 --> 01:05:10,826
If they go to health insurance, which they should have, that would cover it.

720
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:12,808
That's one of those things that's covered by health insurance.

721
01:05:13,308 --> 01:05:15,390
And if they come through us, there's no charge whatsoever.

722
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,091
The Department of Public Health has

723
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:22,947
I mean, they're collecting the health insurance on all the students and the faculty that they're testing.

724
01:05:23,348 --> 01:05:27,132
But if there are out-of-pocket costs, they will cover the out-of-pocket costs.

725
01:05:27,813 --> 01:05:33,259
So it'll first be run through insurance and then supplemented, if needed, by Department of Public Health.

726
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:35,902
And the other thing is that, you know,

727
01:05:37,981 --> 01:05:42,963
The calls and emails that I got were actually, who determined who's identified?

728
01:05:43,723 --> 01:05:51,405
And parents are like, well, my child is in that school, how do I know that, how do they know that that child wasn't near the other child?

729
01:05:51,945 --> 01:06:00,468
And it's a very fine line, but we also have to understand that there are a lot of students that walk our halls, and different stories go out there for different parents.

730
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:04,109
So at least if we could at least advise parents

731
01:06:04,889 --> 01:06:07,910
How at least we came to identifying the student.

732
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:12,112
The Department of Public Health determined that according to a criteria list.

733
01:06:12,252 --> 01:06:21,275
And close contacts are identified by the length of contact you have with the infected person.

734
01:06:21,635 --> 01:06:25,797
So if you think of circles, the first circle would be your immediate family.

735
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:33,760
The second circle would be your extended family, because they would have the most consistent regular contact with that person.

736
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:35,868
Then it starts extending out.

737
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:47,973
The next would be school classmates who sit in class with the student, students who are in or people in extracurricular activities with a student or a faculty member.

738
01:06:48,533 --> 01:06:50,514
And then it just goes out from there.

739
01:06:50,974 --> 01:07:00,038
So for people who are passing in the hallway, let's say, your risk becomes very low because the contact is brief.

740
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:01,039
It's not direct.

741
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:03,440
You have a lot of air around you to disperse.

742
01:07:04,455 --> 01:07:09,338
The people who are at most risk are those with extended close contact.

743
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:12,400
So that's how the list was determined.

744
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:17,623
I mean, there are students in the building that are in other parts of the building that never crossed paths.

745
01:07:17,923 --> 01:07:20,705
I mean, they would be considered nil risk.

746
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:21,185
Right.

747
01:07:21,325 --> 01:07:26,288
Well, I appreciate that, because like I said, I think it was just parents just hearing different things.

748
01:07:26,348 --> 01:07:33,313
And I know that everyone's done their due diligence in doing such a really remarkable job in such a very short period of time.

749
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,925
Pero, nuevamente, las historias diferentes salen por ahí, así que los padres estaban diciendo, bueno, espera un momento, ¿cómo puedo saber quién se ha identificado?

750
01:07:40,365 --> 01:07:45,029
Y sin exagerar la situación de confidencialidad, fue más como, ok, cuéntame las etapas de cómo fue.

751
01:07:45,049 --> 01:07:50,513
Así que para los padres que están escuchando, espero que hayan escuchado esto, y espero que tengamos esa reunión, que los padres, si todavía tienen preguntas o preocupaciones, vengan a ello.

752
01:08:00,402 --> 01:08:07,830
I would suggest that Thursday evening be filmed so that it can go on our school channel as well for those that are unable to come out to the meeting.

753
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:13,775
I just I had some of the same questions that Emory had in Tony.

754
01:08:13,896 --> 01:08:14,416
You answered them.

755
01:08:14,436 --> 01:08:15,197
Thank you very much.

756
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:21,063
And I also wanted to thank Superintendent Belsen for personally calling some parents back on

757
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:31,924
It was really a great, a lot of help from everybody, and a lot of the answers were handled very well, and I appreciate it, I really do.

758
01:08:32,304 --> 01:08:33,084
Thank you very much.

759
01:08:33,104 --> 01:08:33,444
Thank you.

760
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:36,225
Very good.

761
01:08:36,685 --> 01:08:39,266
There's a motion to receive and place on file this report.

762
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:40,367
So moved.

763
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:41,467
All those in favor?

764
01:08:42,187 --> 01:08:42,968
All those opposed?

765
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:44,048
The motion passes.

766
01:08:44,308 --> 01:08:45,088
Thank you very much, Ms.

767
01:08:45,148 --> 01:08:45,449
Antone.

768
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:46,209
Great job on this.

769
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,521
Report on DESE planning for ESSA accountability system.

770
01:08:56,322 --> 01:09:02,084
So as you know, No Child Left Behind has been replaced by Every Student Succeeds Act.

771
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:09,727
And that legislation begins in 2016-2017 as a transition year, with full implementation in 2017-2018.

772
01:09:16,684 --> 01:09:18,624
Now, there are several key elements of the Act.

773
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:30,647
I want to give you enough of it so you understand it, but not so much that you, you know, get overwhelmed by it because there's an awful lot of pieces and we'll have to break it down piece at a time in order for it to really be understood.

774
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:38,029
ESSA comprises nine title grants which provide funding to districts and states.

775
01:09:38,769 --> 01:09:40,289
Currently, there are about five or six.

776
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:44,010
I'm not sure how we count them these days because they keep putting them together.

777
01:09:44,737 --> 01:09:54,382
Title IV grant represents a new funding source, which is an allocation grant for districts in the area of student support services, something that would speak to some of the discussion we had a little bit earlier.

778
01:09:55,415 --> 01:10:08,904
Districts and states are required to conform to the requirements of ESSA, so that No Child Left Behind is now giving way to ESSA and districts and states now must adopt ESSA rules.

779
01:10:09,684 --> 01:10:18,249
ESSA encourages state agencies to think differently about how best to support low-performing schools as the school improvement grants are no longer available.

780
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,471
So they're asking the department

781
01:10:20,907 --> 01:10:26,309
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to talk to us about how we could best benefit from their help.

782
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:31,931
That should be a very robust discussion, especially in our conference and so on and so forth going forward.

783
01:10:33,912 --> 01:10:38,594
ESSA minimizes Title I prescriptive school and district accountability requirements.

784
01:10:39,374 --> 01:10:48,258
No Child Left Behind had very, very specific things under Title I. ESSA wiped some of it away, but it adds some things that are interesting too.

785
01:10:49,973 --> 01:10:52,414
Equitable access is perhaps one of the biggest areas.

786
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,755
What is equitable access?

787
01:10:54,155 --> 01:10:56,016
Does it mean every school gets the same thing?

788
01:10:56,717 --> 01:10:59,919
Does it mean it's based on proportion of low income?

789
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:01,760
Is it based on proportion of high needs?

790
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:02,640
What is it?

791
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:05,262
Equitable doesn't automatically mean things.

792
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:08,824
What if you have a teacher in a school who makes $80,000 a year and a teacher makes $60,000 a year?

793
01:11:11,494 --> 01:11:15,817
Is it different or is it the same thing as long as there's a teacher there who's experienced and can do the job?

794
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:17,998
Those things are yet to be fleshed out.

795
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:22,381
And it's problematic because naturally we hire teachers at different stages of their career.

796
01:11:23,202 --> 01:11:27,624
And a lot of it's based on, you know, how many years they've been with us and what their degrees are.

797
01:11:28,145 --> 01:11:32,007
That doesn't necessarily mean they're better or worse at what they will do.

798
01:11:32,027 --> 01:11:39,112
There's a shift in focus on the Title II program from highly qualified to reporting on student learning experience.

799
01:11:40,122 --> 01:11:45,205
Instead of determining just the teachers are highly qualified, the question will be, what have the students learned?

800
01:11:45,505 --> 01:11:48,307
They have to give us some rubrics to determine that going forward.

801
01:11:50,749 --> 01:11:56,953
It focuses mostly on quality access to education, access to quality education.

802
01:11:58,934 --> 01:12:07,079
DESE is going to continue to collect certain data, but it doesn't mean it's going to have a particular impact on what we do or don't do.

803
01:12:08,382 --> 01:12:14,466
Inexperienced teachers will be expected to do different things, but we haven't got guidelines yet.

804
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:23,372
Total funding for this year has been about the same, a little bit different, with a larger shift in Title IV student support money.

805
01:12:24,293 --> 01:12:27,956
The federal government has readjusted funding levels and our state will receive less money.

806
01:12:28,656 --> 01:12:31,678
The state receives less money, our district receives less money.

807
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:34,180
In most cases, not always.

808
01:12:34,985 --> 01:12:42,209
Desi does not have the FY18 budget, and they're likely not to know for quite a while as to how much money will or won't be there.

809
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:56,376
Of course, you know, with an election year, Congress, who knows what Congress will appropriate and what they won't appropriate until the election actually takes place and we determine who chairs which committees and who's in the White House.

810
01:12:59,663 --> 01:13:08,166
It maintains a lot of the requirements under the 1965 Act, Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the original one.

811
01:13:09,307 --> 01:13:12,728
There's some innovative assessment encouragement that will be there.

812
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:17,710
The definition of supplement versus supplant has changed.

813
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:21,392
That's another little thing we've got to get a good handle on.

814
01:13:21,892 --> 01:13:29,215
What does it mean to add to something versus to shift the burden from the locality to the feds?

815
01:13:30,212 --> 01:13:32,653
Something that comes up all the time.

816
01:13:34,134 --> 01:13:38,676
We're hopeful that we'll get clarity on this sooner rather than later so we can plan.

817
01:13:38,696 --> 01:13:45,559
The problem with some of these things is we don't find out until well after we've gone through a budget and say, well, guess what, this is the new rule.

818
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:50,001
Hopefully we'll find out more as this early part of the year progresses.

819
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:53,562
There's some new accountability requirements under ESSA.

820
01:13:53,622 --> 01:13:57,844
I've talked about that when we had the discussion on the test scores.

821
01:13:58,843 --> 01:14:25,959
Some of the key points in the new system might include maintaining the annual testing requirement, retaining 95% assessment participation requirement, making sure people participate, differentiation between schools depending on what they're supposed to be doing, long-term goals from the state to measure interim progress of all students in subgroups,

822
01:14:28,195 --> 01:14:33,197
New Accountability Indicators, and they're dumping the CPI.

823
01:14:33,377 --> 01:14:34,617
Do you know what the CPI is?

824
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:36,317
The Cumulative Performance Index?

825
01:14:37,058 --> 01:14:38,858
That has been the staple of NCLB.

826
01:14:39,798 --> 01:14:45,520
And then it got changed to the Growth Interest, SGP, then it got changed to a couple of other things that were going on.

827
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:54,763
So the more they keep changing the rules, the tougher it is for us to follow as to what's going to be the way they're going to make determinations.

828
01:14:55,554 --> 01:14:57,515
I provided a PowerPoint for you.

829
01:14:57,555 --> 01:14:59,177
We should go over it at some point.

830
01:15:00,197 --> 01:15:01,238
But we'll be studying it.

831
01:15:01,298 --> 01:15:05,141
I'll be looking for more information in the upcoming weeks at the conference.

832
01:15:05,161 --> 01:15:11,966
We'll be sharing with our colleagues as to what they think and what's going on, so that we can come back and give you real specifics.

833
01:15:12,526 --> 01:15:19,551
And we'll be talking to our people who are involved in the federal education agencies to find out where they see the trends are going.

834
01:15:20,112 --> 01:15:21,933
But this is the first rush of information.

835
01:15:22,493 --> 01:15:23,074
It is different.

836
01:15:23,674 --> 01:15:35,606
It isn't totally different, but it's different, and we need to pay attention to it so we can take maximum advantage of it, optimum advantage of it, while at the same time not losing out on any possibilities that would be helpful to us.

837
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:37,427
Happy to take any questions you have.

838
01:15:39,169 --> 01:15:39,289
Ms.

839
01:15:39,329 --> 01:15:39,810
Van de Kloot.

840
01:15:41,306 --> 01:15:51,651
Mr. Superintendent, I'm wondering if there's any way that we can advocate for that a five-year graduation rate also be included.

841
01:15:51,931 --> 01:15:58,715
We've talked on multiple occasions that everything has been based on a four-year graduation rate.

842
01:15:59,135 --> 01:16:07,157
but we have had, as well as many other school systems, additional students who might take a little bit more time, but they do reach the goal.

843
01:16:07,717 --> 01:16:12,999
So I'm wondering if, it mentions the high school graduation rates will still be, you know, part of this.

844
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:24,742
I'm wondering if there's any way that both the four-year and the five-year graduation rate could be included in when we provide data so that we can look at

845
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:29,707
So we have that, and our graduation rate, by the way, went up this year.

846
01:16:30,407 --> 01:16:33,751
The data you had in front of you from the last presentation was previous year.

847
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:39,117
Part of that is a function of how people view what is success.

848
01:16:39,598 --> 01:16:45,244
So if a youngster is missing one course in June and makes it up over the summer, they're not part of the four-year graduation rate.

849
01:16:45,784 --> 01:16:46,705
That's exactly what I'm saying.

850
01:16:46,725 --> 01:16:47,667
That's the whole point of it.

851
01:16:47,707 --> 01:16:50,330
So we can provide that information to you.

852
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:56,276
The trick will be getting the state and the feds to recognize that as legitimate, especially for youngsters who are challenged.

853
01:16:56,697 --> 01:17:03,124
Mr. Superintendent, my question is how do we move along the discussion of including the five-year graduation

854
01:17:03,865 --> 01:17:05,687
at the state and federal level.

855
01:17:05,707 --> 01:17:14,414
What we do is we get colleagues on school committees, colleagues in my office, principals around the state, to make that point on a regular basis.

856
01:17:14,434 --> 01:17:18,717
And that's something that should come up in November when we're down with colleagues.

857
01:17:19,118 --> 01:17:21,640
Because that's the kind of thing that really needs to be understood.

858
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,161
There shouldn't be a rush to succeed.

859
01:17:23,561 --> 01:17:26,143
There should be a steady, intelligent path to succeed.

860
01:17:26,904 --> 01:17:29,546
Especially for youngsters who don't speak English as a first language.

861
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:34,326
Especially for youngsters who are working with cognitive and procedural difficulties.

862
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:35,728
I mean, it's unfair.

863
01:17:36,429 --> 01:17:41,113
It's just truly unfair and it makes them look like they're not doing what they need to do or school systems aren't doing.

864
01:17:41,473 --> 01:17:45,678
In fact, it would be a shame not to give a youngster more time if they needed it.

865
01:17:46,478 --> 01:17:50,242
This is the kind of stuff that needs to get out there and I agree with you.

866
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:53,065
This is something that should be front and center in our discussions.

867
01:17:53,734 --> 01:18:02,881
I think the old thinking was always, well, you know, you put off these kids a little bit longer and keep managing the data to avoid youngsters being reported out.

868
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:05,503
It's not a question of managing data.

869
01:18:05,523 --> 01:18:07,845
It's a question of providing effective education.

870
01:18:08,145 --> 01:18:13,509
It's a question of recognizing the differences between different types of learners and supporting them.

871
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:17,813
You know, the average college completion rate, I said that the other night, is six years.

872
01:18:18,953 --> 01:18:19,394
Six years.

873
01:18:20,515 --> 01:18:22,316
Most kids take time to complete college.

874
01:18:23,037 --> 01:18:23,497
And it's not

875
01:18:24,649 --> 01:18:28,970
that a percentage of youngsters should take more time in high school to complete.

876
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:37,431
Not because they can't do it, but because they need to pace themselves differently so they can learn and take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of them.

877
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,052
So I agree with you very much.

878
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:49,773
Yeah, I think that's something that our school committee could take as a responsibility of talking about this and bringing it forward when we attend meetings outside of Medford, and also within Medford too.

879
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:53,194
I think it's something that the whole state would benefit from.

880
01:18:54,895 --> 01:18:56,836
Can we make a motion for our next meeting?

881
01:18:58,437 --> 01:18:59,918
Could you write up a motion that we can vote on?

882
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:00,258
Sure.

883
01:19:00,358 --> 01:19:01,399
And then you can deliver it down?

884
01:19:01,419 --> 01:19:01,619
Yep.

885
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,680
On behalf of Ms.

886
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,180
Van de Kloot.

887
01:19:05,861 --> 01:19:06,202
Thank you.

888
01:19:07,683 --> 01:19:10,184
Is there a motion to receive and place on file this report?

889
01:19:10,444 --> 01:19:11,065
Motion by Ms.

890
01:19:11,105 --> 01:19:12,305
Cuno, seconded by Ms.

891
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:13,206
Van de Kloot.

892
01:19:13,226 --> 01:19:13,906
All those in favor?

893
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:13,986
Aye.

894
01:19:14,487 --> 01:19:15,087
All those opposed?

895
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:15,807
Motion passes.

896
01:19:16,748 --> 01:19:19,810
Report on snow day, school cancellation protocols.

897
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:31,236
So, the reason this is on your agenda is every year I get asked around this time, how do we decide when school closes and what can we do about it?

898
01:19:32,137 --> 01:19:34,699
Now, the main message is this.

899
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:49,130
You should start planning now as a parent about a situation that might occur and who will help to cover your youngsters if you have to go to work, who's going to stay at home, what neighbors can work with you,

900
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,520
What situations can occur?

901
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:57,421
Can you talk to your employers, maybe coming in a little bit later on certain days to get things under control?

902
01:19:57,901 --> 01:19:59,742
You can't wait till the day it happens.

903
01:20:00,002 --> 01:20:01,262
You've got to start thinking about it.

904
01:20:01,822 --> 01:20:08,903
And oftentimes, we don't get a final call until later because we don't know if the storm is going to hit.

905
01:20:09,643 --> 01:20:13,124
You know, meteorologists do their job, but they can't be sure.

906
01:20:13,924 --> 01:20:18,345
Sometimes the storm veers off at the last second, and sometimes it veers in at the last second.

907
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,041
And we need to be careful.

908
01:20:20,121 --> 01:20:28,490
And sometimes the storm doesn't seem like it's coming to us at the beginning of school, but it's going to hit at 10 o'clock in the morning and getting young people home is its own problem.

909
01:20:29,231 --> 01:20:34,277
The other thing that we have to deal with is the fact that some youngsters have no one at home on a regular basis.

910
01:20:35,057 --> 01:20:39,602
And getting them to school means they might need a hot meal, they have some supervision.

911
01:20:40,874 --> 01:20:44,258
There's some other things going on that we want to provide.

912
01:20:44,919 --> 01:20:50,686
On the other hand, if you really feel uptight, you really feel like maybe your child shouldn't be out, it's your option to keep them home.

913
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:55,853
Missing a day is not going to change the world as long as you're diligent about following up on the work.

914
01:20:57,179 --> 01:20:58,380
We've got to understand these things.

915
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,900
Now it takes a lot to figure this out.

916
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:11,265
We talk to the DPW, we talk to the police department, we talk to the fire department, we talk to our own custodial crews, we talk to the contractors who plow our schools, we talk to neighbors.

917
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:12,646
What are they doing?

918
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:13,546
How are they doing it?

919
01:21:14,426 --> 01:21:16,127
And some places are more challenging than others.

920
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:22,410
If you live in the narrow streets of Everett and Malden, it's a lot tougher to plow those streets than it is maybe in Medford.

921
01:21:23,443 --> 01:21:32,507
It's a lot tougher to do certain things and they have to make decisions a little bit earlier because they can't get their crews out as fast as our crews get out.

922
01:21:34,528 --> 01:21:35,389
We want to provide.

923
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:37,249
intelligent days.

924
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:40,190
We also have to think about the days if teachers can't get there.

925
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:47,853
So school is open and the faculty can't make it in because they no longer all live in Medford or one community over.

926
01:21:48,413 --> 01:21:50,133
People live in wider areas.

927
01:21:50,753 --> 01:21:55,495
So to have a day where the faculty is missing doesn't give us a quality education day.

928
01:21:56,275 --> 01:21:58,696
We started earlier this year, so that should help.

929
01:21:59,657 --> 01:22:02,099
In terms of days, but you never know.

930
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,702
We've had years where there's been no school days.

931
01:22:05,102 --> 01:22:07,904
We've had years when a couple of years ago there were seven or eight school days.

932
01:22:08,565 --> 01:22:09,486
And last year there were three.

933
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:11,107
So it's hard to know.

934
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:14,150
And one year we shut down schools when the buildings were too cold.

935
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:17,453
And it wasn't a question of snow, it just was too cold.

936
01:22:18,294 --> 01:22:19,355
So there's a lot of reasons.

937
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:21,717
And we try to be up front.

938
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:25,320
There's always somebody who tells me we shouldn't have done it, and there's somebody who always tells me we should have done it.

939
01:22:26,063 --> 01:22:26,723
I mean, I guarantee you.

940
01:22:26,743 --> 01:22:28,604
And of course, the funniest things are the calls from the kids.

941
01:22:29,385 --> 01:22:30,485
Hello, this is a parent.

942
01:22:30,966 --> 01:22:33,327
I don't think kids should be going to school today.

943
01:22:34,248 --> 01:22:36,889
Hello, I had to shovel all day yesterday.

944
01:22:36,949 --> 01:22:38,510
I need at least one day to play in this stuff.

945
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:42,612
I mean, it's really funny what the kids will call up and say and do.

946
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:45,190
You know?

947
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:45,991
You understand?

948
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:47,752
But that's what it is.

949
01:22:47,992 --> 01:22:48,333
Okay?

950
01:22:48,373 --> 01:22:51,075
So a little bit of planning right now would be helpful.

951
01:22:51,135 --> 01:22:52,596
We're going to wish it away.

952
01:22:53,136 --> 01:22:54,017
Mr. Benedetto.

953
01:22:55,478 --> 01:22:56,919
So this is a good point.

954
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:06,006
I know a few years ago I brought it up when we had so many snow days, that there's other ways to learn and teach our students in a lot of other communities.

955
01:23:06,086 --> 01:23:11,650
They either have a snow day backpack where students complete some work so they don't fall behind,

956
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:16,753
Well, this is an opportunity to look at online learning for our community.

957
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:27,040
And, you know, we live in the Northeast, but we still take AP classes on the same day as everybody else in the country, no matter how many snow days we have and how many we don't.

958
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,883
So the learning has to be done in some classes by a specific date.

959
01:23:32,405 --> 01:23:47,214
So I would really, really like to talk to you at some point about more online learning opportunities for our students and to have us present maybe to the state different ways for children to study from home.

960
01:23:48,435 --> 01:23:52,117
That being said, Mr. Belson, you know how I feel.

961
01:23:52,417 --> 01:24:01,283
I like to see our buildings open even for any kids that come, even if it's less teachers, even if it's anything because some kids don't have a warm house.

962
01:24:01,798 --> 01:24:04,300
to stay in all day or parental supervision.

963
01:24:04,761 --> 01:24:09,085
And some kids depend on our schools to have their breakfast and their lunch.

964
01:24:09,465 --> 01:24:12,288
And they really shouldn't be home alone all that long.

965
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:23,217
So any opportunity that you can, I'm going to ask you to please try to keep some of our school buildings open for those families that really need us to be there for them on an everyday basis.

966
01:24:23,838 --> 01:24:27,061
So that's how I feel, even though I hate driving in the snow.

967
01:24:28,388 --> 01:24:32,111
Good luck making that call, and I'm glad it's not me making that decision.

968
01:24:34,172 --> 01:24:48,860
It's one thing we should also mention is our young people, we've tried to encourage them, especially the older children, to help out with neighbors who may be elderly or infirmed, because obviously sidewalks and things of that type need to be shoveled so that youngsters don't have to walk in streets.

969
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:56,730
We don't have situations where it's unsafe when a little kid is behind a huge snowbank.

970
01:24:57,411 --> 01:25:09,220
So those are things we need to talk a little bit about to the community about how they can help us make sure that if there's an accumulation of snow, it doesn't block the visibility for youngsters near buses or in their cars.

971
01:25:10,884 --> 01:25:22,948
Miss Kunio, while we're on that, I was just thinking that I know in the past we've had a list of senior citizens or people that actually need help to remove their snow.

972
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:27,730
And we've had students that have done it for community service and things like that.

973
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:35,073
So if we could look into it again and see if the counseling and aging and maybe speak to our

974
01:25:36,954 --> 01:25:44,496
I know it's difficult, sometimes we don't have a lot of students, but if we could get something working like that, that would be good.

975
01:25:45,276 --> 01:25:50,978
They have something in place that we met over the end of last winter, so hopefully we'll be ready to go.

976
01:25:51,398 --> 01:25:54,759
On the motion by Mr. Scarry to receive in place on file by Ms.

977
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:55,899
VanDekloot, all those in favor?

978
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:56,880
All those opposed?

979
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,461
Motion passes.

980
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:02,543
Motion to move negotiations in legal manners to the end of the agenda.

981
01:26:03,423 --> 01:26:04,544
So moved on that motion, Ms.

982
01:26:04,564 --> 01:26:06,265
Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

983
01:26:06,365 --> 01:26:06,865
Cuno.

984
01:26:07,526 --> 01:26:08,246
All those in favor?

985
01:26:08,446 --> 01:26:08,766
Aye.

986
01:26:08,866 --> 01:26:09,427
All those opposed?

987
01:26:09,687 --> 01:26:10,507
Motion passes.

988
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:12,789
Motion to suspend rules, Madam Mayor.

989
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:14,570
Motion to take new business.

990
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:22,374
Yes, just as a matter of public safety, through the superintendent, and possibly the D.B.W.

991
01:26:22,454 --> 01:26:25,096
look, they have placed this in the fashion signs on High Street by the Port School.

992
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:26,433
New business.

993
01:26:26,534 --> 01:26:26,854
M-A-S-C.

994
01:26:26,914 --> 01:26:30,637
Conference resolutions.

995
01:26:30,677 --> 01:26:31,978
There are four resolutions in our packet.

996
01:26:32,018 --> 01:26:33,118
They are quite lengthy.

997
01:26:33,138 --> 01:26:37,321
Is there a motion to read the entire resolution?

998
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:37,382
Ms.

999
01:26:38,983 --> 01:26:39,223
Vandekloot.

1000
01:26:54,406 --> 01:26:58,814
I think the best is if we could just get to the core of it.

1001
01:26:59,174 --> 01:27:01,077
I think we can do so in one or two sentences.

1002
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:09,583
The first one has to do with the foundation budget which is used to calculate all of the local aid that we get for the school department from the state.

1003
01:27:10,103 --> 01:27:28,595
It's be it resolved that MASC calls upon the legislature to enact the recommendations of the foundation budget into law and further that the legislature order the commission to reconvene in order to conduct further deliberations and make such recommendations as the FBRC may propose and further

1004
01:27:29,155 --> 01:27:36,681
that the FBRC shall address and make recommendations toward the overall accuracy of the adequacy of the overall foundation budget.

1005
01:27:37,302 --> 01:27:38,603
Mr. Superintendent.

1006
01:27:38,823 --> 01:27:46,929
Madam Mayor, the one thing I want to stress with this particular motion, while the motion itself is good, the adequacy word is very important.

1007
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:56,857
Because if they only put a certain amount of money, and even if it's more money, and it gets distributed in ways that Medford doesn't get any money, it doesn't help us.

1008
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:14,242
It's important that they increase the foundation budget, but it's also important that they understand that adequacy means that every community has to receive more than it's currently receiving now, not just those communities that fall below foundation.

1009
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:22,807
So that's critical, you know, that we stress when we talk at the conference about adequacy being funding everyone because everyone can use the money.

1010
01:28:23,692 --> 01:28:28,676
You know, there's that John Greenleaf Whittier quote that I love so much, but I modify it.

1011
01:28:29,497 --> 01:28:33,821
John Greenleaf Whittier said, of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are what might have been.

1012
01:28:34,361 --> 01:28:35,002
I changed that.

1013
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:39,445
Of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are subject to appropriation.

1014
01:28:40,246 --> 01:28:43,769
Because when they don't appropriate enough money, the language doesn't mean anything.

1015
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:50,735
They've got to understand that communities like Medford may be wealthier than certain other communities,

1016
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:54,211
Not as wealthy as others, but we need money.

1017
01:28:54,611 --> 01:29:06,913
You can't have a Foundation Budget Review Committee that wipes out additional funding to 150 communities, which is what the Foundation Budget Review Committee distribution would have done, including Medford.

1018
01:29:08,494 --> 01:29:10,554
We should vote yes, but we should vote for adequacy.

1019
01:29:10,574 --> 01:29:12,695
We should push adequacy in our discussion.

1020
01:29:15,614 --> 01:29:22,640
Is there a way that we should amend this resolution so that it covers our concern?

1021
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:26,464
I'm just looking as I read it, having heard your point.

1022
01:29:26,484 --> 01:29:33,310
I mean, basically, we should be saying that all communities should receive an increase

1023
01:29:33,878 --> 01:29:38,281
that is consistent with the demands and the mandates that the state has put in place.

1024
01:29:38,561 --> 01:29:41,242
The state has increased the number of mandates to communities, as you know.

1025
01:29:41,983 --> 01:29:44,704
Unfunded mandates is almost a way of life at the state house.

1026
01:29:46,065 --> 01:29:52,149
We cannot continue to allow that to happen because we continue to use our own money for things.

1027
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:54,170
And then as a result,

1028
01:29:54,961 --> 01:29:58,623
Eventually, we have to cut other things that we don't want to cut, or you can't go where you want to go.

1029
01:29:59,343 --> 01:30:08,908
So remember this year when we talked budget, I told you that we got $55 per pupil minimum aid, new money in the Chapter 70, which is more than a 25 of the year before.

1030
01:30:09,349 --> 01:30:10,689
But the net net was we lost $200,000.

1031
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:14,351
That's not a win.

1032
01:30:15,312 --> 01:30:18,673
What that is is a partial win.

1033
01:30:18,854 --> 01:30:19,794
It's a balancing act.

1034
01:30:22,447 --> 01:30:28,935
We need to make sure that if they're going to increase the foundation budget, that it adequately reflects the needs of all communities.

1035
01:30:29,496 --> 01:30:34,602
That's the message to the MASC Resolutions Committee and to the state.

1036
01:30:35,773 --> 01:30:39,315
Så... Point of information, Mr. Skerry.

1037
01:30:39,335 --> 01:30:50,062
Given the plight of the state's economy and the present budget shortcomings that the governor released this weekend, have citizen towns been notified that they may have to tighten their belts?

1038
01:30:50,122 --> 01:30:53,024
We have not had any 9C cuts inflicted upon us yet.

1039
01:30:53,084 --> 01:30:56,887
And we received all the scheduled receipts and first quarter payments from Commonwealth?

1040
01:30:56,907 --> 01:30:57,027
Uh-huh.

1041
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:57,507
Okay.

1042
01:30:57,867 --> 01:31:00,289
I'd be curious to see what October's receipts look like.

1043
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:01,650
September look better?

1044
01:31:03,045 --> 01:31:03,605
But not great.

1045
01:31:05,165 --> 01:31:08,786
These cuts across the board could eventually trickle down and affect us.

1046
01:31:09,266 --> 01:31:09,466
Right.

1047
01:31:09,926 --> 01:31:10,326
It did.

1048
01:31:10,546 --> 01:31:20,108
I think back in 2009 we had 9C cuts, which are really hard to do when you get notice in December and January, because you're basically cutting a year's worth of a cut in the 6th month.

1049
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:21,508
That's why I brought this up.

1050
01:31:21,568 --> 01:31:24,969
I want to make sure that we're at the top of the picture.

1051
01:31:25,109 --> 01:31:26,329
We're following quite closely.

1052
01:31:26,349 --> 01:31:26,869
Thank you.

1053
01:31:27,729 --> 01:31:30,710
Is there a motion for approval of this first resolution?

1054
01:31:31,429 --> 01:31:35,651
Well, I just have a question.

1055
01:31:35,671 --> 01:31:50,580
Then should we propose an amendment to the adequacies, continuing it by saying adequacy meaning the needs of all communities, to make it very clear where we stand with this?

1056
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:53,361
Well, I think we should put that into our language.

1057
01:31:53,981 --> 01:31:55,002
So that's what I'm saying.

1058
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:56,703
That adequacy, that we should stress adequacy

1059
01:31:57,418 --> 01:32:02,541
and a full distribution to all communities under Chapter 70, not just some.

1060
01:32:02,941 --> 01:32:04,922
So that's what I'm saying.

1061
01:32:05,022 --> 01:32:06,022
So amending this.

1062
01:32:06,302 --> 01:32:09,224
No, amending it, adding another, adding an emphasis point.

1063
01:32:09,264 --> 01:32:17,668
Right, so that way whoever our delegate is that goes to the conference, Mr. Skerry will actually have to stand up and express what our needs are.

1064
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:20,009
So that's why I want to make sure that we amend it properly.

1065
01:32:20,029 --> 01:32:24,151
And I think it's important to note that if you expect the legislature to enact something,

1066
01:32:24,848 --> 01:32:29,772
If you have 150 cities and towns that aren't going to benefit, it's unlikely they're going to enact it.

1067
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:35,236
So the likelihood of it being enacted has a greater chance if every community is a winner.

1068
01:32:36,397 --> 01:32:37,257
No, and I agree with you.

1069
01:32:37,277 --> 01:32:49,266
I'm just saying that if we are going to be looking at these proposals and the resolutions, I mean, that we make a stand to make sure that if we're going to amend it, we have to be properly, we'll do it properly now.

1070
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:52,588
So that way our delegate could express that when he goes down.

1071
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:54,190
So

1072
01:32:55,560 --> 01:33:01,962
I make a motion that we also change the adequacy, including the meeting, meaning of needs all meet.

1073
01:33:02,303 --> 01:33:06,464
Oh my gosh, meaning that it meet meets all communities.

1074
01:33:08,145 --> 01:33:11,026
On the motion as amended on resolution one.

1075
01:33:13,086 --> 01:33:16,068
Motion seconded roll call vote.

1076
01:33:19,509 --> 01:33:19,729
Yes.

1077
01:33:27,681 --> 01:33:31,508
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative on the motion as amended.

1078
01:33:32,349 --> 01:33:35,234
Resolution 2, tax reform ballot question.

1079
01:33:36,948 --> 01:33:42,533
talks about greater tax equity that will not raise taxes on any but the wealthiest residents of Massachusetts.

1080
01:33:43,313 --> 01:34:03,470
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Massachusetts Association of School Committees explore ways to promote social and economic equity through a valid initiative whose purpose may include a state constitutional amendment, tax reform, protection of the state's neediest residents of all ages, and seeks additional revenue only from tax reform affecting the state's wealthiest residents.

1081
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:15,055
FURTHER, THAT THE GOAL OF SUCH A BALLOT REFERENDUM WILL BE TO SECURE A STRONGER FINANCIAL BASE TO UNDERWRITE NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE COMMONWEALTH, AS WELL AS THE EDUCATIONAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF ITS RESIDENTS.

1082
01:34:16,015 --> 01:34:20,277
IS THERE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR FOR APPROVAL OF THIS RESOLUTION NUMBER 2?

1083
01:34:20,317 --> 01:34:23,779
MOTION FOR APPROVAL, MR. SCARI, SECONDED BY THE INTERCLUDE.

1084
01:34:23,799 --> 01:34:24,579
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

1085
01:34:31,377 --> 01:34:34,400
Yes, 7 to 0, 7 in favor, motion passes.

1086
01:34:35,881 --> 01:34:37,923
Resolution 3, charter school reform.

1087
01:34:38,825 --> 01:34:40,026
Oh, this is a long one.

1088
01:34:40,126 --> 01:34:42,488
I'm going to go right down to the be it resolved.

1089
01:34:42,528 --> 01:35:05,547
Therefore, be it resolved that the Massachusetts Association of School Committees urge the citizens of the Commonwealth to reject such a ballot initiative and further, that MASC seeks legislative approval of a comprehensive set of reforms that include, one, establishment of strict guidelines or regulations to require the charter schools enrolled represent cross-sections of students residing within the school service areas.

1090
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:12,230
Two, reporting of accurate number of students who leave charter schools to return to the sending district or district of residence.

1091
01:35:13,111 --> 01:35:16,412
Three, requiring, well, I'm sorry, requiring the Mass.

1092
01:35:16,432 --> 01:35:29,718
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to retain and report accurate data on enrollment of students with learning disabilities, physical disabilities, economic disadvantage, emotional disability, and status as racial and linguistic minorities.

1093
01:35:30,818 --> 01:35:42,928
4.

1094
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:42,928
State requirements that any charter school authorized in a community without its consent be funded in full by the Commonwealth, rather than by expropriation of Chapter 70 education aid from the sending cities, towns, and regions.

1095
01:35:44,069 --> 01:35:42,928
5.

1096
01:35:44,189 --> 01:35:51,475
State funding in full of any mitigation funds created to offset the loss of state funding for students who become students in charter schools.

1097
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:54,210
Mr. Benedetto.

1098
01:35:54,230 --> 01:35:58,452
First of all, I feel like I work at a charter school.

1099
01:35:58,772 --> 01:36:02,193
I believe my school does adhere to all these rules and regulations.

1100
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:09,035
But as an employee of that school district, I choose to abstain from voting at this time.

1101
01:36:09,095 --> 01:36:13,816
So noted that Mr. Benedetto will abstain based upon her working for a charter school.

1102
01:36:13,836 --> 01:36:14,836
Motion for approval.

1103
01:36:14,856 --> 01:36:15,976
Is the motion for approval by Ms.

1104
01:36:15,996 --> 01:36:17,177
Vanderhoof, seconded by Ms.

1105
01:36:17,217 --> 01:36:17,677
Cuneo.

1106
01:36:17,957 --> 01:36:18,497
Roll call, Ms.

1107
01:36:18,517 --> 01:36:18,657
Toscari.

1108
01:36:18,677 --> 01:36:18,717
Ms.

1109
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:19,057
Cuneo.

1110
01:36:20,078 --> 01:36:20,358
Yes.

1111
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:21,458
Mr. Benedetto.

1112
01:36:28,008 --> 01:36:30,831
Yes, 6 in the affirmative, 1 abstain, motion passes.

1113
01:36:31,391 --> 01:36:34,654
Resolution 4, social and emotional well-being of students.

1114
01:36:35,672 --> 01:36:36,913
Som be it resolved that the Mass.

1115
01:36:36,953 --> 01:37:01,163
Association of School Committees shall be directed to deploy such resources of the Association independently and in collaboration with other organizations to gather resources, identify strategies, and improve public awareness of the importance of addressing students' social and emotional well-being, and further, that MASC shall give consideration to such public policy initiatives that prioritize action by stakeholders and stakeholders

1116
01:37:01,943 --> 01:37:11,132
in collaboration with expert behavioral and health care providers as the most effective entities for addressing strategies that are in the best interest of children.

1117
01:37:11,752 --> 01:37:12,713
Motion for approval by Ms.

1118
01:37:12,753 --> 01:37:14,215
Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

1119
01:37:14,235 --> 01:37:14,775
Cuneo.

1120
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:16,377
Roll call vote, please, Mr. Skerry.

1121
01:37:16,637 --> 01:37:16,797
Ms.

1122
01:37:16,817 --> 01:37:18,499
Van de Kloot would like to speak on this first.

1123
01:37:18,519 --> 01:37:18,559
Ms.

1124
01:37:18,619 --> 01:37:19,219
Van de Kloot?

1125
01:37:33,393 --> 01:37:33,753
Very good.

1126
01:37:34,514 --> 01:37:35,774
Mr. Scarry, roll call, please.

1127
01:37:43,618 --> 01:37:45,659
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1128
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:46,399
Motion passes.

1129
01:37:47,059 --> 01:37:47,780
Thank you very much.

1130
01:37:50,097 --> 01:37:52,698
Okay, resolution submitted by member Van de Kloot.

1131
01:37:52,878 --> 01:37:59,159
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee urges the citizens of Medford to vote no on charter school expansion question two this November.

1132
01:37:59,279 --> 01:37:59,419
Ms.

1133
01:37:59,439 --> 01:37:59,879
Van de Kloot.

1134
01:38:00,739 --> 01:38:05,300
So there's obviously many, many different levels of conversation that we could have on this.

1135
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:08,781
I'm going to strictly take mine to the financial.

1136
01:38:10,002 --> 01:38:15,103
Right now, it costs Medford approximately $4 million to fund our charter school students.

1137
01:38:16,843 --> 01:38:25,672
We have 10 students less than last year, but it's costing us $270,000 more this year.

1138
01:38:26,413 --> 01:38:27,174
Why is that?

1139
01:38:27,594 --> 01:38:34,001
It's because the state has underfunded the charter school account by $57 million.

1140
01:38:36,094 --> 01:38:38,715
This comes to one of those unfunded mandates.

1141
01:38:39,675 --> 01:38:42,516
It's not a question of how good charter schools are or how not.

1142
01:38:42,856 --> 01:38:51,498
Right now we're simply talking about a funding mechanism and the number of charter schools that would be potentially approved by this would only have a greater impact.

1143
01:38:51,838 --> 01:38:59,640
Therefore, I certainly personally have been urging people to vote no on two because of the particular way the funding works.

1144
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:05,743
And I would urge the school committee to take a stand and say vote no on two.

1145
01:39:05,763 --> 01:39:10,326
There's a motion on the floor for approval of Ms.

1146
01:39:10,366 --> 01:39:13,087
Van de Kloot's recommendation, seconded by Ms.

1147
01:39:13,127 --> 01:39:13,608
Cuno.

1148
01:39:13,768 --> 01:39:14,828
Would you like a roll call on this?

1149
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:15,529
Sure.

1150
01:39:16,169 --> 01:39:18,270
Roll call, Mr. Skerry.

1151
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:18,330
Ms.

1152
01:39:19,611 --> 01:39:19,931
Cuno.

1153
01:39:20,832 --> 01:39:20,952
Yes.

1154
01:39:21,032 --> 01:39:22,433
Mr. Van de Kloot.

1155
01:39:27,814 --> 01:39:30,655
Yes, six in the affirmative, one abstained, motion passes.

1156
01:39:33,817 --> 01:39:34,858
Over four million dollars.

1157
01:39:35,318 --> 01:39:36,299
That's on our cherry sheets.

1158
01:39:36,339 --> 01:39:42,882
Anyone can go up to the state website and they can look up Medford's cherry sheet, which was named after the color it used to be printed on back in the dark ages.

1159
01:39:43,643 --> 01:39:49,406
And you can look up the state aid, and you can see the revenue that comes from the state, expenses they charge us, such as tea.

1160
01:39:50,106 --> 01:39:54,292
They hit us for being a T community, which is quite a couple million dollars.

1161
01:39:54,892 --> 01:39:56,855
Charter schools is another big hit that we have.

1162
01:39:56,875 --> 01:40:00,680
And then you see the monies that come to the city from the state as well.

1163
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,202
So please, go up and look.

1164
01:40:02,242 --> 01:40:03,664
It's enlightening.

1165
01:40:06,224 --> 01:40:20,308
Yeah, I think the thing about the charter schools is we're not, like you said, we're not saying they're not great educational facilities, but when you pluck one first grader out of the school, maybe one first out of another school, we don't lose a whole classroom, so we don't gain any efficiencies.

1166
01:40:20,388 --> 01:40:25,029
We just, we lose one here and there, and the next thing you know, we're up to what number, Mr. Billeson?

1167
01:40:25,249 --> 01:40:25,909
About 330 right now.

1168
01:40:25,969 --> 01:40:26,630
330 spread amongst.

1169
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:32,421
you know, all the different grades and schools and classrooms.

1170
01:40:32,461 --> 01:40:39,024
So, we're not able to just cut classrooms, you know, without putting our numbers up to 25, 26 average, so.

1171
01:40:39,364 --> 01:40:43,066
A few years ago, we did a study along with MASS.

1172
01:40:43,786 --> 01:40:51,930
We found that we could fund those youngsters by putting them in classrooms at this point in time, back then, at about a third of the cost.

1173
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:57,172
So, when people say that there is no loss of revenue

1174
01:40:57,835 --> 01:41:01,041
They don't do the numbers like we do the numbers.

1175
01:41:01,361 --> 01:41:03,185
There may be some communities that don't have space.

1176
01:41:03,686 --> 01:41:07,092
There may be some situations that don't exist, that don't work 100%.

1177
01:41:07,192 --> 01:41:09,757
But in this community, it will work.

1178
01:41:11,105 --> 01:41:11,465
Very good.

1179
01:41:12,225 --> 01:41:20,647
Resolution proposed by Mayor Burke, proclamation by Mayor Burke, supporting and celebrating keeping lights on, keeping lights on after school of proclamation.

1180
01:41:21,507 --> 01:41:23,548
Can I read this whole motion?

1181
01:41:24,568 --> 01:41:33,010
Whereas the citizens of Medford stand firmly committed to quality after school programs and opportunities because they provide challenging and engaging learning experiences that help

1182
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:42,558
Children develop social, emotional, physical, and academic skills while supporting working families, ensuring their children are safe and productive after the traditional school day ends.

1183
01:41:43,238 --> 01:41:54,428
We, as the City of Medford, have provided significant leadership in the area of community involvement in the education and well-being of our youth, grounded in the principle that quality after-school programs are key to helping our children become successful adults.

1184
01:41:55,148 --> 01:42:07,058
Where as Lights On After School, the national celebration of after-school programs held this year on October 22, 2016, promotes the importance of quality after-school programs in the lives of children, families, and communities.

1185
01:42:07,599 --> 01:42:09,620
Where as more than 28 million children in the U.S.

1186
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:14,304
have parents who work outside the home, and 15.1 million children have no place to go after school.

1187
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:22,951
Where as many after-school programs across the country are facing funding shortfalls so severe that they are being forced to close their doors and turn off their lights.

1188
01:42:23,852 --> 01:42:35,362
Medford City is committed to investing in the health and safety of all young people by providing after-school and out-of-school time programs that will help close the achievement gap and prepare young people to compete in the global economy.

1189
01:42:36,243 --> 01:42:45,251
It is important to engage families, schools, and communities in advancing the welfare of our children and ensure the lights stay on and the doors stay open for all children after school.

1190
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:46,791
Now, the F.R.I.

1191
01:42:46,811 --> 01:43:06,357
Stephanie Burke, Mayor of the City of Medford, do hereby proclaim October 22, 2016 to be Lights On After School Day, and urge all the citizens of Medford to take cognizance of this event and participate fittingly in its observance, given this seventeenth day of October in the year 2016, and of the independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and forty.

1192
01:43:07,417 --> 01:43:08,657
Motion for approval.

1193
01:43:08,977 --> 01:43:09,717
Seconded by Ms.

1194
01:43:09,737 --> 01:43:10,358
Van de Kloot.

1195
01:43:10,438 --> 01:43:11,278
All those in favor?

1196
01:43:11,298 --> 01:43:12,638
All those opposed?

1197
01:43:12,698 --> 01:43:13,418
Motion passes.

1198
01:43:14,779 --> 01:43:15,059
Thank you.

1199
01:43:16,419 --> 01:43:19,982
Mr. Benedetto, two updates from the super.

1200
01:43:20,042 --> 01:43:21,003
I'm sorry.

1201
01:43:21,464 --> 01:43:21,604
Okay.

1202
01:43:22,845 --> 01:43:23,185
Yep, sorry.

1203
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:28,134
School Committee Resolution.

1204
01:43:28,154 --> 01:43:32,638
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Thomas English.

1205
01:43:32,738 --> 01:43:36,822
Mr. English was a Medford High School physical education health teacher and coach for many years.

1206
01:43:37,162 --> 01:43:40,525
He was the husband of Marlene English, a former Medford public school secretary.

1207
01:43:41,586 --> 01:43:46,591
Further, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Beth Wood.

1208
01:43:46,831 --> 01:43:47,031
Ms.

1209
01:43:47,071 --> 01:43:50,614
Wood was the sister of former Director of Administration and Finance, Pat Bailey.

1210
01:43:51,718 --> 01:43:56,664
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of John DeVeros.

1211
01:43:56,764 --> 01:44:00,068
Mr. DeVeros was a long-time custodian for the Medford Public Schools.

1212
01:44:00,569 --> 01:44:06,817
And if I could just add one, that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Hannah Young, former Medford High School student.

1213
01:44:07,317 --> 01:44:09,039
All please rise for a moment of silence, please.

1214
01:44:25,202 --> 01:44:25,862
Mr. Benedetto.

1215
01:44:26,483 --> 01:44:27,944
Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1216
01:44:28,504 --> 01:44:32,826
Superintendent, through you to Superintendent Bellson, he gave us two updates.

1217
01:44:32,926 --> 01:44:35,107
I don't know if you wanted to go over them publicly.

1218
01:44:36,188 --> 01:44:43,171
One was for the complete rollout of school brains and when that will take place.

1219
01:44:45,753 --> 01:44:46,733
Mr. Superintendent.

1220
01:44:47,294 --> 01:44:49,835
And the other one is the MBTA bus passes.

1221
01:44:50,463 --> 01:44:55,126
All right, so on the School Brains activity, as you know, we've switched from iPass to School Brains.

1222
01:44:55,966 --> 01:45:06,292
It's a much more comprehensive and much more, let's say, modernized version of school software that would keep track of students, staff, and other records and the like.

1223
01:45:06,752 --> 01:45:08,013
But there was a rollout period.

1224
01:45:08,753 --> 01:45:15,357
And the primary activity initially was, one, to transfer information from iPass to School Brains.

1225
01:45:15,377 --> 01:45:17,658
There's still some data that has to be cleaned.

1226
01:45:18,323 --> 01:45:28,607
It's a very arduous process because some of the material is in different formats from one to the other and has to be individually looked at to be sure of accuracy as people come and go.

1227
01:45:29,108 --> 01:45:30,008
And it's not static.

1228
01:45:30,268 --> 01:45:32,889
What's true today may not be true tomorrow as people come and leave.

1229
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:38,812
Secondly, there needs to be training on this and there is training going on.

1230
01:45:40,411 --> 01:45:48,316
There is a train-the-trainer activity at the schools, where we're empowering certain teachers and administrators to become lead people.

1231
01:45:49,157 --> 01:45:55,741
And on the school professional development day, we're having an all-school activity that will deal with that as well.

1232
01:45:56,242 --> 01:46:07,870
Our primary activity initially is to roll out the attendance and grade reporting activities, because that's what's essential for us to do what has to be done, and also the materials that are associated with state reporting.

1233
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,841
We will then work on the parent portal.

1234
01:46:11,302 --> 01:46:20,907
The high school and the vocational school will be ready at the end of the first quarter, around November 17th, to open up the parent portal for students at those schools.

1235
01:46:21,768 --> 01:46:35,936
We think the middle schools probably have a good shot to be opened by the first of the year, and the elementary schools are working on their standards report cards, and we'll get a better handle on that once that's been cleaned up, and we know exactly when they can be able to comment on that.

1236
01:46:35,996 --> 01:46:38,418
But it's making progress, we want to do it right,

1237
01:46:40,306 --> 01:46:53,271
There is something called a System Interoperational Framework, SIF, that is important to coordinate with the state, because if you will, garbage in, garbage out, and once you get that kind of thing happening, it becomes impossible.

1238
01:46:53,931 --> 01:46:59,954
And just simply by inverting the first name and the last name in some reports can create all kinds of errors.

1239
01:47:00,995 --> 01:47:02,395
Very careful as we convert.

1240
01:47:02,495 --> 01:47:16,839
In the long run, it will be distinctly to our advantage that it may take a little bit longer, but our goal remains the same, to increase our interactivity with parents and to provide people with full information and to be able to create reports that will help us all better understand what's going on.

1241
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:19,319
So that's that particular activity.

1242
01:47:19,799 --> 01:47:25,661
In some places, it'll be a little bit slower than others, but we're working on it, and we're certainly not stopping what we need to do.

1243
01:47:26,721 --> 01:47:28,842
On the school bus, okay?

1244
01:47:28,862 --> 01:47:30,042
Mr. Benedetto has a question.

1245
01:47:30,282 --> 01:47:30,482
Sure.

1246
01:47:31,603 --> 01:47:43,927
Mr. Superintendent, I'm wondering if you could maybe work up a timeline in the next month or so, so that way parents know or tell us how you're going to communicate to parents when the rollout for the Parent Portal piece will be.

1247
01:47:44,828 --> 01:47:48,729
I've been getting a few phone calls and messages from parents.

1248
01:47:48,809 --> 01:47:54,771
They're eager to use this program and they were really looking for a specific date.

1249
01:47:55,352 --> 01:47:56,412
Well, you know, I don't want to be

1250
01:47:57,162 --> 01:48:00,165
I'm foolish enough to say something that I can't deliver on.

1251
01:48:00,245 --> 01:48:05,129
One of the things that we want to be careful about is we make a promise and we can't keep it, we're worse off.

1252
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:08,292
I told you that the high school will be ready at the end of the first quarter.

1253
01:48:08,912 --> 01:48:11,735
We think the middle school will be ready by the first of the year, if not sooner.

1254
01:48:12,296 --> 01:48:20,623
We elementary schools will roll out a little bit differently because they have different informational reporting things than the standards report cards and the other two frameworks.

1255
01:48:21,215 --> 01:48:22,716
So we need to be a little bit careful.

1256
01:48:23,136 --> 01:48:24,077
Let's just put it this way.

1257
01:48:24,117 --> 01:48:29,321
We are diligently proceeding of a better idea after the training is done in November.

1258
01:48:30,382 --> 01:48:36,386
Again, to see what teachers' minds are, what they feel comfortable with, and we can work our way through.

1259
01:48:36,426 --> 01:48:38,448
But I understand that people are anxious.

1260
01:48:38,568 --> 01:48:42,791
On the other hand, I certainly don't want to make promises I can't keep because that only creates more problems.

1261
01:48:44,492 --> 01:48:46,113
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1262
01:48:46,173 --> 01:48:49,396
So even if we put it up on our website that we're working

1263
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:55,152
coming soon, approximate, hopeful dates, whatever way you want to put it.

1264
01:48:55,472 --> 01:48:59,353
At least so parents have an understanding of what they're looking for.

1265
01:49:00,493 --> 01:49:06,015
I have experienced school districts turning over, and I really know that this takes a long time.

1266
01:49:06,055 --> 01:49:10,597
And some school districts don't even turn it over till the parents leave first or second year.

1267
01:49:10,657 --> 01:49:13,398
They wait until all think glitches are out.

1268
01:49:14,338 --> 01:49:17,539
So I understand that you are trying to expedite this quickly.

1269
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,471
And I do appreciate that.

1270
01:49:19,891 --> 01:49:26,936
Also, would you just put that on our agenda that, you know, just to update us on the dates?

1271
01:49:27,336 --> 01:49:29,357
If you could do that, I would appreciate that.

1272
01:49:29,377 --> 01:49:33,420
And the MBTA bus pass, Mr. Superintendent.

1273
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:36,442
The MBTA bus passes, the MBTA changed the rules.

1274
01:49:37,163 --> 01:49:40,165
The MBTA gave what they called an M-pass and an S-pass.

1275
01:49:40,565 --> 01:49:44,868
The M-pass is a pass that allows you to bypass for 30 days, for a month.

1276
01:49:45,597 --> 01:49:45,837
And it's $30.

1277
01:49:46,358 --> 01:49:49,000
And that gives you unlimited riding privileges.

1278
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:57,627
The S-Pass was a pass that you could put $10 on and you could use up to $10 for a time and then get another pass, get it renewed.

1279
01:49:58,087 --> 01:50:03,672
The difficulty is that the S-Pass was being abused widely and the MBTA pulled it in.

1280
01:50:04,353 --> 01:50:09,437
And they said school systems and communities are now responsible if the wrong people use it.

1281
01:50:10,282 --> 01:50:17,924
And what we had people losing it, people letting their cousins and their relatives use it, and there was all kinds of problems associated with that.

1282
01:50:18,004 --> 01:50:25,026
So, we recognize that it's something that we want to be available to people, but we want to do it in a measured way.

1283
01:50:25,426 --> 01:50:34,049
So, I've given you a report tonight to show that we've checked it out, we're following it, we're going to do it a limited amount of the time, especially for those people who clearly have a need.

1284
01:50:35,029 --> 01:50:44,533
to have it, but at the same token, we want to be very careful that we don't have abuse and we don't have lost passes and things like that because then we'll get charged for it.

1285
01:50:45,173 --> 01:50:46,193
And that's not going to happen.

1286
01:50:46,293 --> 01:50:50,835
It's not just a Medford issue, it's across the state, across the, let's say, the MBTA area.

1287
01:50:51,395 --> 01:50:56,557
So this is an MBTA-driven activity and we want to control it.

1288
01:50:56,597 --> 01:51:01,719
Plus the fact, too, it's a lot of man hours, person hours, if you will, to control these passes.

1289
01:51:02,483 --> 01:51:04,645
People come in, I've lost my pass, can I have another one?

1290
01:51:06,567 --> 01:51:08,509
It's a lot of work associated with it.

1291
01:51:08,529 --> 01:51:14,274
So we need to create a certain sense that this is something you need to protect and you need to use it wisely.

1292
01:51:14,574 --> 01:51:17,897
And if someone doesn't use it appropriately, they won't get it again.

1293
01:51:17,917 --> 01:51:19,158
Ms.

1294
01:51:19,198 --> 01:51:19,959
Cuneo is first.

1295
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:23,722
Just to go back on school brains.

1296
01:51:25,362 --> 01:51:33,110
A little bit frustrating because I totally understand it's a huge undertaking, but like we're doing train the trainer assistance now.

1297
01:51:34,372 --> 01:51:40,358
Why don't we do train the trainer like in the summertime so that way we could try to get the system up and going?

1298
01:51:40,378 --> 01:51:42,240
I guess that's one question.

1299
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,022
The other question is that

1300
01:51:45,437 --> 01:51:49,419
You know, we have, it's common nature how it is.

1301
01:51:49,459 --> 01:51:50,839
You know, we had the I-PASS.

1302
01:51:51,219 --> 01:51:53,460
When we had I-PASS, everybody hated I-PASS.

1303
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:56,441
Now we have school brains and everybody loves I-PASS.

1304
01:51:56,822 --> 01:51:58,062
So it's just the way it is.

1305
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:12,848
But the fact remains is that now we have people that have been used to at least getting on, checking their children's grades or, you know, getting progress reports via the I-PASS.

1306
01:52:13,742 --> 01:52:16,784
Ahora es como si estuvieran cerradas, completamente cerradas.

1307
01:52:16,804 --> 01:52:22,208
Así que creo que mi preocupación es, en cuanto a los padres, ¿qué les estamos pidiendo?

1308
01:52:22,248 --> 01:52:25,350
¿Les estamos pidiendo que vuelvan a enviar e-mails a sus maestros?

1309
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:30,634
O, no es la escuela de la secundaria que estoy hablando de tanto como la escuela de la secundaria y la escuela de la universidad.

1310
01:52:30,654 --> 01:52:33,336
Los padres están en el jardín y ven a sus maestros.

1311
01:52:33,356 --> 01:52:34,316
Todos tienen horas diferentes.

1312
01:52:34,336 --> 01:52:36,758
No quiero llegar al punto en el que estamos bombardeando a nuestros maestros

1313
01:52:41,181 --> 01:52:43,402
But what are we going to be telling our parents?

1314
01:52:44,223 --> 01:52:47,945
Like, we're not going to get, the high school's not going to be rolling it out until after the first quarter.

1315
01:52:48,566 --> 01:52:52,268
Parents have, you know, questions, they want to know what's going on.

1316
01:52:52,768 --> 01:52:53,569
What are we telling them?

1317
01:52:53,909 --> 01:52:57,231
All right, well, what I told you before, basically, we did a lot of training last year.

1318
01:52:57,851 --> 01:52:59,272
We had to negotiate a contract.

1319
01:52:59,332 --> 01:53:00,753
We did negotiate the contract.

1320
01:53:01,113 --> 01:53:02,354
Then we had to work in training.

1321
01:53:03,011 --> 01:53:06,893
Teachers were uncomfortable using some of these things and took time to get them going.

1322
01:53:06,913 --> 01:53:08,153
We did run training last year.

1323
01:53:08,633 --> 01:53:11,855
They didn't consider it to be sufficient enough and they wanted to do more.

1324
01:53:11,975 --> 01:53:13,956
In the summer, people were away.

1325
01:53:13,976 --> 01:53:15,356
You can only do so much.

1326
01:53:15,396 --> 01:53:18,918
You can only do what the people that want to come in and want to work on it.

1327
01:53:19,798 --> 01:53:21,119
There are other things that are going on.

1328
01:53:21,639 --> 01:53:23,880
So, it's happening.

1329
01:53:24,728 --> 01:53:29,212
The goal was to do it right and to have it be a long-term value to us.

1330
01:53:29,772 --> 01:53:33,535
I don't want to rush it and create a situation where we promise you things and then we can't do it.

1331
01:53:34,275 --> 01:53:39,839
And as far as a little inconvenience in the front end, I understand that, but better to have that little inconvenience in the front end.

1332
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:46,944
You can certainly communicate with your teachers by email, you can certainly call up the school, you certainly can visit to get any information.

1333
01:53:46,985 --> 01:53:48,866
We're certainly still sending out progress reports.

1334
01:53:49,363 --> 01:53:55,269
That's not something we've stopped doing, but the electronic system is going to take a little bit longer.

1335
01:53:55,289 --> 01:53:56,911
The high school will happen very shortly.

1336
01:53:57,691 --> 01:53:59,413
Middle school I think will follow pretty quickly.

1337
01:53:59,994 --> 01:54:04,999
And then the elementary schools will have to figure out what's the best way to do that going forward.

1338
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:08,643
I don't think anyone is trying to slow it down.

1339
01:54:09,003 --> 01:54:10,905
I just think it takes time to do it right.

1340
01:54:11,688 --> 01:54:17,613
And if we rush it and we do something, we're gonna probably find we'll have more headaches down the road than we really bargained for.

1341
01:54:18,054 --> 01:54:19,275
Garbage in, garbage out.

1342
01:54:19,675 --> 01:54:20,656
We don't want that to happen.

1343
01:54:21,016 --> 01:54:21,917
So I appreciate it.

1344
01:54:22,598 --> 01:54:25,841
Hopefully people understand that we're doing everything we can to get it going.

1345
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:28,383
In a short period of time, it'll happen.

1346
01:54:29,612 --> 01:54:42,763
I totally understand that, but again, I agree with all of my colleagues that at least put it out there so that way we don't have different schools saying different messages or sending different messages because I think that was the frustrating part.

1347
01:54:43,183 --> 01:54:52,612
People want to appease everyone, but as you said, you don't want to throw out a date and then parents are expecting that date and now we come across as not abiding by that.

1348
01:54:54,533 --> 01:54:54,693
Ms.

1349
01:54:54,714 --> 01:54:55,174
Van de Kloot.

1350
01:55:01,124 --> 01:55:12,375
I was hoping that Cheryl could just speak about the Roberts community event to just give a shout out to our Yad Seal.

1351
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:18,981
First of all, I want to say thank you for helping the parents that came forward about the MBTA passes.

1352
01:55:19,341 --> 01:55:22,004
When I reached out to them, they were very happy with it.

1353
01:55:22,818 --> 01:55:28,822
administration and how they resolved their issues and how they opened it up to people in need of that.

1354
01:55:29,002 --> 01:55:32,905
And if other people are in need, then they should contact, I'm not exactly sure.

1355
01:55:33,265 --> 01:55:37,888
Joanne Mortel is the person on the point of this particular bus pass.

1356
01:55:38,308 --> 01:55:40,449
She's in the accounts payable office of the schools.

1357
01:55:41,009 --> 01:55:44,812
You can look it up from the business offices to the phone number I have in front of me right now.

1358
01:55:46,286 --> 01:55:50,149
He's the person issuing them and paying attention to their monitoring.

1359
01:55:50,229 --> 01:55:55,773
It's a lot of work and I appreciate all the work that Joanne has done to keep things in place.

1360
01:55:56,934 --> 01:56:00,056
So my last item is a few items in there.

1361
01:56:00,276 --> 01:56:07,462
They're just items that I would like to see listed under number 11 that reports we've requested.

1362
01:56:07,902 --> 01:56:11,104
And as they're requested, we take them off the list and it helps me

1363
01:56:12,432 --> 01:56:21,196
It's like my to-do list, and I go from meeting to meeting and rewrite the list, so it's just helpful to have it on the bottom there.

1364
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:23,257
Someone very smart suggested I do that.

1365
01:56:23,717 --> 01:56:27,219
Anyway, the first one would be the letter to Rep.

1366
01:56:27,239 --> 01:56:33,122
Donato and Gobley regarding the crossing guard at Salem Street and asking them to help us.

1367
01:56:33,702 --> 01:56:34,643
I mean, Felsway, right?

1368
01:56:35,663 --> 01:56:39,205
The other one would be the cost report of all

1369
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:44,622
expenses for the MASC conference from last year and projected costs for next year.

1370
01:56:47,764 --> 01:56:53,926
And there was a couple of items my colleague, Ms.

1371
01:56:53,966 --> 01:57:04,911
Kretz, requested, and that would be to add a bus to go from the elementary school to the high school for the field trip.

1372
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:10,870
Oh, okay.

1373
01:57:11,271 --> 01:57:11,931
I thought it was Ms.

1374
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:12,191
Kratz.

1375
01:57:12,211 --> 01:57:14,732
Sorry, it might have been Anne-Marie.

1376
01:57:16,492 --> 01:57:27,436
In the update on the MCAS, students that did not pass MCAS in adding a prep class, if that's been added... We've done that.

1377
01:57:28,197 --> 01:57:29,217
Okay, that's good to know.

1378
01:57:29,657 --> 01:57:37,280
I know that that question came up last time about how we were going to provide extra additional help and where that money was coming from.

1379
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,900
to help students that have to retake the MCAS.

1380
01:57:41,321 --> 01:57:43,741
So I know that that came up at our last meeting as well.

1381
01:57:44,581 --> 01:57:46,942
So that has been done, and that class is scheduled.

1382
01:57:46,962 --> 01:57:49,362
Yeah, we'll get you a report on that.

1383
01:57:49,642 --> 01:57:49,802
OK.

1384
01:57:50,142 --> 01:57:52,943
It helps me keep everything straight, and I appreciate it.

1385
01:57:53,063 --> 01:57:53,503
Thank you.

1386
01:57:53,523 --> 01:57:54,023
Thank you.

1387
01:57:54,043 --> 01:57:56,123
Oh, Ms.

1388
01:57:56,163 --> 01:57:56,603
Kritz.

1389
01:57:57,903 --> 01:58:06,885
I want to mention, I did follow up with Mr. Johnson regarding the Fulton Street and the Felsway stop.

1390
01:58:07,683 --> 01:58:16,450
and they no longer use that as a bus stop, so they don't cross the students, because I had contacted him and he spoke back, got back to me.

1391
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:21,975
It used to be a popular crossing area when St.

1392
01:58:22,355 --> 01:58:24,417
Francis was open for parochial school.

1393
01:58:25,357 --> 01:58:30,722
They don't use that any longer, and they discourage students from crossing.

1394
01:58:31,482 --> 01:58:37,027
In fact, they re-roaded the buses to have them stop on the appropriate sides of the Fells Way,

1395
01:58:37,575 --> 01:58:38,916
to get to their homes.

1396
01:58:39,557 --> 01:58:44,060
I did clarify that with Mr. Johnson after our last meeting.

1397
01:58:44,401 --> 01:58:53,108
And I also spoke to him and he said that they're doing great with their crossing guard at the Roberts.

1398
01:58:53,188 --> 01:58:57,832
However, it's very busy and it's very congested.

1399
01:58:58,632 --> 01:59:05,298
And in fact, they might need two crossing guards because of the narrow streets and

1400
01:59:05,779 --> 01:59:10,620
making sure that students cross safely, and having somebody direct the traffic.

1401
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:18,441
It's just very busy in that area, as well as the Brooks, which we're all aware of.

1402
01:59:18,761 --> 01:59:28,103
So I wanted to definitely mention that, because he mentioned that to me, that if there was any way to get another crossing guard, that would be helpful.

1403
01:59:28,903 --> 01:59:32,144
So maybe that's something that we would have to look at.

1404
01:59:33,684 --> 01:59:34,144
Thank you, Ms.

1405
01:59:34,164 --> 01:59:34,404
Kretz.

1406
01:59:35,574 --> 01:59:35,734
Ms.

1407
01:59:35,754 --> 01:59:40,080
Mustone, a Roberts announcement?

1408
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:40,661
Yes, please.

1409
01:59:40,681 --> 01:59:41,041
On an event?

1410
01:59:41,121 --> 01:59:41,582
Thank you.

1411
01:59:41,642 --> 01:59:42,082
Big event.

1412
01:59:44,584 --> 01:59:45,785
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1413
01:59:45,885 --> 01:59:48,487
I live at 281 Park Street, and Ms.

1414
01:59:48,507 --> 01:59:54,352
Caldwell mentioned that we are applying for several grants this year for different enrichment for the students.

1415
01:59:54,612 --> 02:00:05,661
Those grants don't usually cover the entire event, so this Saturday from 9 to 3, the Roberts Elementary School will be holding a yard sale to try to cover the cost of the rest of these events.

1416
02:00:06,678 --> 02:00:14,283
It's estimated now that we have three U-Hauls worth of items, and every dollar that we raise will go directly to enrichment for our nearly 600 students.

1417
02:00:14,343 --> 02:00:16,985
So if anyone can come, we're right down on Park Street.

1418
02:00:17,265 --> 02:00:17,926
What was the time?

1419
02:00:18,306 --> 02:00:20,147
It's from 9 to 3 this Saturday.

1420
02:00:20,587 --> 02:00:21,328
Thank you, Cheryl.

1421
02:00:22,449 --> 02:00:23,729
I saw a lot of it on our porch.

1422
02:00:23,809 --> 02:00:24,410
It all looks good.

1423
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:25,691
Thank you.

1424
02:00:26,751 --> 02:00:26,911
Ms.

1425
02:00:26,951 --> 02:00:27,432
Vander Kloot.

1426
02:00:27,572 --> 02:00:29,133
While we're under suspension, I also just

1427
02:00:29,563 --> 02:00:40,163
In our packet, we received a reminder that our next meeting will be on October 24th at the superintendent's conference room to discuss the capital plan and it will begin at 6.30.

1428
02:00:42,328 --> 02:00:42,688
Very good.

1429
02:00:43,028 --> 02:00:46,651
And also this Sunday is Medford Day, 1 to 4 behind the Andrews School.

1430
02:00:46,711 --> 02:00:59,158
There will be musical entertainment, kids activities, adult entertainment, charitable organizations will be there with various informational and or activities for everyone.

1431
02:00:59,238 --> 02:01:00,980
So please come on down to the Andrews School.

1432
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,460
Medford Day.

1433
02:01:03,955 --> 02:01:04,355
Shout out.

1434
02:01:04,496 --> 02:01:05,737
There are so many.

1435
02:01:05,797 --> 02:01:12,983
I mean, if you look at our packets, you'll see that if you're looking for anything in the city of Medford, we definitely offer a lot.

1436
02:01:13,043 --> 02:01:18,307
So if you're looking for something every night, every day, or even two, three times a day, we have an event to go to.

1437
02:01:18,768 --> 02:01:22,951
But one of the events I do want to give a shout out to, and that is the Kiwanis.

1438
02:01:23,332 --> 02:01:28,136
They are doing their Taste of Italy at the high school Wednesday night, this Wednesday night from six to nine.

1439
02:01:29,236 --> 02:01:34,999
Tickets are $40, everyone is welcome, and because the money that's raised there actually does benefit our students.

1440
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:43,163
They receive scholarships from the Kiwanis and they have been very generous over the years, not only for scholarships, but for other things that they've given to our school system.

1441
02:01:43,263 --> 02:01:45,784
Great food, great entertainment.

1442
02:01:45,804 --> 02:01:46,725
Yep, everything.

1443
02:01:48,066 --> 02:01:48,666
Great charity.

1444
02:01:50,967 --> 02:01:51,547
In the foyer.

1445
02:01:51,647 --> 02:01:52,808
In the foyer, the lobby.

1446
02:01:54,856 --> 02:02:02,600
is that it's also the National Honor Society Information Night, which is 6.30 to 7.30 in the Karen Theater.

1447
02:02:03,261 --> 02:02:03,981
That's been moved.

1448
02:02:04,541 --> 02:02:09,644
It's been moved up to the Science Lab and with appropriate arrangements so that the youngsters can come and go freely.

1449
02:02:10,004 --> 02:02:11,405
Okay, that makes much more sense.

1450
02:02:11,705 --> 02:02:12,466
Great, thank you.

1451
02:02:12,806 --> 02:02:21,751
I just might also announce, if I can, Madam Mayor, that tomorrow at noontime, the Medford High School Band will be playing at the Science Museum

1452
02:02:22,798 --> 02:02:26,181
for a special announcement from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

1453
02:02:26,361 --> 02:02:27,141
And Medford resident.

1454
02:02:27,201 --> 02:02:32,485
And Medford resident, who I believe will be making a major presentation to the Science Museum.

1455
02:02:32,505 --> 02:02:34,086
Great.

1456
02:02:34,687 --> 02:02:39,050
Motion to revert to the regular order of business, which is item six, negotiations in legal matters.

1457
02:02:39,070 --> 02:02:42,292
We, there were a motion to go into executive session, offered by Ms.

1458
02:02:42,392 --> 02:02:43,493
Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

1459
02:02:43,533 --> 02:02:43,973
Cuno, Ms.

1460
02:02:43,993 --> 02:02:44,293
Disceri.

1461
02:02:44,313 --> 02:02:44,353
Ms.

1462
02:02:44,373 --> 02:02:44,573
Cuno.

1463
02:02:44,634 --> 02:02:44,734
Yes.

1464
02:02:52,152 --> 02:02:54,058
Yes, seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

1465
02:02:54,098 --> 02:02:55,943
We will now go into executive session.
