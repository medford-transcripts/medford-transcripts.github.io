And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:46,004
All right, thank you both for being with me tonight.

10
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:48,228
We're going to start with some introductions.

11
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,693
So saying your name, your pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:55,592
Okay.

13
00:00:55,972 --> 00:01:00,533
Um, I am cyan McDormand and my pronouns are they, them there.

14
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:05,174
And I was on the Medford pride planning committee last year and I really enjoyed it.

15
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:11,635
Um, I was interested in kind of getting involved in, um, some LGBTQ stuff and the.

16
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:17,537
Uh, application came out and I thought that would be a good opportunity to kind of, you know, contribute to the city.

17
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:21,878
And also I was like really excited about the fact that we were going to start having pride stuff here.

18
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,758
So thank you.

19
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:30,140
And my name is Michael Lowe, they, them pronouns.

20
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:43,750
I also, this is my second year being on the PRIDE committee, excited to be part of it as, you know, I run a little queer art collective out of Medford.

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:52,015
So it's exciting to be, you know, again, helping out plan all of the cool queer stuff in the city I live in.

22
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:54,417
So yeah, excited to get going with it.

23
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:56,068
Thank you both.

24
00:01:56,108 --> 00:02:01,110
Yeah, so I think tonight we're going to hopefully talk a little bit about how last year went and what to expect from this year.

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:10,873
But before we do that, I'm going to ask you the same question that you answered last year, but also that we ask everyone, which is what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

26
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:18,488
So I will go with four pizza in Medford Square.

27
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:26,633
I'm a vegan and there's actually, I'm sorry, there's not a lot of vegan options in Medford, but they do have plant-based pizzas there.

28
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:30,536
And I like to build my own with like banana peppers and spinach and garlic and stuff like that.

29
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:31,356
And they do a good job.

30
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,238
So, and it's walking distance from my house, so.

31
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:36,400
All good things.

32
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,323
For me, I think I gave the same answer last year, but it is

33
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,501
It's still the same.

34
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:44,703
Zamzam also in Medford Square.

35
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,385
Really astounding Pakistani food.

36
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:50,526
I believe it's Pakistani food.

37
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:53,067
I don't know.

38
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:54,668
The quality is always great.

39
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:56,850
The helpings are always enormous.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,291
I can never say enough good stuff about them.

41
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,011
It's always delicious.

42
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:02,811
you.

43
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,132
Yeah, we like their samosas down there too.

44
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:06,993
All right.

45
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:07,634
So, yeah.

46
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:19,680
So, last year was our first kind of like major like city-sponsored pride events and we all, you know, some of us talked last year about how that went or what to expect and I actually had a great time.

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,440
I was able to go to the flag raising.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,642
I brought my older son who was I think like six at the time.

49
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,604
We really enjoyed like, you know, hearing the speeches and

50
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:32,670
just kind of being with lots of other folks, celebrating pride.

51
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:39,940
We also went to the, well my son didn't come to this, but some other adults and I went to the drag show at Carol's, which was awesome.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,767
Like I think I was expecting it to be great, but I wasn't expecting it to be that great, and we had a really, really good time.

53
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:50,910
Um, I wasn't able to make it to the event at the Andrews, but, um, I did hear it was very hot.

54
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,470
So, uh, you know, thank you for putting those things on.

55
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,530
It was, it was great.

56
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:05,914
And it was like, it just felt really nice to have, I felt, I think kind of emotional about it last year, just being able to have those events really like recognize and organize and honored by the city.

57
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,754
It was a really great feeling.

58
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:11,295
And so, um, I'm wondering what, if you all have any reflections about last year.

59
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,899
Sure, I guess I can go first.

60
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,500
I had a really good time.

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,782
For me, the highlight was actually the drag show as well.

62
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:27,844
I particularly like drag, and I was kind of instrumental in trying to push us to have a drag show.

63
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,126
I wanted to have kind of an adult's event.

64
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,068
And I thought it went really well.

65
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:40,552
I was not really sure what to expect, honestly, because I didn't really know the drag performers who were coming.

66
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:46,353
And I wasn't sure who would be willing to come to Medford, and I wasn't sure how it would work in a restaurant in Medford.

67
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,514
And I was kind of expecting it to be a little bit of a hot mess.

68
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:52,954
But actually, the performers were very good.

69
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,335
I think there were, like, seven or eight.

70
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:57,955
I originally thought we'd have, like, three or four.

71
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,456
But there was a good amount of performers.

72
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:05,897
They all showed up on time, which is kind of nice for Drenica.

73
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:06,837
They were all there.

74
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:11,860
I bought them some drinks, and they were super nice.

75
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,982
I talked to them, and they put on an amazing show for everyone.

76
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,583
And people came out.

77
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:17,304
People came out.

78
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,265
It was very exciting.

79
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:20,046
It wasn't empty.

80
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,407
It was pretty full.

81
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:25,170
And I think people were very excited, the crowds.

82
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,372
Overall, I had a really good experience with that.

83
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:29,574
The other events were good, too.

84
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:33,197
We did do a lot of events, so it felt like a lot of work.

85
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:40,282
And so I think that's part of the reason why, well, I know that's part of the reason why we decided to narrow in a little bit on doing fewer events this year.

86
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,885
But I thought that the pride flag raising was like pretty emotional for me as well.

87
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:49,229
Like it just really felt kind of amazing for the city to be doing something.

88
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:54,893
And one of the things that struck me about that event was that Chief Buckley walked down a drag queen down the aisle.

89
00:05:55,994 --> 00:06:02,462
And I just never expected to see like the police chief of my city, hand in hand or arm in arm with a with a drag queen.

90
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,945
So that was really, really sweet.

91
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:12,595
And I thought she gave a nice speech and Reverend Wendy gave a really nice speech and Terry Carter gave a great poem and there was a lot of really great

92
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,482
words on the flag raising day.

93
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,724
And I also enjoyed the other events.

94
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:27,651
But the last day, the last event, the community event, was very, very hot, which was a little bit of a problem.

95
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,812
And people didn't stay super long for that.

96
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:34,877
So that was logistically difficult with the heat and stuff.

97
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:39,720
But there were some good bands and some booths with stuff.

98
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,882
But yeah, overall, I had a great time.

99
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:45,303
I thought it was great, pretty amazing success for the first year.

100
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:52,546
Hoping to focus in and do a few fewer events and even bigger success this year.

101
00:06:52,566 --> 00:07:01,930
Yeah, so I would say, gosh, I mean, the Dragon Show is kind of hard to beat.

102
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:06,913
It probably was our best event last year in terms of just

103
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,553
you know, how many people showed up, just how well it went.

104
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:17,385
I don't think any of the other events went poorly, per se, but definitely the best, you know, highest attendance right there.

105
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:26,557
I had a lot of fun, and I know I am the one who ran it, so I'll tout it, but the art show, well, very low attendance.

106
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:42,850
We got to meet an amazing musician named Miles, and they will be joining us again this year, actually, which I'm excited about, at the flag raising to supply some nice ambient music of their own creation.

107
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,252
So, yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,621
Yeah and I'm remembering though at City Hall they had the like the letters up that spelled out Medford Pride or Pride.

109
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:58,322
I forgot about that part that we all got a picture after the flag raising that was like pretty cool.

110
00:07:59,082 --> 00:07:59,923
Yeah Pride 02155.

111
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,743
Yeah that's what it was.

112
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:08,464
Yeah and there's that one's going to be going up again this year on I think on the first or sometime soon after.

113
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,965
Yeah the local GSA

114
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:17,449
Provided that oh and I forgot to mention that the other one another big another success.

115
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:31,021
We had was the teen night So we had a teen skate night last year Partnered with the GSA and they I think they had a really good time a lot of kids who came out so and the police were there to give us protection and and and to

116
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:35,464
And we had the DPW and the police were there.

117
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:39,406
The DPWs marked everything off for us and helped set up the stuff.

118
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:42,448
And Michael's friends were doing DJing.

119
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,449
And it was a good time as well.

120
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,012
The DJ at the drag show was also great, I thought.

121
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:50,212
It was a good time.

122
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:53,614
Yeah, that was my partner, Giovanna.

123
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:55,695
Oh, nice.

124
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:56,836
Great.

125
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,537
Yeah, I remember.

126
00:08:58,557 --> 00:08:59,958
DJ, right, Michael, for both?

127
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:14,550
Both her and our other friend, Abby, who is stepping away from music for a while, but both of them DJ'd as a pair for both events.

128
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:24,292
I remember talking to the mayor at the drag show and she was really excited that people had come from Somerville to Medford for this event.

129
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,212
That seems like a big point of pride.

130
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,313
I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what we can expect for this year.

131
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,491
Yeah, I can jump in on that.

132
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:46,474
So for this year, we are scaling it down a little bit so we can focus and make the events as good as they can be, basically.

133
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:50,435
We're still going to have the flag-raising event on the 1st, of course.

134
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,675
We're still going to have some good speakers.

135
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:58,837
And like I just said, Miles is going to be joining us to give us some nice ambient music.

136
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:11,045
And then our other large event is going to be the Community Pride Day event, which will be on the 25th, the last Sunday of June.

137
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:15,348
And that is going to be at City Hall this year, which is super exciting.

138
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:17,750
We're going to have vendors.

139
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:25,635
We're going to have a bunch of informational booths as well for local queer organizations, you know, events.

140
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:28,497
Basically, we're going to have stuff for all ages at this event.

141
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:38,082
and hopefully we'll have a couple or a few drag performers there as well to kind of hype people up and give a good show.

142
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:48,562
And then we're planning on having a handful of musicians and or bands playing throughout the day, throughout the event.

143
00:10:49,422 --> 00:11:02,046
And then right after that, we're going to be, courtesy of the vault, we're going to be having a little after party with another drag show like we did last year, but hopefully bigger and better.

144
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,193
Yeah, so just to add on to that, both events are at 4 p.m.

145
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:15,634
June 1st is the flag raising at 4 p.m., and June 25th is the community event at 4 p.m.

146
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:30,497
We are personally working on specifically the flag raising and the community event, and we're gonna be cross-promoting and helping to advertise other events.

147
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:33,758
Like, the Vault event isn't really specifically

148
00:11:34,918 --> 00:12:02,718
planned by the pride committee but we're helping to like give some resources uh you know connections to drag performers and stuff to that um the person who wants to run that and then we're also going to give resources to other people if they if they want to run things so like we reached out to the gsa if they want to plan something we're going to try and help them out um with that as well but the plan the planning committee itself is really doing those two events um and then there's a series of other events that will be happening as well so there's like an interfaith um

149
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,262
interfaith prayer celebration thing on the first as well, I think it's around 7 30.

150
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:17,688
We will put up, we'll put up calendars and stuff on our, our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds for that information as well.

151
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:24,112
And there's also like a few shows at the Chevalier and there's like an LGBTQ book club at the library.

152
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:30,656
So there'll be other pride events in Medford in June, but the main two that we're doing on the first and the 25th at 4pm.

153
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:39,893
But yeah, you guys are really busy last year, so it's kind of focusing on these main two events and kind of promoting the other other events that maybe you aren't planning like.

154
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,393
golden girls of the Chevalier.

155
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:49,537
It sounds like the Ford is going to be having a drag bingo sometime in June as well.

156
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:53,459
I believe that's actually on the first as well at 9am.

157
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:54,579
Great.

158
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,483
Anything else that you think is important for people to know in terms of getting involved?

159
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:04,965
Are there volunteers involved or anything like that?

160
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:15,949
I think the important thing to know is that the city of Medford is really trying to evolve and grow.

161
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:25,753
And there really is a strong focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which helped with the hiring of the new diversity, equity, and inclusion director.

162
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:30,875
I think there was one before, but I feel like she's ramped things up a little bit.

163
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:38,080
that the city of Medford cares enough to have a committee for planning pride.

164
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:46,987
I just really appreciate, and I think people should be aware that Medford is a welcoming city, and Medford has LGBTQ people here.

165
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,689
We've always had LGBTQ people here.

166
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,071
But the acceptance, I think, is growing.

167
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,815
I felt like when I moved here back in 2007, it was a pretty tolerant place.

168
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:59,216
I wasn't getting hassled regularly or anything.

169
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:07,964
Um, but I feel like it's moving, it's moved a lot more towards a welcoming place now where it's actually, you know, not just tolerated, but kind of celebrated.

170
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:10,446
And it's like, it's, it's, it's fine.

171
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:11,507
It's, and it's good.

172
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:13,949
You know, if you're LGBTQ, that's fine.

173
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:15,510
If you're not, that's also fine.

174
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:20,014
Like we have stuff going on here and this is a place where you can be.

175
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:26,860
And, um, and I just, you know, would invite people to try to come if they can make it to any or all of our events.

176
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:27,981
Yeah.

177
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:33,630
I think and also so you two are two members of the pride planning committee.

178
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,311
Do you want to mention other folks that are involved or kind of what the planning committee does?

179
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:45,255
Jacqueline is our newest member and then we have a bunch of people returning from last year.

180
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:54,012
So Francis, Jacqueline, Sian, Michael, Merland, Paul is returning from last year.

181
00:14:54,212 --> 00:15:01,518
And Joan is exciting because we had Joan on the list, but Joan was completely unable to make it in April.

182
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:09,264
And Joan came in like a roaring race car this week, and she's back, and she's planning stuff, and she's making calendars, and she's reaching out.

183
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:11,305
So I'm very happy to have Joan back.

184
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,608
So yeah, we're pretty much a superstar team.

185
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,952
Was there anyone I missed, Michael, on the list of names?

186
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,659
Now that you actually listed them out, no, that is everybody.

187
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:28,611
Yeah, we did actually have a guest from the junior high, I think junior high last year.

188
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:34,896
And she was a great consultant for helping us kind of reach out to the GSA and stuff.

189
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:37,778
And unfortunately, she wasn't able to make it again this year.

190
00:15:38,598 --> 00:15:43,081
So we do have Frances reaching out to the GSA to see if they want to plan something.

191
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:50,086
But we don't have a particular, I guess she was kind of like an honorary member, but that's one difference from last year.

192
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:53,093
Awesome.

193
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,255
Well, anything else you want to mention before we wrap up?

194
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,859
I guess just that I'm excited.

195
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:21,413
I'm excited for the fact that we were actually able to get together and do this a second year and hopefully, you know, I'm excited to be a part of it or even if I'm not in the future, you know, or any of us that it just continues and will, you know, continue to grow and, you know, grow larger visibility for the queer community and

196
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:34,423
You know, I just hope we can make something big and cool out of this over the next five years, the next decade, however long we're able to, you know, just exciting to be exciting to see this happening, you know, growing.

197
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:38,907
Yeah, it's exciting that it's a series now.

198
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,829
This is the second one.

199
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:47,216
So now we have something to refer back to, and I think we can just keep growing it and making it better every year.

200
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:57,767
And I think we've already been talking about it, but I think with some of the new businesses that are opening in Medford, we're hoping that there'll be opportunities and that some of these businesses are gonna wanna like,

201
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,452
you know, maybe start doing things like that's exciting that there's a drag bingo.

202
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,393
And I guess maybe that's not even the first one.

203
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:06,275
And hopefully, there'll be more of those.

204
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:14,583
And maybe there'll be some other drag shows that are happening or other queer nights or events that are happening, you know, on a more regular basis, not just in June.

205
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:22,055
Yeah, there's so many kind of like community events in June that like, you know, we have like Circle the Square, Clippership Day, like that.

206
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:25,556
My hope is that like eventually this is just a normal thing that's in the rotation.

207
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:33,519
Like last week of June, we'd have our pride celebration or like, you know, that it sort of becomes just this like normalized community event that everybody looks forward to.

208
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,579
But I think we're on our way there.

209
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,099
It sounds like.

210
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,760
Yeah.

211
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:41,914
Well, thank you both so much.

212
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:45,476
I can't wait for the events, and I think they're going to be great.

213
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:47,857
Yeah, thank you.

214
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,259
We're not done yet, folks.

215
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:58,102
We have some more bonus content from Reverend Wendy about her summer program, AM to PM for Medford youth.

216
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:02,805
All right, thanks for joining us today.

217
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,947
If you could just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

218
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:08,863
Great, thank you.

219
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,985
Thank you so much for having me on.

220
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:27,904
Again, we did this once before, Danielle my name is Wendy Miller all up on and the pastor of Sanctuary United Church of Christ that partners with the hillside community church over in the hillside neighborhood to make love and justice real in Medford, and I am.

221
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,814
she, hers, identified, soul.

222
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,696
Is that it for that?

223
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:35,557
Yeah.

224
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,440
I've been a pastor in Medford for 10 years now.

225
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,401
It's been 10 years.

226
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:43,663
It's the longest I've ever been a pastor in a community.

227
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,825
I love Medford.

228
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:47,486
I'm an activist.

229
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:56,594
Again, somebody who cares about making love and justice real and change in things, change in the world.

230
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,035
That's a little bit about me.

231
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:02,033
Thank you, Andy, and I think those themes will come up and what we're gonna talk about today.

232
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:05,234
But first, if you could answer our favorite question.

233
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:09,235
So what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

234
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:16,017
You know, I'm having a tough time with this question and I even gave it a little thought because I

235
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:33,360
I have a very narrow food place, but I'll name one of my family's favorite places, which is, and actually it might be in Somerville, but we love Ball Square Cafe.

236
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:39,445
Ball Square sits in both communities, so I'll claim it as Medford's.

237
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:42,908
We love Ball Square Cafe as a family, my sons and I.

238
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,034
Well, actually, also, you know what?

239
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,294
Tasty on the Hill.

240
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:49,035
Tasty on the Hill is one of my favorites, too.

241
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,976
And it's a great, inexpensive burger that I love.

242
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:55,718
So I'll claim Tasty on the Hill right now, so.

243
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:59,079
Sounds like you've taken a side in the ball square sound bites.

244
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,840
I have.

245
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,840
I totally have taken a side.

246
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:03,701
Good to know.

247
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,402
Mike treats me like royalty when I come in.

248
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:08,508
Thank you.

249
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:14,374
So if you could tell us, I know you're here to promote a program that you're running for the summer for some youth.

250
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,796
So if you could tell us a little bit about what that program is.

251
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,658
Yeah, thank you so much.

252
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:27,085
And thanks for making space for this, because we really want to let people know, particularly, there's a couple of markets of families that we want to try to get at.

253
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,087
I'll say a word about that later.

254
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:34,292
But we have for years held this AM to PM youth

255
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:43,218
community service program, and the AM2PM is such a silly name, but it stands for Working from Morning to Night to Save the World, right?

256
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,959
That's what the AM2PM comes from.

257
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:56,828
But we have been operating this for years, and then the pandemic sort of put a hold on it because, you know, gathering and taking kids out into the community to do community service was tough to organize for the last couple of years.

258
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:02,950
But we're back and we're back with a kind of a new vision that we're so excited about.

259
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:19,995
We are holding a high school youth leadership and community service development program for a week where we teach high school youth, not only will they get the 60 hours of community service that they need for graduation,

260
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:30,597
but they'll have the opportunity to become a paid peer mentor for a middle school program that we will then run after the July 4th weekend.

261
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:44,979
So it's an opportunity to both get leadership and life skills, to get some experience in the world serving others, to learn about the systems that are creating the need for volunteerism.

262
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,520
So why are people hungry?

263
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,661
Why are they homeless?

264
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:54,886
Why is there injustice around race and LBGTQIA issues?

265
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,688
Why is the environment crumbling?

266
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:14,182
So we're going to teach them about what's undergirding the need for volunteerism, give them a chance to reflect on it in a circle of peers, but then also give them the kind of leadership and like mental health first aid support.

267
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:21,849
So we're going to give them some skills that they can then become paid stipend mentors to middle schoolers.

268
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:23,390
So it's just a great opportunity.

269
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,672
Then the middle school kids will get similar

270
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:45,480
kinds of experiences, a little bit more about the service and the reflection, but still some life skills, you know, CPR and some mini reflection on how to be a good friend of somebody who can help a friend who's in trouble, how to get access to the resources that they need to support each other.

271
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,562
So, really just love the way this has unfolded to be sort of a multi-layered

272
00:22:52,087 --> 00:23:01,974
You know, you're going to connect not only with each other, but with adults who care for you, with community organizations that are in the business of caring for others.

273
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:17,566
So it's really about this sort of circle of care and connection that we hope, we know, we know will make a difference in kids' lives and give them, empower them to know that they too can make a difference in the world.

274
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:19,734
I love that.

275
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:26,296
I love this sort of concentric nature of me in my community that has been built into this format.

276
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:26,756
Beautiful.

277
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:31,018
Can you speak to possibly the ideal candidate for this program?

278
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:32,598
Like what folks should apply?

279
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,358
Right?

280
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,499
That's a great way to answer that question.

281
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:43,341
I mean, I think we are looking for high school kids that have a sense of call to this kind of pair of others.

282
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:48,203
Not that they have to have that experience, but that leadership and being a peer

283
00:23:48,683 --> 00:24:03,473
being somebody who's going to show up for another would be the ideal high school candidate part of the other, the other piece of the vision that I haven't even talked about yet is that we intend for this to be a year round program so while there'll be a summer camp.

284
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:17,227
aspect to it, we are looking for kids who are willing to be a part of this for the rest of the year, so we'll build in some quarterly opportunities to go out and do something in the community of service.

285
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:27,157
try to get those peer high school peers to stay attached to the middle school kids to help them with their transition into high school those kinds of things so.

286
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:37,821
We are looking for high school kids that have a sense of wanting to make a commitment, but also to invest themselves in their community and each other.

287
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:46,724
In the case of the middle school kids, I think also just being able to make the commitment for a couple of weeks to be a part of it.

288
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:50,506
We are specifically as well, Shelley,

289
00:24:51,346 --> 00:25:07,073
looking to reach into the communities that are historically underrepresented, historically harmed by racism and cisgendered, homophobic kinds of things.

290
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:17,017
We really want to try to connect with families that don't have this opportunity, whether that's because of their economic status or they're just

291
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:20,700
our conditions, excuse me, their economic conditions.

292
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:29,630
You know, as I said to you guys when we were gathering, I think there's a lot of families in Medford who already know what's happening for their kids this summer.

293
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,675
They have the resources to send their kid to a summer camp, but there are a lot of families that don't.

294
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:38,279
And so we've been really deliberate about hiring leadership.

295
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:48,968
to run the program from communities of color and LBGTQIA community, and those are kids that we really want to offer the scholarship.

296
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:50,148
We have scholarship money.

297
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,610
We have money to pay these stipends.

298
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,714
We want to give this opportunity to kids that don't typically have access to it.

299
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:00,997
Thank you, Wendy.

300
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,057
It sounds incredible.

301
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:05,180
Could you tell us a little bit about how to apply for this program?

302
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:06,725
Yes, thank you.

303
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:09,946
So you can go to the Sanctuary UCC website.

304
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:17,789
Right at the top, there's a dropdown that says what's on and you'll see the AM to PM program.

305
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:22,831
But probably if you just Google AM to PM youth, you'll find a link to it.

306
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:29,173
But the web address is sanctuaryucc.org slash AM to PM.

307
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:31,874
And that'll get you right to the page.

308
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,435
All the details are there.

309
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:38,879
It'll give you a sense of what the kids would be doing during the weeks that they would be participating.

310
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:41,360
There's a button to apply.

311
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:50,586
And then there's a nice FAQ for moms and dads and other parents to take a look at any questions that they might have.

312
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:51,707
And of course, the

313
00:26:51,847 --> 00:27:04,356
program director whose name is Kashana Harling is available as am I and as is Tom Hathaway, my colleague in this work to answer any questions.

314
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:13,523
So the program is listed with a cost, but again, we're offering full pay, partial pay and full scholarship options.

315
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:19,527
We do have the resources to be able to offer it to anybody who's looking to have this experience.

316
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:23,207
Thank you, Wendy.

317
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:24,829
And is there a deadline for applying?

318
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:29,031
Well, we currently are listing a June 1st deadline.

319
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:39,378
The program doesn't begin until the last week of June, and so we may end up with a little bit of flexibility about that as we see how the applications come through.

320
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:49,626
So we have 15 slots in each of the opportunities, and so 45 kids will have the chance to do this, and yeah.

321
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:51,507
Well, that sounds great.

322
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:56,238
Amazing dear young people apply this sounds like an incredible opportunity.

323
00:27:56,258 --> 00:28:10,212
yeah we're going to have some fun, I mean I mean I didn't say anything about the experiences, but you know, not only will they have a chance to go and meet some unhoused friends, you know who and serve.

324
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:19,979
food and sit and eat with them, but we have a day at the Wright Lock Farm where they'll get a chance to learn about, you know, organic farming and the environment.

325
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:25,662
We usually go out and clean up some invasive species in the river.

326
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:29,505
We will do some work with the NAACP.

327
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:33,268
So really a smattering of experiences

328
00:28:34,197 --> 00:28:44,639
potentially a trip into Boston to the African American History Museum in Boston.

329
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,861
And then there'll be film and there'll be discussion and there'll be lots of fun too.

330
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:54,742
We'll be sure to have some fun and lots of great food.

331
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,678
I mean, I want to go.

332
00:28:57,858 --> 00:28:58,958
This sounds awesome.

333
00:28:59,019 --> 00:28:59,619
Well, we're out.

334
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,620
By the way, we're looking for volunteers.

335
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:08,865
So we got space for volunteers and always, of course, opportunities for people to make donations.

336
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:19,632
So if this charges you up as you've listened to this podcast and you want to help, also that same email, that same address, sanctuaryucc.org slash am2pm.

337
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:21,693
There's a donate button there.

338
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:22,734
You want to volunteer.

339
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,616
We're loving, we're looking for people to help out.

340
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:37,019
We have plenty of adults that will support both the emotional well-being as well as the physical experience of moving those kids around and going in different directions.

341
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,540
Awesome.

342
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,141
Thank you so much, Reverend Wendy.

343
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,341
Thank you.

344
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:47,763
Thank you for asking and letting me brag a little bit about this amazing vision.

345
00:29:47,803 --> 00:29:49,023
We're really excited about it.

346
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,024
Thank you and good luck.

347
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:51,744
I hope it goes well.

348
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:53,585
I know it will.

349
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:56,093
Thank you.

350
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:58,009
The big guys in charge of that.

351
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:09,005
Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.
