    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=135.045">So</a>  I will go with four pizza in Medford Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=139.248">I'm</a>  a vegan and there's actually, I'm sorry, there's not a lot of vegan options in Medford, but they do have plant-based pizzas there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=147.073">And</a>  I like to build my own with like banana peppers and spinach and garlic and stuff like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=150.576">And</a>  they do a good job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=152.237">So,</a>  and it's walking distance from my house, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=155.859">All</a>  good things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=158.041">For</a>  me, I think I gave the same answer last year, but it is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=161.761">It's</a>  still the same. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=162.822">Zamzam</a>  also in Medford Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=165.583">Really</a>  astounding Pakistani food. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=169.145">I</a>  believe it's Pakistani food. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=171.186">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=173.127">The</a>  quality is always great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=174.748">The</a>  helpings are always enormous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=177.91">I</a>  can never say enough good stuff about them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=179.331">It's</a>  always delicious.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=182.691">you.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=183.411">Yeah,</a>  we like their samosas down there too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=185.773">All</a>  right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=187.093">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=187.654">So,</a>  last year was our first kind of like major like city-sponsored pride events and we all, you know, some of us talked last year about how that went or what to expect and I actually had a great time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=199.72">I</a>  was able to go to the flag raising. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=201.48">I</a>  brought my older son who was I think like six at the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=204.662">We</a>  really enjoyed like, you know, hearing the speeches and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=208.964">just</a>  kind of being with lots of other folks, celebrating pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=213.391">We</a>  also went to the, well my son didn't come to this, but some other adults and I went to the drag show at Carol's, which was awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=219.96">Like</a>  I think I was expecting it to be great, but I wasn't expecting it to be that great, and we had a really, really good time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=225.508">Um,</a>  I wasn't able to make it to the event at the Andrews, but, um, I did hear it was very hot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=230.99">So,</a>  uh, you know, thank you for putting those things on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=233.49">It</a>  was, it was great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=234.55">And</a>  it was like, it just felt really nice to have, I felt, I think kind of emotional about it last year, just being able to have those events really like recognize and organize and honored by the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=245.934">It</a>  was a really great feeling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=247.794">And</a>  so, um, I'm wondering what, if you all have any reflections about last year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=255.037">Sure,</a>  I guess I can go first. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=258.279">I</a>  had a really good time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=260.44">For</a>  me, the highlight was actually the drag show as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=263.682">I</a>  particularly like drag, and I was kind of instrumental in trying to push us to have a drag show. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=268.785">I</a>  wanted to have kind of an adult's event. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=272.367">And</a>  I thought it went really well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=274.468">I</a>  was not really sure what to expect, honestly, because I didn't really know the drag performers who were coming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=281.292">And</a>  I wasn't sure who would be willing to come to Medford, and I wasn't sure how it would work in a restaurant in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=286.833">And</a>  I was kind of expecting it to be a little bit of a hot mess. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=290.354">But</a>  actually, the performers were very good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=292.974">I</a>  think there were, like, seven or eight. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=295.535">I</a>  originally thought we'd have, like, three or four. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=299.335">But</a>  there was a good amount of performers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=302.516">They</a>  all showed up on time, which is kind of nice for Drenica. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=306.097">They</a>  were all there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=309.057">I</a>  bought them some drinks, and they were super nice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=311.92">I</a>  talked to them, and they put on an amazing show for everyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=315.022">And</a>  people came out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=316.764">People</a>  came out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=317.384">It</a>  was very exciting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=319.226">It</a>  wasn't empty. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=320.066">It</a>  was pretty full. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=322.528">And</a>  I think people were very excited, the crowds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=325.23">Overall,</a>  I had a really good experience with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=328.353">The</a>  other events were good, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=330.295">We</a>  did do a lot of events, so it felt like a lot of work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=334.158">And</a>  so I think that's part of the reason why, well, I know that's part of the reason why we decided to narrow in a little bit on doing fewer events this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=341.383">But</a>  I thought that the pride flag raising was like pretty emotional for me as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=344.945">Like</a>  it just really felt kind of amazing for the city to be doing something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=349.409">And</a>  one of the things that struck me about that event was that Chief Buckley walked down a drag queen down the aisle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=355.994">And</a>  I just never expected to see like the police chief of my city, hand in hand or arm in arm with a with a drag queen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=363.263">So</a>  that was really, really sweet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=364.966">And</a>  I thought she gave a nice speech and Reverend Wendy gave a really nice speech and Terry Carter gave a great poem and there was a lot of really great <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=374.52">words</a>  on the flag raising day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=377.583">And</a>  I also enjoyed the other events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=380.605">But</a>  the last day, the last event, the community event, was very, very hot, which was a little bit of a problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=387.711">And</a>  people didn't stay super long for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=389.892">So</a>  that was logistically difficult with the heat and stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=394.937">But</a>  there were some good bands and some booths with stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=400.501">But</a>  yeah, overall, I had a great time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=401.942">I</a>  thought it was great, pretty amazing success for the first year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=406.244">Hoping</a>  to focus in and do a few fewer events and even bigger success this year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=412.566">Yeah,</a>  so I would say, gosh, I mean, the Dragon Show is kind of hard to beat. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=422.231">It</a>  probably was our best event last year in terms of just <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=427.788">you</a>  know, how many people showed up, just how well it went. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=430.573">I</a>  don't think any of the other events went poorly, per se, but definitely the best, you know, highest attendance right there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=439.412">I</a>  had a lot of fun, and I know I am the one who ran it, so I'll tout it, but the art show, well, very low attendance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=446.597">We</a>  got to meet an amazing musician named Miles, and they will be joining us again this year, actually, which I'm excited about, at the flag raising to supply some nice ambient music of their own creation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=462.91">So,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=467.24">Yeah</a>  and I'm remembering though at City Hall they had the like the letters up that spelled out Medford Pride or Pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=473.641">I</a>  forgot about that part that we all got a picture after the flag raising that was like pretty cool.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=479.082">Yeah</a>  Pride 02155. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=479.963">Yeah</a>  that's what it was.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=481.803">Yeah</a>  and there's that one's going to be going up again this year on I think on the first or sometime soon after.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=489.124">Yeah</a>  the local GSA <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=492.405">Provided</a>  that oh and I forgot to mention that the other one another big another success. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=497.489">We</a>  had was the teen night So we had a teen skate night last year Partnered with the GSA and they I think they had a really good time a lot of kids who came out so and the police were there to give us protection and and and to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=512.102">And</a>  we had the DPW and the police were there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=515.504">The</a>  DPWs marked everything off for us and helped set up the stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=519.506">And</a>  Michael's friends were doing DJing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=522.608">And</a>  it was a good time as well.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=525.55">The</a>  DJ at the drag show was also great, I thought.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=529.412">It</a>  was a good time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=530.272">Yeah,</a>  that was my partner, Giovanna. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=533.814">Oh,</a>  nice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=536.576">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=542.447">Both</a>  her and our other friend, Abby, who is stepping away from music for a while, but both of them DJ'd as a pair for both events.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=556.91">I</a>  remember talking to the mayor at the drag show and she was really excited that people had come from Somerville to Medford for this event. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=564.912">That</a>  seems like a big point of pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=566.832">I'm</a>  wondering if you could talk a little bit about what we can expect for this year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=574.271">Yeah,</a>  I can jump in on that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=576.652">So</a>  for this year, we are scaling it down a little bit so we can focus and make the events as good as they can be, basically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=587.114">We're</a>  still going to have the flag-raising event on the 1st, of course. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=590.535">We're</a>  still going to have some good speakers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=592.775">And</a>  like I just said, Miles is going to be joining us to give us some nice ambient music. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=600.657">And</a>  then our other large event is going to be the Community Pride Day event, which will be on the 25th, the last Sunday of June. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=612.386">And</a>  that is going to be at City Hall this year, which is super exciting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=616.068">We're</a>  going to have vendors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=618.05">We're</a>  going to have a bunch of informational booths as well for local queer organizations, you know, events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=625.655">Basically,</a>  we're going to have stuff for all ages at this event. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=630.712">and</a>  hopefully we'll have a couple or a few drag performers there as well to kind of hype people up and give a good show. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=640.479">And</a>  then we're planning on having a handful of musicians and or bands playing throughout the day, throughout the event. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=649.422">And</a>  then right after that, we're going to be, courtesy of the vault, we're going to be having a little after party with another drag show like we did last year, but hopefully bigger and better.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=665.112">Yeah,</a>  so just to add on to that, both events are at 4 p.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=668.893">June</a>  1st is the flag raising at 4 p.m., and June 25th is the community event at 4 p.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=676.434">We</a>  are personally working on specifically the flag raising and the community event, and we're gonna be cross-promoting and helping to advertise other events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=691.277">Like,</a>  the Vault event isn't really specifically <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=694.918">planned</a>  by the pride committee but we're helping to like give some resources uh you know connections to drag performers and stuff to that um the person who wants to run that and then we're also going to give resources to other people if they if they want to run things so like we reached out to the gsa if they want to plan something we're going to try and help them out um with that as well but the plan the planning committee itself is really doing those two events um and then there's a series of other events that will be happening as well so there's like an interfaith um <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=723.639">interfaith</a>  prayer celebration thing on the first as well, I think it's around 7 30. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=729.623">We</a>  will put up, we'll put up calendars and stuff on our, our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds for that information as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=738.449">And</a>  there's also like a few shows at the Chevalier and there's like an LGBTQ book club at the library. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=744.572">So</a>  there'll be other pride events in Medford in June, but the main two that we're doing on the first and the 25th at 4pm.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=752.71">But</a>  yeah, you guys are really busy last year, so it's kind of focusing on these main two events and kind of promoting the other other events that maybe you aren't planning like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=760.812">golden</a>  girls of the Chevalier. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=764.214">It</a>  sounds like the Ford is going to be having a drag bingo sometime in June as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=769.577">I</a>  believe that's actually on the first as well at 9am.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=774.339">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=776.32">Anything</a>  else that you think is important for people to know in terms of getting involved? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=781.543">Are</a>  there volunteers involved or anything like that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=787.445">I</a>  think the important thing to know is that the city of Medford is really trying to evolve and grow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=796.969">And</a>  there really is a strong focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which helped with the hiring of the new diversity, equity, and inclusion director. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=805.773">I</a>  think there was one before, but I feel like she's ramped things up a little bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=812.696">that</a>  the city of Medford cares enough to have a committee for planning pride. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=818.24">I</a>  just really appreciate, and I think people should be aware that Medford is a welcoming city, and Medford has LGBTQ people here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=827.067">We've</a>  always had LGBTQ people here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=829.929">But</a>  the acceptance, I think, is growing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=832.431">I</a>  felt like when I moved here back in 2007, it was a pretty tolerant place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=836.855">I</a>  wasn't getting hassled regularly or anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=840.097">Um,</a>  but I feel like it's moving, it's moved a lot more towards a welcoming place now where it's actually, you know, not just tolerated, but kind of celebrated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=848.044">And</a>  it's like, it's, it's, it's fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=850.526">It's,</a>  and it's good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=851.907">You</a>  know, if you're LGBTQ, that's fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=853.989">If</a>  you're not, that's also fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=856.031">Like</a>  we have stuff going on here and this is a place where you can be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=860.194">And,</a>  um, and I just, you know, would invite people to try to come if they can make it to any or all of our events.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=867.841">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=870.048">I</a>  think and also so you two are two members of the pride planning committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=873.65">Do</a>  you want to mention other folks that are involved or kind of what the planning committee does?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=880.253">Jacqueline</a>  is our newest member and then we have a bunch of people returning from last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=886.546">So</a>  Francis, Jacqueline, Sian, Michael, Merland, Paul is returning from last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=894.212">And</a>  Joan is exciting because we had Joan on the list, but Joan was completely unable to make it in April. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=901.538">And</a>  Joan came in like a roaring race car this week, and she's back, and she's planning stuff, and she's making calendars, and she's reaching out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=909.644">So</a>  I'm very happy to have Joan back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=912.286">So</a>  yeah, we're pretty much a superstar team. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=914.908">Was</a>  there anyone I missed, Michael, on the list of names?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=918.134">Now</a>  that you actually listed them out, no, that is everybody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=922.307">Yeah,</a>  we did actually have a guest from the junior high, I think junior high last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=930.052">And</a>  she was a great consultant for helping us kind of reach out to the GSA and stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=934.956">And</a>  unfortunately, she wasn't able to make it again this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=938.598">So</a>  we do have Frances reaching out to the GSA to see if they want to plan something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=943.161">But</a>  we don't have a particular, I guess she was kind of like an honorary member, but that's one difference from last year.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=952.793">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=953.213">Well,</a>  anything else you want to mention before we wrap up?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=959.998">I</a>  guess just that I'm excited. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=961.899">I'm</a>  excited for the fact that we were actually able to get together and do this a second year and hopefully, you know, I'm excited to be a part of it or even if I'm not in the future, you know, or any of us that it just continues and will, you know, continue to grow and, you know, grow larger visibility for the queer community and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=982.702">You</a>  know, I just hope we can make something big and cool out of this over the next five years, the next decade, however long we're able to, you know, just exciting to be exciting to see this happening, you know, growing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=996.644">Yeah,</a>  it's exciting that it's a series now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=998.927">This</a>  is the second one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1001.329">So</a>  now we have something to refer back to, and I think we can just keep growing it and making it better every year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1007.236">And</a>  I think we've already been talking about it, but I think with some of the new businesses that are opening in Medford, we're hoping that there'll be opportunities and that some of these businesses are gonna wanna like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1018.568">you</a>  know, maybe start doing things like that's exciting that there's a drag bingo. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1022.492">And</a>  I guess maybe that's not even the first one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1024.453">And</a>  hopefully, there'll be more of those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1026.355">And</a>  maybe there'll be some other drag shows that are happening or other queer nights or events that are happening, you know, on a more regular basis, not just in June.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1035.173">Yeah,</a>  there's so many kind of like community events in June that like, you know, we have like Circle the Square, Clippership Day, like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1042.095">My</a>  hope is that like eventually this is just a normal thing that's in the rotation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1045.596">Like</a>  last week of June, we'd have our pride celebration or like, you know, that it sort of becomes just this like normalized community event that everybody looks forward to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1054.319">But</a>  I think we're on our way there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1055.599">It</a>  sounds like.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1057.52">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1151.075">You</a>  know, I'm having a tough time with this question and I even gave it a little thought because I <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1157.208">I</a>  have a very narrow food place, but I'll name one of my family's favorite places, which is, and actually it might be in Somerville, but we love Ball Square Cafe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1173.441">Ball</a>  Square sits in both communities, so I'll claim it as Medford's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1179.605">We</a>  love Ball Square Cafe as a family, my sons and I. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1183.413">Well,</a>  actually, also, you know what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1185.114">Tasty</a>  on the Hill. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1186.694">Tasty</a>  on the Hill is one of my favorites, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1189.095">And</a>  it's a great, inexpensive burger that I love. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1192.076">So</a>  I'll claim Tasty on the Hill right now, so.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1196.258">Sounds</a>  like you've taken a side in the ball square sound bites.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1208.048">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1208.548">So</a>  if you could tell us, I know you're here to promote a program that you're running for the summer for some youth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1214.394">So</a>  if you could tell us a little bit about what that program is.</p>

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1217.296">Yeah,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1218.718">And</a>  thanks for making space for this, because we really want to let people know, particularly, there's a couple of markets of families that we want to try to get at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1227.766">I'll</a>  say a word about that later. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1229.127">But</a>  we have for years held this AM to PM youth <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1234.992">community</a>  service program, and the AM2PM is such a silly name, but it stands for Working from Morning to Night to Save the World, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1243.238">That's</a>  what the AM2PM comes from. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1244.999">But</a>  we have been operating this for years, and then the pandemic sort of put a hold on it because, you know, gathering and taking kids out into the community to do community service was tough to organize for the last couple of years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1257.308">But</a>  we're back and we're back with a kind of a new vision that we're so excited about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1263.47">We</a>  are holding a high school youth leadership and community service development program for a week where we teach high school youth, not only will they get the 60 hours of community service that they need for graduation, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1280.635">but</a>  they'll have the opportunity to become a paid peer mentor for a middle school program that we will then run after the July 4th weekend. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1291.088">So</a>  it's an opportunity to both get leadership and life skills, to get some experience in the world serving others, to learn about the systems that are creating the need for volunteerism. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1305.059">So</a>  why are people hungry? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1306.62">Why</a>  are they homeless? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1307.781">Why</a>  is there injustice around race and LBGTQIA issues? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1315.007">Why</a>  is the environment crumbling? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1317.028">So</a>  we're going to teach them about what's undergirding the need for volunteerism, give them a chance to reflect on it in a circle of peers, but then also give them the kind of leadership and like mental health first aid support. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1334.643">So</a>  we're going to give them some skills that they can then become paid stipend mentors to middle schoolers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1341.889">So</a>  it's just a great opportunity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1343.43">Then</a>  the middle school kids will get similar <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1346.232">kinds</a>  of experiences, a little bit more about the service and the reflection, but still some life skills, you know, CPR and some mini reflection on how to be a good friend of somebody who can help a friend who's in trouble, how to get access to the resources that they need to support each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1366.06">So,</a>  really just love the way this has unfolded to be sort of a multi-layered <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1372.087">You</a>  know, you're going to connect not only with each other, but with adults who care for you, with community organizations that are in the business of caring for others. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1382.355">So</a>  it's really about this sort of circle of care and connection that we hope, we know, we know will make a difference in kids' lives and give them, empower them to know that they too can make a difference in the world.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1399.254">I</a>  love that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1399.774">I</a>  love this sort of concentric nature of me in my community that has been built into this format. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1406.336">Beautiful.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1407.817">Can</a>  you speak to possibly the ideal candidate for this program? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1411.058">Like</a>  what folks should apply?</p>

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1413.078">Right?</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1414.179">That's</a>  a great way to answer that question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1416.579">I</a>  mean, I think we are looking for high school kids that have a sense of call to this kind of pair of others. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1423.862">Not</a>  that they have to have that experience, but that leadership and being a peer <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1428.683">being</a>  somebody who's going to show up for another would be the ideal high school candidate part of the other, the other piece of the vision that I haven't even talked about yet is that we intend for this to be a year round program so while there'll be a summer camp. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1444.455">aspect</a>  to it, we are looking for kids who are willing to be a part of this for the rest of the year, so we'll build in some quarterly opportunities to go out and do something in the community of service. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1457.828">try</a>  to get those peer high school peers to stay attached to the middle school kids to help them with their transition into high school those kinds of things so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1467.797">We</a>  are looking for high school kids that have a sense of wanting to make a commitment, but also to invest themselves in their community and each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1478.741">In</a>  the case of the middle school kids, I think also just being able to make the commitment for a couple of weeks to be a part of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1487.885">We</a>  are specifically as well, Shelley, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1491.346">looking</a>  to reach into the communities that are historically underrepresented, historically harmed by racism and cisgendered, homophobic kinds of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1507.133">We</a>  really want to try to connect with families that don't have this opportunity, whether that's because of their economic status or they're just <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1517.857">our</a>  conditions, excuse me, their economic conditions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1521.501">You</a>  know, as I said to you guys when we were gathering, I think there's a lot of families in Medford who already know what's happening for their kids this summer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1529.69">They</a>  have the resources to send their kid to a summer camp, but there are a lot of families that don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1534.735">And</a>  so we've been really deliberate about hiring leadership. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1539.18">to</a>  run the program from communities of color and LBGTQIA community, and those are kids that we really want to offer the scholarship. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1549.008">We</a>  have scholarship money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1550.489">We</a>  have money to pay these stipends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1552.63">We</a>  want to give this opportunity to kids that don't typically have access to it.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1560.456">Thank</a>  you, Wendy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1561.017">It</a>  sounds incredible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2swShWjtdwoHUZtpHMKTOW?t=1562.338">Could</a>  you tell us a little bit about how to apply for this program?</p>
