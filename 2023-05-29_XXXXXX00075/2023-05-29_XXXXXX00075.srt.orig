14
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:05,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was on the Medford pride planning committee last year and I really enjoyed it.

15
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:11,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was interested in kind of getting involved in, um, some LGBTQ stuff and the.

16
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:17,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, application came out and I thought that would be a good opportunity to kind of, you know, contribute to the city.

17
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:21,878
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I was like really excited about the fact that we were going to start having pride stuff here.

18
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,758
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

19
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:30,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And my name is Michael Lowe, they, them pronouns.

20
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:43,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, this is my second year being on the PRIDE committee, excited to be part of it as, you know, I run a little queer art collective out of Medford.

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:52,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's exciting to be, you know, again, helping out plan all of the cool queer stuff in the city I live in.

22
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:54,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, excited to get going with it.

23
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:56,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you both.

24
00:01:56,108 --> 00:02:01,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think tonight we're going to hopefully talk a little bit about how last year went and what to expect from this year.

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:10,873
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do that, I'm going to ask you the same question that you answered last year, but also that we ask everyone, which is what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

26
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:18,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will go with four pizza in Medford Square.

27
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:26,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegan and there's actually, I'm sorry, there's not a lot of vegan options in Medford, but they do have plant-based pizzas there.

28
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:30,536
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to build my own with like banana peppers and spinach and garlic and stuff like that.

29
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:31,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do a good job.

30
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,238
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's walking distance from my house, so.

31
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:36,400
[SPEAKER_04]: All good things.

32
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,323
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I think I gave the same answer last year, but it is

33
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,501
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still the same.

34
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:44,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Zamzam also in Medford Square.

35
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Really astounding Pakistani food.

36
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:50,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's Pakistani food.

37
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:53,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

38
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:54,668
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality is always great.

39
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:56,850
[SPEAKER_04]: The helpings are always enormous.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never say enough good stuff about them.

41
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always delicious.

42
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:02,811
[SPEAKER_01]: you.

43
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:05,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we like their samosas down there too.

44
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:06,993
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

45
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:07,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

46
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:19,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So, last year was our first kind of like major like city-sponsored pride events and we all, you know, some of us talked last year about how that went or what to expect and I actually had a great time.

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to go to the flag raising.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought my older son who was I think like six at the time.

49
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,604
[SPEAKER_01]: We really enjoyed like, you know, hearing the speeches and

50
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:32,670
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of being with lots of other folks, celebrating pride.

51
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:39,940
[SPEAKER_01]: We also went to the, well my son didn't come to this, but some other adults and I went to the drag show at Carol's, which was awesome.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think I was expecting it to be great, but I wasn't expecting it to be that great, and we had a really, really good time.

53
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:50,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wasn't able to make it to the event at the Andrews, but, um, I did hear it was very hot.

54
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, thank you for putting those things on.

55
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was great.

56
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:05,914
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, it just felt really nice to have, I felt, I think kind of emotional about it last year, just being able to have those events really like recognize and organize and honored by the city.

57
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,754
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really great feeling.

58
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:11,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I'm wondering what, if you all have any reflections about last year.

59
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I guess I can go first.

60
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really good time.

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,782
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, the highlight was actually the drag show as well.

62
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:27,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I particularly like drag, and I was kind of instrumental in trying to push us to have a drag show.

63
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to have kind of an adult's event.

64
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,068
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it went really well.

65
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:40,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not really sure what to expect, honestly, because I didn't really know the drag performers who were coming.

66
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:46,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't sure who would be willing to come to Medford, and I wasn't sure how it would work in a restaurant in Medford.

67
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of expecting it to be a little bit of a hot mess.

68
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:52,954
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, the performers were very good.

69
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were, like, seven or eight.

70
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:57,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I originally thought we'd have, like, three or four.

71
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,456
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a good amount of performers.

72
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:05,897
[SPEAKER_00]: They all showed up on time, which is kind of nice for Drenica.

73
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:06,837
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all there.

74
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:11,860
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought them some drinks, and they were super nice.

75
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to them, and they put on an amazing show for everyone.

76
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And people came out.

77
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:17,304
[SPEAKER_00]: People came out.

78
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,265
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very exciting.

79
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:20,046
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't empty.

80
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,407
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty full.

81
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:25,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people were very excited, the crowds.

82
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, I had a really good experience with that.

83
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:29,574
[SPEAKER_00]: The other events were good, too.

84
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:33,197
[SPEAKER_00]: We did do a lot of events, so it felt like a lot of work.

85
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:40,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's part of the reason why, well, I know that's part of the reason why we decided to narrow in a little bit on doing fewer events this year.

86
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,885
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought that the pride flag raising was like pretty emotional for me as well.

87
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:49,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just really felt kind of amazing for the city to be doing something.

88
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:54,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that struck me about that event was that Chief Buckley walked down a drag queen down the aisle.

89
00:05:55,994 --> 00:06:02,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just never expected to see like the police chief of my city, hand in hand or arm in arm with a with a drag queen.

90
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,945
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really, really sweet.

91
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:12,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought she gave a nice speech and Reverend Wendy gave a really nice speech and Terry Carter gave a great poem and there was a lot of really great

92
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,482
[SPEAKER_00]: words on the flag raising day.

93
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also enjoyed the other events.

94
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:27,651
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last day, the last event, the community event, was very, very hot, which was a little bit of a problem.

95
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,812
[SPEAKER_00]: And people didn't stay super long for that.

96
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:34,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was logistically difficult with the heat and stuff.

97
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:39,720
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were some good bands and some booths with stuff.

98
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,882
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, overall, I had a great time.

99
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:45,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was great, pretty amazing success for the first year.

100
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:52,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping to focus in and do a few fewer events and even bigger success this year.

101
00:06:52,566 --> 00:07:01,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I would say, gosh, I mean, the Dragon Show is kind of hard to beat.

102
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:06,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably was our best event last year in terms of just

103
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,553
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how many people showed up, just how well it went.

104
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:17,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any of the other events went poorly, per se, but definitely the best, you know, highest attendance right there.

105
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:26,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a lot of fun, and I know I am the one who ran it, so I'll tout it, but the art show, well, very low attendance.

106
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:42,850
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to meet an amazing musician named Miles, and they will be joining us again this year, actually, which I'm excited about, at the flag raising to supply some nice ambient music of their own creation.

107
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and I'm remembering though at City Hall they had the like the letters up that spelled out Medford Pride or Pride.

109
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:58,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot about that part that we all got a picture after the flag raising that was like pretty cool.

110
00:07:59,082 --> 00:07:59,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Pride 02155.

111
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's what it was.

112
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:08,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and there's that one's going to be going up again this year on I think on the first or sometime soon after.

113
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the local GSA

114
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:17,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Provided that oh and I forgot to mention that the other one another big another success.

115
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:31,021
[SPEAKER_00]: We had was the teen night So we had a teen skate night last year Partnered with the GSA and they I think they had a really good time a lot of kids who came out so and the police were there to give us protection and and and to

116
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:35,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had the DPW and the police were there.

117
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:39,406
[SPEAKER_00]: The DPWs marked everything off for us and helped set up the stuff.

118
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:42,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michael's friends were doing DJing.

119
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a good time as well.

120
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,012
[SPEAKER_01]: The DJ at the drag show was also great, I thought.

121
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good time.

122
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:53,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was my partner, Giovanna.

123
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:55,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.

124
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:56,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

125
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember.

126
00:08:58,557 --> 00:08:59,958
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ, right, Michael, for both?

127
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:14,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Both her and our other friend, Abby, who is stepping away from music for a while, but both of them DJ'd as a pair for both events.

128
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:24,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember talking to the mayor at the drag show and she was really excited that people had come from Somerville to Medford for this event.

129
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,212
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like a big point of pride.

130
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what we can expect for this year.

131
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can jump in on that.

132
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:46,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So for this year, we are scaling it down a little bit so we can focus and make the events as good as they can be, basically.

133
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:50,435
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still going to have the flag-raising event on the 1st, of course.

134
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,675
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still going to have some good speakers.

135
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:58,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I just said, Miles is going to be joining us to give us some nice ambient music.

136
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:11,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And then our other large event is going to be the Community Pride Day event, which will be on the 25th, the last Sunday of June.

137
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:15,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is going to be at City Hall this year, which is super exciting.

138
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:17,750
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have vendors.

139
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:25,635
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a bunch of informational booths as well for local queer organizations, you know, events.

140
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:28,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we're going to have stuff for all ages at this event.

141
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:38,082
[SPEAKER_04]: and hopefully we'll have a couple or a few drag performers there as well to kind of hype people up and give a good show.

142
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:48,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're planning on having a handful of musicians and or bands playing throughout the day, throughout the event.

143
00:10:49,422 --> 00:11:02,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And then right after that, we're going to be, courtesy of the vault, we're going to be having a little after party with another drag show like we did last year, but hopefully bigger and better.

144
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so just to add on to that, both events are at 4 p.m.

145
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:15,634
[SPEAKER_00]: June 1st is the flag raising at 4 p.m., and June 25th is the community event at 4 p.m.

146
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:30,497
[SPEAKER_00]: We are personally working on specifically the flag raising and the community event, and we're gonna be cross-promoting and helping to advertise other events.

147
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:33,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, the Vault event isn't really specifically

148
00:11:34,918 --> 00:12:02,718
[SPEAKER_00]: planned by the pride committee but we're helping to like give some resources uh you know connections to drag performers and stuff to that um the person who wants to run that and then we're also going to give resources to other people if they if they want to run things so like we reached out to the gsa if they want to plan something we're going to try and help them out um with that as well but the plan the planning committee itself is really doing those two events um and then there's a series of other events that will be happening as well so there's like an interfaith um

149
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,262
[SPEAKER_00]: interfaith prayer celebration thing on the first as well, I think it's around 7 30.

150
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:17,688
[SPEAKER_00]: We will put up, we'll put up calendars and stuff on our, our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds for that information as well.

151
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:24,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also like a few shows at the Chevalier and there's like an LGBTQ book club at the library.

152
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:30,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be other pride events in Medford in June, but the main two that we're doing on the first and the 25th at 4pm.

153
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:39,893
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you guys are really busy last year, so it's kind of focusing on these main two events and kind of promoting the other other events that maybe you aren't planning like.

154
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,393
[SPEAKER_01]: golden girls of the Chevalier.

155
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:49,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like the Ford is going to be having a drag bingo sometime in June as well.

156
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:53,459
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's actually on the first as well at 9am.

157
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:54,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

158
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else that you think is important for people to know in terms of getting involved?

159
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:04,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there volunteers involved or anything like that?

160
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:15,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the important thing to know is that the city of Medford is really trying to evolve and grow.

161
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:25,753
[SPEAKER_00]: And there really is a strong focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which helped with the hiring of the new diversity, equity, and inclusion director.

162
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:30,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was one before, but I feel like she's ramped things up a little bit.

163
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:38,080
[SPEAKER_00]: that the city of Medford cares enough to have a committee for planning pride.

164
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:46,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really appreciate, and I think people should be aware that Medford is a welcoming city, and Medford has LGBTQ people here.

165
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,689
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always had LGBTQ people here.

166
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,071
[SPEAKER_00]: But the acceptance, I think, is growing.

167
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like when I moved here back in 2007, it was a pretty tolerant place.

168
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:59,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't getting hassled regularly or anything.

169
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:07,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I feel like it's moving, it's moved a lot more towards a welcoming place now where it's actually, you know, not just tolerated, but kind of celebrated.

170
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:10,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's, it's, it's fine.

171
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:11,507
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, and it's good.

172
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:13,949
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're LGBTQ, that's fine.

173
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:15,510
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not, that's also fine.

174
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:20,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have stuff going on here and this is a place where you can be.

175
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:26,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and I just, you know, would invite people to try to come if they can make it to any or all of our events.

176
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:27,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

177
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:33,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I think and also so you two are two members of the pride planning committee.

178
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to mention other folks that are involved or kind of what the planning committee does?

179
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:45,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacqueline is our newest member and then we have a bunch of people returning from last year.

180
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:54,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So Francis, Jacqueline, Sian, Michael, Merland, Paul is returning from last year.

181
00:14:54,212 --> 00:15:01,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And Joan is exciting because we had Joan on the list, but Joan was completely unable to make it in April.

182
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:09,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And Joan came in like a roaring race car this week, and she's back, and she's planning stuff, and she's making calendars, and she's reaching out.

183
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:11,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very happy to have Joan back.

184
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,608
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're pretty much a superstar team.

185
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anyone I missed, Michael, on the list of names?

186
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you actually listed them out, no, that is everybody.

187
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:28,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did actually have a guest from the junior high, I think junior high last year.

188
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:34,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was a great consultant for helping us kind of reach out to the GSA and stuff.

189
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:37,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, she wasn't able to make it again this year.

190
00:15:38,598 --> 00:15:43,081
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have Frances reaching out to the GSA to see if they want to plan something.

191
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:50,086
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have a particular, I guess she was kind of like an honorary member, but that's one difference from last year.

192
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:53,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

193
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anything else you want to mention before we wrap up?

194
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess just that I'm excited.

195
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:21,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited for the fact that we were actually able to get together and do this a second year and hopefully, you know, I'm excited to be a part of it or even if I'm not in the future, you know, or any of us that it just continues and will, you know, continue to grow and, you know, grow larger visibility for the queer community and

196
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:34,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just hope we can make something big and cool out of this over the next five years, the next decade, however long we're able to, you know, just exciting to be exciting to see this happening, you know, growing.

197
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:38,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's exciting that it's a series now.

198
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,829
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second one.

199
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:47,216
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have something to refer back to, and I think we can just keep growing it and making it better every year.

200
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:57,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've already been talking about it, but I think with some of the new businesses that are opening in Medford, we're hoping that there'll be opportunities and that some of these businesses are gonna wanna like,

201
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,452
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe start doing things like that's exciting that there's a drag bingo.

202
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,393
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess maybe that's not even the first one.

203
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:06,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, there'll be more of those.

204
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:14,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there'll be some other drag shows that are happening or other queer nights or events that are happening, you know, on a more regular basis, not just in June.

205
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:22,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's so many kind of like community events in June that like, you know, we have like Circle the Square, Clippership Day, like that.

206
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:25,556
[SPEAKER_01]: My hope is that like eventually this is just a normal thing that's in the rotation.

207
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:33,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Like last week of June, we'd have our pride celebration or like, you know, that it sort of becomes just this like normalized community event that everybody looks forward to.

208
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,579
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we're on our way there.

209
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,099
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like.

210
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

211
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:41,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you both so much.

212
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:45,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for the events, and I think they're going to be great.

213
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:47,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.

214
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,259
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not done yet, folks.

215
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:58,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some more bonus content from Reverend Wendy about her summer program, AM to PM for Medford youth.

216
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:02,805
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks for joining us today.

217
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:06,947
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

218
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:08,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

219
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me on.

220
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:27,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we did this once before, Danielle my name is Wendy Miller all up on and the pastor of Sanctuary United Church of Christ that partners with the hillside community church over in the hillside neighborhood to make love and justice real in Medford, and I am.

221
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,814
[SPEAKER_02]: she, hers, identified, soul.

222
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it for that?

223
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:35,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

224
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a pastor in Medford for 10 years now.

225
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been 10 years.

226
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:43,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the longest I've ever been a pastor in a community.

227
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Medford.

228
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:47,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an activist.

229
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:56,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, somebody who cares about making love and justice real and change in things, change in the world.

230
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit about me.

231
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:02,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Andy, and I think those themes will come up and what we're gonna talk about today.

232
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:05,234
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, if you could answer our favorite question.

233
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:09,235
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

234
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:16,017
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm having a tough time with this question and I even gave it a little thought because I

235
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:33,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a very narrow food place, but I'll name one of my family's favorite places, which is, and actually it might be in Somerville, but we love Ball Square Cafe.

236
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:39,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Ball Square sits in both communities, so I'll claim it as Medford's.

237
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:42,908
[SPEAKER_02]: We love Ball Square Cafe as a family, my sons and I.

238
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, also, you know what?

239
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty on the Hill.

240
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty on the Hill is one of my favorites, too.

241
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a great, inexpensive burger that I love.

242
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:55,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll claim Tasty on the Hill right now, so.

243
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:59,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you've taken a side in the ball square sound bites.

244
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.

245
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally have taken a side.

246
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:03,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to know.

247
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike treats me like royalty when I come in.

248
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:08,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

249
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:14,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could tell us, I know you're here to promote a program that you're running for the summer for some youth.

250
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could tell us a little bit about what that program is.

251
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you so much.

252
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:27,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for making space for this, because we really want to let people know, particularly, there's a couple of markets of families that we want to try to get at.

253
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say a word about that later.

254
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:34,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have for years held this AM to PM youth

255
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:43,218
[SPEAKER_02]: community service program, and the AM2PM is such a silly name, but it stands for Working from Morning to Night to Save the World, right?

256
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,959
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the AM2PM comes from.

257
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:56,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have been operating this for years, and then the pandemic sort of put a hold on it because, you know, gathering and taking kids out into the community to do community service was tough to organize for the last couple of years.

258
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:02,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're back and we're back with a kind of a new vision that we're so excited about.

259
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:19,995
[SPEAKER_02]: We are holding a high school youth leadership and community service development program for a week where we teach high school youth, not only will they get the 60 hours of community service that they need for graduation,

260
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:30,597
[SPEAKER_02]: but they'll have the opportunity to become a paid peer mentor for a middle school program that we will then run after the July 4th weekend.

261
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:44,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an opportunity to both get leadership and life skills, to get some experience in the world serving others, to learn about the systems that are creating the need for volunteerism.

262
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So why are people hungry?

263
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they homeless?

264
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:54,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is there injustice around race and LBGTQIA issues?

265
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is the environment crumbling?

266
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:14,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to teach them about what's undergirding the need for volunteerism, give them a chance to reflect on it in a circle of peers, but then also give them the kind of leadership and like mental health first aid support.

267
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:21,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to give them some skills that they can then become paid stipend mentors to middle schoolers.

268
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:23,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a great opportunity.

269
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the middle school kids will get similar

270
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:45,480
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of experiences, a little bit more about the service and the reflection, but still some life skills, you know, CPR and some mini reflection on how to be a good friend of somebody who can help a friend who's in trouble, how to get access to the resources that they need to support each other.

271
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really just love the way this has unfolded to be sort of a multi-layered

272
00:22:52,087 --> 00:23:01,974
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're going to connect not only with each other, but with adults who care for you, with community organizations that are in the business of caring for others.

273
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:17,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really about this sort of circle of care and connection that we hope, we know, we know will make a difference in kids' lives and give them, empower them to know that they too can make a difference in the world.

274
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:19,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.

275
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:26,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this sort of concentric nature of me in my community that has been built into this format.

276
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:26,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.

277
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:31,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak to possibly the ideal candidate for this program?

278
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:32,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what folks should apply?

279
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

280
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great way to answer that question.

281
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:43,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we are looking for high school kids that have a sense of call to this kind of pair of others.

282
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:48,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that they have to have that experience, but that leadership and being a peer

283
00:23:48,683 --> 00:24:03,473
[SPEAKER_02]: being somebody who's going to show up for another would be the ideal high school candidate part of the other, the other piece of the vision that I haven't even talked about yet is that we intend for this to be a year round program so while there'll be a summer camp.

284
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:17,227
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect to it, we are looking for kids who are willing to be a part of this for the rest of the year, so we'll build in some quarterly opportunities to go out and do something in the community of service.

285
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:27,157
[SPEAKER_02]: try to get those peer high school peers to stay attached to the middle school kids to help them with their transition into high school those kinds of things so.

286
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:37,821
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking for high school kids that have a sense of wanting to make a commitment, but also to invest themselves in their community and each other.

287
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:46,724
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of the middle school kids, I think also just being able to make the commitment for a couple of weeks to be a part of it.

288
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:50,506
[SPEAKER_02]: We are specifically as well, Shelley,

289
00:24:51,346 --> 00:25:07,073
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to reach into the communities that are historically underrepresented, historically harmed by racism and cisgendered, homophobic kinds of things.

290
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:17,017
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to try to connect with families that don't have this opportunity, whether that's because of their economic status or they're just

291
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: our conditions, excuse me, their economic conditions.

292
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:29,630
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as I said to you guys when we were gathering, I think there's a lot of families in Medford who already know what's happening for their kids this summer.

293
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,675
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the resources to send their kid to a summer camp, but there are a lot of families that don't.

294
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:38,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been really deliberate about hiring leadership.

295
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:48,968
[SPEAKER_02]: to run the program from communities of color and LBGTQIA community, and those are kids that we really want to offer the scholarship.

296
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:50,148
[SPEAKER_02]: We have scholarship money.

297
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:52,610
[SPEAKER_02]: We have money to pay these stipends.

298
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,714
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to give this opportunity to kids that don't typically have access to it.

299
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:00,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Wendy.

300
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,057
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds incredible.

301
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:05,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you tell us a little bit about how to apply for this program?

302
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:06,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

303
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:09,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go to the Sanctuary UCC website.

304
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:17,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Right at the top, there's a dropdown that says what's on and you'll see the AM to PM program.

305
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:22,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But probably if you just Google AM to PM youth, you'll find a link to it.

306
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:29,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But the web address is sanctuaryucc.org slash AM to PM.

307
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:31,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll get you right to the page.

308
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,435
[SPEAKER_02]: All the details are there.

309
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:38,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll give you a sense of what the kids would be doing during the weeks that they would be participating.

310
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:41,360
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a button to apply.

311
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:50,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a nice FAQ for moms and dads and other parents to take a look at any questions that they might have.

312
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:51,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the

313
00:26:51,847 --> 00:27:04,356
[SPEAKER_02]: program director whose name is Kashana Harling is available as am I and as is Tom Hathaway, my colleague in this work to answer any questions.

314
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:13,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So the program is listed with a cost, but again, we're offering full pay, partial pay and full scholarship options.

315
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:19,527
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have the resources to be able to offer it to anybody who's looking to have this experience.

316
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:23,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Wendy.

317
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:24,829
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a deadline for applying?

318
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:29,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we currently are listing a June 1st deadline.

319
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:39,378
[SPEAKER_02]: The program doesn't begin until the last week of June, and so we may end up with a little bit of flexibility about that as we see how the applications come through.

320
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:49,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 15 slots in each of the opportunities, and so 45 kids will have the chance to do this, and yeah.

321
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:51,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that sounds great.

322
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing dear young people apply this sounds like an incredible opportunity.

323
00:27:56,258 --> 00:28:10,212
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah we're going to have some fun, I mean I mean I didn't say anything about the experiences, but you know, not only will they have a chance to go and meet some unhoused friends, you know who and serve.

324
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:19,979
[SPEAKER_02]: food and sit and eat with them, but we have a day at the Wright Lock Farm where they'll get a chance to learn about, you know, organic farming and the environment.

325
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:25,662
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually go out and clean up some invasive species in the river.

326
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:29,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We will do some work with the NAACP.

327
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:33,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So really a smattering of experiences

328
00:28:34,197 --> 00:28:44,639
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially a trip into Boston to the African American History Museum in Boston.

329
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there'll be film and there'll be discussion and there'll be lots of fun too.
