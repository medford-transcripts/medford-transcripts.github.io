[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Madam President Morrell and esteemed body of our city council.

78
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:48,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, City Councilors, all of you for having me this evening to present our resubmission of the MSBA statement of input statement of interest application.

79
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,143
[SPEAKER_05]: We submitted a year ago and we've submitted many years in the past.

80
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:57,506
[SPEAKER_05]: This past year, we were very close, but

81
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:07,351
[SPEAKER_05]: based on the feedback that we had received, the amount of schools that were approved this past year was a smaller number.

82
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a result of that, we just weren't able to make the number.

83
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:19,759
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't make the cut, but we were given very positive feedback to resubmit our application, which we have done.

84
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:35,501
[SPEAKER_05]: This evening, I'm requesting the entire city council if you would approve Medford Public Schools reapplication for the statement of interest for the core program for Medford High School.

85
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:37,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

86
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:39,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm available to answer any questions.

87
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:40,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

88
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, thank you very much.

89
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:48,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Superintendent, how does this application differ from years past and what changes were made based upon the feedback that you mentioned that you received?

90
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we haven't been able to secure this.

91
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:57,837
[SPEAKER_02]: funding now for multiple years, we're getting feedback from the point the enabling authority.

92
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:01,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So what changes are we making to the application to maybe enhance our chances.

93
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:11,847
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we had a very strong application, again this past year, and because the number of schools that were awarded this year was a reduced number.

94
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we, we just missed that cut.

95
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:21,845
[SPEAKER_05]: and we were encouraged by the MSBA to resubmit for this year.

96
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:23,466
[SPEAKER_05]: There is one key difference.

97
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:32,629
[SPEAKER_05]: In previous years, MSBA was having two programs, the accelerated repair program and the core program.

98
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,870
[SPEAKER_05]: This current year,

99
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:36,425
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not accepting applications.

100
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,786
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not doing the accelerated repair program.

101
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:40,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only the core program.

102
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:50,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're resubmitting our application from last year with the addition of a few things that have surfaced at the school.

103
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:58,092
[SPEAKER_05]: We had pipes bursting and some asbestos work for tiles that had popped on the floor.

104
00:07:58,152 --> 00:07:59,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did have additional work

105
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:04,400
[SPEAKER_05]: that needed to be done because the building is aging.

106
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:20,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we are reapplying for the core program and MSBA will come back out if we're approved, if our statement of interest is approved, they will come back out and do a senior study and follow the appropriate steps.

107
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:27,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to say that this is just, today's request is permission to,

108
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,604
[SPEAKER_05]: reapply with the statement of interest.

109
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:41,828
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we continue with MSBA, there will be multiple opportunities to come before your body and respond to questions and let you know the status of what is happening.

110
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:54,112
[SPEAKER_05]: MSBA just does not want a school district on their own to go and say, we're putting in this application and not have the support of both the school committee and the city council.

111
00:08:55,012 --> 00:09:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee did approve it last week for us to move forward, and my request is that the city council will allow us to apply.

112
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:07,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should continue to apply.

113
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:20,044
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that the high school needs work, and I feel very confident in our resubmission and based on the feedback that we received that we should not give up but move forward.

114
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:22,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

115
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:32,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that, Madam President, so the one difference, the difference is nothing other than the fact that we moved some items that were covered under the accelerated repair grant from last year over to the school grant.

116
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm understanding.

117
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:35,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct, Mr. Lieutenant?

118
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:42,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same exact application as last year with the addition of these infrastructure items that were under the accelerated repair grant being moved over to this one.

119
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:44,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that accurate?

120
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:49,903
[SPEAKER_05]: The additional pieces that I just shared were things that happened this year since we applied.

121
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:52,824
[SPEAKER_02]: The question they asked was, you know, how does this application differ from years past?

122
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,524
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what it was, yes.

123
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:55,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one item, right, okay.

124
00:09:56,265 --> 00:10:02,966
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, yeah, I was looking, because I had my files, I was looking, I usually have my files nice and organized, but I can't find the documents.

125
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone must have moved them, so that's it.

126
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:08,787
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was looking to see if I could look at last year's application and see if we could take a look at that as well.

127
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:12,488
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't have it in my files yet, because my filing system's a little screwy.

128
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:22,034
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm looking at this so ultimately, this is the same application that we submitted last year with a couple of additions that application is the same application we submitted the year before.

129
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:35,502
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not identical year before last year's application was was significantly different brought in consultants and had additional help in terms of how we structured the application.

130
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:44,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And so last year's application was looked upon very favorably, and we did advance to the next phase of senior study, which is promising.

131
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:48,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Some districts do not advance even to that phase.

132
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were able to advance to the second phase.

133
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:59,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we did receive positive feedback from MSBA to definitely reapply.

134
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:00,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And so,

135
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:08,796
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's why we're reapplying resubmitting the application was the additions, what was the consultants cost.

136
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:16,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not have the cost of the consultant right now but we did secure additional support.

137
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:21,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't, I can get that number to you.

138
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:22,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

139
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:31,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just seeing, you know, a lot of money being spent that's not being spent in the classroom, and I'd like to take a look at that as we get prepared for the budget.

140
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, ultimately, you know, it's pretty cut and dry, right?

141
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an application we submit every year.

142
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:39,430
[SPEAKER_02]: All we're doing is asking for free money, so I don't see any reason why we shouldn't support it and move for approval.

143
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:40,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

144
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,552
[SPEAKER_07]: A motion from Councilor Knight for approval.

145
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:43,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Behrs.

146
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:44,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

147
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent, for being here.

148
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:52,816
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly agree with Councilor Knight's point that this is something that we submit regularly and we should submit.

149
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:59,358
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really grateful to hear that the improved application that was submitted last year was seen significantly better than prior applications.

150
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's great news.

151
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:00,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it

152
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:17,578
[SPEAKER_12]: reflects the work that went into that, you know, I think the big issue that we're, you know, not necessarily dancing around I think we're trying to go at it right is that the city doesn't have enough resources to replace school buildings, the state has determined that cities don't have the resources to replace school buildings.

153
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:45,165
[SPEAKER_12]: and created the MSBA for the purpose that we need new school buildings in the Commonwealth and obviously I'm in for high school needs that I think, you know, maybe many, many of us behind this real can attest to it but counselor saying and I probably most recently and, and, you know, my locker was in the very cold overpass on the second floor of C building, and, you know, while I appreciate Medford High School in the building for what it is significant improvements need to be made you know I for one.

154
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:53,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just hopeful that we can get into this program and that the state will recognize our need.

155
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:55,598
[SPEAKER_12]: The building has major, major, major needs.

156
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:14,337
[SPEAKER_12]: not just the HVAC systems and the infrastructure and the structure of the building or the AV or the technology or all of that, but quite frankly, just the size of the building, it's not built for the group that's there now, it's not built for the team that's there now and that causes issues and those issues need to be addressed as well.

157
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:23,284
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really hopeful that MSBA will accept our application and we can start to move forward those important community discussions about addressing Medford High School.

158
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,025
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for submitting this and I'll be supporting it.

159
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

160
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:28,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

161
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:30,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

162
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there when the building was new.

163
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a second graduating class.

164
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's 52 years old now.

165
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:43,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen the wear and tear that's gone over the building over the years.

166
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:50,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've toured the building with the previous superintendent see all the boilers and things that, and I agree that

167
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:53,182
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, ask for everything and we get whatever we get.

168
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:54,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something I supported over the years.

169
00:13:55,763 --> 00:14:05,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I was also here when we, you know, when we got the money for the science labs and the technical school, I think, you know, I think the money was well spent there and the renovations come out good.

170
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:13,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, this will be something I support again and hopefully we'll get what we need this time to keep the school moving forward.

171
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:15,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

172
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sang.

173
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

174
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:24,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to first reiterate some points from last year when this came before us.

175
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:33,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, I mentioned a lot of the needs that I saw when I was a student there about five years ago, so not that long ago.

176
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:48,265
[SPEAKER_01]: where a building had flood and their needs in their heating problems and overpasses and a lot of different heat, I mean, even heating problems in their classrooms, sunlight problems and all of that.

177
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:56,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage anyone who's not, who wants to learn more about why this is important to read the application itself.

178
00:14:56,267 --> 00:15:00,788
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have, your team has put together, I think, in very clear language,

179
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:07,773
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the problems that we're seeing in the high school that doesn't match the education that we're providing today.

180
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:17,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're seeing that the physical building doesn't match the quality of the instruction that's in the building.

181
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:27,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And that by improving the physical building itself, we can hopefully bring more pride to Medford and shine a light to the good work that's happening inside the high school.

182
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And to

183
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:46,033
[SPEAKER_01]: As a student there I know that it can be a very bluntly said drab and depressing environment to study in, and I would want for future students at Medford a happier place and a more encouraging environment to work in, a physical environment to work in.

184
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important for residents.

185
00:15:53,137 --> 00:16:04,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is an issue that came up on the doorstep time and time again, especially from parents, but even the parents of graduates, of students who've already left Medford High.

186
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:08,222
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I think, an issue that much of the community can unite around.

187
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:22,511
[SPEAKER_01]: given the importance that everyone sees, there might be different approaches to what we do with the building exactly, but it's really important to take the steps that allow us to have as many options on the table as possible.

188
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And a yes vote on the council tonight allows that.

189
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:34,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we were chatting before this meeting, we mentioned, you know, it's super encouraging that they asked us to reapply.

190
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:39,022
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see that there have been even more improvements made to the application this time.

191
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:45,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's about trying.

192
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:53,262
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about trying whenever we can and keep pushing for it, because we don't know what year it's gonna happen.

193
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:56,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

194
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:57,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

195
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:01,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I second Councilor Knight's motion to approve.

196
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:04,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Any members of the public wish to speak?

197
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:10,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, so we have a motion from Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

198
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

199
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:14,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Behrs?

200
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:14,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

201
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:15,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kerrio?

202
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:16,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

203
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:17,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins?

204
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:17,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

205
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:18,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

206
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:19,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

207
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:21,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

208
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:21,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

209
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Sanchez?

210
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

211
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,321
[SPEAKER_11]: President Morrell?

212
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:24,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

213
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:27,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

214
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:30,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, thank you for being here tonight.

215
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:35,835
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still under suspension.

216
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:46,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and looking through our responses that we received, I just like to point out, Council response to paper 23048 from my state delegation.

217
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:55,656
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a request made by the city council to ask that the dot and DCR provide some routine roadwork and.

218
00:17:57,533 --> 00:18:03,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Representative Donato has gotten back to us, saying that both the DOT and the DCR have indicated that their repairs have been made.

219
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:09,179
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if we go right to this on-ramp right here, right beside City Hall, the repairs aren't done.

220
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we could just ask that the administration follow up on that request, please.

221
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

222
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:18,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I can follow up with the mayor on that.

223
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:21,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to revert back to regular order business.

224
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:25,848
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Naito to revert back to regular order business, seconded by Councilor Seng.

225
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:26,568
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

226
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,656
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed, motion passes.

227
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

228
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:34,138
[SPEAKER_07]: 23-086, offered by Councilor Carviello.

229
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:40,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it so resolved that the Metro City Council update the ordinances pertaining to body shops and automobile repair facilities.

230
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Carviello.

231
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

232
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:56,387
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something I've had a discussion with the chief about, and especially around the Mystic Avenue area, is we've got a lot of repair shops coming to Metro because they've been pushed out of Somerville and Cambridge, so they're all coming here now.

233
00:18:57,273 --> 00:19:05,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's happening is they're moving into these small lots, these small garages, and parts are getting harder to come by, and cars are sitting there longer.

234
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:08,180
[SPEAKER_06]: You're now parking the cars all over the streets.

235
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:16,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I say, it's a discussion I have with the chief many times, and the chief says, he says, I can't enforce an ordinance that doesn't exist.

236
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So tonight I'm proposing that we have an ordinance

237
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:30,614
[SPEAKER_06]: set up for body shops, toe shops, and garages, service facilities, not the parked cars in the street.

238
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:34,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what's happening, they just, if you go by like Columbia Street,

239
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:39,209
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole street is all cars parked from the other garage.

240
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:44,010
[SPEAKER_06]: You go by down Swan Street, all cars parked from the garages there.

241
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,652
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter where you go, you're seeing all these garages just parking the cars in the street.

242
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:49,172
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing repairs on the street.

243
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:53,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we need an ordinance to make sure that they keep the limit.

244
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,875
[SPEAKER_06]: to what their permit was for the amount of cars in the space.

245
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:58,375
[SPEAKER_06]: No on-street parking.

246
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:02,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bares, I think is the head of that committee, subcommittee.

247
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:10,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave him some of those ordinances, which was pretty simple and concise, and I think it will address the needs.

248
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:20,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would hope that the subcommittee of ordinances would take this up as soon as possible so we can get that out there and we can start cleaning up our streets.

249
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:22,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

250
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:37,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, this is an issue that I've discussed in the past as well and I think it's really an issue of parking capacity, you know, we issue a permit to a repair shop, but we really don't put any restrictions or confines on parking capacity based upon the size of the lot.

251
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:40,159
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you drive down Mystic Gap, the first

252
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,381
[SPEAKER_02]: two shops you'll see in probably what Volsar and Atech.

253
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:48,824
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the parking lot at Atech, I mean, you can't fit a piece of paper between the cars in the parking lot there.

254
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:51,987
[SPEAKER_02]: There must be 35 cars in this very small parking lot.

255
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:53,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, we approved the permit.

256
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:55,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with these people trying to make a buck.

257
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:56,410
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

258
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the American way.

259
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:01,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, at the end of the day, it's also creating issues where

260
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,147
[SPEAKER_02]: These lots appear overcrowded and unsightly.

261
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic Avenue, for example, is a gateway road to our community.

262
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:13,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to drive from Somerville into Medford, and that gateway road is going to look like an industrial park, right?

263
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:24,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The condition of the roadway is bad enough as it is, but now to have, you know, unsightly businesses that really aren't a welcoming business to the community, I think is something we need to talk about as we go into our meeting tomorrow night.

264
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:26,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it raises, I think,

265
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:32,709
[SPEAKER_02]: issues about safety, whether or not these lots are questionably safe.

266
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:38,111
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a parking lot with 25 cars in there, how can you get a fire engine in there?

267
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:46,173
[SPEAKER_02]: These repair shops, they have flammables, they have combustibles, and it puts us in a position where we may be putting our

268
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:54,112
[SPEAKER_02]: first responders and our fire personnel at risk in responding to these, to cause these locations because of the overcrowding of the parking lots.

269
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are definitely things that we need to take into place.

270
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:59,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might just ask that this be set to fire prevention as well.

271
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:03,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So that fire prevention can be provided the opportunity to pipe in.

272
00:22:03,796 --> 00:22:14,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all too often when we talk about permitting a new business, we talk about the parking and the impacts that it's gonna have on the community, but we don't really think about the impact that it's gonna have on fire safety and fire prevention as well.

273
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just ask that this paper be sent to the fire chief.

274
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:18,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like that as an amendment?

275
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:20,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this embarrassed?

276
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:21,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

277
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio for putting this forward.

278
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I think definitely we can move on this right away.

279
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:32,766
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard making sure at least that the chief has consulted in some way the fire chief.

280
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:36,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably going to want to bring the traffic folks down from the police department.

281
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:40,953
[SPEAKER_12]: But is there anyone else that you want us to invite to that meeting?

282
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Code enforcement in the building, Commissioner?

283
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:45,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

284
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:46,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

285
00:22:46,912 --> 00:23:03,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Great yeah and I agree with the point that you made again I don't know what property this was on in the area I don't know if it was a car shop and I'm just saying that to put that out there in advance because I know if I don't say that people will be frustrated but we did have, there was a fire, and there was a someone who was, I believe, killed in that fire in that area.

286
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:09,408
[SPEAKER_12]: And again I don't know the circumstance I'm not saying it was because of car parking or anything but again I think it just speaks to your point.

287
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,680
[SPEAKER_12]: around is that even the best use in the area?

288
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:25,247
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a long conversation and I know a lot of people obviously have livelihoods that depend on the businesses there, but I also think we can't just be packing, packing, packing cars and car repair shops in that area without addressing the negative effects that may come from that.

289
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:26,608
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll work on it.

290
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:27,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

291
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:28,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

292
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:29,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

293
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:36,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Carvillo as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Knight.

294
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:37,814
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

295
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,149
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed, motion passes.

296
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,173
[SPEAKER_07]: 23-087 offered by Councilor Carviello.

297
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:54,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the code enforcement officer notify Tufts University that the city of Medford is no longer picking up mattresses left out on the street, so they can notify all students in Medford living off campus.

298
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:58,907
[SPEAKER_07]: The university has a list of all students living in apartments off campus in Medford.

299
00:23:58,967 --> 00:23:59,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Carviello.

300
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mayor President.

301
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:18,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all know every year when Tufts closes for the year, we see the furniture and mattresses all left, students just leave them all over the place and not something new.

302
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:21,816
[SPEAKER_06]: But this year, we're no longer picking up mattresses.

303
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,077
[SPEAKER_06]: There's now a fee.

304
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:30,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that the university should inform the students who are living off campus and they have a list that

305
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:35,047
[SPEAKER_06]: they need to call and pay for the mattresses that are gonna be left out there.

306
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:40,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've already called them a few times, the mattresses are already up there and school hasn't even closed yet.

307
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,470
[SPEAKER_06]: So not counting the furniture.

308
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:55,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the university could notify the students that the mattresses need to be called in, they're gonna have to pay to get rid of them and that they have to call waste manager when they get rid of the furniture also.

309
00:24:57,652 --> 00:25:05,679
[SPEAKER_06]: something that, you know, we say we go through this every single year, but let's see if we can get a little bit more under control, especially with the mattresses that we're not paying for.

310
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:06,540
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to pay for now.

311
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:07,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Carvajal.

312
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:08,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Behrs.

313
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:09,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam President.

314
00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:10,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this makes sense.

315
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:12,005
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important that Tufts do this.

316
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:15,949
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to note that the reason that that went into effect was a change in state law.

317
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,391
[SPEAKER_12]: The city didn't decide to change that.

318
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:19,692
[SPEAKER_12]: The state law changed on us.

319
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:22,455
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why this new policy is in effect around mattresses.

320
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:22,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

321
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:32,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, thank you very much and I think the council for bringing this initiative up by issue up raises a couple of interesting points.

322
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:45,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here in the city of Medford we have what's called the university accountability ordinance right as Councillor caveat noted down that provides us with a list of all the parcels were touched university students live in our community.

323
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:48,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have another ordinance called the clean it or lean it ordinance.

324
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,883
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering how these two ordinances would combine and intertwine, right?

325
00:25:54,003 --> 00:26:07,351
[SPEAKER_02]: If we actually sent our code enforcement officer out to remove the mattresses, could we then put a clean it and lean it on either the parcel or Tufts University where it's an extension of the campus?

326
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:17,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that it might make sense for us to try to see if that would be something we could tie to the university where we could use the clean it or lean it ordinance to see if we could get some relief in that regard.

327
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Tufts is pretty good at policing its own.

328
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:20,583
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no question about that.

329
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:34,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it comes down to us using the clean and lean and ordinance to promote and produce corrective action to bad behavior, I think Tufts would be on board because one thing they don't like doing is spending money.

330
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:40,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I think this is something that we can look at a little bit more.

331
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:43,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to get an opinion from the non-existent city solicitor.

332
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:55,638
[SPEAKER_02]: as to how these ordinances were intertwined and whether or not if we were going to utilize the clean, no-lead ordinance, would it be applied to the, could be applied to the university as opposed to the possible property owner?

333
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put that in the form of an amendment.

334
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:57,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

335
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to keep that until we have a city solicitor?

336
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:07,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like a KP law opinion on it?

337
00:27:07,243 --> 00:27:11,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because the administration isn't doing their part doesn't mean that we can stop, we have to stop doing ours.

338
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:12,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to continue to ask the questions.

339
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:16,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want to take that as a separate motion or as an amendment?

340
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the board's comfortable with.

341
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:20,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's one of the dozen of the others.

342
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll go with this.

343
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:27,010
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just hearing Dover Amendment, Dover Amendment, Dover Amendment.

344
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

345
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,312
[SPEAKER_12]: People don't get my joke that Tufts just says they're exempt from it, you know, pretty much.

346
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:35,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but they have, they pay taxes on Walnut Hill properties.

347
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:40,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I think it makes sense now, but you know, I'm just, well, these are possible that they don't necessarily own.

348
00:27:40,036 --> 00:27:40,736
[SPEAKER_07]: And that too, yeah.

349
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:41,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

350
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:41,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

351
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

352
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Clarification, it's a KP law.

353
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Boy, it's so serious.

354
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:52,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

355
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

356
00:27:56,202 --> 00:27:57,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at this point, it doesn't matter what we say.

357
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,263
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get what we're going to get, which is nothing.

358
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:07,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'll ask the question and let the administration, when they feel like we're going to have to do something with it, and whoever they send it to is fine with me because it's not going to move anyway, I'm pretty sure.

359
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:10,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Based upon my experience over the past 36 months.

360
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:11,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You're asking for a legal opinion?

361
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:12,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

362
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:20,511
[SPEAKER_08]: and Madam President, I support Council mates.

363
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:25,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, intense 1000% but anything that goes to K. P law, I will not support.

364
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate that.

365
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:31,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President, this is where this is kind of time sensitive.

366
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:38,958
[SPEAKER_06]: If we get asked to get done sooner rather than later, because I'd be happy to offer a separate paper, a second paper.

367
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So the code enforcement officer can do that, but make a notification.

368
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering, it's going to be made in a couple of weeks and the students be, you know.

369
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:50,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Madam President, what I would do is I would draw and just ask for the code enforcement officer to report back to us.

370
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we get that report back, we can look at it.

371
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe by then I can have some answers as to what's going to apply in one month.

372
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:56,324
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll satisfy everybody.

373
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:57,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

374
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have that amendment?

375
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

376
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:05,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

377
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

378
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:13,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Carviello as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by- Second.

379
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:14,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

380
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:16,073
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

381
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

382
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:17,594
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

383
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

384
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:21,478
[SPEAKER_07]: 23-088 offered by Councilor Carviello.

385
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:33,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Due to the increase in traffic on Main Street and Harvard Street be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the police department increased traffic patrols in that area, along with increased parking and enforcement especially on the weekends in the interest of public safety, Councilor Cabrillo.

386
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:34,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

387
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:45,807
[SPEAKER_06]: frequent the south method area the main in Main Street and Harvard Street intersection is really and that's another traffic intersection that's turned into a nightmare.

388
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,551
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've done traffic calming measures everywhere.

389
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:50,173
[SPEAKER_06]: We really haven't done anything.

390
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:52,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's at that intersection.

391
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:58,773
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got probably two of the most popular restaurants in the city across from each other.

392
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:07,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And the traffic nightmares are there, the parking nightmares, especially on Saturday and Sundays, traffic is just a total nightmare there.

393
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,382
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of accidents and it's unsafe.

394
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would ask the chief if he could step up patrols over there.

395
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:21,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And on Saturdays and Sundays, if they could step up parking enforcement, especially in the evening,

396
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:35,081
[SPEAKER_06]: so much in the day, you know, even in the day but going right right until you know 1011 o'clock at night, because I say that's a, it's a packed area, and the parking is limited for those, those two busy establishments.

397
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:36,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

398
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:38,702
[SPEAKER_07]: You further discussion from the council.

399
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:43,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I agree with what's being said.

400
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:49,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we last year we asked the city also also to pay attention to cut through traffic.

401
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:52,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we did get a report back.

402
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:59,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, I just wanted to note to the audience to people watching out there that, um, this this is important to us on the council.

403
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that, um, it's it's in addition to Harvard Street.

404
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:10,103
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also all the other parallel streets that are facing a lot of increased traffic and people were just speeding right right through as well.

405
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:12,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

406
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:13,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion from the council?

407
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:13,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I do see one.

408
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:17,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a hand up from Anthony D'Antonio on Zoom.

409
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:22,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll unmute you and just name and address for the record, please.

410
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:33,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. D'Antonio, would you like to speak?

411
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:33,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we go.

412
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:35,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there you go.

413
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:36,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

414
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:39,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear my address and name?

415
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:41,533
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 24 Hicks Avenue.

416
00:31:41,873 --> 00:31:44,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I wanna thank Councilor Carabiello for bringing this up.

417
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:53,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of the councilors have good intentions to try to get things done, but nothing gets done.

418
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:55,696
[SPEAKER_00]: All we hear about is, let's have a report from this one.

419
00:31:55,716 --> 00:31:56,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a report from that one.

420
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:57,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this, let's do that.

421
00:31:58,457 --> 00:31:59,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not working, number one.

422
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:02,738
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an influx of people down in South Medford.

423
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:07,979
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of children, a lot of parents, a lot of bicycles and bike riders.

424
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:11,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's treacherous down there.

425
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:21,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the traffic engineer had in mind when he put some of these rotaries in or some of these stop signs, which I think are misplaced and should be reviewed.

426
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:29,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm asking people, anybody in the council, you want to spend about 10 minutes with me.

427
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:38,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pick the day, Saturday, stand at the corner of Highland Main Street with me, and I'll show you exactly how dangerous that intersection is.

428
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:43,670
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on and on about the dangers, but you gotta see it to believe it.

429
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:50,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, not for anything, the car drivers are not the only ones that are causing a problem.

430
00:32:51,433 --> 00:33:03,036
[SPEAKER_00]: People on bikes, people on these bikes with their kids, with cabooses in the front and in the back, riding around on these heavily, you know, traffic streets, it's dangerous.

431
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:08,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what kind of a bus, a bike lane you put in, nobody pays attention to the rules, okay?

432
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:16,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hit two weeks ago in that intersection as a pedestrian.

433
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person that hit me took off, all right?

434
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:21,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody saw anything.

435
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:28,649
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the cars that were there that stopped took the guy's number down, okay?

436
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:31,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a guy because I was trying to catch up with him.

437
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:37,975
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was running down the street there, because I did get hurt, but my adrenaline was so pitched.

438
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,109
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to get this guy because he came, I was in the right.

439
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:43,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the right of way.

440
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:44,756
[SPEAKER_00]: He was wrong.

441
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:46,079
[SPEAKER_00]: He came right through the light.

442
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:47,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you,

443
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,462
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw my life flash before me.

444
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:51,663
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number seven.

445
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:52,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two more lives to go.

446
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it's serious.

447
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:56,448
[SPEAKER_00]: It's serious.

448
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:58,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you how serious it is.

449
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:01,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes on a Saturday morning, okay?

450
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:05,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget Sunday because it's pretty quiet there on a Sunday or even a Friday.

451
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:08,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I got a problem with is these school bus drivers.

452
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:11,789
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're all on the Indianapolis Speedway out there.

453
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:13,089
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous.

454
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:17,592
[SPEAKER_00]: They got these huge buses speeding down Willis Avenue, speeding down side streets.

455
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:19,514
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be enforcement.

456
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:21,595
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had enough of the excuses.

457
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:27,579
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to take the, you know, whatever the term is, I'm still banged up from that accident.

458
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not coming out all the way.

459
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever they do.

460
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,736
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it safer for pedestrians.

461
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:40,239
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's going to be at fault when the next person gets killed at the intersection there, because we have had fatalities there.

462
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:44,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bad intersection just in the way that it's placed geographically.

463
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:52,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, anybody, feel free to come with me, five minutes, 10 minutes, I'll even buy you a cup of coffee, maybe a Danish if you're nice.

464
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:54,065
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all I have to say.

465
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:59,207
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you again, Councilor Carrie Villela for bringing this up, appreciate it.

466
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,350
[SPEAKER_07]: were hit and hurt over there.

467
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you're here.

468
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:07,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, me too.

469
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:07,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

470
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:12,673
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only a Ford F-150, and that's, it's gotta be a lot bigger to take me out, trust me.

471
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:13,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, wow.

472
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Carvalho.

473
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:16,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

474
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:24,036
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as I mentioned about the traffic and the danger, you know, part of the problem comes from these food delivery services.

475
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:27,617
[SPEAKER_06]: They're stacking up there, they're parking, they're just double parking, leaving the car.

476
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,638
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a giant part of the problem there.

477
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,418
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I,

478
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:46,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a comment I made on the meeting before this one is that people forget that we have over 500,000 cars that traverse our roads from ride share services every year.

479
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a real number because we know how much we get paid

480
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:54,981
[SPEAKER_06]: for every ride that starts in Memphis, so you know those people are coming back.

481
00:35:55,521 --> 00:36:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are aggressive drivers, they don't know the roads, and that's a giant part of our traffic problem, especially down, you know, down, especially in that part of town, where there's a lot more students and younger people who depend more on those rideshare services.

482
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:17,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I do ask the Chief to step up some enforcement over there, especially on the weekends and in the evenings.

483
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:18,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

484
00:36:18,897 --> 00:36:19,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

485
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:29,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Morrell and Mr D Antonio I just wanted to share my, you know, and how unfortunately got hit in that intersection I'm glad to hear that you were doing okay but so sorry that you had to go through that.

486
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:30,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

487
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that it seems abundantly clear to me that.

488
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:45,149
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we talked about the particularly troublesome intersections in the city that particularly troublesome roads, there's so many of them I think it's just clear that roads were not our roads are not built for the Medford of today.

489
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:58,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So to fix it we need to, you know, approach the problem on all fronts to accommodate, you know, all of the road users that we see right now I think the counselor car VL brings up a really good point which is, you know,

490
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: several decades ago, we didn't have ride share companies inundating the streets.

491
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:03,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have these delivery companies.

492
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I notice all the time.

493
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It drives me bananas when I see delivery drivers blocking traffic, blocking parking spaces, blocking bike lanes.

494
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:16,399
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of new dangers and there's just a lot more cars on the road than there used to be.

495
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So clearly we need to marshal all of our city resources to make sure that people can cross the street, can get where they're going without

496
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,405
[SPEAKER_03]: without being hurt or have to fear getting hurt.

497
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:33,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Councilor Carvialho for putting this forward I think it's one part of the puzzle and Mr. D'Antonio I hope you're feeling better very soon.

498
00:37:35,392 --> 00:37:35,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

499
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:42,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Carvialho seconded by Councilor Knight.

500
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:44,140
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

501
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,422
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed motion passes.

502
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Communications from the mayor, 23-089.

503
00:37:53,401 --> 00:38:00,043
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to waive the reading of the, we have a food truck permit before us.

504
00:38:00,183 --> 00:38:04,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion of Councilor Knight to waive the reading and approve, seconded by Councilor Collins.

505
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:07,185
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

506
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:08,966
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

507
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:10,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

508
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:13,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I do see we have Mr. Gray from Neighborhood Produce.

509
00:38:13,647 --> 00:38:14,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion passes.

510
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:15,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You are all good.

511
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:17,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

512
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:19,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam President.

513
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:23,499
[SPEAKER_12]: motion to take and I apologize.

514
00:38:24,441 --> 00:38:26,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me one second.

515
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:26,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

516
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:27,347
[SPEAKER_12]: We have one more.

517
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:27,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Never mind.

518
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:28,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll wait.

519
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:28,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

520
00:38:30,654 --> 00:38:30,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

521
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:40,790
[SPEAKER_07]: 23-091, request for expenditure from law department claims over $1,000, account 010-151-5762.

522
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:46,975
[SPEAKER_07]: To President Nicole Morrell and honorable members of the city council, from Brianna Lungo, current mayor.

523
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Claimant name, Valerie Spinelli.

524
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:51,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Date of accident, February 3rd, 2021.

525
00:38:51,338 --> 00:38:54,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Date of settlement, March 27th, 2023.

526
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:57,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Date of trial result, not applicable.

527
00:38:58,075 --> 00:39:23,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, amount requested $3,450 claimants attorney clerk and Sinclair and refuse LLP description of alleged claim the claimant USAA casualty insurance company also serving as I don't know what those little constants away seeks compensation for a claim paid to their insured for property damage suffered when a Medford firetruck stuck the struck the side of the insurance vehicle ballpark on Surge's Street in Metro Massachusetts on or about March 8 2018.

528
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,440
[SPEAKER_07]: the necessary release has been obtained from the claimant.

529
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:36,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Breakdown of amount requested, medical costs zero, lost wages zero, property damage $3,450, others zero, total settlement $3,450.

530
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:40,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, motion to send this back to the legal department.

531
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:43,302
[SPEAKER_02]: We have here a date of accident, February 3rd, 2021.

532
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:48,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when we read the description of the alleged claim, it says that the accident happened on or around March 8th, 2018.

533
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:51,124
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big discrepancy.

534
00:39:52,386 --> 00:40:01,511
[SPEAKER_02]: like to make sure if we're going to be spending money and this is a legal document, legal document that's going to be bound by law once the council approves it, that we're approving something that's accurate.

535
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:17,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't appear to me that this is an accurate description of what happened when we have two different dates of accidents on the same document, which is, again, just another reflection as to why we should probably have an in-house city solicitor, instead of a hired gun that we're using to do all of our legal services for the mayor's office, as opposed to the city of Medford and its people.

536
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I'd offer a motion to send this back to the legal department for

537
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:24,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

538
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:25,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor.

539
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:26,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no problem with that.

540
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:40,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but I just want to also state that this is the first, uh, paper over $1000 that we've seen in a while, and, uh, I'm hoping that this means that we're going to be seeing all the settlements over $1000 going forward for our approval, which is required.

541
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:41,358
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

542
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

543
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

544
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:49,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank Council bears because that was my my my response to make a motion that, um,

545
00:40:50,392 --> 00:41:13,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, this isn't the only settlement that we're looking at over $1,000 and to get a breakdown of all the settlements that have been forgotten or bypassed or not reported, I think we should ask for a report because this, like Councilor Knight said, for years,

546
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:15,113
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a long time ago.

547
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:23,298
[SPEAKER_08]: And to say that because if to say that was the only one is pretty frightening considering in the past years that I've been on the council.

548
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:34,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've by this time of the year we've all always seen about six to seven close to eight settlements that we've seen with either pothole incidents.

549
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:43,076
[SPEAKER_08]: city vehicles, hitting different vehicles, or even trip and fall accidents.

550
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:49,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So, again, Council and I brings up the point that that I find very frightening is that

551
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,593
[SPEAKER_08]: we're not seeing what's really happening.

552
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:55,235
[SPEAKER_08]: This lack of transparency is frightening.

553
00:41:56,436 --> 00:42:12,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to make it a motion that we ask the city, the mayor's office or the chief of staff to get back to us with any information or settlements that we've had, even in a spreadsheet form so we know what's coming.

554
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:16,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's important because I,

555
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:23,990
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is, this is frightening the fact that 2018, the sense that it happened and the reporting dates are so off.

556
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Madam President.

557
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to take that as a beat paper?

558
00:42:26,951 --> 00:42:27,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

559
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:27,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

560
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:27,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

561
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:29,092
[SPEAKER_07]: This is embarrassing.

562
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:29,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

563
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:30,052
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to add to that.

564
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:31,153
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that makes perfect sense.

565
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:36,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause if you look at the Warren articles we got sent, I didn't do it a specific count, but there were dozens of settlements in there.

566
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:41,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, many of them over a thousand dollars that we never saw quite frankly,

567
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:48,877
[SPEAKER_12]: and not to single you out Councilor Knight but didn't you receive a settlement for for damage $2,149 and 68 cents for two tires and a rim.

568
00:42:48,917 --> 00:43:03,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I did Councilor Bish and speaks to the state of our roads and the money we need to put into that but also speaks to the fact that I don't think we've been driving one of the well maybe both but we didn't vote on that I don't believe right, and you obviously would have voted present or abstained but I'm just saying.

569
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:07,637
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm just saying it never came before us.

570
00:43:08,277 --> 00:43:13,322
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, again, I think there were probably dozens of those in the Warren articles that we saw over the past couple of years.

571
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:17,766
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, you know, it's just kind of the basic due diligence that needs to be happening.

572
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:18,787
[SPEAKER_12]: It isn't happening, so.

573
00:43:19,668 --> 00:43:20,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Rivera.

574
00:43:20,649 --> 00:43:21,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

575
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a B paper first from Councilor Scarpelli.

576
00:43:24,713 --> 00:43:25,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, can you read back?

577
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:31,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli has a B paper requesting that the Mayor or the Chief of Staff

578
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:38,180
[SPEAKER_09]: report back to the council as a spreadsheet, if necessary, on all the legal settlements to date.

579
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:40,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we just amend that to include judgments as well?

580
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:41,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Settlements and judgments.

581
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:52,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the B paper from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

582
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:53,113
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

583
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,654
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

584
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:55,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

585
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the main paper from

586
00:43:58,744 --> 00:44:02,806
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a motion from Councillor Knight to send back to the legal department because of conflicting dates.

587
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

588
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:04,867
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

589
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:06,228
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

590
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:06,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

591
00:44:06,788 --> 00:44:08,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Carville.

592
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:12,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Scarpelli's motion is something I asked for, I think, three months ago.

593
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:16,693
[SPEAKER_06]: That we get a list of all the settlements and I haven't seen it.

594
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:18,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Settlements are different.

595
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe they said the judgments.

596
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:27,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Settlements and judgments are different, but we can ask for executive session to review those, can't we?

597
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:31,546
[SPEAKER_10]: We can ask, they don't have to oblige.

598
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:32,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, let's ask.

599
00:44:32,846 --> 00:44:41,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you've seen the KP law, what was given to us, close to half a million dollars, and I still don't believe that that's a true number.

600
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Transparency.

601
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:47,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Bares, you had a, you were moving on something?

602
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:49,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you vote on this?

603
00:44:49,973 --> 00:44:50,194
[SPEAKER_07]: We did.

604
00:44:50,214 --> 00:44:52,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we voted to send it back to

605
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:54,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right, great.

606
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:55,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, sorry.

607
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:03,218
[SPEAKER_12]: On paper, can we take paper, motion to take paper 23-052 from the table and approve for third reading.

608
00:45:03,238 --> 00:45:11,544
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the amendment to Appendix A of the Code of Ordinance, which just adds the fee for the planned development district, which we created in the zoning ordinance.

609
00:45:11,564 --> 00:45:19,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a motion from Vice Mayor Behrs to take 23-052 off the table and to pass for a third reading, seconded by Councilor Sang.

610
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:21,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

611
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:39,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Shuffle survey.

612
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:39,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

613
00:45:39,746 --> 00:45:39,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

614
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:40,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

615
00:45:40,686 --> 00:45:40,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

616
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:41,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

617
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:42,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven.

618
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:47,768
[SPEAKER_10]: The infirmary is there in the night of the motion passes for third reading.

619
00:45:56,096 --> 00:45:56,356
[SPEAKER_07]: public.

620
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:58,917
[SPEAKER_07]: So public participation anyone.

621
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:02,518
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no one in the chambers anyone on zoom would like to participate for public participation.

622
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:06,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none.

623
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:09,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he was, I saw him.

624
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I saw him before he's not here right now.

625
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:21,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to Councilor Scott motion to adjourn seconded by second person bears all those in favor.

626
00:46:21,784 --> 00:46:23,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed opposition from Councilor night.

627
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes, meeting adjourned.
