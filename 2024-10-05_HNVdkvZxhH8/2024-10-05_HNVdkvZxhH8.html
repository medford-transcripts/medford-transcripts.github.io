    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=330.008s">Good</a>  evening, Madam President Morell and esteemed body of our city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=336.272s">Thank</a>  you, City Councilors, all of you for having me this evening to present our resubmission of the MSBA statement of input statement of interest application. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=348.981s">We</a>  submitted a year ago and we've submitted many years in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=353.424s">This</a>  past year, we were very close, but <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=358.685s">based</a>  on the feedback that we had received, the amount of schools that were approved this past year was a smaller number. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=368.031s">And</a>  as a result of that, we just weren't able to make the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=372.594s">We</a>  didn't make the cut, but we were given very positive feedback to resubmit our application, which we have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=381.294s">This</a>  evening, I'm requesting the entire city council if you would approve Medford Public Schools reapplication for the statement of interest for the core program for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=396.781s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=397.302s">I'm</a>  available to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=399.963s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=400.743s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=401.804s">Madam</a>  Superintendent, how does this application differ from years past and what changes were made based upon the feedback that you mentioned that you received? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=409.047s">Obviously,</a>  we haven't been able to secure this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=411.193s">funding</a>  now for multiple years, we're getting feedback from the point the enabling authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=418.258s">So</a>  what changes are we making to the application to maybe enhance our chances.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=422.28s">So,</a>  we had a very strong application, again this past year, and because the number of schools that were awarded this year was a reduced number. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=433.868s">Unfortunately,</a>  we, we just missed that cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=437.463s">and</a>  we were encouraged by the MSBA to resubmit for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=442.045s">There</a>  is one key difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=444.526s">In</a>  previous years, MSBA was having two programs, the accelerated repair program and the core program. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=453.03s">This</a>  current year, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=454.464s">They</a>  are not accepting applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=456.525s">They're</a>  not doing the accelerated repair program. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=459.186s">It's</a>  only the core program. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=460.786s">So</a>  we're resubmitting our application from last year with the addition of a few things that have surfaced at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=470.63s">We</a>  had pipes bursting and some asbestos work for tiles that had popped on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=478.152s">So</a>  we did have additional work <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=480.317s">that</a>  needed to be done because the building is aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=484.92s">And</a>  so we are reapplying for the core program and MSBA will come back out if we're approved, if our statement of interest is approved, they will come back out and do a senior study and follow the appropriate steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=501.293s">And</a>  I also want to say that this is just, today's request is permission to, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=507.663s">reapply</a>  with the statement of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=510.144s">But</a>  as we continue with MSBA, there will be multiple opportunities to come before your body and respond to questions and let you know the status of what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=522.008s">MSBA</a>  just does not want a school district on their own to go and say, we're putting in this application and not have the support of both the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=535.012s">The</a>  school committee did approve it last week for us to move forward, and my request is that the city council will allow us to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=545.797s">I</a>  think we should continue to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=547.778s">We</a>  know that the high school needs work, and I feel very confident in our resubmission and based on the feedback that we received that we should not give up but move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=562.325s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=563.312s">So</a>  on that, Madam President, so the one difference, the difference is nothing other than the fact that we moved some items that were covered under the accelerated repair grant from last year over to the school grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=572.655s">That's</a>  what I'm understanding.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=574.296s">Is</a>  that correct, Mr. Lieutenant?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=575.676s">It's</a>  the same exact application as last year with the addition of these infrastructure items that were under the accelerated repair grant being moved over to this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=583.102s">Is</a>  that accurate?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=584.162s">The</a>  additional pieces that I just shared were things that happened this year since we applied.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=589.943s">The</a>  question they asked was, you know, how does this application differ from years past?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=593.004s">So</a>  that's what it was, yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=594.544s">So</a>  that one item, right, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=596.265s">All</a>  right, yeah, I was looking, because I had my files, I was looking, I usually have my files nice and organized, but I can't find the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=602.986s">Someone</a>  must have moved them, so that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=604.526s">But</a>  I was looking to see if I could look at last year's application and see if we could take a look at that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=608.807s">But</a>  I didn't have it in my files yet, because my filing system's a little screwy. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=612.948s">But</a>  I'm looking at this so ultimately, this is the same application that we submitted last year with a couple of additions that application is the same application we submitted the year before.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=622.814s">No,</a>  it's not identical year before last year's application was was significantly different brought in consultants and had additional help in terms of how we structured the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=636.152s">And</a>  so last year's application was looked upon very favorably, and we did advance to the next phase of senior study, which is promising. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=645.216s">Some</a>  districts do not advance even to that phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=648.597s">So</a>  we were able to advance to the second phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=653.359s">And</a>  again, we did receive positive feedback from MSBA to definitely reapply. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=660.081s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=662.212s">That's,</a>  that's why we're reapplying resubmitting the application was the additions, what was the consultants cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=669.857s">I</a>  do not have the cost of the consultant right now but we did secure additional support. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=678.042s">And</a>  I don't, I can get that number to you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=682.225s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=682.705s">I'm</a>  just seeing, you know, a lot of money being spent that's not being spent in the classroom, and I'd like to take a look at that as we get prepared for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=691.667s">Madam</a>  President, ultimately, you know, it's pretty cut and dry, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=693.988s">It's</a>  an application we submit every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=695.309s">All</a>  we're doing is asking for free money, so I don't see any reason why we shouldn't support it and move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=700.111s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=701.091s">A</a>  motion from Councilor Knight for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=702.572s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=703.992s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=704.612s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Superintendent, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=705.993s">I</a>  certainly agree with Councilor Knight's point that this is something that we submit regularly and we should submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=712.836s">I'm</a>  really grateful to hear that the improved application that was submitted last year was seen significantly better than prior applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=719.418s">I</a>  think that's great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=720.359s">I</a>  think it <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=721.295s">reflects</a>  the work that went into that, you know, I think the big issue that we're, you know, not necessarily dancing around I think we're trying to go at it right is that the city doesn't have enough resources to replace school buildings, the state has determined that cities don't have the resources to replace school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=738.653s">and</a>  created the MSBA for the purpose that we need new school buildings in the Commonwealth and obviously I'm in for high school needs that I think, you know, maybe many, many of us behind this real can attest to it but Councilor Tseng and I probably most recently and, and, you know, my locker was in the very cold overpass on the second floor of C building, and, you know, while I appreciate Medford High School in the building for what it is significant improvements need to be made you know I for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=765.845s">I'm</a>  just hopeful that we can get into this program and that the state will recognize our need. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=773.115s">The</a>  building has major, major, major needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=776.985s">not</a>  just the HVAC systems and the infrastructure and the structure of the building or the AV or the technology or all of that, but quite frankly, just the size of the building, it's not built for the group that's there now, it's not built for the team that's there now and that causes issues and those issues need to be addressed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=794.437s">So</a>  I'm really hopeful that MSBA will accept our application and we can start to move forward those important community discussions about addressing Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=803.304s">So</a>  thank you for submitting this and I'll be supporting it.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=806.437s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=807.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=808.698s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=811.9s">I</a>  was there when the building was new. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=813.68s">I</a>  was a second graduating class. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=817.162s">So</a>  it's 52 years old now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=819.243s">And</a>  I've seen the wear and tear that's gone over the building over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=823.665s">And</a>  I've toured the building with the previous superintendent see all the boilers and things that, and I agree that <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=830.861s">you</a>  know, ask for everything and we get whatever we get. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=833.602s">So</a>  it's something I supported over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=835.763s">I</a>  was also here when we, you know, when we got the money for the science labs and the technical school, I think, you know, I think the money was well spent there and the renovations come out good. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=845.226s">So</a>  again, this will be something I support again and hopefully we'll get what we need this time to keep the school moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=855.229s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=855.729s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=856.77s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=859.561s">I</a>  wanted to first reiterate some points from last year when this came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=865.509s">Back</a>  then, I mentioned a lot of the needs that I saw when I was a student there about five years ago, so not that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=874.742s">where</a>  a building had flood and their needs in their heating problems and overpasses and a lot of different heat, I mean, even heating problems in their classrooms, sunlight problems and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=889.225s">I</a>  encourage anyone who's not, who wants to learn more about why this is important to read the application itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=896.267s">You</a>  guys have, your team has put together, I think, in very clear language, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=902.088s">many</a>  of the problems that we're seeing in the high school that doesn't match the education that we're providing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=909.014s">And</a>  I think we're seeing that the physical building doesn't match the quality of the instruction that's in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=917.501s">And</a>  that by improving the physical building itself, we can hopefully bring more pride to Medford and shine a light to the good work that's happening inside the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=928.61s">And</a>  to <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=931.412s">As</a>  a student there I know that it can be a very bluntly said drab and depressing environment to study in, and I would want for future students at Medford a happier place and a more encouraging environment to work in, a physical environment to work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=948.735s">I</a>  think it's important for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=953.137s">I</a>  mean, this is an issue that came up on the doorstep time and time again, especially from parents, but even the parents of graduates, of students who've already left Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=964.341s">This</a>  is, I think, an issue that much of the community can unite around. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=972.645s">given</a>  the importance that everyone sees, there might be different approaches to what we do with the building exactly, but it's really important to take the steps that allow us to have as many options on the table as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=983.072s">And</a>  a yes vote on the council tonight allows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=986.734s">And</a>  as we were chatting before this meeting, we mentioned, you know, it's super encouraging that they asked us to reapply. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=994.779s">It's</a>  great to see that there have been even more improvements made to the application this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1001.313s">And,</a>  you know, it's about trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1005.736s">It's</a>  about trying whenever we can and keep pushing for it, because we don't know what year it's gonna happen.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1015.704s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1017.085s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1057.737s">Yes,</a>  and looking through our responses that we received, I just like to point out, Council response to paper 23048 from my state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1067.788s">This</a>  was a request made by the city council to ask that the dot and DCR provide some routine roadwork and. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1077.533s">Representative</a>  Donato has gotten back to us, saying that both the DOT and the DCR have indicated that their repairs have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1084.097s">However,</a>  if we go right to this on-ramp right here, right beside City Hall, the repairs aren't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1089.819s">So</a>  maybe we could just ask that the administration follow up on that request, please.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1096.543s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1097.143s">I</a>  can follow up with the mayor on that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1121.541s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1122.381s">This</a>  is something I've had a discussion with the chief about, and especially around the Mystic Avenue area, is we've got a lot of repair shops coming to Metro because they've been pushed out of Somerville and Cambridge, so they're all coming here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1137.273s">And</a>  what's happening is they're moving into these small lots, these small garages, and parts are getting harder to come by, and cars are sitting there longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1145.538s">You're</a>  now parking the cars all over the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1149.16s">And</a>  as I say, it's a discussion I have with the chief many times, and the chief says, he says, I can't enforce an ordinance that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1157.605s">So</a>  tonight I'm proposing that we have an ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1163.038s">set</a>  up for body shops, toe shops, and garages, service facilities, not the parked cars in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1171.115s">Because</a>  what's happening, they just, if you go by like Columbia Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1175.067s">The</a>  whole street is all cars parked from the other garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1179.469s">You</a>  go by down Swan Street, all cars parked from the garages there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1184.03s">No</a>  matter where you go, you're seeing all these garages just parking the cars in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1187.872s">They're</a>  doing repairs on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1189.532s">So</a>  I think we need an ordinance to make sure that they keep the limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1194.074s">to</a>  what their permit was for the amount of cars in the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1197.515s">No</a>  on-street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1199.556s">Councilor</a>  Bears, I think is the head of that committee, subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1202.696s">I</a>  gave him some of those ordinances, which was pretty simple and concise, and I think it will address the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1210.939s">So</a>  I would hope that the subcommittee of ordinances would take this up as soon as possible so we can get that out there and we can start cleaning up our streets.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1221.902s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1223.506s">Madam</a>  President, this is an issue that I've discussed in the past as well and I think it's really an issue of parking capacity, you know, we issue a permit to a repair shop, but we really don't put any restrictions or confines on parking capacity based upon the size of the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1238.357s">So</a>  if you drive down Mystic Gap, the first <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1240.939s">two</a>  shops you'll see in probably what Volsar and Atech. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1243.861s">If</a>  you look at the parking lot at Atech, I mean, you can't fit a piece of paper between the cars in the parking lot there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1248.844s">There</a>  must be 35 cars in this very small parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1252.047s">Now,</a>  you know, we approved the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1253.768s">I</a>  have no problem with these people trying to make a buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1255.829s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1256.43s">It's</a>  the American way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1258.011s">But,</a>  you know, at the end of the day, it's also creating issues where <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1262.106s">These</a>  lots appear overcrowded and unsightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1264.827s">Mystic</a>  Avenue, for example, is a gateway road to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1267.988s">So</a>  we're going to drive from Somerville into Medford, and that gateway road is going to look like an industrial park, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1274.29s">The</a>  condition of the roadway is bad enough as it is, but now to have, you know, unsightly businesses that really aren't a welcoming business to the community, I think is something we need to talk about as we go into our meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1285.113s">Also,</a>  it raises, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1287.468s">issues</a>  about safety, whether or not these lots are questionably safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1292.729s">If</a>  you have a parking lot with 25 cars in there, how can you get a fire engine in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1298.131s">These</a>  repair shops, they have flammables, they have combustibles, and it puts us in a position where we may be putting our <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1307.11s">first</a>  responders and our fire personnel at risk in responding to these, to cause these locations because of the overcrowding of the parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1314.472s">So</a>  these are definitely things that we need to take into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1316.313s">And</a>  I might just ask that this be set to fire prevention as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1320.054s">So</a>  that fire prevention can be provided the opportunity to pipe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1323.796s">It's</a>  all too often when we talk about permitting a new business, we talk about the parking and the impacts that it's gonna have on the community, but we don't really think about the impact that it's gonna have on fire safety and fire prevention as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1334.059s">So</a>  I just ask that this paper be sent to the fire chief.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1337.313s">Would</a>  you like that as an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1340.195s">Or</a>  is this embarrassed?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1341.076s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1342.718s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1344.179s">I</a>  think definitely we can move on this right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1348.482s">I've</a>  heard making sure at least that the chief has consulted in some way the fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1353.286s">Probably</a>  going to want to bring the traffic folks down from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1356.949s">But</a>  is there anyone else that you want us to invite to that meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1363.495s">Code</a>  enforcement in the building, Commissioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1364.956s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1365.957s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1366.912s">Great</a>  yeah and I agree with the point that you made again I don't know what property this was on in the area I don't know if it was a car shop and I'm just saying that to put that out there in advance because I know if I don't say that people will be frustrated but we did have, there was a fire, and there was a someone who was, I believe, killed in that fire in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1384.324s">And</a>  again I don't know the circumstance I'm not saying it was because of car parking or anything but again I think it just speaks to your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1389.859s">around</a>  is that even the best use in the area? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1391.76s">And</a>  that's a long conversation and I know a lot of people obviously have livelihoods that depend on the businesses there, but I also think we can't just be packing, packing, packing cars and car repair shops in that area without addressing the negative effects that may come from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1405.427s">So</a>  we'll work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1406.648s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1408.249s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1409.249s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1411.571s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1417.154s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1418.708s">All</a>  those opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1420.169s">23-087</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1424.634s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the Medford City Council have the code enforcement officer notify Tufts University that the city of Medford is no longer picking up mattresses left out on the street, so they can notify all students in Medford living off campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1435.284s">The</a>  university has a list of all students living in apartments off campus in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1438.967s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1441.48s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1442.381s">I</a>  think we all know every year when Tufts closes for the year, we see the furniture and mattresses all left, students just leave them all over the place and not something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1459.214s">But</a>  this year, we're no longer picking up mattresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1461.836s">There's</a>  now a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1463.798s">So</a>  I think that the university should inform the students who are living off campus and they have a list that <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1471.585s">they</a>  need to call and pay for the mattresses that are gonna be left out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1475.367s">I</a>  mean, I've already called them a few times, the mattresses are already up there and school hasn't even closed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1481.03s">So</a>  not counting the furniture. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1482.49s">So</a>  if the university could notify the students that the mattresses need to be called in, they're gonna have to pay to get rid of them and that they have to call waste manager when they get rid of the furniture also. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1497.652s">something</a>  that, you know, we say we go through this every single year, but let's see if we can get a little bit more under control, especially with the mattresses that we're not paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1505.699s">We</a>  have to pay for now.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1507.201s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1507.921s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1508.902s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1509.823s">I</a>  think this makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1510.704s">I</a>  think it's important that Tufts do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1512.045s">I</a>  just want to note that the reason that that went into effect was a change in state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1516.349s">The</a>  city didn't decide to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1518.471s">The</a>  state law changed on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1519.772s">So</a>  that's why this new policy is in effect around mattresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1522.575s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1524.941s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much and I think the council for bringing this initiative up by issue up raises a couple of interesting points. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1533.427s">So,</a>  here in the city of Medford we have what's called the university accountability ordinance right as Councilor caveat noted down that provides us with a list of all the parcels were touched university students live in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1545.894s">And</a>  we also have another ordinance called the clean it or lean it ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1550.041s">So</a>  I'm wondering how these two ordinances would combine and intertwine, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1554.003s">If</a>  we actually sent our code enforcement officer out to remove the mattresses, could we then put a clean it and lean it on either the parcel or Tufts University where it's an extension of the campus? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1567.431s">I</a>  mean, I think that it might make sense for us to try to see if that would be something we could tie to the university where we could use the clean it or lean it ordinance to see if we could get some relief in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1577.856s">Tufts</a>  is pretty good at policing its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1579.582s">There's</a>  no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1580.763s">And</a>  if it comes down to us using the clean and lean and ordinance to promote and produce corrective action to bad behavior, I think Tufts would be on board because one thing they don't like doing is spending money. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1595.152s">So</a>  with that being said, I think this is something that we can look at a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1600.676s">I'd</a>  like to get an opinion from the non-existent city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1604.274s">as</a>  to how these ordinances were intertwined and whether or not if we were going to utilize the clean, no-lead ordinance, would it be applied to the, could be applied to the university as opposed to the possible property owner? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1616.159s">I'll</a>  put that in the form of an amendment.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1617.299s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1619.12s">Would</a>  you like to keep that until we have a city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1621.441s">Would</a>  you like a KP law opinion on it?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1627.243s">Just</a>  because the administration isn't doing their part doesn't mean that we can stop, we have to stop doing ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1631.244s">So</a>  I'm going to continue to ask the questions.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1634.624s">So</a>  you want to take that as a separate motion or as an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1637.385s">Whatever</a>  the board's comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1639.386s">Either</a>  way, it's one of the dozen of the others.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1641.707s">Okay,</a>  we'll go with this.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1643.328s">I'm</a>  just hearing Dover Amendment, Dover Amendment, Dover Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1647.03s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1648.89s">People</a>  don't get my joke that Tufts just says they're exempt from it, you know, pretty much.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1652.332s">Right,</a>  but they have, they pay taxes on Walnut Hill properties.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1655.294s">Yeah,</a>  so I think it makes sense now, but you know, I'm just, well, these are possible that they don't necessarily own.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1660.036s">And</a>  that too, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1660.756s">Right,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1661.256s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1664.52s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1666.38s">Clarification,</a>  it's a KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1669.041s">Boy,</a>  it's so serious.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1672.161s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1675.642s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1676.202s">I</a>  mean, at this point, it doesn't matter what we say. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1677.802s">We're</a>  going to get what we're going to get, which is nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1679.683s">So,</a>  you know, I'll ask the question and let the administration, when they feel like we're going to have to do something with it, and whoever they send it to is fine with me because it's not going to move anyway, I'm pretty sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1687.724s">Based</a>  upon my experience over the past 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1690.584s">You're</a>  asking for a legal opinion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1691.825s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1695.205s">and</a>  Madam President, I support Council mates. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1700.531s">Uh,</a>  intense 1000% but anything that goes to K. P law, I will not support. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1705.836s">So</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1709.395s">Madam</a>  President, this is where this is kind of time sensitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1712.616s">If</a>  we get asked to get done sooner rather than later, because I'd be happy to offer a separate paper, a second paper.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1718.978s">So</a>  the code enforcement officer can do that, but make a notification.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1722.92s">I'm</a>  just wondering, it's going to be made in a couple of weeks and the students be, you know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1726.261s">Actually,</a>  Madam President, what I would do is I would draw and just ask for the code enforcement officer to report back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1730.542s">And</a>  then when we get that report back, we can look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1732.563s">And</a>  maybe by then I can have some answers as to what's going to apply in one month. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1735.384s">That'll</a>  satisfy everybody.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1774.007s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1776.875s">frequent</a>  the south method area the main in Main Street and Harvard Street intersection is really and that's another traffic intersection that's turned into a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1785.827s">You</a>  know, we've done traffic calming measures everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1788.951s">We</a>  really haven't done anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1791.134s">And</a>  that's at that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1794.629s">You've</a>  got probably two of the most popular restaurants in the city across from each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1800.414s">And</a>  the traffic nightmares are there, the parking nightmares, especially on Saturday and Sundays, traffic is just a total nightmare there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1808.561s">There's</a>  a lot of accidents and it's unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1811.243s">So</a>  I would ask the chief if he could step up patrols over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1814.966s">And</a>  on Saturdays and Sundays, if they could step up parking enforcement, especially in the evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1822.317s">so</a>  much in the day, you know, even in the day but going right right until you know 1011 o'clock at night, because I say that's a, it's a packed area, and the parking is limited for those, those two busy establishments.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1900.392s">It's</a>  24 Hicks Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1901.873s">Listen,</a>  I wanna thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1905.554s">And</a>  I know a lot of the councilors have good intentions to try to get things done, but nothing gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1913.656s">All</a>  we hear about is, let's have a report from this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1915.716s">Let's</a>  get a report from that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1916.876s">Let's</a>  do this, let's do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1918.457s">It's</a>  not working, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1919.997s">We</a>  have an influx of people down in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1923.158s">A</a>  lot of children, a lot of parents, a lot of bicycles and bike riders. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1929.186s">And</a>  it's treacherous down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1932.447s">I</a>  don't know what the traffic engineer had in mind when he put some of these rotaries in or some of these stop signs, which I think are misplaced and should be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1942.409s">And</a>  I'm asking people, anybody in the council, you want to spend about 10 minutes with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1949.671s">I'll</a>  pick the day, Saturday, stand at the corner of Highland Main Street with me, and I'll show you exactly how dangerous that intersection is. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1959.869s">I</a>  could go on and on about the dangers, but you gotta see it to believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1964.25s">And</a>  you know, not for anything, the car drivers are not the only ones that are causing a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1971.433s">People</a>  on bikes, people on these bikes with their kids, with cabooses in the front and in the back, riding around on these heavily, you know, traffic streets, it's dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1983.196s">I</a>  don't care what kind of a bus, a bike lane you put in, nobody pays attention to the rules, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1990.476s">I</a>  got hit two weeks ago in that intersection as a pedestrian. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1996.7s">And</a>  the person that hit me took off, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2000.663s">Nobody</a>  saw anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2002.865s">None</a>  of the cars that were there that stopped took the guy's number down, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2008.969s">And</a>  it was a guy because I was trying to catch up with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2012.371s">And</a>  as I was running down the street there, because I did get hurt, but my adrenaline was so pitched. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2018.74s">that</a>  I wanted to get this guy because he came, I was in the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2022.349s">I</a>  had the right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2024.054s">He</a>  was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2024.876s">He</a>  came right through the light. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2026.881s">And</a>  I'm telling you, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2028.9s">He</a>  saw my life flash before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2030.722s">So</a>  that's number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2031.703s">I</a>  got two more lives to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2033.385s">Anyway,</a>  it's serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2035.928s">It's</a>  serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2036.689s">And</a>  I'm going to show you how serious it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2039.051s">Five</a>  minutes on a Saturday morning, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2042.395s">Forget</a>  Sunday because it's pretty quiet there on a Sunday or even a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2045.618s">And</a>  the other thing I got a problem with is these school bus drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2049.267s">They</a>  think they're all on the Indianapolis Speedway out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2052.249s">It's</a>  dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2053.129s">They</a>  got these huge buses speeding down Willis Avenue, speeding down side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2058.113s">There</a>  has to be enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2060.094s">We've</a>  had enough of the excuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2062.315s">It's</a>  time to take the, you know, whatever the term is, I'm still banged up from that accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2067.599s">So</a>  it's not coming out all the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2070.18s">Whatever</a>  they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2071.795s">to</a>  make it safer for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2074.336s">So</a>  who's going to be at fault when the next person gets killed at the intersection there, because we have had fatalities there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2080.999s">And</a>  it's a bad intersection just in the way that it's placed geographically. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2085.441s">So</a>  please, anybody, feel free to come with me, five minutes, 10 minutes, I'll even buy you a cup of coffee, maybe a Danish if you're nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2092.404s">But</a>  that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2094.085s">And</a>  thank you again, Councilor Carrie Villela for bringing this up, appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2102.19s">were</a>  hit and hurt over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2103.37s">I'm</a>  glad you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2105.711s">Yeah,</a>  me too. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2107.411s">Yeah,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2108.312s">It</a>  was only a Ford F-150, and that's, it's gotta be a lot bigger to take me out, trust me.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2113.113s">Wow,</a>  wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2114.093s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2115.854s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2116.974s">You</a>  know, as I mentioned about the traffic and the danger, you know, part of the problem comes from these food delivery services. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2124.496s">They're</a>  stacking up there, they're parking, they're just double parking, leaving the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2128.417s">That's</a>  a giant part of the problem there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2129.878s">You</a>  know, and I, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2131.433s">It's</a>  a comment I made on the meeting before this one is that people forget that we have over 500,000 cars that traverse our roads from ride share services every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2147.317s">And</a>  that's a real number because we know how much we get paid <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2150.758s">for</a>  every ride that starts in Medford, so you know those people are coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2155.521s">And</a>  these are aggressive drivers, they don't know the roads, and that's a giant part of our traffic problem, especially down, you know, down, especially in that part of town, where there's a lot more students and younger people who depend more on those rideshare services. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2170.372s">So</a>  again, I do ask the Chief to step up some enforcement over there, especially on the weekends and in the evenings.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2178.057s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2178.897s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2180.284s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell and Mr. D Antonio I just wanted to share my, you know, and how unfortunately got hit in that intersection I'm glad to hear that you were doing okay but so sorry that you had to go through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2190.018s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2190.88s">You</a>  know, I think that it seems abundantly clear to me that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2195.446s">You</a>  know, we talked about the particularly troublesome intersections in the city that particularly troublesome roads, there's so many of them I think it's just clear that roads were not our roads are not built for the Medford of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2205.389s">So</a>  to fix it we need to, you know, approach the problem on all fronts to accommodate, you know, all of the road users that we see right now I think the Councilor car VL brings up a really good point which is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2218.912s">several</a>  decades ago, we didn't have ride share companies inundating the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2222.274s">We</a>  didn't have these delivery companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2223.654s">That's</a>  something that I notice all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2225.155s">It</a>  drives me bananas when I see delivery drivers blocking traffic, blocking parking spaces, blocking bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2232.318s">There's</a>  a lot of new dangers and there's just a lot more cars on the road than there used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2237.0s">So</a>  clearly we need to marshal all of our city resources to make sure that people can cross the street, can get where they're going without <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2245.043s">without</a>  being hurt or have to fear getting hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2248.386s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Caraviello for putting this forward I think it's one part of the puzzle and Mr. D'Antonio I hope you're feeling better very soon.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2376.841s">Madam</a>  President, motion to send this back to the legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2381.542s">We</a>  have here a date of accident, February 3rd, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2383.342s">Then</a>  when we read the description of the alleged claim, it says that the accident happened on or around March 8th, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2388.964s">That's</a>  a big discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2392.386s">like</a>  to make sure if we're going to be spending money and this is a legal document, legal document that's going to be bound by law once the council approves it, that we're approving something that's accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2402.151s">And</a>  it doesn't appear to me that this is an accurate description of what happened when we have two different dates of accidents on the same document, which is, again, just another reflection as to why we should probably have an in-house city solicitor, instead of a hired gun that we're using to do all of our legal services for the mayor's office, as opposed to the city of Medford and its people. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2418.359s">So</a>  with that being said, I'd offer a motion to send this back to the legal department for</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2422.235s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2424.315s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2425.896s">I</a>  have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2427.236s">Um,</a>  but I just want to also state that this is the first, uh, paper over $1000 that we've seen in a while, and, uh, I'm hoping that this means that we're going to be seeing all the settlements over $1000 going forward for our approval, which is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2440.838s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2442.039s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2443.079s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2444.179s">Thank</a>  Councilor Bears because that was my my my response to make a motion that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2450.392s">Obviously,</a>  this isn't the only settlement that we're looking at over $1,000 and to get a breakdown of all the settlements that have been forgotten or bypassed or not reported, I think we should ask for a report because this, like Councilor Knight said, for years, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2474.112s">That's</a>  a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2475.133s">And</a>  to say that because if to say that was the only one is pretty frightening considering in the past years that I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2483.718s">I</a>  think we've by this time of the year we've all always seen about six to seven close to eight settlements that we've seen with either pothole incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2496.306s">city</a>  vehicles, hitting different vehicles, or even trip and fall accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2503.116s">So,</a>  again, Council and I brings up the point that that I find very frightening is that <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2510.812s">we're</a>  not seeing what's really happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2512.893s">This</a>  lack of transparency is frightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2516.436s">So</a>  I'd like to make it a motion that we ask the city, the mayor's office or the chief of staff to get back to us with any information or settlements that we've had, even in a spreadsheet form so we know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2534.087s">I</a>  think that that's important because I, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2537.207s">You</a>  know, this is, this is frightening the fact that 2018, the sense that it happened and the reporting dates are so off. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2544.01s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2545.09s">Would</a>  you like to take that as a beat paper?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2546.951s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2547.131s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2547.571s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2548.432s">This</a>  is embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2549.112s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2549.212s">And</a>  I just want to add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2550.092s">I</a>  think that makes perfect sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2551.173s">Cause</a>  if you look at the Warren articles we got sent, I didn't do it a specific count, but there were dozens of settlements in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2557.575s">Um,</a>  many of them over a thousand dollars that we never saw quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2561.814s">and</a>  not to single you out Councilor Knight but didn't you receive a settlement for for damage $2,149 and 68 cents for two tires and a rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2568.917s">Yes,</a>  I did Councilor Bish and speaks to the state of our roads and the money we need to put into that but also speaks to the fact that I don't think we've been driving one of the well maybe both but we didn't vote on that I don't believe right, and you obviously would have voted present or abstained but I'm just saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2585.655s">But</a>  I'm just saying it never came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2588.277s">And,</a>  you know, again, I think there were probably dozens of those in the Warren articles that we saw over the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2593.402s">And</a>  again, you know, it's just kind of the basic due diligence that needs to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2597.786s">It</a>  isn't happening, so.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2599.668s">Thank</a>  you, President Rivera. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2600.649s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2601.57s">So</a>  we have a B paper first from Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2604.713s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you read back?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2606.895s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli has a B paper requesting that the Mayor or the Chief of Staff <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2612.155s">report</a>  back to the council as a spreadsheet, if necessary, on all the legal settlements to date.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2618.801s">Can</a>  we just amend that to include judgments as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2620.782s">Settlements</a>  and judgments.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2625.806s">So</a>  on the B paper from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2632.472s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2633.133s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2634.714s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2635.875s">And</a>  on the main paper from <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2638.744s">We</a>  have a motion from Councilor Knight to send back to the legal department because of conflicting dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2643.166s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2644.307s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2645.087s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2646.248s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2646.788s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2648.789s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli's motion is something I asked for, I think, three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2653.811s">That</a>  we get a list of all the settlements and I haven't seen it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2658.173s">Settlements</a>  are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2658.974s">I</a>  believe they said the judgments. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2661.155s">Settlements</a>  and judgments are different, but we can ask for executive session to review those, can't we?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2669.845s">We</a>  can ask, they don't have to oblige.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2672.106s">Sure,</a>  let's ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2672.846s">Because</a>  if you've seen the KP law, what was given to us, close to half a million dollars, and I still don't believe that that's a true number. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2682.27s">Transparency.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2684.051s">Vice</a>  President Bears, you had a, you were moving on something? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2688.613s">Can</a>  you vote on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2689.973s">We</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2690.214s">Well,</a>  we voted to send it back to</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2693.89s">Right,</a>  right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2694.671s">Yep,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2697.153s">On</a>  paper, can we take paper, motion to take paper 23-052 from the table and approve for third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2703.238s">This</a>  is the amendment to Appendix A of the Code of Ordinance, which just adds the fee for the planned development district, which we created in the zoning ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2711.564s">We</a>  have a motion from Vice Mayor Bears to take 23-052 off the table and to pass for a third reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2720.212s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.</p>
