[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello.

16
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:22,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

17
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:23,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:51,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to wish everybody a happy Valentine's Day, and we'll do our best to get everybody home to be with their wives and husbands.

19
00:00:51,786 --> 00:01:00,830
[SPEAKER_05]: 17072, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that in light of the recent accidents, speeding and heavy trucking on Winthrop Street, that the City of Medford

20
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:02,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Increase enforcement in that area.

21
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:17,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that a list be created with regard to the locations of our new speed monitor signs need to be placed and that Winthrop Street should be the first on the list once the monitors are received.

22
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:18,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Undercurrent.

23
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:21,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

24
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:30,559
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice we have the department here to maybe help us out on this one, but I've been getting complaints with regards to, and concerns with regards to the speeding on Winthrop Street.

25
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:36,830
[SPEAKER_12]: We always, you know, get a call or once a week or once a month with a different area.

26
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,572
[SPEAKER_12]: We have, you know, like every other town, city, we have people that speed, heavy trucking that shouldn't be going down certain streets.

27
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,233
[SPEAKER_12]: And the last concerns that I've got were on Winthrop Street.

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:54,375
[SPEAKER_12]: There was an accident, I think a week ago, two weeks ago, where a car went into a home.

29
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:58,016
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's an issue with regards to people trying to pass on that road.

30
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:04,446
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did approve money last week for two speed limit monitoring signs.

31
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,568
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that was about $25,000.

32
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:10,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Two of them hopefully will be coming in, I believe they said in June.

33
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:16,994
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would ask if maybe we can get our chief of police to maybe come up and just comment on this.

34
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Let the citizens speak and voice their concerns.

35
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:21,617
[SPEAKER_12]: They're the ones with children that live in the neighborhood.

36
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:26,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And when a car goes into a home, it is a traumatic event for the whole neighborhood.

37
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:34,956
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could get those monitors out as soon as we get them and put one on Winthrop Street, hopefully to deter some speeding.

38
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:40,537
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we have our sergeant here of traffic and I'm not sure if we can just pick up the enforcement in the area as well.

39
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be greatly appreciated by the residents, especially in light of the recent accidents.

40
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:45,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

41
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

42
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:51,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Leroy Sacco, Jr., Police Chief, City of Medford, 227 Elm Street, Medford.

43
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Winthrop Street's probably one of our more heavily enforced streets.

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:10,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of complaints from the Winchester residents who get stopped coming over the line into Medford, complaining about it to the point that we've had to move the officers around a little bit more, and we'll put them right back on Winsor Street.

45
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:13,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, a lot of it is self-directed.

46
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:17,910
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to where the crashes are, and then they perform the enforcement that's necessary.

47
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:19,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be done.

48
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:25,777
[SPEAKER_03]: The speed monitors, as soon as they come in, we will put them out, and we will provide a list.

49
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:37,567
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did initially when we had the first radar monitor, people called and asked to be placed on the list for their street, and we'd just check them off and move them a week or two, and just move it around.

50
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:41,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if we have two, we'll be able to cover twice as much area.

51
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chief.

52
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:50,117
[SPEAKER_12]: While I have you through the chair, the speed monitor signs that are stationary on Elm Street, for example,

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Are those City of Medford property, I think you said, are those DCI?

54
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:56,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a DCI road.

55
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:00,247
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Medford bought those signs because of Rights Pond.

56
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:01,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

57
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:07,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And on any state road, we have concurrent jurisdiction, we can perform enforcement as well.

58
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:18,720
[SPEAKER_12]: If I could just amend my resolve, and for those stationary signs, if we could get the speed limit posted either above the move of traffic or below so that people know, speed limit's 30.

59
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,251
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going 50, got to slow down.

60
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:29,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be very helpful because when you're coming down Elm, 30 isn't posted for another several blocks.

61
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,813
[SPEAKER_12]: So just right on the pole, if we could get a small sign.

62
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:36,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice if we could get the state to lower that to 25 like the rest of the city streets.

63
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:36,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

64
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:37,375
[SPEAKER_12]: 25, yes.

65
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:38,355
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be even better.

66
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,696
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have a few citizens that want to.

67
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:43,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Dayton.

68
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief Sacco actually just took the words right out of my mouth.

69
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:56,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to ask if the city had jurisdiction over Elm Street relative to the recent ordinance that, I mean the recent change that the traffic commission put in place with thickly settled areas and their speed limits.

70
00:04:57,343 --> 00:05:00,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering if that would apply there, but it's a state controlled roadway, so I don't think it would.

71
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:04,906
[SPEAKER_03]: State controlled roadway, we can't do it, but we do have concomitant jurisdiction for enforcement.

72
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:08,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether it's 25 or 30, we can still cite for the violation.

73
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:09,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

74
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:10,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chief.

75
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:12,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

77
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:19,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

78
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Daniel O'Reilly, 707 Winthrop Street in Medford.

79
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:28,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I ended up voicing my concern to the council last week or the week before.

80
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot.

81
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:29,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been busy.

82
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:34,050
[SPEAKER_13]: But Brianna and George both responded to me.

83
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,951
[SPEAKER_13]: And it made me feel better.

84
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:46,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Chief Sacco and the rest of the police department are doing what they can with the amounts of police officers that they have.

85
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,971
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a big issue.

86
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:58,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than this accident, we know the mailboxes at the corner of Winford Way and Winthrop Street have been hit several times.

87
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:04,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Now there are bollards on the sidewalk, so you've got to walk around the bollards to get onto the sidewalk.

88
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:14,805
[SPEAKER_13]: But particularly last week, as I was pulling into my driveway, taking a right, a vehicle was behind me, tailgating me, and tried to surpass me on the right.

89
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:21,422
[SPEAKER_13]: a weekly occurrence or a monthly occurrence, it's a daily occurrence.

90
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:31,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And the speeding is a lot, and to the point where I don't want to take my little girls outside and go for a walk.

91
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,453
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a street like any other in Medford.

92
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:41,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is heavily used, but I would like to see a little care towards it.

93
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,442
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would help however I can if there's anything I can do.

94
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,007
[SPEAKER_13]: But thank you very much.

95
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:48,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

96
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:54,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the chief has had the radar gunned down on many different occasions to slow that down.

97
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:58,977
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Alango-Kern.

98
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:05,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Come forward please.

99
00:07:07,798 --> 00:07:09,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

100
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Sharon Wentworth, 694 Winthrop Street.

101
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Like he said that you can't turn into your driveway.

102
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I've lived here many years and it's just increasing.

103
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:21,589
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't sleep at night.

104
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,432
[SPEAKER_14]: The trucks are so heavy coming by.

105
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:31,757
[SPEAKER_14]: There's another house where the bushes were all torn down from a car hitting it.

106
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:40,856
[SPEAKER_14]: The buses, I brought this up before, between Playstead and Winthrop, you can't see.

107
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:43,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody's going to get hit there.

108
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:48,344
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bus here, there's a bus here, and there's a bus here.

109
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:49,945
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't pull out.

110
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I brought this up last year.

111
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

112
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:57,593
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

113
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:00,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

114
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:04,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

115
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:08,824
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why we have paid a park when we need to put enforcement on the roads.

116
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I've seen a number of accidents on Salem.

117
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,746
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's all over Medford.

118
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,067
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just Winsor Street.

119
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,507
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just Playstead Road.

120
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Salem Street, they come at you in the crosswalk.

121
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:21,029
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't care.

122
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:21,989
[SPEAKER_19]: I have photos.

123
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,230
[SPEAKER_19]: I sent them to Chief Sacco.

124
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,692
[SPEAKER_19]: I have photos of people just dodging and going on the right of cars to try to pace them on the right.

125
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:31,599
[SPEAKER_19]: completely out of control, we need to have some enforcement.

126
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,339
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we need.

127
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,460

00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, is the petitioner present?

150
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:43,533
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could come to the podium, please.

151
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:48,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

152
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Andrew La Fuente, 429 High Street.

153
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,688
[SPEAKER_17]: My address is 137 Sycamore in Somerville.

154
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,389
[SPEAKER_17]: As I was saying, I got diagnosed with a muscle disease, so I have to hold my neck.

155
00:09:57,409 --> 00:09:57,709
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

156
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:57,789
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

157
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:00,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilman.

158
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,831
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could just give us a brief synopsis on what the request is.

159
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course.

160
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:11,274
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm asking for four banners and brackets projecting off of the building in addition to an awning on the side.

161
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:14,495
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important to understand the signage that he has now.

162
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,892
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a hard sign projecting off the building, but it's old.

163
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,193
[SPEAKER_17]: He actually asked me to take it off.

164
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:27,557
[SPEAKER_17]: The problem is that folks are having trouble because he's on the second floor, the second level, even finding his business.

165
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:33,060
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason I'm proposing a projecting sign is because it's so high up and cars move relatively quickly there.

166
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,701
[SPEAKER_17]: There's not a light to stop or anything.

167
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:39,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So even if he did a flat sign, folks would drive by it without even recognizing the sign.

168
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:49,220
[SPEAKER_17]: And his business has actually dipped a little bit, obviously with the internet now and online businesses, he's seen a little bit of a decline as well, which is why I'm proposing it this way.

169
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:53,340
[SPEAKER_17]: So how far do they project off the building itself?

170
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,141
[SPEAKER_17]: So the brackets themselves, it's 36 inches.

171
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,562
[SPEAKER_17]: The banners will be 30 inches.

172
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:02,906
[SPEAKER_17]: So three inches in on either side to allow for the threaded bolts to tighten the banners.

173
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And you plan on removing the awnings?

174
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:06,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that going to?

175
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,530
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a blue awning on the right side that goes up.

176
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,390
[SPEAKER_17]: That's coming down.

177
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:17,495
[SPEAKER_17]: And a new one is going up that just says Entrance with his logo and 429 High Street, just to identify it for people to know to go in that way.

178
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:21,539
[SPEAKER_17]: because the front of the building has two warnings that belong to the preschool.

179
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:29,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, based on the information we received tonight and this particular location, I find no problem with the approval.

180
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

181
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,312
[SPEAKER_05]: On the second of Councilor Marks' approval.

182
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:39,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Second of Councilor Marks' approval.

183
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

184
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

185
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,363
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the width of the building?

186
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,084
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like you're looking for four?

187
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:53,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

188
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,986
[SPEAKER_12]: The sign, so five total?

189
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:56,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

190
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:58,588
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's the width of the building?

191
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,310
[SPEAKER_12]: You think you need all four?

192
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

193
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:08,175
[SPEAKER_17]: So initially when I spoke to Chris, the owner, he actually asked for six, and I thought six was too much.

194
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:11,918
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason I'm proposing four is because of the way the windows are set up.

195
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,151
[SPEAKER_17]: you can keep it so it comes in 12 feet on either side with nothing.

196
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:18,131
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it's one, two, three, four.

197
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:24,173
[SPEAKER_17]: If you did less, it would look foolish because I believe the width of the building is like 58 or 59 feet wide.

198
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,113
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's pretty big.

199
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:29,555
[SPEAKER_17]: And the spacing between each of the banners, I believe is around 12 or 13 feet.

200
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,575
[SPEAKER_17]: So, so it gives proper visibility.

201
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:32,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

202
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:33,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

203
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:38,737
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Marks second Councilor Dela Rosa.

204
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:47,416
[SPEAKER_09]: The design that's been presented to us, Mr. President, has a proportionality that seems seemly for that building.

205
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:56,541
[SPEAKER_09]: With the lack of anybody here in opposition to this, from the most active and organized business district in the city, I second approval.

206
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Second by Councilor Dello Russo.

207
00:12:58,662 --> 00:12:59,422
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

208
00:12:59,442 --> 00:12:59,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

209
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,023
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

210
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean all those opposed?

211
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:02,384
[SPEAKER_05]: None.

212
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:03,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

213
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:04,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

214
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:17,177
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-074, petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Method Mass, to address the council about two specialized police officers.

215
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

216
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

217
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

218
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:31,768
[SPEAKER_01]: In light of the fact that we have the fire department here,

219
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:38,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And the police department, I'd just like to say that these are people that don't toot their own horns.

220
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:44,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of them are needed and necessary by the city.

221
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:51,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fire department does a whole lot of things that we don't really give notice to until we need them.

222
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in nursing homes, and when a patient was too heavy, fell out of the bed, we called the fire department because the aides couldn't pick him up and put him in the bed.

223
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,705
[SPEAKER_01]: They rolled him on a stretcher and lifted him up, four people, into the bed.

224
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:10,336
[SPEAKER_01]: A flood in their basement, a little old lady friend of mine called me.

225
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over there and I called the fire department and instantly they knew how to cut off the water.

226
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,220
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a whole lot of things that we need to appreciate.

227
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to say that.

228
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

229
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:28,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So I first need to acknowledge the great victory of the council on behalf of the people.

230
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:35,648
[SPEAKER_01]: We were instrumental in locking up the built out of the new police station, this council.

231
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:42,145
[SPEAKER_01]: This was no small accomplishment and the city will be much better off for it and with it.

232
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:47,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to thank the mayor for acknowledging the importance of this new station.

233
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:52,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure that this was not an easy political sell and shows strength on her part.

234
00:14:54,112 --> 00:15:00,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to thank the newcomers and the more liberal establishment in this city who met the majority of the city halfway.

235
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:02,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that

236
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,332
[SPEAKER_01]: that some of their expectations for city resources have been delayed.

237
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:11,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for your sacrifice.

238
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:18,979
[SPEAKER_01]: The police officers have just gotten a moral boost, morale boost, that will help them do their jobs better for you.

239
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the police officers, I now hold you more accountable to do the right thing.

240
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you are wrong, I expect better from you now.

241
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:30,926
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last five years, I have fought on behalf of this

242
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:40,316
[SPEAKER_01]: On behalf of you, from this podium and beyond, and I expect you to thank me by doing right by the people of this city.

243
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I thank the whole city for backing our police officers.

244
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for a more sensitive, but necessary request of the city.

245
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Since September 11th, 2001, we have been in a continuous war with a perverse version of Islam.

246
00:15:55,739 --> 00:16:01,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more importantly, we have been hit here at home by jihadist-inspired lone wolves.

247
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:13,125
[SPEAKER_01]: While we need to continue our fight against this scourge, we must also be acutely aware of the innocent Muslims that have been and are caught up in the crossfire.

248
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:23,548
[SPEAKER_01]: As recently as January 29, 2017, a mosque in Quebec, Canada, was attacked by a hate-filled white man who equated Muslim with terrorist.

249
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:31,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Alex Bissonette murdered six innocent victims and injured another eight others while they were worshiping God.

250
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:34,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Quebec is only five hours away from here.

251
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,875
[SPEAKER_01]: An equivalency would be Boston to New York.

252
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:41,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Quebec borders Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.

253
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:45,019
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think this could not happen here, you are mistaken.

254
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,262
[SPEAKER_01]: We as a city have an obligation to defend our Muslim population from this misdirected violence.

255
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,063
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem we now

256
00:16:53,550 --> 00:17:03,139
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to solve as a city is the misinterpretation or the misperception that all Muslims are guilty by association, which by definition is profiling.

257
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:19,414
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two objectives, to protect this religious minority from physical harm and to engage young Muslims in a way that prevents them from growing alienated, leaving them susceptible to radicalization.

258
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:28,228
[SPEAKER_01]: While it is easier for most of us to place Muslims in a box, it is not only unfair to them, it is unsafe for us.

259
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:36,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Many Muslim men and women have risked their lives in our war on terror and are living in the States because of that sacrifice.

260
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:38,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Quebec never saw it coming.

261
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want Medford to miss the signs of religious hostility

262
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:44,479
[SPEAKER_01]: which can translate into violence.

263
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because we do not hear about the resentment doesn't mean it isn't there.

264
00:17:50,742 --> 00:18:01,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I am therefore recommending the following, that we hire three new female police officers who will specialize in all racial harassment with an emphasis on Muslim sensitivity.

265
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer four for this task force, but I will take what I can get.

266
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:06,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Why women?

267
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:10,754
[SPEAKER_01]: This role will require trust in order to be effective, and men are less likely to gain it.

268
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:15,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Intuition is women's other long suit and irreplaceable skill.

269
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:24,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Women are also less likely to be called a racist, which male officers often fear being called this career-ending name.

270
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:31,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Women can also reach women and children in the community in ways that male officers are unable to.

271
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:37,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe at least one female officer who is also a mother would be another asset to this role.

272
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:49,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I am recommending at least two black women to work side by side with one white woman because, frankly, white women wouldn't be seen by a Muslim woman as having anywhere near the same experience as them.

273
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:56,583
[SPEAKER_01]: The department must also have access to a Muslim female contact who is considered an expert in their culture.

274
00:18:57,543 --> 00:19:00,744
[SPEAKER_01]: This expert would be hired as an independent contractor when needed.

275
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:08,207
[SPEAKER_01]: These three women officers will be first and foremost sworn officers and will be counted in the total number of rank and file police personnel.

276
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:11,047
[SPEAKER_01]: but with a side specialty.

277
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:19,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend them as new hires because, as you know, we are understaffed and, quite frankly, I don't want to take any more testosterone off the streets.

278
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,671
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were fully staffed, I might have suggested just switching them out.

279
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:37,674
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who would like to see women veterans hired, I applaud that recommendation.

280
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:42,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the city finds it in their budget to complete a proper search, I agree that this is the best route to go.

281
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:49,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding only two women on the Eastern Seaboard search is very achievable.

282
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:56,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you argue that this does not conform to the civil service exam process, I don't want to hear it.

283
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:02,553
[SPEAKER_01]: This country is at war, and local police departments are now faced with frontline combat responsibilities.

284
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:05,335
[SPEAKER_01]: The military discriminates all the time.

285
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:11,167
[SPEAKER_01]: An applicant can be too short for the Marines, too tall for the Navy, too fat for the Army, and too dumb for the Air Force.

286
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:16,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for the civilian police departments to catch up with that reality.

287
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Ignore me, and innocent people get hurt.

288
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:32,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Without this new tool for a new era, our police department can't protect this religious minority, who, given the current climate, is reasonably at risk of receiving threats of harm, if not harm itself.

289
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:38,514
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our duty as a city to provide this protection with this new technique.

290
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:50,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I'd just like to say that the Marines have also reinstituted their female engagement teams, which was very successful in Iraq and Afghanistan.

291
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:58,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they were, they reinstituted that program in 2015 and 2015 because it was so successful.

292
00:20:58,927 --> 00:20:59,388
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

293
00:20:59,528 --> 00:20:59,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

294
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,650
[SPEAKER_05]: What should my councilor Falco, the receiving place and file.

295
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:03,858
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

296
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:04,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Second by Councilor Knight.

297
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:05,479
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

298
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:06,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

299
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

300
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:13,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Communications from the Mayor.

301
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:13,961
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-075.

302
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:20,423
[SPEAKER_05]: To Council President Caraviello and members of the Methodist City Council, from Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

303
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:26,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I read, loan order, Architectural Services, New Police Station.

304
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:32,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Mr. Presidents and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend

305
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:36,293
[SPEAKER_05]: that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

306
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:40,054
[SPEAKER_05]: City of Medford, Massachusetts, loan order.

307
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:43,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Architectural services, new police station.

308
00:21:43,396 --> 00:22:02,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it ordered by the city that the sum of two million dollars be hereby is appropriate to pay for the cost of architectural services for a new police station and for the payment of costs incidental or related thereto and that to meet said

309
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:25,254
[SPEAKER_05]: appropriation, the treasurer with the approval of the mayor is authorized to borrow such amounts under and pursuant to chapter 44, section 7-7 of the general laws as amended or pursuant to any other enabling authority and to issue bonds or notes of the city therefore.

310
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:31,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Any premium received by the city upon the sale of any bonds or notes approved by this vote

311
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:54,876
[SPEAKER_05]: lest any such premium applied to the payment of the cost of such issuance of bonds or notes may be applied to the payment of costs approved by this vote in accordance with chapter 44, section 20 of the general laws, thereby reducing the amount authorized to be borrowed to pay such costs by a like amount and further ordered.

312
00:22:55,816 --> 00:23:01,300
[SPEAKER_05]: That the city treasurer is authorized to file an application with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

313
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:24,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Municipal Finance Oversight Board to qualify under Chapter 44A of the General Laws in all bonds and notes of the city authorized by this vote or pursuant to any other vote of the city in the connection therein to provide such information and execute such documents as the Municipal Finance Oversight Board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require.

314
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:26,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

315
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:38,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a presentation by the city?

316
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:42,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

317
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,151
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Mark Rumley.

318
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:48,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

319
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:57,983
[SPEAKER_11]: What's before you tonight, similar to other papers in terms of form is a loan order and it's a loan order for $2 million.

320
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:03,928
[SPEAKER_11]: The purpose of which would be to provide architectural services for a new police station.

321
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:09,009
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, it also says, for any costs which are incidental or related thereto.

322
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:29,777
[SPEAKER_11]: The authorization is based on, under municipal finance, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 44, section 7, subparagraph 7, which allows a municipality to bond for architectural services, for plans for a project, for a period of up to five years.

323
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:34,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if the project ultimately was going forward to be constructed,

324
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:41,359
[SPEAKER_11]: then that would roll into another period of time, which deals with the construction of a project, which would be 30 years.

325
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,480
[SPEAKER_11]: What's before you this evening is a request for the first reading.

326
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Like so many different papers that come before this council, it requires three readings.

327
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:54,103
[SPEAKER_11]: The first would be your approval this evening.

328
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:58,404
[SPEAKER_11]: That would require, at minimum, four votes of the council.

329
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:02,245
[SPEAKER_11]: The next reading would be advertisement in a newspaper.

330
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:08,288
[SPEAKER_11]: by the city clerk, and that usually happens about two, sometimes three weeks later, depending upon circumstances.

331
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:22,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it comes back before the council no earlier than 10 days after the last publication for the final vote of the council, and that would require five votes in order for it to pass.

332
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:31,383
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's occurring tonight is the first part of a step towards the architectural services to design a new police department.

333
00:25:32,134 --> 00:26:01,557
[SPEAKER_11]: As was stated last week by the mayor, both at a press conference and also during the State of the City address, she has determined that the appropriate site for the construction of a new police station would be on the plot of land where the police station is right now, over in the area to the northern part of that lot, which would allow ultimately for the police station as it presently exists to be taken down.

334
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,673
[SPEAKER_11]: But this would be the first step.

335
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:11,375
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think the best way to describe this paper tonight is the only determination that has been made is location.

336
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:19,396
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, not that it's the best imagery to give by way of analysis, but this is a launching pad.

337
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:20,756
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a landing spot.

338
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:28,597
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the beginning of many different steps which would be necessary in order to actually see the construction of a police department.

339
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:31,658
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is the paper that's before you tonight.

340
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,373
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, Mr. President and members of the council.

341
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:40,396
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have colleagues with me this evening, including the chief of police to answer any questions you may have.

342
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:42,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

343
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:43,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

344
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:47,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor.

345
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:47,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

346
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,780
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello.

347
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,801
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could maybe

348
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,199
[SPEAKER_12]: educate the public on our meeting.

349
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:54,359
[SPEAKER_12]: We did meet on this from six to seven.

350
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,100
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could go over maybe what's.

351
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,242
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a meeting of the council of the whole earlier for about an hour and 15 minutes.

352
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:05,563
[SPEAKER_05]: That was because that's why you had a delay in the council meeting starting late.

353
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:13,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we've heard from both the police and the firemen in regards to their concerns, uh, in regards to this project.

354
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:15,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I think they were all duly noted.

355
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:20,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and let's say it was, and we, and the committee, uh,

356
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:23,644
[SPEAKER_05]: will report it out this evening, am I correct?

357
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:29,787
[SPEAKER_05]: We will adopt the committee report sometime this evening.

358
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:39,993
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I said, I think everyone had a chance to air their concerns, and again, this is a point if anyone else has concerns, this is an opportunity to air them again.

359
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:49,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we spoke about it last week with regards to trying to get all boards and commissions and meetings publicized, because it would be nice if we could read over the 10

360
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:58,676
[SPEAKER_12]: concerns and questions we had, that can just be a starting point, because I know the council probably, you can't.

361
00:27:58,716 --> 00:28:00,177
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have to report it out.

362
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not reported it out of the committee.

363
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,479
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll yield.

364
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

365
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:09,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill O'Brien, president of local 1032, office of 340 Salem Street.

366
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:11,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we had a lot of discussion earlier.

367
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:19,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to inform the public at large that we're here to support the building of a police station, but

368
00:28:20,008 --> 00:28:27,790
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here to also address, more importantly, our concerns about what's going to happen to our training facility, our storage area, so on and so forth.

369
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we're not going to have much of a discussion, but I just want to reiterate that.

370
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, councils, for looking into this, and hopefully we can go forward and come up with a better master plan that's currently being discussed.

371
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:40,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

372
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:41,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

373
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Langlois-Cray.

374
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:49,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to report the committee notes out so that we

375
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,548
[SPEAKER_12]: can further discuss any questions that we had.

376
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:54,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Mayne.

377
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:57,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

378
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:05,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn took the words right out of my mouth in terms of attempting to report the committee report out.

379
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:08,853
[SPEAKER_08]: However, procedurally, it's gonna be very difficult because we have this paper before us.

380
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:19,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, the committee report included a number of items, one of which would be to include retrofitting the existing structure to expand

381
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:22,357
[SPEAKER_08]: for the allowance of fire service expansion.

382
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:29,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the next item would be a cost breakdown, um, as to the whole entire cost of the total project.

383
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a breakdown of our bonded indebtedness at this point in time going out, I believe 15 years Councilor, is that correct?

384
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:46,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever the life of the box or 30 years, I believe, um, discuss and look at the feasibility of a combined police and fire department in the creation of a construction of a new one.

385
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:47,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

386
00:29:48,335 --> 00:30:14,148
[SPEAKER_08]: a listing of all the locations that were examined to establish the selected location for where this structure is going to be built, when the fire department and the fire chief knew, and that the administration established a working group requiring that members of the fire service division and members of the administration work to address some of the concerns with the training academy, and also that the training academy is an important and vital

387
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:19,448
[SPEAKER_08]: asset that we have here in the community, and that that's something that we'd like to see continue as we move on.

388
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:26,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that is reflective of the issues that were brought up in the committee report, Mr. President, just for an informational purpose.

389
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:28,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

390
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:30,335
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm leaving anything out.

391
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,257
Point of information, Mr. President.

392
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor De La Russa.

393
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:44,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight had made a two-point intervention into our Committee of the Whole meeting's

394
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,981
[SPEAKER_09]: proceedings.

395
00:30:46,061 --> 00:31:08,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe one was to establish a working group and the second was to recommend an examination, if I'm remembering this correctly, an examination into maintaining a portion of the existing building in the architectural drawings to maintain the training tower.

396
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:11,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I understand through the chair, the councilor correctly?

397
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

398
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:40,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you did, former Mr. President, and also discussion about pursuing grant funding for the construction of a new training academy underneath the- The federal grant- Urban Area Securities Initiative grant program that the federal government- Yes, hopefully the previous administration didn't, in their dispersal of tens of millions of dollars in the final days of their administration, hopefully some of that money wasn't sent to the Middle East.

399
00:31:41,627 --> 00:31:42,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

400
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:43,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

401
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:52,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to take an opportunity to go over the points that were brought up in the committee report, Mr. President, because procedurally we weren't able to adopt that report at this point in time.

402
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

403
00:31:57,612 --> 00:31:58,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other discussion?

404
00:31:58,372 --> 00:31:59,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

405
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

406
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:04,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

407
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:09,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can appreciate the fact that some members of this council

408
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:17,296
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, would be interested in retrofitting, uh, the fire station, uh, if we do move forward with the police side.

409
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:26,139
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to call to the council's attention the, uh, report that was commissioned by this city back in January, 2013.

410
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,441
[SPEAKER_10]: It's entitled, uh, method, police and fire station feasibility study.

411
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:36,743
[SPEAKER_10]: It was prepared by Donovan Sweeney, uh, architects.

412
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:44,405
[SPEAKER_10]: And I won't go through the hundreds of pages of this report, but I will go to the conclusion and recommendation.

413
00:32:45,186 --> 00:32:53,513
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was commissioned, I believe the study was $100,000 to see what we should do with our police and fire stations.

414
00:32:54,834 --> 00:33:03,262
[SPEAKER_10]: And the conclusion and recommendation, Mr. President, states, based on our analysis, evaluation of the existing facilities,

415
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:17,564
[SPEAKER_10]: amount space needed by the departments, and weighing the cost and code implications of renovation, it is our recommendation that all buildings should be replaced with new construction.

416
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:24,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Our recommendation is based on the information above, but the following factors are most prominent.

417
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:28,786
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it goes on to state, Mr. President, and this is to address the retrofit.

418
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:33,667
[SPEAKER_10]: It says building a separate police department where the academy building now stands

419
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:42,460
[SPEAKER_10]: may appear on face to be the best alternative to building entirely new facilities, given the cost savings between the two.

420
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,062
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the savings would not be sufficient

421
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:50,289
[SPEAKER_10]: to renovate the fire station to meet code in the future.

422
00:33:51,069 --> 00:34:00,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Thus, the total cost to the city for the combined work at both stations over time would be far greater than any of the options presented in this study.

423
00:34:01,632 --> 00:34:07,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, this option would result in poorly utilized space for the fire department in the interim.

424
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:15,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So the report that we commissioned, and maybe the mayor doesn't like to look at reports that the city spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on,

425
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:24,795
[SPEAKER_10]: states quite clearly, Mr. President, that a retrofit of the fire department, which I'm hearing now, is not cost effective.

426
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:29,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the long term, would be cheaper to build brand new facility.

427
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is the report.

428
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone can go look, it's online.

429
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:36,505
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be a copy, I assume, within the city website.

430
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:41,588
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's Donovan Sweeney that we contracted with in January 2013.

431
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:42,289
[SPEAKER_10]: So as was recommended by

432
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:55,059
[SPEAKER_10]: this council and the committee of the whole meeting is that we also view, Mr. President, the fact that we want a combined center.

433
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:59,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's extremely important to discuss it now.

434
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:07,087
[SPEAKER_10]: If for whatever reason it's cost prohibitive, for whatever reason it doesn't pan out, at least we have the discussion.

435
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:08,668
[SPEAKER_10]: At least we offered it.

436
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:15,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember in the past when we went through with different bonding issues, we'd get four or five different recommendations.

437
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:32,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And the council would sit down, in particular I'm talking about the schools when we went through, the science spending for the schools, the pool, some of the larger cost items in the community, we had three or four items that we'd have to pick from.

438
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:36,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Say this is option one, this is option two, this is option three.

439
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:40,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight we're being presented with option mayor.

440
00:35:41,427 --> 00:35:42,787
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the mayor's option.

441
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:45,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're hearing tonight that, you know what,

442
00:35:46,315 --> 00:35:47,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get the ball rolling.

443
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:49,017
[SPEAKER_10]: This is $2 million.

444
00:35:49,337 --> 00:36:01,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, if we waited a few more weeks to sit down and have discussion about a combined center that addresses both police and fire, that building was built in 1962.

445
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:14,273
[SPEAKER_10]: The conditions on both sides are no different, although I agree the fire probably because of their own upkeep has kept the building up a little different than the police department.

446
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:23,058
[SPEAKER_10]: But both buildings are used seven days a week, 24 hours a day, Mr. President, and we got a lot of use out of them for the past 50-something years.

447
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:27,563
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of use with very little spending in these buildings.

448
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:29,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Now's the time to rebuild.

449
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:31,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Now's the time to do it.

450
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:45,167
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the support, and I'm not gonna speak for members of this council, you have support of this council, Mr. President, to move forward, I believe, with the combined facility that benefits both police and fire, as well as the community.

451
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:50,628
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping tonight, Mr. President, that we're able to at least

452
00:36:51,849 --> 00:37:06,202
[SPEAKER_10]: put this off for a few weeks so we can have discussion with the administration about some of the things we brought up tonight, whether it's the training academy, whether it's what's going to take place with the old station, if we build a new station at the training academy.

453
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:10,967
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the things I think we need answered, Mr. President, before we hastily move forward.

454
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:13,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know people aren't going to like hastily, but guess what?

455
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,769
[SPEAKER_10]: We got this last Wednesday.

456
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:19,172
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been six days and we got nothing last Wednesday.

457
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:22,475
[SPEAKER_10]: We were presented with a fact sheet tonight that you read off.

458
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,499
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have not received anything until today really on this.

459
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:35,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't see anything hastily about waiting a few weeks, going over, seeing what our options are about including the fire department in this discussion.

460
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,692
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes fiscal sense, Mr. President.

461
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:43,454
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes sense from a standpoint of public safety in this community.

462
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be my recommendation tonight.

463
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:53,460
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope we can all get together and not divide us, but say, you know what, we want a meeting with the administration.

464
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:56,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very disappointed the mayor's not here tonight.

465
00:37:56,922 --> 00:38:00,244
[SPEAKER_10]: We invited her, as you know, you invited her to the Committee of the Whole meeting.

466
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:04,307
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm very disappointed in a potential

467
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:12,465
[SPEAKER_10]: a bonding of over $22 million that the mayor didn't see fit to come to our meeting to discuss her proposal.

468
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,406
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not the city solicitor's proposal.

469
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,246
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a chief of staff proposal.

470
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:18,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not a treasurer's proposal.

471
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:20,307
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the mayor's proposal.

472
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:24,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

473
00:38:24,528 --> 00:38:28,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to hear what people in the audience have to say and members of this council.

474
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,851
[SPEAKER_10]: But my recommendation would be a full and thorough explanation why we can't move forward

475
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:35,914
[SPEAKER_10]: on a combined center, Mr. President.

476
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:39,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

477
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

478
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

479
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:51,804
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Robert Penter, former member of the Zargas Party, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

480
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,605
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to go over some points that were brought up.

481
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:57,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, the whole meeting wasn't televised.

482
00:38:57,907 --> 00:39:01,009
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President.

483
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:03,754
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a 3,500 square foot building.

484
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:06,176
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a 35,000 square foot building.

485
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:07,237
[SPEAKER_16]: That's number one.

486
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:11,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Number two, in the report, it states it's going to be three stories.

487
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:17,943
[SPEAKER_16]: And our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go.

488
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:25,728
[SPEAKER_16]: The sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing an excess of a 22 and a half million.

489
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:27,929
[SPEAKER_16]: And we don't even know what the contingencies might be.

490
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:30,170
[SPEAKER_16]: proposal here for the city of Medford.

491
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:35,493
[SPEAKER_16]: This present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing.

492
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:39,975
[SPEAKER_16]: And because of that, and because of that, I agree with Councilor Marks, the mayor should be here tonight.

493
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:41,356
[SPEAKER_16]: This is her proposal.

494
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:45,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Because when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years.

495
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,199
[SPEAKER_16]: How it got sped up to this point, I don't know.

496
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,003
[SPEAKER_16]: But thankfully because of the police department going out there and having their demonstrations and speaking up

497
00:39:55,753 --> 00:39:57,994
[SPEAKER_16]: and folks coming forward saying it's about time.

498
00:39:58,815 --> 00:39:59,755
[SPEAKER_16]: But there are some issues.

499
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn is correct.

500
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:07,019
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates, places, people that you met with, whoever it might be.

501
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:16,164
[SPEAKER_16]: And if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it.

502
00:40:16,204 --> 00:40:20,005
[SPEAKER_16]: At least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might have been.

503
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:24,588
[SPEAKER_16]: There wasn't one police union representative on this committee.

504
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,440
[SPEAKER_16]: So what does that tell you there?

505
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Where was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be?

506
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:35,444
[SPEAKER_16]: The other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all.

507
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:42,828
[SPEAKER_16]: You're hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day.

508
00:40:43,368 --> 00:40:44,889
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great for transparency.

509
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,590
[SPEAKER_16]: This administration was going to be so transparent.

510
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,411
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about as transparent as this rug on the floor.

511
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:57,097
[SPEAKER_16]: More importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted.

512
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:04,881
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't answer for the chief of police, because I did speak with him last Tuesday night at the council meeting, and there was going to be an announcement the next day.

513
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:08,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether he knew what the announcement was or not, I don't know.

514
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:10,144
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't get to the finality of it.

515
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:16,927
[SPEAKER_16]: But if the fire department, like they are here tonight, have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play.

516
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Now let's talk about the bonding.

517
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,305
[SPEAKER_16]: because if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January of 2013,

518
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,183
[SPEAKER_16]: as Councilor Marks has alluded to.

519
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:29,364
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed.

520
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:44,309
[SPEAKER_16]: And the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's gonna be to bond the police station.

521
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:50,451
[SPEAKER_16]: But over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code.

522
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:56,154
[SPEAKER_16]: mechanically, electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time.

523
00:41:56,934 --> 00:42:14,284
[SPEAKER_16]: So to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together, or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it.

524
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't it best to sit down and discuss these things?

525
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:20,410
[SPEAKER_16]: rather than she made the decision.

526
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:29,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and then she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner, boxing you in like a rubber stamp.

527
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:31,383
[SPEAKER_16]: If you don't vote for it, that means you're against it.

528
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,184
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not true.

529
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,627
[SPEAKER_16]: What's true is you should be a part of it.

530
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:36,209
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all part of this.

531
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,893
[SPEAKER_16]: whether we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're being.

532
00:42:42,153 --> 00:42:44,694
[SPEAKER_16]: But more importantly, you have fire and police out here.

533
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,935
[SPEAKER_16]: And to some degree, they are divided.

534
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:47,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you know something?

535
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:50,817
[SPEAKER_16]: The fire department is starting to realize things that they need.

536
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:57,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital improvement program, what does that say?

537
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is that going?

538
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,602
[SPEAKER_16]: How does that affect them on their side of the building?

539
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:07,569
[SPEAKER_16]: You just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines.

540
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:16,835
[SPEAKER_16]: 6, 3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive.

541
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:19,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter?

542
00:43:20,518 --> 00:43:22,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that gonna be something that's gonna be a challenge?

543
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I would hope not.

544
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,562
[SPEAKER_16]: You pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another.

545
00:43:27,662 --> 00:43:31,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Another thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis.

546
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,588
[SPEAKER_16]: The city treasurer is here.

547
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:40,210
[SPEAKER_16]: She has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating.

548
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:49,452
[SPEAKER_16]: And by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project.

549
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:51,012
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see that.

550
00:43:51,572 --> 00:43:55,173
[SPEAKER_16]: As a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that.

551
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:59,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Because is the city saying your taxes won't go up?

552
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:01,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Your rates won't go up because of this?

553
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:07,443
[SPEAKER_16]: And where is all the grants from the federal government and the state?

554
00:44:07,843 --> 00:44:13,188
[SPEAKER_16]: The city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building.

555
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:17,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

556
00:44:17,952 --> 00:44:18,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Has anyone received one?

557
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:20,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you become aware of it?

558
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:22,896
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't even know if they've even applied for it.

559
00:44:23,736 --> 00:44:26,699
[SPEAKER_16]: It would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation.

560
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:36,990
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back.

561
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,532
[SPEAKER_16]: But she shut you out too, which is wrong.

562
00:44:40,433 --> 00:44:42,596
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't do it by yourself, your own way.

563
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:44,738
[SPEAKER_16]: You know,

564
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,340
[SPEAKER_16]: You get elected to do a job.

565
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:49,642
[SPEAKER_16]: You talk about being transparent.

566
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:52,064
[SPEAKER_16]: You talk about being independent voices.

567
00:44:52,425 --> 00:44:58,330
[SPEAKER_16]: How can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process?

568
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:03,834
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we spent $110,000 for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014.

569
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:11,907
[SPEAKER_16]: You had a Committee of the Whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up.

570
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:25,415
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think any one fireman or any one police woman or lady, police man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman, I don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it.

571
00:45:26,095 --> 00:45:27,676
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is crunch time right now.

572
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:32,760
[SPEAKER_16]: You're talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police.

573
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:47,170
[SPEAKER_16]: And unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you.

574
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:50,773
[SPEAKER_16]: The report talks about a merger of the buildings.

575
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:53,755
[SPEAKER_16]: It talks about the irregular space that you have over there.

576
00:45:53,995 --> 00:46:02,161
[SPEAKER_16]: It also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation.

577
00:46:02,725 --> 00:46:05,046
[SPEAKER_16]: You're only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land.

578
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:07,787
[SPEAKER_16]: So your space requirements are already confined.

579
00:46:08,447 --> 00:46:11,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination?

580
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:13,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's the parking facility going to go?

581
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:15,709
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're going to have a schematic design?

582
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:19,271
[SPEAKER_16]: You talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months.

583
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:21,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Six to eight months are going to prove to be what?

584
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:22,372
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to go out there for a design.

585
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:25,253
[SPEAKER_16]: But to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision.

586
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:27,313
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to have to agree and disagree on things.

587
00:46:27,593 --> 00:46:28,714
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're going to have to move forward.

588
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:32,235
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're going to have to have people input, your input.

589
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:35,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Taxpayers' input, it's their money.

590
00:46:36,523 --> 00:46:37,643
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the taxpayers' money.

591
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:46,326
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job.

592
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:55,189
[SPEAKER_16]: They should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon.

593
00:46:55,669 --> 00:47:02,631
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day.

594
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:07,223
[SPEAKER_16]: The stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly.

595
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:13,610
[SPEAKER_16]: And right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there.

596
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:19,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Why would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion for the fire department?

597
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:33,704
[SPEAKER_16]: without you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa?

598
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:34,584
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't know.

599
00:47:35,524 --> 00:47:36,725
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we live in a great city.

600
00:47:37,405 --> 00:47:42,227
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community.

601
00:47:42,687 --> 00:47:46,149
[SPEAKER_16]: But we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be,

602
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:49,806
[SPEAKER_16]: understanding that we all can't think the same way.

603
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:56,452
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything.

604
00:47:57,093 --> 00:48:00,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Today is Valentine's Day, and I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day.

605
00:48:01,577 --> 00:48:05,400
[SPEAKER_16]: But with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused, okay?

606
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:08,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

607
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:09,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

608
00:48:21,434 --> 00:48:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

609
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:27,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

610
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:30,521
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try not to repeat myself.

611
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:32,783
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we had a lengthy 6 to 7 p.m.

612
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:38,647
[SPEAKER_12]: meeting, but I am going to just reiterate probably a couple of things, so forgive me.

613
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:45,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a really terrible situation that we've been put in tonight, that our two departments have been put in tonight.

614
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:52,573
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that flows from the lack of transparency in the closed door meetings with regards to this proposal.

615
00:48:53,554 --> 00:48:58,437
[SPEAKER_12]: When we met with the mayor in the spring, we went over a draft capital plan.

616
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:06,223
[SPEAKER_12]: We were told that the preliminary studies weren't going to be done for new police station until 2018.

617
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:12,627
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the fire department 2 million were for later in that 2019, 2020.

618
00:49:13,908 --> 00:49:15,549
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you have the plan in front of you.

619
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:33,691
[SPEAKER_12]: We thought we were going to have ample opportunity to sit down and discuss it as a council with the community where every issue, every concern would be vetted properly before any decisions were made.

620
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,393
[SPEAKER_12]: We did push for it to happen far sooner than 2018.

621
00:49:39,013 --> 00:49:45,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So on one hand, I'm very happy that the administration wants to move forward on a police station.

622
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:53,414
[SPEAKER_12]: or anything at all with regards to spending of that sort, I am happy and that's something that our men and women do deserve.

623
00:49:54,714 --> 00:50:11,500
[SPEAKER_12]: But to be told through text message last Tuesday night after a council meeting that there was a press conference, we weren't told what it was about, I couldn't make it, I think I was in court on Wednesday, I found out Wednesday afternoon that we have a new police station and I found out the location.

624
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,961
[SPEAKER_12]: No idea of any details until tonight.

625
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:21,323
[SPEAKER_12]: questions that we have that need to be answered before we take this vote.

626
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:25,487
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something that we could have asked, these questions we could have asked back in January.

627
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:36,356
[SPEAKER_12]: I went back and just read some of the highlights from the state of the city address and some of the quotes.

628
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:43,122
[SPEAKER_12]: We are here as one city because we are strong and believe in writing this chapter together.

629
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:52,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Working in collaboration with elected officials in a high level dialogue to renew and improve our city.

630
00:50:52,744 --> 00:50:55,465
[SPEAKER_12]: I felt sick.

631
00:50:56,346 --> 00:51:01,249
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to go back and read some campaign promises, but I really would have got sick.

632
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:11,155
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a police station that needs to be redone, but we also have a building just as old from the fire department.

633
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:15,318
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't, I said it in the committee of the whole meeting, we haven't toured that facility.

634
00:51:15,722 --> 00:51:17,383
[SPEAKER_12]: We toured the DPW yard in 2011.

635
00:51:17,443 --> 00:51:19,625
[SPEAKER_12]: We toured the police station.

636
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:23,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I toured the police station in August, ran out of there, felt filthy.

637
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,229
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know it needs to be redone.

638
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,613
[SPEAKER_12]: But whether it's a couple weeks or a month, we need to do it the right way.

639
00:51:30,594 --> 00:51:36,999
[SPEAKER_12]: The fire department and the chief of fire has to come back from Florida to be able to sit with the mayor and voice his concerns.

640
00:51:40,036 --> 00:51:47,361
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole process is done wrong, and we're left in a position where we're going to look like big jerks for not voting for it, or heroes.

641
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, either way, we're going to lose tonight.

642
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,986
[SPEAKER_12]: But the bottom line is, we haven't been given any information.

643
00:51:55,106 --> 00:52:00,470
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a $2 million that is going to be spent on architecture for a police station.

644
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:13,989
[SPEAKER_12]: If we have the commitment of the administration, and they really want to do a new police station, and we ask them to do a dual facility, or at least explore the option, then we need to take a week and do it.

645
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,632
[SPEAKER_12]: We can get some quotes.

646
00:52:17,992 --> 00:52:20,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been in Malden's police facility, and it's amazing.

647
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:24,336
[SPEAKER_12]: We can get some quotes from surrounding towns.

648
00:52:25,137 --> 00:52:30,140
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't put this on the books and delay new fire updates

649
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:33,974
[SPEAKER_12]: fire department station one for 20 years.

650
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:34,894
[SPEAKER_12]: It just can't happen.

651
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:38,335
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have the fire department picketing in two, three years.

652
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:47,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's really lousy way to run a business, let alone a city.

653
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:54,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Lack of transparency, closed, I think it was stated, closet telephone booth discussions.

654
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,381
[SPEAKER_12]: I loved that quote.

655
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:59,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I used it in a different context, but I loved it because that's what happened.

656
00:53:02,102 --> 00:53:06,666
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's wrong, and I think we need to explore all options, and we need to take a week or two to do it.

657
00:53:07,106 --> 00:53:09,128
[SPEAKER_12]: We've delayed this years, like it was said before.

658
00:53:09,408 --> 00:53:14,013
[SPEAKER_12]: We can sit and meet next week and discuss it, have the mayor come to the table.

659
00:53:14,053 --> 00:53:21,839
[SPEAKER_12]: We asked her to come tonight, and she wasn't present, and we couldn't even get some answers because certain department heads weren't here.

660
00:53:24,262 --> 00:53:28,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So I ask, too, that we just get the figures of doing a dual,

661
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:42,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the police and fire study from 2013 in front of me too, very clear that that site, if we're gonna keep it on that site, it should be done together as a dual station, police and fire.

662
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:46,034
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna...

663
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:55,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President, my name is Mark Rumley.

664
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:56,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the city solicitor.

665
00:53:56,876 --> 00:54:12,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford I was the one who used the expression closet and telephone booth discussions and I used that in the context of saying that that is not what occurred Administrations of every city and township throughout the Commonwealth throughout the country

666
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:20,498
[SPEAKER_11]: When the chief executive of a city or town makes a decision on how to proceed, they have to do so by way of checking things out.

667
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:29,142
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't check things out by going into the newspaper and saying, this afternoon I'm going here, next week I'm going here, next month I'm going here.

668
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:34,965
[SPEAKER_11]: He or she who operates as an executive goes out with their administration and they check out different sites.

669
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:39,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It was represented to this council earlier that that's indeed what Mayor Burke did.

670
00:54:40,003 --> 00:54:43,327
[SPEAKER_11]: And she went to many different sites and talked to many different people.

671
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:46,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I was involved in many of those discussions also.

672
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:52,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of those owners said, we will talk with you, but only if this is kept on a confidential basis.

673
00:54:52,676 --> 00:54:53,858
[SPEAKER_11]: But not all of them did.

674
00:54:54,238 --> 00:54:58,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the locations that you've alluded to, yes, we talked about those places.

675
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:01,466
[SPEAKER_11]: But most of them had one particular deficiency.

676
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:03,986
[SPEAKER_11]: and that was acquisition cost.

677
00:55:04,306 --> 00:55:06,647
[SPEAKER_11]: At least that and maybe other deficiencies.

678
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:09,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was millions of dollars for acquisition cost.

679
00:55:10,147 --> 00:55:18,449
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the great positives about the location which has been chosen by Mayor Burke is this, the acquisition cost is absolute zero.

680
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:30,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And that puts the city so far ahead as far as financing this project that it cannot be denied, it cannot be overlooked by anyone who's going to be prudent with taxpayer money

681
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:32,818
[SPEAKER_11]: and the city's budgetary needs.

682
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:33,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

683
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:36,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Solicitor.

684
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:42,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

685
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:46,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Leo A. Sacco, Jr., 227 Elm Street, Medford, Chief of Police.

686
00:55:47,483 --> 00:55:52,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, once again, I'm here to ask you to vote in favor of this tonight to move it forward.

687
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the process in its entirety,

688
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:03,036
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I understand it is that it would take a few weeks for it to be posted if it were passed tonight.

689
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:09,902
[SPEAKER_05]: The process would be Chief, four votes would give it a first reading, five votes would pass the bonds.

690
00:56:11,124 --> 00:56:15,568
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue is that we've gotten to this point.

691
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:18,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Not saying that the blood is on your hands if something happens.

692
00:56:18,895 --> 00:56:20,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that all the time myself.

693
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:23,835
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't pass a crosswalk or something like that, I get that.

694
00:56:24,656 --> 00:56:27,096
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is we have an opportunity to move forward.

695
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:30,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're missing an opportunity.

696
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:35,498
[SPEAKER_03]: As the police chief and as a citizen that lives in the city and pays taxes, I think it's a good thing.

697
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:36,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that should be done.

698
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:38,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, do I benefit from it?

699
00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:39,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

700
00:56:39,618 --> 00:56:43,479
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been something I've been fighting for for about 20 years to get a new police station.

701
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:46,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But so have everyone that's been seated behind me tonight.

702
00:56:46,805 --> 00:56:48,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been fighting for the same thing.

703
00:56:49,366 --> 00:56:55,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Why things have happened in the way that they happened, I can't give you that answer, but you'll have plenty of time to get those answers.

704
00:56:55,568 --> 00:56:59,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Why some of these things can't happen on a parallel track, I'm not sure.

705
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that they could.

706
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:06,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But to delay this now at this point, I just think it's wrong.

707
00:57:06,872 --> 00:57:10,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the bashing has to go and the leadership has to begin.

708
00:57:12,044 --> 00:57:13,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to begin right now, right here.

709
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:14,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

710
00:57:15,025 --> 00:57:15,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chief.

711
00:57:22,126 --> 00:57:23,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

712
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:24,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Move approval.

713
00:57:25,927 --> 00:57:27,947
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Dello Russo.

714
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:30,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

715
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:32,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

716
00:57:32,868 --> 00:57:34,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 281 Park Street.

717
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:41,170
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say that I think the biggest concern that I have is that when I showed up at this meeting, there were

718
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,643
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of police and fire here who had questions that they wanted answers to.

719
00:57:46,344 --> 00:57:47,505
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us had questions.

720
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:51,908
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here at the meeting last week and nobody knew anything about this announcement.

721
00:57:52,108 --> 00:57:57,813
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty upsetting to hear that when I voted in November of 2015, I selected a mayoral candidate.

722
00:57:58,282 --> 00:58:01,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected city councilors and I expected that they would all work together.

723
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:07,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Both mayoral candidates said that they wanted to run the city open and transparent.

724
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:15,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So either person who won should have been in a position to go to our city council and have these conversations about the police station.

725
00:58:16,194 --> 00:58:21,841
[SPEAKER_00]: To hear that a text message was sent out that said, hey, show up at this place and I have a great announcement.

726
00:58:22,402 --> 00:58:23,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty upsetting.

727
00:58:23,663 --> 00:58:25,345
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how the city is supposed to run.

728
00:58:25,826 --> 00:58:33,975
[SPEAKER_00]: As a citizen, I don't expect to be apprised of everything happening in the city, but I do hope that my city council is involved in big decisions such as this.

729
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:42,159
[SPEAKER_00]: And to find out that the fire station, the fire department still doesn't know exactly what's going to happen for them with their training tower.

730
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:50,683
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're being asked to approve $2 million in funding for an architectural study, that the fire station also needs to be repaired.

731
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:52,804
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so much money in the city.

732
00:58:52,844 --> 00:59:02,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to undertake a huge project on this site, then we need to make sure it's the best possible project for our city and for all of our public safety.

733
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:04,509
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that

734
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:09,334
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the answers to the questions, then this isn't the time to vote for it.

735
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:17,560
[SPEAKER_00]: You should definitely pursue a combination of police and fire and get the best that we can for all of these hardworking men and women who are keeping us safe.

736
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

737
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:19,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

738
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:25,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

739
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:29,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Lexington, Massachusetts.

740
00:59:31,887 --> 00:59:38,631
[SPEAKER_15]: As I said many times in the past, if you need something to, let's get it done in a smart, smart full way.

741
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:56,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, what I don't understand this, however, we have a building that's only 55 years old, made of brick and mortar and it's on, it's teetering on the being condemned as was the DPW yard.

742
00:59:56,862 --> 01:00:02,445
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems like we have a problem, Houston, as far as maintenance in this city with our higher end tax money.

743
01:00:03,185 --> 01:00:13,910
[SPEAKER_15]: And now you're talking, or someone's talking here about a $2 million cost to do an architectural study of some sort.

744
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:20,473
[SPEAKER_15]: I bet back in 62 when I visited that station, when it was brand spank, I knew it probably didn't cost $2 million.

745
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:25,035
[SPEAKER_15]: However, just for inflation, I understand I'm behind the times.

746
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:33,112
[SPEAKER_15]: But over 10,000 wood frame homes are in the city.

747
01:00:35,793 --> 01:00:42,135
[SPEAKER_15]: And they seem to be in fine order, even though I don't have $160 million budget every year to take care of my two families.

748
01:00:44,076 --> 01:00:48,977
[SPEAKER_15]: The old high school, built in 1830-something, I believe.

749
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:54,059
[SPEAKER_15]: And my old high school will still be there, and these new schools will long be gone.

750
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm concerned.

751
01:00:57,045 --> 01:01:02,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Our children can afford to live in this city today at 2017 prices, if they can.

752
01:01:03,249 --> 01:01:04,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's debatable.

753
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:11,053
[SPEAKER_15]: What are they going to be paying for another station if it transpires next year?

754
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:19,458
[SPEAKER_15]: In 55 years, mind you, because the city's not taking care of our taxpayer property.

755
01:01:20,498 --> 01:01:25,381
[SPEAKER_15]: If the police need a decent building to take care of police business, so be it.

756
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get it done.

757
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:29,483
[SPEAKER_15]: but it has to be done smart.

758
01:01:31,904 --> 01:01:38,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of understand how come the middle class keeps getting raked over the coals.

759
01:01:40,111 --> 01:01:43,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't people care to take care of us?

760
01:01:43,353 --> 01:01:46,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Because without a middle class, we're not going to have a society worth a damn.

761
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:52,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And then again, I repeat, we may have our second revolution.

762
01:01:53,381 --> 01:01:54,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Please take care of

763
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:57,706
[SPEAKER_15]: our hard-earned investments.

764
01:01:58,046 --> 01:01:58,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Please.

765
01:01:59,326 --> 01:01:59,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

766
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:02,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

767
01:02:04,368 --> 01:02:06,429
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo.

768
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:09,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a second?

769
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:14,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

770
01:02:17,473 --> 01:02:23,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought at this particular point that we were going to go through the different recommendations made in the committee of the whole.

771
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not reported the paper out of committee yet.

772
01:02:28,102 --> 01:02:31,883
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to vote on the $2 million without reporting our recommendations from the previous meeting?

773
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:33,304
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to vote the paper out of committee first.

774
01:02:34,024 --> 01:02:35,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's do that.

775
01:02:35,244 --> 01:02:41,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was asked for by Councilor Longo-Curran that we vote that out of... Do we have a motion to vote the paper out of committee?

776
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:44,167
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a paper before us that needs to be acted on.

777
01:02:44,187 --> 01:02:45,207
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to table this first.

778
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:51,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we motion to table this while we report the other one out of committee.

779
01:02:54,513 --> 01:02:58,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Councilor Langevin to table this while we take the committee paper.

780
01:02:59,036 --> 01:02:59,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

781
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:07,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, all we need to do is call for a suspension of the rules to take the committee report.

782
01:03:07,142 --> 01:03:07,923
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all we need to do.

783
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:10,084
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need to table any particular paper.

784
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:12,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Suspension of the rules to take up the committee report.

785
01:03:12,586 --> 01:03:14,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Suspension of the rules been called by Councilor Marks.

786
01:03:14,888 --> 01:03:15,628
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

787
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:17,550
[SPEAKER_05]: To take up the committee report, Mr. President.

788
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Take up the committee report.

789
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:19,131
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

790
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:19,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

791
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:22,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm opposed, Mr. President.

792
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:23,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo is opposed.

793
01:03:23,648 --> 01:03:24,949
[SPEAKER_05]: My call is opposed.

794
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:25,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

795
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:30,512
[SPEAKER_05]: You are the aligner.

796
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:47,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to make a point of procedure relative to... We have a motion to take... We have a paper... We have a motion, we have suspended the rules to take the committee, to adopt the committee paper and read it out.

797
01:03:48,922 --> 01:03:49,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have...

798
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:58,685
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

799
01:03:59,885 --> 01:04:00,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we're at.

800
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:04,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to adopt, we're going to read the committee report.

801
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:11,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we have a motion to bring the committee report up?

802
01:04:17,832 --> 01:04:18,432
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

803
01:04:20,783 --> 01:04:21,924
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already suspended the rules.

804
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:25,385
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the committee report?

805
01:04:25,605 --> 01:04:29,206
[SPEAKER_05]: The committee of the whole report that we had earlier this evening, Councilor Dello Russo.

806
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:30,587
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

807
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:32,928
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

808
01:04:32,948 --> 01:04:36,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

809
01:04:36,469 --> 01:04:39,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the paper out of the committee and read it on the floor.

810
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,311
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

811
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:44,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

812
01:04:45,232 --> 01:04:45,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

813
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:47,931
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair seems to be in doubt here.

814
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:49,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

815
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Solison?

816
01:04:57,673 --> 01:04:58,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you leave?

817
01:04:58,673 --> 01:05:09,455
[SPEAKER_11]: On matters of procedure, if I understand what's going on, which I'm not sure I do, there was the paper which was in the committee of the whole.

818
01:05:10,095 --> 01:05:15,476
[SPEAKER_11]: So in order for the paper in the committee of the whole to get to the council, it's gotta go from there to here.

819
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:16,972
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

820
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:26,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the other motion which preceded that, at least in terms of time, was Councilor Dello Russo moving approval of a paper, but the paper wasn't before you.

821
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:27,055
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

822
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:27,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

823
01:05:29,256 --> 01:05:31,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the chair is gonna have to rule on that.

824
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:35,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

825
01:05:37,499 --> 01:05:41,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So we move suspension of the rules so we can take the paper out of the committee to read out.

826
01:05:41,848 --> 01:05:44,829
[SPEAKER_05]: to make the recommendations, Mr. Solicitor.

827
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:45,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

828
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:58,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. DelRusso, would you rescind your question so we can take the paper off the table?

829
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:04,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

830
01:06:04,398 --> 01:06:07,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. DelRusso.

831
01:06:12,817 --> 01:06:14,057
[SPEAKER_05]: He's withdrawing his motion.

832
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:19,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so under suspension of the rules, we will now move to take the paper.

833
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:21,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee report.

834
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee report and read it out.

835
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:23,781
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

836
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:23,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

837
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:24,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

838
01:06:25,141 --> 01:06:25,641
[SPEAKER_05]: All opposed?

839
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion has it.

840
01:06:30,443 --> 01:06:32,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, could you please read the committee report?

841
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:36,465
[SPEAKER_05]: The recommendations that we had in the committee.

842
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:42,087
[SPEAKER_06]: This is committee report.

843
01:06:43,978 --> 01:06:56,380
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier this evening, Tuesday, February 14th, in regards to funding proposals, funding mechanisms for the police station.

844
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:08,322
[SPEAKER_06]: The recommendations out of committee were, one, the RFP includes retrofitting of the current fire station to accommodate the needs of the fire department.

845
01:07:10,003 --> 01:07:12,583
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the cost to put in a new training facility?

846
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:23,138
[SPEAKER_06]: feasibility of grant funding on the municipal training facility, a breakdown of all city bonds and debtors, breakdown of all financial aspects of the loan order.

847
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:32,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I look at a combined police and police and fire facility, a listing of all locations that were viewed and proposed.

848
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,592
[SPEAKER_06]: When was the chief, when was the fire chief apprised of the proposal?

849
01:07:42,948 --> 01:08:00,502
[SPEAKER_06]: and an administration put together a working group with fire to deliberate on the existing fire stations, training facility, and with the, with the demolition of the existing facility, the city council support a new training, a training facility to be replaced.

850
01:08:02,043 --> 01:08:02,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

851
01:08:03,604 --> 01:08:06,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept that point of information.

852
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:08,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

853
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:12,011
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe we said executive session to go over those sites.

854
01:08:13,085 --> 01:08:15,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there was confidential issues?

855
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:20,167
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be wise, Madam President.

856
01:08:20,207 --> 01:08:20,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

857
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:21,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

858
01:08:21,948 --> 01:08:23,148
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something you've got to take up.

859
01:08:23,188 --> 01:08:23,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, coach.

860
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:26,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Just if we could add.

861
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:26,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

862
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:28,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Long.

863
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:28,410
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

864
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Just add possible grant funding.

865
01:08:31,771 --> 01:08:33,792
Grant funding for a dual facility.

866
01:08:34,032 --> 01:08:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

867
01:08:34,912 --> 01:08:35,533
[SPEAKER_05]: He has it in there.

868
01:08:38,774 --> 01:08:39,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

869
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:42,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge Alena.

870
01:08:43,677 --> 01:08:45,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilman Kern, you have your letter.

871
01:08:45,718 --> 01:08:49,181
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just grant funding for a potential dual facility.

872
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:51,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept the paper.

873
01:08:53,744 --> 01:08:54,204
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

874
01:08:54,224 --> 01:08:55,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

875
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept the paper.

876
01:08:58,047 --> 01:08:58,987
[SPEAKER_05]: With the committee report.

877
01:09:02,109 --> 01:09:05,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

878
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:11,416
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion.

879
01:09:13,366 --> 01:09:13,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

880
01:09:13,926 --> 01:09:20,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Return my motion to the floor for approval of 17-075 loan order.

881
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:21,228
[SPEAKER_09]: City of Medford.

882
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:24,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

883
01:09:26,849 --> 01:09:28,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

884
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Marks.

885
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:39,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I think at this point, I don't think anyone behind the reel wants to walk away tonight with, uh, you know, not a deal in hand.

886
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:49,072
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's difficult to negotiate when you have members of the council willing to discuss and we don't have the other party at the table.

887
01:09:50,093 --> 01:09:51,733
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very difficult, Mr. President.

888
01:09:52,473 --> 01:10:05,757
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I would ask is for maybe a two-week, three-week, whatever grace period we need, under your leadership, to sit down with the mayor and discuss these nine or 10 issues that we brought up on behalf of this council,

889
01:10:06,137 --> 01:10:10,441
[SPEAKER_10]: behalf of both departments, and behalf of the citizens, and discuss them with the mayor.

890
01:10:10,861 --> 01:10:20,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Now if we come to an impasse or we're unable to move forward, then it'll be up to this council to come back again and decide what they want to do, if they want to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down the station.

891
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:24,493
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's do our due diligence now, Mr. President.

892
01:10:24,793 --> 01:10:26,774
[SPEAKER_10]: That's wait the two weeks, whatever that week.

893
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:28,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm willing to meet tomorrow, Mr. President.

894
01:10:29,116 --> 01:10:29,997
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter to me.

895
01:10:30,277 --> 01:10:34,241
[SPEAKER_10]: That's do our homework and our due diligence, get these questions answered.

896
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:40,046
[SPEAKER_10]: If the mayor's adamantly opposed to building one combined public safety facility, then we have our answer.

897
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:42,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we have our answer, Mr. President.

898
01:10:42,227 --> 01:10:45,110
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be up to this council whether they want to move forward or not.

899
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,252
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now, we don't have the answer.

900
01:10:47,892 --> 01:10:50,314
[SPEAKER_10]: And I personally think that's the best answer.

901
01:10:50,675 --> 01:10:56,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's the best answer for all parties, and I think it's one we can afford, Mr. President, in this community.

902
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,182
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't spent anything on public safety.

903
01:10:59,442 --> 01:11:03,025
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to beg, borrow, and steal to get new cars, new apparatus.

904
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:08,130
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not spending anything on public safety in this community.

905
01:11:09,547 --> 01:11:23,194
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my recommendation, Mr. President, that within the next two weeks that you call for a meeting with the mayor, and we sit down and go over these particular items, and if we aren't able to come to a resolve, then the paper's right before us again.

906
01:11:23,415 --> 01:11:25,776
[SPEAKER_10]: The paper's not going anywhere with the police department.

907
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:29,118
[SPEAKER_10]: It's right before us again, Mr. President, and we'll take a vote on it.

908
01:11:29,978 --> 01:11:30,939
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm prepared to do that.

909
01:11:31,499 --> 01:11:32,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm prepared to do that.

910
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Give the process a little time.

911
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:37,222
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had no time.

912
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,663
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had no process.

913
01:11:40,002 --> 01:11:45,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Admittedly, even some of the representatives from the mayor's office, I think admittedly have said the process has been lax.

914
01:11:46,028 --> 01:11:47,890
[SPEAKER_10]: There hasn't really been a process.

915
01:11:48,310 --> 01:12:00,202
[SPEAKER_10]: They may be working behind the scenes, Mr. President, but surely it hasn't involved us as a council or other city employees that have the largest impact on Mr. President.

916
01:12:00,662 --> 01:12:03,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

917
01:12:05,353 --> 01:12:07,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Dello Russo does have a motion on the floor.

918
01:12:07,335 --> 01:12:07,855
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

919
01:12:07,895 --> 01:12:09,196
[SPEAKER_10]: He can have all the motions he want.

920
01:12:09,216 --> 01:12:11,798
[SPEAKER_10]: He sat on the subcommittee that recommended something else.

921
01:12:12,139 --> 01:12:13,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Now he's sitting, he's going with the mayor.

922
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:15,482
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine, Mr. President.

923
01:12:15,782 --> 01:12:21,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to do the right thing on behalf of the employees in this city and in the taxpayers of this community, Mr. President.

924
01:12:21,907 --> 01:12:25,950
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no rush to judgment over the next two weeks to sit down with the mayor.

925
01:12:26,151 --> 01:12:28,973
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't sat down with her once since she offered this proposal.

926
01:12:29,353 --> 01:12:29,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Not once.

927
01:12:31,587 --> 01:12:35,550
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not spending $20, it's $2 million for a study.

928
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:55,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, Mark Rumley, there is not one item on that list that cannot be discussed, whether it's this week, next week, or the week after, which would be prohibited if this paper took its first reading tonight.

929
01:12:56,102 --> 01:13:01,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Not one issue on that paper which came out of committee would be prohibited from being discussed.

930
01:13:01,646 --> 01:13:02,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, with all due respect...

931
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:05,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I'm confused.

932
01:13:06,273 --> 01:13:10,256
[SPEAKER_10]: The gentleman here is acting on behalf of the mayor, as the mayor's spokesperson.

933
01:13:10,276 --> 01:13:12,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I object, I'm on behalf of the city.

934
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:13,819
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not a court, you can't object to this.

935
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:17,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes I can, I'll object to you today, tomorrow, or the next day.

936
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:18,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I could finish my comment.

937
01:13:19,464 --> 01:13:20,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very confused.

938
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:23,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Very confused is an apt description.

939
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:23,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

940
01:13:25,289 --> 01:13:31,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, the gentleman comes up here as the mayor's spokesperson,

941
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:38,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Then he's coming up here based on legal maneuvers that we're doing as a council and voting on issues to give his opinion on that.

942
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what he's acting as.

943
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,123
[SPEAKER_10]: City solicitor, the mayor's spokesperson.

944
01:13:42,463 --> 01:13:43,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't understand, Mr. President.

945
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:44,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll make it clear to you, Councilor.

946
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:45,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand, Mr. President.

947
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:46,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the city solicitor.

948
01:13:47,387 --> 01:13:49,749
[SPEAKER_10]: You should act as the city solicitor, not the mayor's spokesperson.

949
01:13:49,869 --> 01:13:54,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And as to procedure, perhaps the council should get its act together on procedure.

950
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:55,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you can't be both.

951
01:13:55,534 --> 01:13:56,635
[SPEAKER_11]: You're wearing two hats tonight.

952
01:13:56,775 --> 01:14:01,976
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I will be a spokesperson and a city solicitor, and I will not be insulted in this fashion.

953
01:14:02,056 --> 01:14:03,016
[SPEAKER_10]: And you should not be.

954
01:14:03,836 --> 01:14:05,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, Mr. Solicitor, please.

955
01:14:06,177 --> 01:14:06,797
[SPEAKER_05]: The colonel, please.

956
01:14:07,797 --> 01:14:08,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

957
01:14:08,597 --> 01:14:10,497
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

958
01:14:11,978 --> 01:14:13,298
[SPEAKER_10]: And happy Valentine's Day, Mr. Solicitor.

959
01:14:13,558 --> 01:14:13,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

960
01:14:14,038 --> 01:14:15,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

961
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:18,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

962
01:14:18,059 --> 01:14:21,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this council in 2014, 2015, 2016, now 2017, has made it adamantly clear that

963
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:28,766
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, a new police station is a priority.

964
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,566
[SPEAKER_08]: The number one priority for this body.

965
01:14:31,307 --> 01:14:34,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, however, we also did just adopt a committee report that asked questions.

966
01:14:35,748 --> 01:14:41,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if we're going to be making a prudent expenditure of the taxpayer dollar and we have questions, we need to have those questions answered.

967
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:42,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

968
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:43,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

969
01:14:43,171 --> 01:14:43,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

970
01:14:46,192 --> 01:14:47,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record please.

971
01:14:47,392 --> 01:14:50,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Bedford, Mass, former member of this board.

972
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:54,354
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, this is the problem that's happening here.

973
01:14:54,414 --> 01:14:56,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight just hit it right in the head.

974
01:14:56,752 --> 01:14:57,933
[SPEAKER_16]: You have questions to be asked.

975
01:14:57,953 --> 01:14:59,394
[SPEAKER_16]: You've waited some 15, 20 years.

976
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:02,777
[SPEAKER_16]: The chief says it's been some 20 years looking for a new police station.

977
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:04,018
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not gonna happen overnight.

978
01:15:04,038 --> 01:15:07,060
[SPEAKER_16]: You're gonna have to take six to eight months before you even get the groundwork going.

979
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:15,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me make an offering here that maybe you folks through the presidency, go to the mayor tomorrow morning, because I saw her walking out of the building tonight.

980
01:15:16,988 --> 01:15:18,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently she decided not to come to the meeting.

981
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,190
[SPEAKER_16]: This is her baby.

982
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,112
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not your baby, it's her baby.

983
01:15:22,152 --> 01:15:23,633
[SPEAKER_16]: She's the one that made the presentation.

984
01:15:24,273 --> 01:15:26,275
[SPEAKER_16]: You tell her that you wanna sit down and talk with her,

985
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:28,767
[SPEAKER_16]: You have all the questions you wanna ask.

986
01:15:28,848 --> 01:15:43,692
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be nice, maybe the first time in some, what, 16 months, that you had an opportunity for all of you to sit down, break some bread in our office, and just saying, hey, these are the questions we're going, let's do this all together, and maybe you can come to some sense of resolution.

987
01:15:43,892 --> 01:15:46,053
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think a week or two is gonna make any difference right now.

988
01:15:46,273 --> 01:15:48,233
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think a first reading is gonna make any difference.

989
01:15:48,633 --> 01:15:50,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the fact of the matter is, you don't have your questions answered.

990
01:15:51,434 --> 01:15:54,375
[SPEAKER_16]: And until those questions are answered, you're not gonna be able to go anywhere.

991
01:15:55,153 --> 01:15:59,176
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, Councilor Falco, you had a concern over the tower, okay?

992
01:15:59,696 --> 01:16:04,600
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you don't have that answer yet, but we can get into all the minutia of the questions that need to be asked.

993
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:06,622
[SPEAKER_16]: So why don't you just reverse it?

994
01:16:07,282 --> 01:16:08,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Call her up tomorrow morning.

995
01:16:10,246 --> 01:16:18,990
[SPEAKER_16]: 8.30 when she comes to work, like everybody else at City Hall, 8.30 in the morning, go knocking on her door and just saying, we're having a meeting with you, Madam Mayor and the City Council.

996
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:20,251
[SPEAKER_16]: She needs you.

997
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,171
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't need her.

998
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:21,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember that.

999
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:23,572
[SPEAKER_16]: You're her breadstrings.

1000
01:16:23,892 --> 01:16:24,873
[SPEAKER_16]: You're her lifeline.

1001
01:16:25,713 --> 01:16:34,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you don't hold her feet to the fire, she'll just use you each and every time she wants something done for her, to make her look politically good, and to embarrass you folks.

1002
01:16:35,221 --> 01:16:39,745
[SPEAKER_16]: And right now, that's the position you're in, an embarrassing position, but you don't need to be.

1003
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:47,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Now's the time to turn around, put your big boy suits on, and your shoes, and your girl, and your high heels, and go knock on that door, and say, we're here to do business.

1004
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:49,874
[SPEAKER_16]: If you wanna do business, we're ready to do it.

1005
01:16:50,135 --> 01:16:51,496
[SPEAKER_16]: If not, we're shutting down.

1006
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:52,577
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I would do.

1007
01:16:58,837 --> 01:16:59,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Neistat.

1008
01:17:00,678 --> 01:17:03,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't support a government shutdown, Mr. President, just for the record.

1009
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:08,402
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a motion by Councilor Dello Russo.

1010
01:17:09,942 --> 01:17:11,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, Vice President Marks.

1011
01:17:11,723 --> 01:17:16,625
[SPEAKER_10]: I would respectfully ask my colleague to withdraw his motion so we can compromise.

1012
01:17:17,326 --> 01:17:20,267
[SPEAKER_10]: All we're asking is for two weeks and then we'll take a vote.

1013
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:26,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Either way, it's gonna be a guaranteed vote so we can iron out some of the issues.

1014
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,291
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be a commitment by this council.

1015
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:31,432
[SPEAKER_10]: There's seven of us here, and I think we're all on the same page.

1016
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:35,014
[SPEAKER_10]: As Councilor Knight just said, let's get some answers, we'll come back to the table.

1017
01:17:35,254 --> 01:17:36,095
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a guarantee.

1018
01:17:37,135 --> 01:17:40,117
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not gonna go, this issue is not going away by any stretch.

1019
01:17:40,437 --> 01:17:43,339
[SPEAKER_10]: So no one's gonna leave here tonight saying we're not gonna get a station or whatever.

1020
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,121
[SPEAKER_10]: There's gonna be a guaranteed cement answer within two weeks.

1021
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:52,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I would respectfully ask my colleague in the suggestion to compromise.

1022
01:17:53,565 --> 01:17:54,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1023
01:17:54,686 --> 01:17:55,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think that

1024
01:17:57,416 --> 01:18:00,798
[SPEAKER_08]: In the spirit of compromise, Councilor Marks raises a very good point, number one.

1025
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:10,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, I think it's very important that if, in fact, we are going to sit down and discuss this, that there is a date certain that we come back to further discuss this debate in this forum.

1026
01:18:10,865 --> 01:18:16,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can't get our questions answered, then we should have a date certain that we're going to come back and actually vote on the paper.

1027
01:18:16,669 --> 01:18:17,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly appreciate that.

1028
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's an excellent suggestion.

1029
01:18:27,248 --> 01:18:27,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lococo.

1030
01:18:28,368 --> 01:18:30,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to say, we just want questions answered too.

1031
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:31,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Just sitting in meeting.

1032
01:18:31,989 --> 01:18:34,030
[SPEAKER_12]: It goes both ways.

1033
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1034
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:35,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1035
01:18:37,091 --> 01:18:41,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo, your colleague has asked that you.

1036
01:18:41,952 --> 01:18:44,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I acknowledge that my colleague has asked the question.

1037
01:18:45,193 --> 01:18:46,694
[SPEAKER_09]: My motion stands, Mr. President.

1038
01:18:46,934 --> 01:18:47,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion.

1039
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:50,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo's motion has made a motion.

1040
01:18:51,495 --> 01:18:53,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a second on Councilor Dello Russo's motion?

1041
01:18:55,016 --> 01:18:56,877
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Mr. President, just so I understand,

1042
01:18:57,753 --> 01:19:08,339
[SPEAKER_10]: If we vote against Councilor Dello Russo's motion, is it true the paper cannot come back to us, the police station paper, for six months, Mr. President, after a denial of his counsel?

1043
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:10,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's 90 days.

1044
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:10,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Three months?

1045
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Solicitor, could you- I'll ask it for two weeks.

1046
01:19:13,502 --> 01:19:14,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Solicitor, would that be correct?

1047
01:19:14,962 --> 01:19:20,225
[SPEAKER_10]: This paper will be laid up for three months under the councilor's recommendation, Mr. President.

1048
01:19:22,086 --> 01:19:22,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1049
01:19:24,308 --> 01:19:24,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1050
01:19:26,858 --> 01:19:40,829
[SPEAKER_09]: this ample opportunity within the intervening weeks after the first reading to have conversation about the matters that are presented tonight, in my estimation.

1051
01:19:52,743 --> 01:19:59,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I have a motion for approval.

1052
01:19:59,065 --> 01:20:05,628
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody feels that they can get their questions answered in that time.

1053
01:20:05,908 --> 01:20:15,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I just think people at home and people in the audience should know that if Councilor Dello Russo's motion does not prevail, we cannot discuss that for another 90 days.

1054
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:21,100
[SPEAKER_10]: So just want you to know that, that people will be disposed of.

1055
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:28,444
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I'm asking is a two-week compromise to be back at this table in two weeks for a vote.

1056
01:20:28,564 --> 01:20:29,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a win-win.

1057
01:20:29,885 --> 01:20:38,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, the two weeks intervening is ample opportunity, and this is not a final vote on the matter.

1058
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,491
[SPEAKER_09]: The logic doesn't follow, Mr. President.

1059
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:43,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I could.

1060
01:20:44,723 --> 01:20:52,568
[SPEAKER_10]: The vote is to move forward on a paper that solely looks at the architectural design for a police station.

1061
01:20:52,608 --> 01:20:53,189
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

1062
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:59,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if we include a fire station, I'm sure whoever's going to do this design is going to say, you're not getting it for $2 million.

1063
01:21:00,113 --> 01:21:02,255
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to cost you, City of Method, $2.3 million.

1064
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:07,043
[SPEAKER_10]: The paper does not ask for a fire station.

1065
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:07,564
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1066
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:13,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I'm saying is, by moving forward on a paper that doesn't address the issues, doesn't make sense.

1067
01:21:13,367 --> 01:21:14,928
[SPEAKER_10]: You're putting the cart before the horse.

1068
01:21:15,649 --> 01:21:20,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get this ironed out, and then we'll know the exact dollar amount we need to move forward.

1069
01:21:20,512 --> 01:21:23,294
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a combined center, or it might just be the police department.

1070
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:23,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1071
01:21:24,334 --> 01:21:26,296
[SPEAKER_10]: But that vote will come in two weeks, Mr. President.

1072
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:30,498
[SPEAKER_10]: So I respectfully ask my colleague again to withdraw his motion, Mr. President.

1073
01:21:30,898 --> 01:21:31,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor De La Rosa?

1074
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, do we have a second?

1075
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:42,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seconding that.

1076
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:49,173
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not have a second, Councilor Dello Russo.

1077
01:21:50,354 --> 01:21:52,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I ask that my motion be taken, Mr. President.

1078
01:21:54,397 --> 01:21:54,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1079
01:21:56,558 --> 01:22:03,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to postpone the matter 14 days.

1080
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:08,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting there.

1081
01:22:08,196 --> 01:22:08,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting there.

1082
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:13,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying.

1083
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm practicing, all right?

1084
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:17,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to postpone for 14 days.

1085
01:22:18,004 --> 01:22:25,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the interim, have a meeting with the administration to discuss some of the questions that were raised this evening.

1086
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:29,712
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to postpone the meeting

1087
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:35,331
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, you can make it a joint motion.

1088
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:38,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be yours, I withdraw it.

1089
01:22:38,873 --> 01:22:39,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I withdraw it.

1090
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:43,236
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Naive and Councilor Marks.

1091
01:22:44,437 --> 01:22:47,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Imitation to sign a flattery.

1092
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:51,462
[SPEAKER_05]: To postpone this for 14 days, all those in favor.

1093
01:22:52,983 --> 01:22:55,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1094
01:22:59,117 --> 01:23:01,838
[SPEAKER_05]: to meet with the mayor and to discuss the issues.

1095
01:23:05,539 --> 01:23:06,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is essentially your table.

1096
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:18,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo?

1097
01:23:18,324 --> 01:23:18,624
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1098
01:23:19,224 --> 01:23:19,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

1099
01:23:20,024 --> 01:23:20,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1100
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:21,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

1101
01:23:21,525 --> 01:23:21,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1102
01:23:22,525 --> 01:23:23,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Leopold?

1103
01:23:23,486 --> 01:23:23,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1104
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:25,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marx?

1105
01:23:25,186 --> 01:23:25,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1106
01:23:25,906 --> 01:23:26,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott Daly?

1107
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:27,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1108
01:23:28,075 --> 01:23:29,116
[SPEAKER_06]: President Gabriela.

1109
01:23:29,256 --> 01:23:29,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1110
01:23:31,457 --> 01:23:33,779
[SPEAKER_05]: One in the affirmative, six in the negative.

1111
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:35,920
Excuse me.

1112
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1113
01:23:37,521 --> 01:23:38,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion is tabled for 14 days.

1114
01:23:38,962 --> 01:23:40,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a five minute recess.

1115
01:31:36,855 --> 01:31:50,385
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-070, report of the Subcommittee on Zoning and Audiences held on February 6, 2017 to review and discuss all papers assigned to the Subcommittee on Zoning and Audiences.

1116
01:31:52,587 --> 01:31:52,947
[SPEAKER_08]: That's me.

1117
01:31:53,567 --> 01:31:54,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1118
01:31:55,269 --> 01:31:56,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1119
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:02,913
[SPEAKER_08]: The Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances asks that you call a committee of the whole to go over the following paper.

1120
01:32:03,693 --> 01:32:05,794
[SPEAKER_08]: We did adopt a committee report.

1121
01:32:06,194 --> 01:32:07,875
[SPEAKER_08]: The committee report is rather extensive.

1122
01:32:08,615 --> 01:32:14,818
[SPEAKER_08]: For a brief synopsis, I will tell you that the council addressed paper 16771, the wage theft ordinance.

1123
01:32:16,139 --> 01:32:22,762
[SPEAKER_08]: The committee also addressed council paper 15749, an ordinance regulating replica firearms.

1124
01:32:25,314 --> 01:32:29,436
[SPEAKER_08]: These two matters were reported out of the committee favorably in motion to refer to the committee of the whole, Mr. President.

1125
01:32:30,516 --> 01:32:45,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we also called a meeting relative to paper one six seven zero five, a short term rental ordinance paper one six five five five related to demolition delay that was scheduled for two 1317 at 6pm, which was yesterday, Mr. President, but city hall was closed.

1126
01:32:45,703 --> 01:32:47,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, we canceled the meeting.

1127
01:32:47,444 --> 01:32:48,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So that did not occur.

1128
01:32:49,385 --> 01:32:49,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

1129
01:32:50,576 --> 01:32:54,557
[SPEAKER_08]: We took up paper one, two, three, nine, five, satellites antennas receivers ordinance.

1130
01:32:55,057 --> 01:32:58,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we voted to receive it and place it on file, but give notice to the building commissioner.

1131
01:32:58,858 --> 01:33:02,739
[SPEAKER_08]: The measure was introduced at his request and the paper has been in subcommittee for an extended period of time.

1132
01:33:03,419 --> 01:33:07,440
[SPEAKER_08]: We requested that if the building commissioner feels as though it's still an issue that he can reintroduce the paper.

1133
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:12,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we looked at paper one, four, seven, zero, eight regulating e-cigarettes in an ordinance.

1134
01:33:12,562 --> 01:33:17,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We received it in place on file with a notice to the sponsor that the matter is currently governed by board of health regulation.

1135
01:33:18,889 --> 01:33:27,353
[SPEAKER_08]: We also looked at paper 1660, amending the graffiti ordinance 62-94 to authorize fines to property owners for the non-removal of graffiti on private property.

1136
01:33:28,133 --> 01:33:35,997
[SPEAKER_08]: We voted, Mr. President, to keep this matter in committee and reconvene on 2-2017, as well as invite a representative from the building department to appear before us.

1137
01:33:38,358 --> 01:33:43,821
[SPEAKER_08]: On paper 16626, notice of all zoning board of appeal hearings to all residents within 300 feet of the applicant.

1138
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,361
[SPEAKER_08]: We voted to keep this matter in committee, Mr. President.

1139
01:33:46,381 --> 01:33:48,522
[SPEAKER_08]: We requested a legal opinion from the city solicitor.

1140
01:33:48,862 --> 01:33:50,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Does state law govern notice requirements?

1141
01:33:50,843 --> 01:33:54,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this proposal outside the scope of local control?

1142
01:33:55,586 --> 01:33:59,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper 16-666, moratoriums on building smart development.

1143
01:33:59,307 --> 01:34:00,808
[SPEAKER_08]: We voted to keep this paper in committee.

1144
01:34:00,868 --> 01:34:05,050
[SPEAKER_08]: We requested a legal opinion from the solicitor as to whether or not this is within our scope and purview.

1145
01:34:06,511 --> 01:34:10,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper 16359, an amendment to the Zoning Act to authorize front yard parking.

1146
01:34:10,973 --> 01:34:12,594
[SPEAKER_08]: The committee voted to keep that in committee as well.

1147
01:34:13,334 --> 01:34:18,395
[SPEAKER_08]: In paper 16338, paper to hire a zoning consultant, we voted to keep that paper in committee as well.

1148
01:34:18,775 --> 01:34:22,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion was made by Councilor Dello Russo to report the paper out of committee favorably.

1149
01:34:22,036 --> 01:34:23,956
[SPEAKER_08]: It was seconded by Councilor Falco.

1150
01:34:24,696 --> 01:34:26,396
[SPEAKER_08]: The meeting adjourned at 6.58 p.m.

1151
01:34:26,436 --> 01:34:31,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, in attendance were myself as the chairman, Councilor Dello Russo, and Councilor Falco as members.

1152
01:34:32,177 --> 01:34:38,278
[SPEAKER_08]: We were also very lucky to have two members of our council here, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello.

1153
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:41,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello and Councilor

1154
01:34:42,382 --> 01:34:52,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Scarpelli were in attendance as citizens and not as members of the subcommittee or city councilors, because that would have posed some issues, Mr. President.

1155
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:54,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in attendance was Mr. DeVito and Ms.

1156
01:34:54,751 --> 01:34:56,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Rodriguez, and I want to thank them both for coming.

1157
01:34:56,813 --> 01:35:03,518
[SPEAKER_08]: So as such, Mr. President, we'd ask that the subcommittee report be adopted and that a committee of the whole be set up to go over the two pieces of legislation that are included therein.

1158
01:35:03,838 --> 01:35:04,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1159
01:35:04,278 --> 01:35:08,241
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Nathan, as seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1160
01:35:09,122 --> 01:35:09,822
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1161
01:35:09,842 --> 01:35:09,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1162
01:35:11,584 --> 01:35:11,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1163
01:35:15,938 --> 01:35:17,219
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair seems to be in question.

1164
01:35:17,599 --> 01:35:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1165
01:35:18,759 --> 01:35:18,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1166
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:20,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1167
01:35:23,021 --> 01:35:25,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfinished business.

1168
01:35:25,861 --> 01:35:27,902
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-022B.

1169

[SPEAKER_05]: Committee report from January 10th for revised vehicle for hire.

1170
01:35:35,885 --> 01:35:42,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It has passed its first reading, it has been advertised, it is now eligible for its third reading this evening.

1171
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:44,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.

1172
01:35:44,594 --> 01:35:51,898
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a matter that was debated in subcommittee for an extended period of time, reported out of subcommittee to committee of the whole, reviewed by the Traffic Division.

1173
01:35:52,618 --> 01:35:53,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendations were made.

1174
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:54,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendations were adopted.

1175
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:55,940

1180
01:36:06,566 --> 01:36:07,406
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1181
01:36:08,707 --> 01:36:08,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1182
01:36:11,487 --> 01:36:12,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Third reading roll call is required.

1183
01:36:13,327 --> 01:36:15,108

01:36:45,207 --> 01:37:01,094

01:37:01,534 --> 01:37:02,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

1206
01:37:02,714 --> 01:37:04,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1207
01:37:04,415 --> 01:37:08,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that you, Councilor Scarpelli, and myself all had the same idea.

1208
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:09,478
[SPEAKER_08]: when Ms.

1209
01:37:09,498 --> 01:37:13,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Wentworth came up here this evening and I've had discussions with the MBTA about it.

1210
01:37:13,402 --> 01:37:15,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Councilor Scarpelli has it as well.

1211
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:18,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli has it as well.

1212
01:37:20,728 --> 01:37:21,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, Mr. President.

1213
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:23,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, Councilor Knight.

1214
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:27,753
[SPEAKER_05]: In the back, it's hard enough to hear as it is here.

1215
01:37:27,773 --> 01:37:28,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Councilor Knight.

1216
01:37:30,175 --> 01:37:31,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1217
01:37:31,677 --> 01:37:32,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can proceed.

1218
01:37:32,557 --> 01:37:34,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Council rule, there's no cell phones in the room.

1219
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:36,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1220
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:36,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

1221
01:37:39,574 --> 01:37:40,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was I?

1222
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, so, Ms.

1223
01:37:42,757 --> 01:37:49,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Wentworth appeared before the council earlier this evening to discuss the situation that she's having getting in and out of her driveway on Winthrop Street.

1224
01:37:50,081 --> 01:37:52,303
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a problem that's not exclusive to Ms.

1225
01:37:52,343 --> 01:37:57,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Wentworth with the number of buses that queue up on Winthrop Street and along Placehead Road.

1226
01:37:57,506 --> 01:37:59,047
[SPEAKER_08]: It does pose a visibility issue.

1227
01:37:59,668 --> 01:38:07,933
[SPEAKER_08]: With the recent amount of snowfall that we received, these buses are a little further out in the street, causing a significant issue for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists.

1228
01:38:09,038 --> 01:38:18,503
[SPEAKER_08]: the administration reach out to the MBTA and discuss potential solutions to the long-term idling of buses in that location and the public safety concerns that it poses.

1229
01:38:18,563 --> 01:38:21,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Councilor Knight, Scott Pell, and Caraviello.

1230
01:38:21,944 --> 01:38:23,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1231
01:38:23,785 --> 01:38:24,546
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1232
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:27,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes 7-0.

1233
01:38:28,908 --> 01:38:29,428
[SPEAKER_05]: The records.

1234
01:38:31,409 --> 01:38:32,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to suspend the rules.

1235
01:38:39,058 --> 01:38:57,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, I'm Ronald Paone, I live at 314 Winthrop Street in Medford, and I want to piggyback on what those two residents were talking about, about the speeding, but I'm on the other side, I'm towards the rotary, so I'm gonna get a little animated here, but if you could just give me about seven minutes of your time, and I'm just gonna read what happened.

1236
01:38:57,716 --> 01:38:59,598
[SPEAKER_20]: This incident occurred this morning at 2 a.m.

1237
01:39:00,886 --> 01:39:02,486
[SPEAKER_20]: And it had something to do with the snow.

1238
01:39:02,506 --> 01:39:04,607
[SPEAKER_20]: It also had something to do with speeding.

1239
01:39:04,747 --> 01:39:12,209
[SPEAKER_20]: It also had something to do with the road that is destroyed because of a water break that happened two months ago, okay?

1240
01:39:12,649 --> 01:39:13,789
[SPEAKER_20]: So at 2 a.m.

1241
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:20,131
[SPEAKER_20]: this morning, I was awakened by a big bang, a pickup truck snowplow from the city of Medford.

1242
01:39:20,271 --> 01:39:21,671
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the city of Medford pickup truck.

1243
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:26,092
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was moving up and down Winthrop Street with his blade lowered.

1244
01:39:26,692 --> 01:39:28,573
[SPEAKER_20]: His intention was to widen the road.

1245
01:39:30,469 --> 01:39:33,471
[SPEAKER_20]: I ran outside and he flew by me with his blade dropped.

1246
01:39:34,072 --> 01:39:35,753
[SPEAKER_20]: He was going over excessive.

1247
01:39:36,754 --> 01:39:39,536
[SPEAKER_20]: He was doing 50 miles an hour with his blade dropped.

1248
01:39:39,556 --> 01:39:40,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Not five, 15.

1249
01:39:40,276 --> 01:39:44,880
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm pretty accurate with this because I can see how fast he was going.

1250
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:53,966
[SPEAKER_20]: He hit my snow bank before my driveway, shot snow throwing it all over my entrance to my driveway and my sidewalk.

1251
01:39:55,687 --> 01:39:57,649
[SPEAKER_20]: I got in my vehicle and I went to look for him.

1252
01:39:58,650 --> 01:39:59,250
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't find him.

1253
01:39:59,947 --> 01:40:13,313
[SPEAKER_20]: I went down to the city yard, walked in, there was a gentleman behind the desk, he was sleeping, and before I continue, I just wanna say, I'm not disrespecting the municipality because I think they're one of the greatest municipalities in the state.

1254
01:40:13,413 --> 01:40:15,874
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna reiterate that at the end of this, okay?

1255
01:40:16,655 --> 01:40:22,077
[SPEAKER_20]: I wake up the guy behind the desk, told him what happened, he said, I will report it.

1256
01:40:22,798 --> 01:40:24,839
[SPEAKER_20]: I went home, waited for about 10, 15 minutes,

1257
01:40:26,322 --> 01:40:38,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing happened, so I picked up four big chunks of ice that weighed about 50 pounds, brought them over to the snowbank, put them back, then I cleared my driveway with a shovel and my sidewalk.

1258
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:54,199
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so, after I was done with that, the same truck came speeding down the street, now I'm watching him as he's coming towards my house, and he's cascading and hitting every snowbank with a pickup truck, trying to widen the street, which is not gonna do it because it's iced.

1259
01:40:54,819 --> 01:40:55,540
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything is frozen.

1260
01:40:56,937 --> 01:40:59,319
[SPEAKER_20]: Same thing, and he's hitting it.

1261
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:06,305
[SPEAKER_20]: I stepped out, he seen me, but his windshield was, on his passenger's side, was covered with snow.

1262
01:41:06,365 --> 01:41:07,667
[SPEAKER_20]: So he probably didn't really see me.

1263
01:41:08,147 --> 01:41:09,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Lifted his blade and he went around.

1264
01:41:10,009 --> 01:41:11,090
[SPEAKER_20]: Went over the double yellow line.

1265
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:14,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Hit the speed bump, put his blade back down.

1266
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:14,913
[SPEAKER_20]: What speed bump?

1267
01:41:15,433 --> 01:41:18,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, whatever, the hump that's in the middle of the street, raised from the water damage.

1268
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:20,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever you want to call it.

1269
01:41:21,859 --> 01:41:22,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, now.

1270
01:41:23,829 --> 01:41:24,970
[SPEAKER_20]: He lifted his thing, all right?

1271
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:30,153
[SPEAKER_20]: He probably would've, if he didn't see me, probably would've re-buried my driveway, all right?

1272
01:41:30,933 --> 01:41:32,114
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not someone to complain.

1273
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:37,097
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, this is not the first time this incident has happened in my house.

1274
01:41:37,918 --> 01:41:47,744
[SPEAKER_20]: A snow blower truck, City of Medford, the big one, came by in the snow storms of 2015 and shot three feet of snow onto my sidewalk, okay?

1275
01:41:48,284 --> 01:41:52,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is about 25 feet long from neighbor to neighbor.

1276
01:41:53,627 --> 01:41:53,887
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay?

1277
01:41:54,948 --> 01:41:57,250
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a bobcat, okay?

1278
01:41:58,111 --> 01:41:59,693
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 52 years old, still runs.

1279
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:01,995
[SPEAKER_20]: I had to remove that snow.

1280
01:42:02,235 --> 01:42:02,796
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so.

1281
01:42:04,177 --> 01:42:06,619
[SPEAKER_20]: My question is, who's in charge of these people?

1282
01:42:06,659 --> 01:42:07,600
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's supervising them?

1283
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,261
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, and I'm not knocking them again.

1284
01:42:09,282 --> 01:42:10,963
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm gonna get to this.

1285
01:42:12,665 --> 01:42:14,807
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm probably not the only resident that this has happened to.

1286
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:21,215
[SPEAKER_20]: Since the water break pipe two months ago, we've had this hump in the middle of the street across from side to side.

1287
01:42:21,255 --> 01:42:27,841
[SPEAKER_20]: So the plow drivers do not come close to the curb as they're plowing because they want to avoid the hump.

1288
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:34,807
[SPEAKER_20]: So now the snow banks are extended about two and a half to five feet out from the curb.

1289
01:42:36,028 --> 01:42:36,648
[SPEAKER_20]: All right?

1290
01:42:37,489 --> 01:42:39,291
[SPEAKER_20]: Before it, which extended to the snow bank.

1291
01:42:39,391 --> 01:42:41,413
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so anyway, before my house,

1292
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:47,152
[SPEAKER_20]: The snow bank is about four feet away from the curb, right before my driveway.

1293
01:42:48,053 --> 01:42:51,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, and they keep continuing, it's not moving, all right?

1294
01:42:54,956 --> 01:43:10,364
[SPEAKER_20]: I decided that I was gonna move all the snow today, so I went 25 feet in front of my house, and I removed four feet of snow, 25 feet from my neighbor's to my driveway, picked up the snow, I got a little snow farm in the backyard now, okay?

1295
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:23,454
[SPEAKER_20]: listen I'm getting kind of like tired of this so you know again I don't know who's not accountable for this stuff and again I try to do my part to help the city all right

1296
01:43:23,942 --> 01:43:28,663
[SPEAKER_20]: But the patient thing, especially when you're not feeling well and you try to work a little bit.

1297
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:34,945
[SPEAKER_20]: And I understand some of the guys that are in the municipality are not really experienced, some of them might not be.

1298
01:43:35,305 --> 01:43:38,586
[SPEAKER_20]: They learn from being in the municipalities for years, I get that, okay?

1299
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:43,687
[SPEAKER_20]: And a lot of them, they're tired, they're overworked, they just wanna get home, I get that too.

1300
01:43:44,388 --> 01:43:46,048
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not disrespecting anybody, again.

1301
01:43:46,068 --> 01:43:52,630
[SPEAKER_20]: DPW method, it's not my intention here, but at my age, my patience with incompetence gets a little,

1302
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:54,125
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?

1303
01:43:54,525 --> 01:43:57,087
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can do my part to respect the city.

1304
01:43:57,547 --> 01:44:00,068
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like a little respect back, you know what I mean?

1305
01:44:00,468 --> 01:44:03,710
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, the Method DDTW is one of the finest municipalities in the state.

1306
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:04,811
[SPEAKER_20]: I know you guys know.

1307
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:08,493
[SPEAKER_20]: But like I said, I just wanted to reiterate this, okay?

1308
01:44:08,933 --> 01:44:11,474
[SPEAKER_20]: I've seen and done some things, and I'm not perfect.

1309
01:44:11,934 --> 01:44:16,957
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been in this field of earth moving and snow removal for 35 years.

1310
01:44:17,577 --> 01:44:20,559
[SPEAKER_20]: So I've seen how it takes a storm, okay?

1311
01:44:21,408 --> 01:44:31,968
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is a safety matter, and I mean like, I like to do one job once and not have to do it again, and this kinda like peed me off a little bit, and I don't mean to use that phrase, but it kinda really did.

1312
01:44:31,988 --> 01:44:33,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I did receive some other calls, and...

1313
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:42,875
[SPEAKER_05]: and I did make Brian Cairns aware of it, and we will send a letter to him from the clerk.

1314
01:44:43,376 --> 01:44:45,237
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't wanna hurt anybody's jobs.

1315
01:44:45,257 --> 01:44:46,778
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's looking to hurt anybody.

1316
01:44:46,798 --> 01:44:50,680
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want anybody losing their jobs, I just know what I've seen and what I observed.

1317
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,741
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not the only one that's complained about that.

1318
01:44:52,902 --> 01:45:01,407
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the front of my house, 314 Winthrop Street, you go by there, anyone of you who's wanna take a picture, I cleared four feet of snow from the curb, now the curb is visible.

1319
01:45:02,371 --> 01:45:06,134
[SPEAKER_20]: So the next time around, if there's a snowstorm, you guys can come on in.

1320
01:45:06,595 --> 01:45:08,096
[SPEAKER_20]: But that bump has to be addressed.

1321
01:45:08,336 --> 01:45:08,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1322
01:45:11,058 --> 01:45:14,701
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could send them to Commissioner Kerins.

1323
01:45:15,102 --> 01:45:18,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is Rick, please.

1324
01:45:18,564 --> 01:45:19,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Regards to what happened.

1325
01:45:19,866 --> 01:45:31,175
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could just get an update from DPW with regards to the incident that happened on Winthrop Street near 314, but you said, I think it sounded like it went all the way down the street a couple times.

1326
01:45:31,618 --> 01:45:42,206
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just can get a written update with regards to, you know, if he can make sure he knows who did it, if it was a contractor, if it was one of our personnel, and we make sure we do it right the next time.

1327
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:42,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1328
01:45:43,227 --> 01:45:44,168
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe the sinking.

1329
01:45:44,788 --> 01:45:45,288
[SPEAKER_12]: And the sinking.

1330
01:45:46,209 --> 01:45:51,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, the sinkhole there from the leak, which probably won't get fixed till the spring.

1331
01:45:51,853 --> 01:45:52,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1332
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:54,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the wreckage.

1333
01:45:54,956 --> 01:45:56,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Castaneri, Cushing Street, Methodist.

1334
01:45:57,231 --> 01:46:01,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry sometimes that people are not satisfied with some of the work that's being done in the city.

1335
01:46:02,115 --> 01:46:06,359
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I'm not on either side of the party, so to speak.

1336
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:15,807
[SPEAKER_15]: I must say, it seems to me that the DPW workers are overworked and understaffed, especially with these recent storms and stuff.

1337
01:46:18,029 --> 01:46:20,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe some of this free cash should be spent to hire

1338
01:46:21,817 --> 01:46:26,941
[SPEAKER_15]: some key positions in DPW, because they work really hard, and they're very tired.

1339
01:46:27,562 --> 01:46:28,122
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

1340
01:46:28,142 --> 01:46:34,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Spent a tough few days with the DPW, and they've done a lot of work keeping up with the snow.

1341
01:46:36,409 --> 01:46:37,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

1342
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:41,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1343
01:46:42,233 --> 01:46:48,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Last week at the State of the City, Mrs. Burke finally let us know that she's gonna have an access TV station,

1344
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,873
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm not the only one.

1345
01:46:51,913 --> 01:46:57,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Pente had to suffer that, too, from these ignorant people that are supposed to get paid $30,000 a year to be here.

1346
01:46:58,457 --> 01:47:02,559
[SPEAKER_19]: That being said, she said there would be a TV station in late spring.

1347
01:47:02,599 --> 01:47:03,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I want you to hear the timeline.

1348
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:09,843
[SPEAKER_19]: March 26th of last year at the school committee, Heidi Riccio said we'd have an access station in September.

1349
01:47:10,244 --> 01:47:13,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Burke came up and disagreed with her and said October.

1350
01:47:13,966 --> 01:47:17,348
[SPEAKER_19]: I visited Roy Belson in November, and he said, Joe, we're going to have it in January.

1351
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,882
[SPEAKER_19]: February 8th, we hear it's going to be late spring, which I take as June.

1352
01:47:22,463 --> 01:47:25,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, this causes irreparable harm to the election 2017.

1353
01:47:26,005 --> 01:47:29,787
[SPEAKER_19]: For all you people running again, if you are running again, irreparable harm.

1354
01:47:29,807 --> 01:47:31,668
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't have the access that we have in Somerville.

1355
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:37,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, our esteemed city solicitor, who made it clear that I'm the city solicitor tonight, he had to emphasize that.

1356
01:47:37,612 --> 01:47:38,712
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess people don't know that.

1357
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:42,214
[SPEAKER_19]: He told me that access is obsolete in his office.

1358
01:47:42,234 --> 01:47:45,236
[SPEAKER_19]: And I said, Mark, teaching children

1359
01:47:45,842 --> 01:47:48,725
[SPEAKER_19]: computers, teaching seniors computers, as they do in Stoneham.

1360
01:47:49,206 --> 01:47:49,866
[SPEAKER_19]: The E.D.

1361
01:47:49,926 --> 01:47:53,710
[SPEAKER_19]: brings the computers to the senior housing and the seniors learn computers.

1362
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:54,931
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, that's obsolete.

1363
01:47:54,991 --> 01:47:56,273
[SPEAKER_19]: And he goes, oh, I guess you're right.

1364
01:47:56,573 --> 01:48:01,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it's obsolete if you're Tom Brady and you're suspended by Roger Goodell for four weeks.

1365
01:48:01,358 --> 01:48:02,559
[SPEAKER_19]: Then Tom Brady's obsolete.

1366
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:05,202
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the standard our city solicitor uses.

1367
01:48:05,282 --> 01:48:06,043
[SPEAKER_19]: It's self-serving.

1368
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:08,672
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's censorship, it's pure censorship.

1369
01:48:08,992 --> 01:48:20,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Now what I propose, now that Mrs. Burke has said that the vocational school is getting the lion's share of the time for the access station, wait a minute, they already get the educational monies.

1370
01:48:20,798 --> 01:48:22,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Why should they also get the access monies?

1371
01:48:22,759 --> 01:48:24,280
[SPEAKER_19]: And access TV we'll have at night.

1372
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:29,423
[SPEAKER_19]: At night, Mrs. Burke, would you send your mother, a senior citizen, up the ramp?

1373
01:48:30,203 --> 01:48:34,569
[SPEAKER_19]: at the vocational school at 7 o'clock at night, Mrs. Burke?

1374
01:48:34,889 --> 01:48:37,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would you do that to my grandmother or anyone in my family?

1375
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:39,415
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would you do that, Mrs. Burke?

1376
01:48:39,856 --> 01:48:44,662
[SPEAKER_19]: We need what Mayor McGlynn's tribunal said, to have it in a central location.

1377
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:46,871
[SPEAKER_19]: I proposed a van.

1378
01:48:47,231 --> 01:48:48,592
[SPEAKER_19]: We have 600 grand there.

1379
01:48:49,052 --> 01:48:52,135
[SPEAKER_19]: A van with two cameras that go over the cellular wires.

1380
01:48:52,375 --> 01:48:53,256
[SPEAKER_19]: This is very simple.

1381
01:48:53,296 --> 01:48:56,318
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't need cable anymore to do public access TV.

1382
01:48:56,618 --> 01:48:57,899
[SPEAKER_19]: You just need the cellular wires.

1383
01:48:57,939 --> 01:49:02,603
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I'm very proud of our council president, Mr. Caraviello, who said the library.

1384
01:49:02,743 --> 01:49:04,284
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with him wholeheartedly.

1385
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,525
[SPEAKER_19]: And I talked to Barbara Kerr.

1386
01:49:05,765 --> 01:49:07,286
[SPEAKER_19]: We have some space for computers.

1387
01:49:07,927 --> 01:49:10,208
[SPEAKER_19]: Learn computers at the library, Mr. Rumley.

1388
01:49:10,589 --> 01:49:11,950
[SPEAKER_19]: That is what it was.

1389
01:49:12,482 --> 01:49:15,505
[SPEAKER_19]: bequeathed to the city for, for educational purposes.

1390
01:49:15,785 --> 01:49:22,131
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can put some computers up there, have a van, the van goes from the Chevalier to the library and roams around town.

1391
01:49:22,691 --> 01:49:25,974
[SPEAKER_19]: When Mr. Falco is speaking at a luncheon, we tape him.

1392
01:49:26,254 --> 01:49:29,117
[SPEAKER_19]: When Mr. Scarpelli is doing a sports event, we tape him.

1393
01:49:29,637 --> 01:49:35,321
[SPEAKER_19]: When Breonna Lungo-Koehn has something, a function, we tape our elected officials.

1394
01:49:35,722 --> 01:49:36,722
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it's for.

1395
01:49:37,623 --> 01:49:38,704
[SPEAKER_19]: They have it in Somerville.

1396
01:49:38,964 --> 01:49:46,349
[SPEAKER_19]: So when I won an award on January 19th, Joe Kurtatone won an award and he said, you keep us politicians honest.

1397
01:49:46,669 --> 01:49:47,910
[SPEAKER_19]: That's from Joe Kurtatone.

1398
01:49:48,611 --> 01:49:49,271
[SPEAKER_19]: And he was right.

1399
01:49:49,371 --> 01:49:52,754
[SPEAKER_19]: And he got massive applause because he leaves us alone in Somerville.

1400
01:49:53,534 --> 01:49:55,196
[SPEAKER_19]: God bless him, he leaves us alone.

1401
01:49:55,356 --> 01:49:57,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Love him or hate him, he did the right thing.

1402
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:02,021
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he said to us, I guess you people are looking for more funding, giving me the award.

1403
01:50:02,342 --> 01:50:03,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm paraphrasing him.

1404
01:50:03,623 --> 01:50:05,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty funny, but he deserved it.

1405
01:50:05,444 --> 01:50:06,365
[SPEAKER_19]: He said the right thing.

1406
01:50:06,665 --> 01:50:08,987
[SPEAKER_19]: We're flourishing in Somerville, Mr. Rumley.

1407
01:50:09,267 --> 01:50:13,331
[SPEAKER_19]: We are flourishing in Malden, where I'm a music director, Mr. Rumley.

1408
01:50:13,693 --> 01:50:15,814
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm a music director in Malden.

1409
01:50:15,954 --> 01:50:17,534
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a music director in Somerville.

1410
01:50:17,554 --> 01:50:18,314
[SPEAKER_19]: I have these titles.

1411
01:50:18,675 --> 01:50:25,877
[SPEAKER_19]: I have these awards from Winchester and Somerville, Mr. Rumley, but our citizens, our seniors, our children do not have these awards.

1412
01:50:26,197 --> 01:50:27,817
[SPEAKER_19]: They do not have our football games.

1413
01:50:28,357 --> 01:50:30,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Malden has our Thanksgiving game.

1414
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:37,655
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been here talking for, what, since 2005, 2004, about public access issues.

1415
01:50:37,695 --> 01:50:38,556
[SPEAKER_19]: It's 13 years.

1416
01:50:39,156 --> 01:50:41,097
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you know that I'm serious.

1417
01:50:41,798 --> 01:50:46,181
[SPEAKER_19]: So if I have to file a class action suit with a lawyer and with some citizens, I intend to.

1418
01:50:46,481 --> 01:50:58,428
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to have access in the city, in the middle of town, if I have to build one, if I have to build a for-profit access center, and then we will fight for the agreement to put it over Channel 3 and whatever Channel Verizon gives us.

1419
01:50:58,848 --> 01:51:00,609
[SPEAKER_19]: We need this in this city.

1420
01:51:01,009 --> 01:51:16,938
[SPEAKER_19]: The children need it, the senior citizens need it, and you as elected officials need to talk to Mrs. Burke, if she'll talk to you, if she's not evading you, need to talk to her and say, two hours for public access with a million dollars a year, that's not fair, Mrs. Burke.

1421
01:51:17,398 --> 01:51:25,903
[SPEAKER_19]: The VOC has educational money, let them use the educational money, do not touch our access money, because Mrs. Burke, I will see you in court.

1422
01:51:29,078 --> 01:51:29,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1423
01:51:30,099 --> 01:51:30,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1424
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:32,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Councilor Falgo to receive and place on file.

1425
01:51:35,762 --> 01:51:36,143

01:51:38,864 --> 01:51:39,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1427
01:51:39,185 --> 01:51:39,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1428
01:51:42,046 --> 01:51:42,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1429
01:51:42,447 --> 01:51:43,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1430
01:51:43,687 --> 01:51:53,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I just want to make it known that, uh, a long time, uh, part of this community, uh, the method Mercury is closing their door officially.

1431
01:51:54,134 --> 01:51:56,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I think the paper has been in circulation in the city for,

1432
01:51:57,289 --> 01:52:19,126
[SPEAKER_10]: some 40 or 50 years, or maybe even longer, Mr. President, and they were a good source of news for a number of years, and they are finally, due to some financial hardships and so forth, closing their doors, and I wanna wish the paper well, and thank them for their many years of reporting on the city of Medford, and I wish them well, Mr. President.

1433
01:52:19,506 --> 01:52:20,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1434
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:22,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1435
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:23,329
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1436
01:52:23,349 --> 01:52:25,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing that up.

1437
01:52:27,833 --> 01:52:39,840
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone that I think that's kept so many highlights in our communities, especially the Malden-Medford rivalry, is Steve Frecker, someone, the editor, who kept things going for so long when things were so tough, and he hung in there.

1438
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:47,545
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate all his hard work and what he's done for Medford and Malden and the Mercury.

1439
01:52:47,585 --> 01:52:49,946
[SPEAKER_18]: So we wish him well.

1440
01:52:51,267 --> 01:52:51,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1441
01:52:51,787 --> 01:52:55,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve Frecker was a good man, and I go back to the days of Alfrezza.

1442
01:52:55,709 --> 01:52:56,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Alfrezza.

1443
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:56,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Alfrezza.

1444
01:52:57,707 --> 01:52:59,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Al was the power guy in town.

1445
01:53:00,829 --> 01:53:01,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Records.

1446
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:02,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1447
01:53:02,911 --> 01:53:10,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just hoping that Coach Nestor's at home watching and maybe Coach Freck's available to come over to Medford and help us out a little bit over here.

1448
01:53:10,216 --> 01:53:12,898
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we can... No, Steve's a great guy.

1449
01:53:13,658 --> 01:53:14,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1450
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:15,440
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
