    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=38.16s">I</a>  want to wish everybody a happy Valentine's Day, and we'll do our best to get everybody home to be with their wives and husbands. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=51.786s">17072,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that in light of the recent accidents, speeding and heavy trucking on Winthrop Street, that the City of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=61.452s">Increase</a>  enforcement in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=63.072s">Be</a>  it further resolved that a list be created with regard to the locations of our new speed monitor signs need to be placed and that Winthrop Street should be the first on the list once the monitors are received. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=77.576s">Councilor</a>  Undercurrent.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=79.836s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=81.697s">It's</a>  nice we have the department here to maybe help us out on this one, but I've been getting complaints with regards to, and concerns with regards to the speeding on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=91.468s">We</a>  always, you know, get a call or once a week or once a month with a different area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=96.95s">We</a>  have, you know, like every other town, city, we have people that speed, heavy trucking that shouldn't be going down certain streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=104.312s">And</a>  the last concerns that I've got were on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=107.273s">There</a>  was an accident, I think a week ago, two weeks ago, where a car went into a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=114.595s">I</a>  know there's an issue with regards to people trying to pass on that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=118.863s">And</a>  we did approve money last week for two speed limit monitoring signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=124.727s">I</a>  believe that was about $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=126.948s">Two</a>  of them hopefully will be coming in, I believe they said in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=131.091s">So</a>  I would ask if maybe we can get our chief of police to maybe come up and just comment on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=137.034s">Let</a>  the citizens speak and voice their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=139.496s">They're</a>  the ones with children that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=141.657s">And</a>  when a car goes into a home, it is a traumatic event for the whole neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=147.295s">If</a>  we could get those monitors out as soon as we get them and put one on Winthrop Street, hopefully to deter some speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=155.456s">I</a>  know we have our sergeant here of traffic and I'm not sure if we can just pick up the enforcement in the area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=160.577s">I</a>  think that would be greatly appreciated by the residents, especially in light of the recent accidents.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=165.278s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=165.598s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=167.298s">Leroy</a>  Sacco, Jr., Police Chief, City of Medford, 227 Elm Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=173.359s">Winthrop</a>  Street's probably one of our more heavily enforced streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=177.11s">I</a>  get a lot of complaints from the Winchester residents who get stopped coming over the line into Medford, complaining about it to the point that we've had to move the officers around a little bit more, and we'll put them right back on Winsor Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=191.003s">Actually,</a>  a lot of it is self-directed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=193.446s">They</a>  go to where the crashes are, and then they perform the enforcement that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=198.771s">So</a>  that'll be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=200.893s">The</a>  speed monitors, as soon as they come in, we will put them out, and we will provide a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=206.237s">What</a>  we did initially when we had the first radar monitor, people called and asked to be placed on the list for their street, and we'd just check them off and move them a week or two, and just move it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=217.667s">Now</a>  if we have two, we'll be able to cover twice as much area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=221.77s">Thank</a>  you, Chief.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=223.692s">While</a>  I have you through the chair, the speed monitor signs that are stationary on Elm Street, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=230.62s">Are</a>  those City of Medford property, I think you said, are those DCI?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=235.163s">It's</a>  a DCI road. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=237.165s">City</a>  of Medford bought those signs because of Rights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=241.167s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=242.248s">And</a>  on any state road, we have concurrent jurisdiction, we can perform enforcement as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=247.732s">If</a>  I could just amend my resolve, and for those stationary signs, if we could get the speed limit posted either above the move of traffic or below so that people know, speed limit's 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=259.71s">And</a>  I'm going 50, got to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=262.331s">I</a>  think that would be very helpful because when you're coming down Elm, 30 isn't posted for another several blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=269.693s">So</a>  just right on the pole, if we could get a small sign.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=271.833s">It</a>  would be nice if we could get the state to lower that to 25 like the rest of the city streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=276.575s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=277.135s">25,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=277.435s">That</a>  would be even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=278.375s">I</a>  think we have a few citizens that want to.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=282.736s">Councilor</a>  Dayton. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=284.958s">Chief</a>  Sacco actually just took the words right out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=286.819s">I</a>  was just going to ask if the city had jurisdiction over Elm Street relative to the recent ordinance that, I mean the recent change that the traffic commission put in place with thickly settled areas and their speed limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=297.343s">I</a>  was wondering if that would apply there, but it's a state controlled roadway, so I don't think it would.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=300.544s">State</a>  controlled roadway, we can't do it, but we do have concomitant jurisdiction for enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=304.946s">So</a>  whether it's 25 or 30, we can still cite for the violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=309.528s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=310.148s">Thank</a>  you, Chief.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=310.808s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=318.04s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=319.381s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=319.721s">Daniel</a>  O'Reilly, 707 Winthrop Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=323.663s">I</a>  ended up voicing my concern to the council last week or the week before. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=328.186s">I</a>  forgot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=329.427s">I've</a>  been busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=330.548s">But</a>  Brianna and George both responded to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=334.71s">And</a>  it made me feel better. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=336.971s">I</a>  know Chief Sacco and the rest of the police department are doing what they can with the amounts of police officers that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=347.01s">It</a>  is a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=347.991s">Other</a>  than this accident, we know the mailboxes at the corner of Winford Way and Winthrop Street have been hit several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=358.256s">Now</a>  there are bollards on the sidewalk, so you've got to walk around the bollards to get onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=365.62s">But</a>  particularly last week, as I was pulling into my driveway, taking a right, a vehicle was behind me, tailgating me, and tried to surpass me on the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=377.298s">a</a>  weekly occurrence or a monthly occurrence, it's a daily occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=382.262s">And</a>  the speeding is a lot, and to the point where I don't want to take my little girls outside and go for a walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=391.93s">So</a>  it's a street like any other in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=395.654s">Yes,</a>  it is heavily used, but I would like to see a little care towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=401.759s">And</a>  I would help however I can if there's anything I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=406.806s">But</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=408.407s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=408.687s">And</a>  I know the chief has had the radar gunned down on many different occasions to slow that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=417.456s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Alango-Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=424.822s">Come</a>  forward please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=427.798s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=597.729s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=597.809s">Councilman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=600.99s">If</a>  you could just give us a brief synopsis on what the request is.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=604.051s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=605.432s">So</a>  I'm asking for four banners and brackets projecting off of the building in addition to an awning on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=612.314s">I</a>  think it's important to understand the signage that he has now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=615.59s">It's</a>  just a hard sign projecting off the building, but it's old. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=618.992s">He</a>  actually asked me to take it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=621.433s">The</a>  problem is that folks are having trouble because he's on the second floor, the second level, even finding his business. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=627.997s">The</a>  reason I'm proposing a projecting sign is because it's so high up and cars move relatively quickly there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=633.2s">There's</a>  not a light to stop or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=635.202s">So</a>  even if he did a flat sign, folks would drive by it without even recognizing the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=640.529s">And</a>  his business has actually dipped a little bit, obviously with the internet now and online businesses, he's seen a little bit of a decline as well, which is why I'm proposing it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=650.898s">So</a>  how far do they project off the building itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=653.5s">So</a>  the brackets themselves, it's 36 inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=656.281s">The</a>  banners will be 30 inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=657.802s">So</a>  three inches in on either side to allow for the threaded bolts to tighten the banners.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=663.566s">And</a>  you plan on removing the awnings? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=665.607s">Is</a>  that going to?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=667.068s">So</a>  there's a blue awning on the right side that goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=669.61s">That's</a>  coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=670.51s">And</a>  a new one is going up that just says Entrance with his logo and 429 High Street, just to identify it for people to know to go in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=677.915s">because</a>  the front of the building has two warnings that belong to the preschool.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=682.58s">Mr.</a>  President, based on the information we received tonight and this particular location, I find no problem with the approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=690.827s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=693.37s">On</a>  the second of Councilor Marks' approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=698.355s">Second</a>  of Councilor Marks' approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=707.08s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=707.921s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=710.242s">What's</a>  the width of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=711.383s">It</a>  looks like you're looking for four? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=713.425s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=714.465s">The</a>  sign, so five total? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=716.467s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=717.227s">So</a>  what's the width of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=718.608s">You</a>  think you need all four?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=721.09s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=721.851s">So</a>  initially when I spoke to Chris, the owner, he actually asked for six, and I thought six was too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=728.676s">The</a>  reason I'm proposing four is because of the way the windows are set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=732.53s">you</a>  can keep it so it comes in 12 feet on either side with nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=736.371s">And</a>  then it's one, two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=738.492s">If</a>  you did less, it would look foolish because I believe the width of the building is like 58 or 59 feet wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=744.193s">So</a>  it's pretty big. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=746.014s">And</a>  the spacing between each of the banners, I believe is around 12 or 13 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=749.755s">So,</a>  so it gives proper visibility.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=752.715s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=752.995s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=754.996s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks second Councilor Dela Rosa.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=759.812s">The</a>  design that's been presented to us, Mr. President, has a proportionality that seems seemly for that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=769.017s">With</a>  the lack of anybody here in opposition to this, from the most active and organized business district in the city, I second approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=777.221s">Second</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=778.662s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=779.442s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=780.483s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=781.043s">I</a>  mean all those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=782.204s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=782.404s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=783.945s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=787.57s">17-074,</a>  petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Method Mass, to address the council about two specialized police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=800.96s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=802.541s">Gene</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=806.544s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=809.146s">In</a>  light of the fact that we have the fire department here, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=812.581s">And</a>  the police department, I'd just like to say that these are people that don't toot their own horns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=819.384s">And</a>  both of them are needed and necessary by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=825.796s">And</a>  the fire department does a whole lot of things that we don't really give notice to until we need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=833.12s">I</a>  worked in nursing homes, and when a patient was too heavy, fell out of the bed, we called the fire department because the aides couldn't pick him up and put him in the bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=840.464s">They</a>  rolled him on a stretcher and lifted him up, four people, into the bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=847.495s">A</a>  flood in their basement, a little old lady friend of mine called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=851.117s">I</a>  went over there and I called the fire department and instantly they knew how to cut off the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=855.819s">They</a>  do a whole lot of things that we need to appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=858.76s">So</a>  I just want to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=862.362s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=864.283s">So</a>  I first need to acknowledge the great victory of the council on behalf of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=869.245s">We</a>  were instrumental in locking up the built out of the new police station, this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=876.741s">This</a>  was no small accomplishment and the city will be much better off for it and with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=883.545s">I</a>  would also like to thank the mayor for acknowledging the importance of this new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=888.289s">I</a>  am sure that this was not an easy political sell and shows strength on her part. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=894.112s">I</a>  would also like to thank the newcomers and the more liberal establishment in this city who met the majority of the city halfway. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=902.078s">I</a>  know that <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=903.19s">that</a>  some of their expectations for city resources have been delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=909.674s">I</a>  thank you for your sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=911.915s">The</a>  police officers have just gotten a moral boost, morale boost, that will help them do their jobs better for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=920.1s">And</a>  to the police officers, I now hold you more accountable to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=924.602s">And</a>  when you are wrong, I expect better from you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=928.364s">For</a>  the last five years, I have fought on behalf of this <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=932.593s">On</a>  behalf of you, from this podium and beyond, and I expect you to thank me by doing right by the people of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=941.156s">And</a>  finally, I thank the whole city for backing our police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=945.478s">Now</a>  for a more sensitive, but necessary request of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=948.919s">Since</a>  September 11th, 2001, we have been in a continuous war with a perverse version of Islam. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=955.739s">And</a>  even more importantly, we have been hit here at home by jihadist-inspired lone wolves. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=962.601s">While</a>  we need to continue our fight against this scourge, we must also be acutely aware of the innocent Muslims that have been and are caught up in the crossfire. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=974.245s">As</a>  recently as January 29, 2017, a mosque in Quebec, Canada, was attacked by a hate-filled white man who equated Muslim with terrorist. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=984.588s">Alex</a>  Bissonette murdered six innocent victims and injured another eight others while they were worshiping God. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=992.512s">Quebec</a>  is only five hours away from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=995.614s">An</a>  equivalency would be Boston to New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=998.575s">Quebec</a>  borders Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1002.357s">If</a>  you think this could not happen here, you are mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1005.919s">We</a>  as a city have an obligation to defend our Muslim population from this misdirected violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1012.303s">The</a>  problem we now <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1013.55s">we</a>  need to solve as a city is the misinterpretation or the misperception that all Muslims are guilty by association, which by definition is profiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1027.683s">We</a>  have two objectives, to protect this religious minority from physical harm and to engage young Muslims in a way that prevents them from growing alienated, leaving them susceptible to radicalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1040.563s">While</a>  it is easier for most of us to place Muslims in a box, it is not only unfair to them, it is unsafe for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1049.469s">Many</a>  Muslim men and women have risked their lives in our war on terror and are living in the States because of that sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1057.414s">Quebec</a>  never saw it coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1059.875s">I</a>  don't want Medford to miss the signs of religious hostility <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1063.058s">which</a>  can translate into violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1065.519s">Just</a>  because we do not hear about the resentment doesn't mean it isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1070.742s">I</a>  am therefore recommending the following, that we hire three new female police officers who will specialize in all racial harassment with an emphasis on Muslim sensitivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1082.329s">I</a>  would prefer four for this task force, but I will take what I can get. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1085.591s">Why</a>  women? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1086.592s">This</a>  role will require trust in order to be effective, and men are less likely to gain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1091.518s">Intuition</a>  is women's other long suit and irreplaceable skill. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1097.683s">Women</a>  are also less likely to be called a racist, which male officers often fear being called this career-ending name. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1105.488s">Women</a>  can also reach women and children in the community in ways that male officers are unable to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1112.633s">I</a>  believe at least one female officer who is also a mother would be another asset to this role. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1118.357s">I</a>  am recommending at least two black women to work side by side with one white woman because, frankly, white women wouldn't be seen by a Muslim woman as having anywhere near the same experience as them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1130.201s">The</a>  department must also have access to a Muslim female contact who is considered an expert in their culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1137.543s">This</a>  expert would be hired as an independent contractor when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1141.625s">These</a>  three women officers will be first and foremost sworn officers and will be counted in the total number of rank and file police personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1149.947s">but</a>  with a side specialty. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1151.787s">I</a>  recommend them as new hires because, as you know, we are understaffed and, quite frankly, I don't want to take any more testosterone off the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1160.51s">If</a>  we were fully staffed, I might have suggested just switching them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1173.113s">For</a>  those who would like to see women veterans hired, I applaud that recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1178.233s">And</a>  if the city finds it in their budget to complete a proper search, I agree that this is the best route to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1183.978s">Finding</a>  only two women on the Eastern Seaboard search is very achievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1191.344s">Before</a>  you argue that this does not conform to the civil service exam process, I don't want to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1197.208s">This</a>  country is at war, and local police departments are now faced with frontline combat responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1203.513s">The</a>  military discriminates all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1205.905s">An</a>  applicant can be too short for the Marines, too tall for the Navy, too fat for the Army, and too dumb for the Air Force. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1212.167s">It</a>  is time for the civilian police departments to catch up with that reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1217.768s">Ignore</a>  me, and innocent people get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1220.989s">Without</a>  this new tool for a new era, our police department can't protect this religious minority, who, given the current climate, is reasonably at risk of receiving threats of harm, if not harm itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1233.971s">It</a>  is our duty as a city to provide this protection with this new technique. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1239.455s">And</a>  also, I'd just like to say that the Marines have also reinstituted their female engagement teams, which was very successful in Iraq and Afghanistan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1251.022s">Um,</a>  they were, they reinstituted that program in 2015 and 2015 because it was so successful. <a

Burke, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1416.845s">Do</a>  we have a presentation by the city?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1420.989s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1423.01s">My</a>  name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1424.191s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1428.915s">What's</a>  before you tonight, similar to other papers in terms of form is a loan order and it's a loan order for $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1438.523s">The</a>  purpose of which would be to provide architectural services for a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1444.567s">And</a>  of course, it also says, for any costs which are incidental or related thereto. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1449.649s">The</a>  authorization is based on, under municipal finance, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 44, section 7, subparagraph 7, which allows a municipality to bond for architectural services, for plans for a project, for a period of up to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1470.378s">Now,</a>  if the project ultimately was going forward to be constructed, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1474.437s">then</a>  that would roll into another period of time, which deals with the construction of a project, which would be 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1482.119s">What's</a>  before you this evening is a request for the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1485.94s">Like</a>  so many different papers that come before this council, it requires three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1491.202s">The</a>  first would be your approval this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1495.123s">That</a>  would require, at minimum, four votes of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1499.144s">The</a>  next reading would be advertisement in a newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1502.624s">by</a>  the city clerk, and that usually happens about two, sometimes three weeks later, depending upon circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1508.928s">And</a>  then it comes back before the council no earlier than 10 days after the last publication for the final vote of the council, and that would require five votes in order for it to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1523.158s">So</a>  what's occurring tonight is the first part of a step towards the architectural services to design a new police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1532.134s">As</a>  was stated last week by the mayor, both at a press conference and also during the State of the City address, she has determined that the appropriate site for the construction of a new police station would be on the plot of land where the police station is right now, over in the area to the northern part of that lot, which would allow ultimately for the police station as it presently exists to be taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1562.433s">But</a>  this would be the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1563.693s">But</a>  I think the best way to describe this paper tonight is the only determination that has been made is location. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1571.835s">This</a>  is, not that it's the best imagery to give by way of analysis, but this is a launching pad. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1579.436s">It's</a>  not a landing spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1581.116s">This</a>  is the beginning of many different steps which would be necessary in order to actually see the construction of a police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1589.058s">So</a>  that is the paper that's before you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1592.172s">uh,</a>  Mr. President and members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1594.873s">And</a>  I have colleagues with me this evening, including the chief of police to answer any questions you may have.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1602.277s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1602.997s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1606.419s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1607.66s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1608.0s">President</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1608.82s">If</a>  we could maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1610.678s">educate</a>  the public on our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1612.239s">We</a>  did meet on this from six to seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1614.419s">If</a>  we could go over maybe what's.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1616.5s">We</a>  did have a meeting of the council of the whole earlier for about an hour and 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1621.282s">That</a>  was because that's why you had a delay in the council meeting starting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1626.083s">Uh,</a>  we've heard from both the police and the firemen in regards to their concerns, uh, in regards to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1633.386s">And,</a>  uh, I think they were all duly noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1635.906s">Um,</a>  and let's say it was, and we, and the committee, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1641.643s">will</a>  report it out this evening, am I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1645.345s">We</a>  will adopt the committee report sometime this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1650.188s">But</a>  as I said, I think everyone had a chance to air their concerns, and again, this is a point if anyone else has concerns, this is an opportunity to air them again.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1660.833s">And</a>  I think we spoke about it last week with regards to trying to get all boards and commissions and meetings publicized, because it would be nice if we could read over the 10 <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1672.092s">concerns</a>  and questions we had, that can just be a starting point, because I know the council probably, you can't.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1678.716s">We'd</a>  have to report it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1680.217s">We</a>  have not reported it out of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1683.039s">I'll</a>  yield.</p>

    <p>[Bill O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1685.08s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1686.281s">Bill</a>  O'Brien, president of local 1032, office of 340 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1689.844s">I</a>  know we had a lot of discussion earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1691.965s">I</a>  just want to inform the public at large that we're here to support the building of a police station, but <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1700.008s">We're</a>  here to also address, more importantly, our concerns about what's going to happen to our training facility, our storage area, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1707.81s">So</a>  I know we're not going to have much of a discussion, but I just want to reiterate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1712.552s">Thank</a>  you, councils, for looking into this, and hopefully we can go forward and come up with a better master plan that's currently being discussed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1719.734s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1720.674s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. O'Brien. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1724.435s">Councilor</a>  Langlois-Cray.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1726.716s">I'd</a>  like to report the committee notes out so that we <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1730.147s">can</a>  further discuss any questions that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1734.188s">Councilor</a>  Mayne.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1735.909s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1737.769s">And</a>  I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn took the words right out of my mouth in terms of attempting to report the committee report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1745.472s">However,</a>  procedurally, it's gonna be very difficult because we have this paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1749.813s">Ultimately,</a>  the committee report included a number of items, one of which would be to include retrofitting the existing structure to expand <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1759.776s">for</a>  the allowance of fire service expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1762.937s">Um,</a>  the next item would be a cost breakdown, um, as to the whole entire cost of the total project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1770.02s">Um,</a>  a breakdown of our bonded indebtedness at this point in time going out, I believe 15 years Councilor, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1777.424s">Whatever</a>  the life of the box or 30 years, I believe, um, discuss and look at the feasibility of a combined police and fire department in the creation of a construction of a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1787.608s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1788.335s">a</a>  listing of all the locations that were examined to establish the selected location for where this structure is going to be built, when the fire department and the fire chief knew, and that the administration established a working group requiring that members of the fire service division and members of the administration work to address some of the concerns with the training academy, and also that the training academy is an important and vital <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1815.105s">asset</a>  that we have here in the community, and that that's something that we'd like to see continue as we move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1819.988s">I</a>  believe that is reflective of the issues that were brought up in the committee report, Mr. President, just for an informational purpose.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1827.913s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1829.354s">If</a>  I'm leaving anything out.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1833.377s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor De La Russa.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1835.878s">Councilor</a>  Knight had made a two-point intervention into our Committee of the Whole meeting's <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1845.4s">proceedings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1846.061s">I</a>  believe one was to establish a working group and the second was to recommend an examination, if I'm remembering this correctly, an examination into maintaining a portion of the existing building in the architectural drawings to maintain the training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1868.161s">Did</a>  I understand through the chair, the councilor correctly?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1871.66s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1872.561s">Yes,</a>  you did, former Mr. President, and also discussion about pursuing grant funding for the construction of a new training academy underneath the- The federal grant- Urban Area Securities Initiative grant program that the federal government- Yes, hopefully the previous administration didn't, in their dispersal of tens of millions of dollars in the final days of their administration, hopefully some of that money wasn't sent to the Middle East.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1901.627s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1903.087s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1904.528s">I</a>  just wanted to take an opportunity to go over the points that were brought up in the committee report, Mr. President, because procedurally we weren't able to adopt that report at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1913.81s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1917.612s">Any</a>  other discussion?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1918.372s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1920.512s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1923.693s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1926.014s">And</a>  I can appreciate the fact that some members of this council <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1930.313s">uh,</a>  would be interested in retrofitting, uh, the fire station, uh, if we do move forward with the police side. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1938.036s">And</a>  I just want to call to the council's attention the, uh, report that was commissioned by this city back in January, 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1947.98s">It's</a>  entitled, uh, method, police and fire station feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1952.982s">It</a>  was prepared by Donovan Sweeney, uh, architects. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1957.739s">And</a>  I won't go through the hundreds of pages of this report, but I will go to the conclusion and recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1965.186s">And</a>  this was commissioned, I believe the study was $100,000 to see what we should do with our police and fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1974.834s">And</a>  the conclusion and recommendation, Mr. President, states, based on our analysis, evaluation of the existing facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1984.122s">amount</a>  space needed by the departments, and weighing the cost and code implications of renovation, it is our recommendation that all buildings should be replaced with new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=1998.504s">Our</a>  recommendation is based on the information above, but the following factors are most prominent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2004.725s">And</a>  then it goes on to state, Mr. President, and this is to address the retrofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2009.346s">It</a>  says building a separate police department where the academy building now stands <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2014.274s">may</a>  appear on face to be the best alternative to building entirely new facilities, given the cost savings between the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2023.22s">However,</a>  the savings would not be sufficient <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2026.708s">to</a>  renovate the fire station to meet code in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2031.069s">Thus,</a>  the total cost to the city for the combined work at both stations over time would be far greater than any of the options presented in this study. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2041.632s">Plus,</a>  this option would result in poorly utilized space for the fire department in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2048.014s">So</a>  the report that we commissioned, and maybe the mayor doesn't like to look at reports that the city spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2056.589s">states</a>  quite clearly, Mr. President, that a retrofit of the fire department, which I'm hearing now, is not cost effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2065.316s">And</a>  in the long term, would be cheaper to build brand new facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2070.14s">And</a>  that is the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2071.1s">Anyone</a>  can go look, it's online. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2073.002s">There</a>  should be a copy, I assume, within the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2077.485s">But</a>  that's Donovan Sweeney that we contracted with in January 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2081.628s">So</a>  as was recommended by <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2087.193s">this</a>  council and the committee of the whole meeting is that we also view, Mr. President, the fact that we want a combined center. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2095.859s">And</a>  I think that's extremely important to discuss it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2100.643s">If</a>  for whatever reason it's cost prohibitive, for whatever reason it doesn't pan out, at least we have the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2107.587s">At</a>  least we offered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2109.268s">I</a>  remember in the past when we went through with different bonding issues, we'd get four or five different recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2116.26s">And</a>  the council would sit down, in particular I'm talking about the schools when we went through, the science spending for the schools, the pool, some of the larger cost items in the community, we had three or four items that we'd have to pick from. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2132.725s">Say</a>  this is option one, this is option two, this is option three. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2136.686s">Tonight</a>  we're being presented with option mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2141.427s">That's</a>  the mayor's option. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2143.187s">And</a>  we're hearing tonight that, you know what, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2146.315s">Let's</a>  get the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2148.016s">This</a>  is $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2149.337s">And</a>  as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, if we waited a few more weeks to sit down and have discussion about a combined center that addresses both police and fire, that building was built in 1962. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2164.267s">The</a>  conditions on both sides are no different, although I agree the fire probably because of their own upkeep has kept the building up a little different than the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2174.793s">But</a>  both buildings are used seven days a week, 24 hours a day, Mr. President, and we got a lot of use out of them for the past 50-something years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2184.462s">A</a>  lot of use with very little spending in these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2188.003s">Now's</a>  the time to rebuild. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2190.163s">Now's</a>  the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2191.724s">You</a>  have the support, and I'm not gonna speak for members of this council, you have support of this council, Mr. President, to move forward, I believe, with the combined facility that benefits both police and fire, as well as the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2206.547s">So</a>  I'm hoping tonight, Mr. President, that we're able to at least <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2211.849s">put</a>  this off for a few weeks so we can have discussion with the administration about some of the things we brought up tonight, whether it's the training academy, whether it's what's going to take place with the old station, if we build a new station at the training academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2226.583s">These</a>  are the things I think we need answered, Mr. President, before we hastily move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2231.345s">And</a>  I know people aren't going to like hastily, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2234.168s">We</a>  got this last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2235.789s">It's</a>  been six days and we got nothing last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2239.512s">We</a>  were presented with a fact sheet tonight that you read off. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2243.116s">So</a>  we have not received anything until today really on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2247.119s">So</a>  I don't see anything hastily about waiting a few weeks, going over, seeing what our options are about including the fire department in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2256.13s">It</a>  makes fiscal sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2259.032s">It</a>  makes sense from a standpoint of public safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2264.095s">And</a>  that would be my recommendation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2266.816s">So</a>  I hope we can all get together and not divide us, but say, you know what, we want a meeting with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2274.061s">I'm</a>  very disappointed the mayor's not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2276.922s">We</a>  invited her, as you know, you invited her to the Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2280.685s">And</a>  I'm very disappointed in a potential <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2284.823s">a</a>  bonding of over $22 million that the mayor didn't see fit to come to our meeting to discuss her proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2293.465s">This</a>  is not the city solicitor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2295.666s">It's</a>  not a chief of staff proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2297.446s">And</a>  it's not a treasurer's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2299.147s">It's</a>  the mayor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2302.388s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2304.528s">I'd</a>  like to hear what people in the audience have to say and members of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2309.17s">But</a>  my recommendation would be a full and thorough explanation why we can't move forward <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2314.313s">on</a>  a combined center, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2318.075s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2324.719s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2326.06s">Good</a>  evening, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2327.181s">My</a>  name is Robert Penter, former member of the Zargas Party, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2333.064s">I'd</a>  like to go over some points that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2334.645s">Unfortunately,</a>  the whole meeting wasn't televised. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2337.907s">But</a>  it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2341.553s">It's</a>  not a 3,500 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2343.794s">It's</a>  a 35,000 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2346.536s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2347.297s">Number</a>  two, in the report, it states it's going to be three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2351.799s">And</a>  our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2358.823s">The</a>  sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing an excess of a 22 and a half million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2365.788s">And</a>  we don't even know what the contingencies might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2368.629s">proposal</a>  here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2370.33s">This</a>  present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2376.013s">And</a>  because of that, and because of that, I agree with Councilor Marks, the mayor should be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2380.275s">This</a>  is her proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2382.076s">Because</a>  when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2386.178s">How</a>  it got sped up to this point, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2388.52s">But</a>  thankfully because of the police department going out there and having their demonstrations and speaking up <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2395.753s">and</a>  folks coming forward saying it's about time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2398.815s">But</a>  there are some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2399.795s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2401.596s">You</a>  don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates, places, people that you met with, whoever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2407.359s">And</a>  if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2416.204s">At</a>  least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2420.806s">There</a>  wasn't one police union representative on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2425.4s">So</a>  what does that tell you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2426.841s">Where</a>  was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2432.083s">The</a>  other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2435.484s">You're</a>  hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2443.368s">That's</a>  great for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2445.369s">This</a>  administration was going to be so transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2448.37s">It's</a>  about as transparent as this rug on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2451.995s">More</a>  importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2457.818s">I</a>  can't answer for the chief of police, because I did speak with him last Tuesday night at the council meeting, and there was going to be an announcement the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2465.381s">Whether</a>  he knew what the announcement was or not, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2468.803s">We</a>  didn't get to the finality of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2470.584s">But</a>  if the fire department, like they are here tonight, have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2478.067s">Now</a>  let's talk about the bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2479.92s">because</a>  if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January of 2013, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2484.783s">as</a>  Councilor Marks has alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2486.824s">There</a>  is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2489.384s">And</a>  the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's gonna be to bond the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2504.809s">But</a>  over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2511.151s">mechanically,</a>  electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2516.934s">So</a>  to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together, or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2535.244s">Isn't</a>  it best to sit down and discuss these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2538.347s">rather</a>  than she made the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2540.59s">Who</a>  is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and then she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner, boxing you in like a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2549.561s">If</a>  you don't vote for it, that means you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2551.423s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2552.885s">What's</a>  true is you should be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2555.068s">We're</a>  all part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2556.91s">whether</a>  we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're being. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2562.153s">But</a>  more importantly, you have fire and police out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2565.274s">And</a>  to some degree, they are divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2567.035s">Because</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2568.176s">The</a>  fire department is starting to realize things that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2571.237s">Just</a>  because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital improvement program, what does that say? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2577.28s">Where</a>  is that going? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2578.341s">How</a>  does that affect them on their side of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2581.625s">You</a>  just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2589.27s">6,</a>  3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2597.516s">Well,</a>  why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2600.518s">Is</a>  that gonna be something that's gonna be a challenge? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2603.119s">Well,</a>  I would hope not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2604.6s">You</a>  pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2607.662s">Another</a>  thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2612.568s">The</a>  city treasurer is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2613.988s">She</a>  has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2620.85s">And</a>  by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2630.152s">I</a>  want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2631.572s">As</a>  a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2635.913s">Because</a>  is the city saying your taxes won't go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2640.475s">Your</a>  rates won't go up because of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2643.219s">And</a>  where is all the grants from the federal government and the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2647.843s">The</a>  city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2654.029s">Where</a>  is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2657.952s">Has</a>  anyone received one? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2659.393s">Have</a>  you become aware of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2661.275s">You</a>  don't even know if they've even applied for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2663.736s">It</a>  would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2667.3s">And</a>  if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2677.09s">But</a>  she shut you out too, which is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2680.433s">You</a>  can't do it by yourself, your own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2684.518s">You</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2685.839s">You</a>  get elected to do a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2687.841s">You</a>  talk about being transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2689.802s">You</a>  talk about being independent voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2692.425s">How</a>  can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2699.49s">You</a>  know, we spent $110,000 for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2709.045s">You</a>  had a Committee of the Whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2712.467s">And</a>  I don't think any one fireman or any one police woman or lady, police man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman, I don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2726.095s">But</a>  this is crunch time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2728.057s">You're</a>  talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2733.58s">And</a>  unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2748.071s">The</a>  report talks about a merger of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2751.153s">It</a>  talks about the irregular space that you have over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2753.995s">It</a>  also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2762.725s">You're</a>  only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2765.626s">So</a>  your space requirements are already confined. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2768.447s">And</a>  to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2772.028s">Where's</a>  the parking facility going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2774.109s">And</a>  if you're going to have a schematic design? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2776.37s">You</a>  talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2779.671s">Six</a>  to eight months are going to prove to be what? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2781.331s">You're</a>  going to go out there for a design. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2782.612s">But</a>  to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2785.633s">You're</a>  going to have to agree and disagree on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2787.593s">And</a>  you're going to have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2788.734s">And</a>  you're going to have to have people input, your input. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2793.322s">Taxpayers'</a>  input, it's their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2796.523s">It's</a>  the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2798.183s">And</a>  I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2807.266s">They</a>  should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2815.669s">It</a>  wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2823.458s">The</a>  stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2827.663s">And</a>  right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2834.311s">Why</a>  would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion for the fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2840.078s">without</a>  you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2853.964s">You</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2855.524s">You</a>  know, we live in a great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2857.405s">We</a>  have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2862.687s">But</a>  we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2867.243s">understanding</a>  that we all can't think the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2870.226s">But</a>  if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2877.093s">Today</a>  is Valentine's Day, and I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2881.577s">But</a>  with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2888.443s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2889.304s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2901.434s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2905.617s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2907.238s">I'll</a>  try not to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2910.581s">I</a>  know we had a lengthy 6 to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2912.823s">meeting,</a>  but I am going to just reiterate probably a couple of things, so forgive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2919.728s">I</a>  think it's a really terrible situation that we've been put in tonight, that our two departments have been put in tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2926.969s">And</a>  I think that flows from the lack of transparency in the closed door meetings with regards to this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2933.554s">When</a>  we met with the mayor in the spring, we went over a draft capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2940.058s">We</a>  were told that the preliminary studies weren't going to be done for new police station until 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2946.903s">I</a>  think the fire department 2 million were for later in that 2019, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2953.908s">I</a>  don't know if you have the plan in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2957.806s">We</a>  thought we were going to have ample opportunity to sit down and discuss it as a council with the community where every issue, every concern would be vetted properly before any decisions were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2974.471s">We</a>  did push for it to happen far sooner than 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2979.013s">So</a>  on one hand, I'm very happy that the administration wants to move forward on a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2985.751s">or</a>  anything at all with regards to spending of that sort, I am happy and that's something that our men and women do deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=2994.714s">But</a>  to be told through text message last Tuesday night after a council meeting that there was a press conference, we weren't told what it was about, I couldn't make it, I think I was in court on Wednesday, I found out Wednesday afternoon that we have a new police station and I found out the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3012.72s">No</a>  idea of any details until tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3016.339s">questions</a>  that we have that need to be answered before we take this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3021.383s">And</a>  that's something that we could have asked, these questions we could have asked back in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3028.77s">I</a>  went back and just read some of the highlights from the state of the city address and some of the quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3036.917s">We</a>  are here as one city because we are strong and believe in writing this chapter together. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3046.94s">Working</a>  in collaboration with elected officials in a high level dialogue to renew and improve our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3052.744s">I</a>  felt sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3056.346s">I</a>  was going to go back and read some campaign promises, but I really would have got sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3064.571s">You</a>  have a police station that needs to be redone, but we also have a building just as old from the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3071.616s">We</a>  haven't, I said it in the committee of the whole meeting, we haven't toured that facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3075.722s">We</a>  toured the DPW yard in 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3077.443s">We</a>  toured the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3080.065s">I</a>  toured the police station in August, ran out of there, felt filthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3083.748s">So</a>  I know it needs to be redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3085.85s">But</a>  whether it's a couple weeks or a month, we need to do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3090.594s">The</a>  fire department and the chief of fire has to come back from Florida to be able to sit with the mayor and voice his concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3100.036s">The</a>  whole process is done wrong, and we're left in a position where we're going to look like big jerks for not voting for it, or heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3107.441s">I</a>  mean, either way, we're going to lose tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3111.984s">But</a>  the bottom line is, we haven't been given any information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3115.106s">And</a>  this is a $2 million that is going to be spent on architecture for a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3121.501s">If</a>  we have the commitment of the administration, and they really want to do a new police station, and we ask them to do a dual facility, or at least explore the option, then we need to take a week and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3134.79s">We</a>  can get some quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3137.992s">I've</a>  been in Malden's police facility, and it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3141.554s">We</a>  can get some quotes from surrounding towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3145.137s">We</a>  can't put this on the books and delay new fire updates <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3150.813s">fire</a>  department station one for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3154.074s">It</a>  just can't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3155.775s">We're</a>  going to have the fire department picketing in two, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3161.476s">I</a>  think it's really lousy way to run a business, let alone a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3167.798s">Lack</a>  of transparency, closed, I think it was stated, closet telephone booth discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3174.62s">I</a>  loved that quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3175.721s">I</a>  used it in a different context, but I loved it because that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3182.102s">And</a>  it's wrong, and I think we need to explore all options, and we need to take a week or two to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3187.106s">We've</a>  delayed this years, like it was said before. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3189.408s">We</a>  can sit and meet next week and discuss it, have the mayor come to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3194.053s">We</a>  asked her to come tonight, and she wasn't present, and we couldn't even get some answers because certain department heads weren't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3204.262s">So</a>  I ask, too, that we just get the figures of doing a dual, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3209.206s">I</a>  have the police and fire study from 2013 in front of me too, very clear that that site, if we're gonna keep it on that site, it should be done together as a dual station, police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3222.332s">It's</a>  gonna...</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3233.893s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, my name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3235.875s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3236.876s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford I was the one who used the expression closet and telephone booth discussions and I used that in the context of saying that that is not what occurred Administrations of every city and township throughout the Commonwealth throughout the country <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3253.335s">When</a>  the chief executive of a city or town makes a decision on how to proceed, they have to do so by way of checking things out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3260.898s">And</a>  they don't check things out by going into the newspaper and saying, this afternoon I'm going here, next week I'm going here, next month I'm going here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3269.622s">He</a>  or she who operates as an executive goes out with their administration and they check out different sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3275.505s">It</a>  was represented to this council earlier that that's indeed what Mayor Burke did. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3280.003s">And</a>  she went to many different sites and talked to many different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3283.707s">I</a>  was involved in many of those discussions also. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3286.69s">Some</a>  of those owners said, we will talk with you, but only if this is kept on a confidential basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3292.676s">But</a>  not all of them did. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3294.238s">Some</a>  of the locations that you've alluded to, yes, we talked about those places. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3298.423s">But</a>  most of them had one particular deficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3301.846s">and</a>  that was acquisition cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3304.306s">At</a>  least that and maybe other deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3306.947s">And</a>  it was millions of dollars for acquisition cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3310.147s">One</a>  of the great positives about the location which has been chosen by Mayor Burke is this, the acquisition cost is absolute zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3318.889s">And</a>  that puts the city so far ahead as far as financing this project that it cannot be denied, it cannot be overlooked by anyone who's going to be prudent with taxpayer money <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3331.118s">and</a>  the city's budgetary needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3333.319s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3335.219s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3451.728s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3452.868s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3456.109s">I</a>  must say that I think the biggest concern that I have is that when I showed up at this meeting, there were <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3462.0s">A</a>  lot of police and fire here who had questions that they wanted answers to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3466.344s">A</a>  lot of us had questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3467.565s">I</a>  was here at the meeting last week and nobody knew anything about this announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3472.108s">It's</a>  pretty upsetting to hear that when I voted in November of 2015, I selected a mayoral candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3478.282s">I</a>  selected city councilors and I expected that they would all work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3482.365s">Both</a>  mayoral candidates said that they wanted to run the city open and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3487.708s">So</a>  either person who won should have been in a position to go to our city council and have these conversations about the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3496.194s">To</a>  hear that a text message was sent out that said, hey, show up at this place and I have a great announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3502.402s">It's</a>  pretty upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3503.663s">That's</a>  not how the city is supposed to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3505.826s">As</a>  a citizen, I don't expect to be apprised of everything happening in the city, but I do hope that my city council is involved in big decisions such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3514.996s">And</a>  to find out that the fire station, the fire department still doesn't know exactly what's going to happen for them with their training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3522.539s">And</a>  you're being asked to approve $2 million in funding for an architectural study, that the fire station also needs to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3531.283s">There's</a>  only so much money in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3532.844s">And</a>  if we're going to undertake a huge project on this site, then we need to make sure it's the best possible project for our city and for all of our public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3543.789s">I</a>  just think that <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3546.011s">If</a>  you don't have the answers to the questions, then this isn't the time to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3549.754s">You</a>  should definitely pursue a combination of police and fire and get the best that we can for all of these hardworking men and women who are keeping us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3558.02s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3751.903s">We</a>  have to vote the paper out of committee first.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3761.626s">We</a>  have a paper before us that needs to be acted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3764.187s">You've</a>  got to table this first.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3766.307s">So</a>  if we motion to table this while we report the other one out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3774.513s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Langevin to table this while we take the committee paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=3779.036s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4089.409s">I</a>  believe we said executive session to go over those sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4093.085s">Because</a>  there was confidential issues?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4097.226s">That</a>  would be wise, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4100.207s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4101.088s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4101.948s">There's</a>  something you've got to take up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4103.188s">Yeah,</a>  coach.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4103.689s">Just</a>  if we could add.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4106.289s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4107.89s">Councilor</a>  Long. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4108.37s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4108.43s">Just</a>  add possible grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4114.032s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4114.912s">He</a>  has it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4118.774s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4122.435s">Judge</a>  Alena. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4123.677s">Councilman</a>  Kern, you have your letter.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4125.718s">That's</a>  just grant funding for a potential dual facility.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4150.735s">We</a>  have a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4153.366s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4153.926s">Return</a>  my motion to the floor for approval of 17-075 loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4160.308s">City</a>  of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4163.868s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4166.849s">Move</a>  for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4169.51s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4171.91s">Mr.</a>  President, I think at this point, I don't think anyone behind the reel wants to walk away tonight with, uh, you know, not a deal in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4180.63s">But</a>  it's difficult to negotiate when you have members of the council willing to discuss and we don't have the other party at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4190.093s">It's</a>  very difficult, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4192.473s">And</a>  what I would ask is for maybe a two-week, three-week, whatever grace period we need, under your leadership, to sit down with the mayor and discuss these nine or 10 issues that we brought up on behalf of this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4206.137s">behalf</a>  of both departments, and behalf of the citizens, and discuss them with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4210.861s">Now</a>  if we come to an impasse or we're unable to move forward, then it'll be up to this council to come back again and decide what they want to do, if they want to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4221.53s">But</a>  that's do our due diligence now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4224.793s">That's</a>  wait the two weeks, whatever that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4226.995s">I'm</a>  willing to meet tomorrow, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4229.116s">It</a>  doesn't matter to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4230.277s">That's</a>  do our homework and our due diligence, get these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4234.541s">If</a>  the mayor's adamantly opposed to building one combined public safety facility, then we have our answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4240.466s">Then</a>  we have our answer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4242.227s">It'll</a>  be up to this council whether they want to move forward or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4245.81s">But</a>  right now, we don't have the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4247.892s">And</a>  I personally think that's the best answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4250.675s">I</a>  think it's the best answer for all parties, and I think it's one we can afford, Mr. President, in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4257.2s">We</a>  haven't spent anything on public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4259.442s">We</a>  have to beg, borrow, and steal to get new cars, new apparatus. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4263.726s">We're</a>  not spending anything on public safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4269.547s">That</a>  would be my recommendation, Mr. President, that within the next two weeks that you call for a meeting with the mayor, and we sit down and go over these particular items, and if we aren't able to come to a resolve, then the paper's right before us again. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4283.415s">The</a>  paper's not going anywhere with the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4286.056s">It's</a>  right before us again, Mr. President, and we'll take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4289.978s">I'm</a>  prepared to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4291.499s">I'm</a>  prepared to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4294.24s">Give</a>  the process a little time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4296.121s">We've</a>  had no time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4297.502s">We've</a>  had no process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4300.002s">Admittedly,</a>  even some of the representatives from the mayor's office, I think admittedly have said the process has been lax. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4306.028s">There</a>  hasn't really been a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4308.31s">They</a>  may be working behind the scenes, Mr. President, but surely it hasn't involved us as a council or other city employees that have the largest impact on Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4320.662s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4325.353s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo does have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4327.335s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4327.895s">He</a>  can have all the motions he want. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4329.216s">He</a>  sat on the subcommittee that recommended something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4332.139s">Now</a>  he's sitting, he's going with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4334.361s">That's</a>  fine, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4335.782s">I</a>  want to do the right thing on behalf of the employees in this city and in the taxpayers of this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4341.907s">And</a>  there's no rush to judgment over the next two weeks to sit down with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4346.151s">We</a>  haven't sat down with her once since she offered this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4349.353s">Not</a>  once. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4351.587s">We're</a>  not spending $20, it's $2 million for a study.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4359.492s">Mr.</a>  President, Mark Rumley, there is not one item on that list that cannot be discussed, whether it's this week, next week, or the week after, which would be prohibited if this paper took its first reading tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4376.102s">Not</a>  one issue on that paper which came out of committee would be prohibited from being discussed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4381.646s">Mr.</a>  President, with all due respect... <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4383.771s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4386.273s">The</a>  gentleman here is acting on behalf of the mayor, as the mayor's spokesperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4390.276s">I</a>  object, I'm on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4392.118s">This</a>  is not a court, you can't object to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4393.959s">Yes</a>  I can, I'll object to you today, tomorrow, or the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4397.582s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could finish my comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4399.464s">I'm</a>  very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4400.805s">Very</a>  confused is an apt description. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4403.327s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4405.289s">Mr.</a>  President, the gentleman comes up here as the mayor's spokesperson, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4411.974s">Then</a>  he's coming up here based on legal maneuvers that we're doing as a council and voting on issues to give his opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4419.02s">I</a>  don't know what he's acting as. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4420.081s">City</a>  solicitor, the mayor's spokesperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4422.463s">I</a>  can't understand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4423.544s">Well,</a>  I'll make it clear to you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4424.985s">I</a>  don't understand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4425.826s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4427.387s">You</a>  should act as the city solicitor, not the mayor's spokesperson.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4429.869s">And</a>  as to procedure, perhaps the council should get its act together on procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4434.633s">Well,</a>  you can't be both. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4435.534s">You're</a>  wearing two hats tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4436.775s">No,</a>  I will be a spokesperson and a city solicitor, and I will not be insulted in this fashion.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4442.056s">And</a>  you should not be.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4443.836s">Councilor,</a>  Mr. Solicitor, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4446.177s">The</a>  colonel, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4447.797s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4448.597s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4451.978s">And</a>  happy Valentine's Day, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4453.558s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4454.038s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4486.192s">Name</a>  and address for the record please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4487.392s">Robert</a>  Penta, Zero Summit Road, Bedford, Mass, former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4490.853s">You</a>  know, this is the problem that's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4494.414s">Councilor</a>  Knight just hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4496.752s">You</a>  have questions to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4497.953s">You've</a>  waited some 15, 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4499.554s">The</a>  chief says it's been some 20 years looking for a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4502.917s">It's</a>  not gonna happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4504.038s">You're</a>  gonna have to take six to eight months before you even get the groundwork going. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4508.261s">Let</a>  me make an offering here that maybe you folks through the presidency, go to the mayor tomorrow morning, because I saw her walking out of the building tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4516.988s">Apparently</a>  she decided not to come to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4519.33s">This</a>  is her baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4520.31s">This</a>  is not your baby, it's her baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4522.152s">She's</a>  the one that made the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4524.273s">You</a>  tell her that you wanna sit down and talk with her, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4527.107s">You</a>  have all the questions you wanna ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4528.848s">It</a>  would be nice, maybe the first time in some, what, 16 months, that you had an opportunity for all of you to sit down, break some bread in our office, and just saying, hey, these are the questions we're going, let's do this all together, and maybe you can come to some sense of resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4543.892s">I</a>  don't think a week or two is gonna make any difference right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4546.273s">I</a>  don't think a first reading is gonna make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4548.633s">Because</a>  the fact of the matter is, you don't have your questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4551.434s">And</a>  until those questions are answered, you're not gonna be able to go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4555.153s">You</a>  know, Councilor Falco, you had a concern over the tower, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4559.696s">You</a>  know, you don't have that answer yet, but we can get into all the minutia of the questions that need to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4565.301s">So</a>  why don't you just reverse it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4567.282s">Call</a>  her up tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4570.246s">8.30</a>  when she comes to work, like everybody else at City Hall, 8.30 in the morning, go knocking on her door and just saying, we're having a meeting with you, Madam Mayor and the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4579.27s">She</a>  needs you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4580.351s">You</a>  don't need her. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4581.251s">Remember</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4582.412s">You're</a>  her breadstrings. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4583.892s">You're</a>  her lifeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4585.713s">And</a>  if you don't hold her feet to the fire, she'll just use you each and every time she wants something done for her, to make her look politically good, and to embarrass you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4595.221s">And</a>  right now, that's the position you're in, an embarrassing position, but you don't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4600.266s">Now's</a>  the time to turn around, put your big boy suits on, and your shoes, and your girl, and your high heels, and go knock on that door, and say, we're here to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4607.732s">If</a>  you wanna do business, we're ready to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4610.135s">If</a>  not, we're shutting down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4611.796s">That's</a>  what I would do.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4618.837s">Councilor</a>  Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4620.678s">I</a>  don't support a government shutdown, Mr. President, just for the record.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4626.581s">We</a>  have a motion by Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4629.942s">Councilor</a>  Marks, Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4631.723s">I</a>  would respectfully ask my colleague to withdraw his motion so we can compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4637.326s">All</a>  we're asking is for two weeks and then we'll take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4640.567s">Either</a>  way, it's gonna be a guaranteed vote so we can iron out some of the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4646.71s">That</a>  could be a commitment by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4648.79s">There's</a>  seven of us here, and I think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4652.052s">As</a>  Councilor Knight just said, let's get some answers, we'll come back to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4655.254s">That's</a>  a guarantee. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4657.135s">This</a>  is not gonna go, this issue is not going away by any stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4660.437s">So</a>  no one's gonna leave here tonight saying we're not gonna get a station or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4664.5s">There's</a>  gonna be a guaranteed cement answer within two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4668.042s">I</a>  would respectfully ask my colleague in the suggestion to compromise.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4673.565s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4674.686s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4677.416s">In</a>  the spirit of compromise, Councilor Marks raises a very good point, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4681.139s">Number</a>  two, I think it's very important that if, in fact, we are going to sit down and discuss this, that there is a date certain that we come back to further discuss this debate in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4690.865s">So</a>  if we can't get our questions answered, then we should have a date certain that we're going to come back and actually vote on the paper.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4696.669s">So</a>  I certainly appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4697.95s">I</a>  think that that's an excellent suggestion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4707.248s">Councilor</a>  Lococo. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4708.368s">I</a>  was just going to say, we just want questions answered too. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4710.949s">Just</a>  sitting in meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4711.989s">It</a>  goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4714.07s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4715.13s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4717.091s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo, your colleague has asked that you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4721.952s">I</a>  acknowledge that my colleague has asked the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4725.193s">My</a>  motion stands, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4726.934s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4727.674s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo's motion has made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4731.495s">Do</a>  we have a second on Councilor Dello Russo's motion?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4735.016s">So,</a>  Mr. President, just so I understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4737.753s">If</a>  we vote against Councilor Dello Russo's motion, is it true the paper cannot come back to us, the police station paper, for six months, Mr. President, after a denial of his counsel?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4748.699s">I</a>  think it's 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4750.16s">Three</a>  months? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4750.78s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, could you- I'll ask it for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4753.502s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, would that be correct?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4754.962s">This</a>  paper will be laid up for three months under the councilor's recommendation, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4762.086s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4764.308s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4766.858s">this</a>  ample opportunity within the intervening weeks after the first reading to have conversation about the matters that are presented tonight, in my estimation.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4792.743s">Mr.</a>  President, I have a motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4799.065s">If</a>  somebody feels that they can get their questions answered in that time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4805.908s">Mr.</a>  President, I just think people at home and people in the audience should know that if Councilor Dello Russo's motion does not prevail, we cannot discuss that for another 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4817.198s">So</a>  just want you to know that, that people will be disposed of. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4821.62s">So</a>  what I'm asking is a two-week compromise to be back at this table in two weeks for a vote.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4828.564s">I</a>  think that's a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4829.885s">Mr.</a>  President, the two weeks intervening is ample opportunity, and this is not a final vote on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4840.65s">The</a>  logic doesn't follow, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4842.511s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4844.723s">The</a>  vote is to move forward on a paper that solely looks at the architectural design for a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4852.608s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4853.349s">Now,</a>  if we include a fire station, I'm sure whoever's going to do this design is going to say, you're not getting it for $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4860.113s">It's</a>  going to cost you, City of Method, $2.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4863.601s">The</a>  paper does not ask for a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4867.143s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4867.904s">So</a>  what I'm saying is, by moving forward on a paper that doesn't address the issues, doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4873.367s">You're</a>  putting the cart before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4875.649s">Let's</a>  get this ironed out, and then we'll know the exact dollar amount we need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4880.512s">It</a>  might be a combined center, or it might just be the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4883.534s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4884.334s">But</a>  that vote will come in two weeks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4886.316s">So</a>  I respectfully ask my colleague again to withdraw his motion, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4890.898s">Councilor</a>  De La Rosa? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4894.823s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, do we have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4897.685s">I'm</a>  not seconding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=4906.431s">We</a>  do not have a second, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5952.649s">So</a>  at 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5953.829s">this</a>  morning, I was awakened by a big bang, a pickup truck snowplow from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5960.271s">It</a>  was the city of Medford pickup truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5962.491s">And</a>  he was moving up and down Winthrop Street with his blade lowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5966.692s">His</a>  intention was to widen the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5970.469s">I</a>  ran outside and he flew by me with his blade dropped. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5974.072s">He</a>  was going over excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5976.754s">He</a>  was doing 50 miles an hour with his blade dropped. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5979.556s">Not</a>  five, 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5980.276s">I'm</a>  pretty accurate with this because I can see how fast he was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5985.54s">He</a>  hit my snow bank before my driveway, shot snow throwing it all over my entrance to my driveway and my sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5995.687s">I</a>  got in my vehicle and I went to look for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5998.65s">I</a>  didn't find him. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=5999.947s">I</a>  went down to the city yard, walked in, there was a gentleman behind the desk, he was sleeping, and before I continue, I just wanna say, I'm not disrespecting the municipality because I think they're one of the greatest municipalities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6013.413s">I'm</a>  gonna reiterate that at the end of this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6016.655s">I</a>  wake up the guy behind the desk, told him what happened, he said, I will report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6022.798s">I</a>  went home, waited for about 10, 15 minutes, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6026.322s">Nothing</a>  happened, so I picked up four big chunks of ice that weighed about 50 pounds, brought them over to the snowbank, put them back, then I cleared my driveway with a shovel and my sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6039.49s">Okay,</a>  so, after I was done with that, the same truck came speeding down the street, now I'm watching him as he's coming towards my house, and he's cascading and hitting every snowbank with a pickup truck, trying to widen the street, which is not gonna do it because it's iced. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6054.819s">Everything</a>  is frozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6056.937s">Same</a>  thing, and he's hitting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6059.94s">I</a>  stepped out, he seen me, but his windshield was, on his passenger's side, was covered with snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6066.365s">So</a>  he probably didn't really see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6068.147s">Lifted</a>  his blade and he went around. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6070.009s">Went</a>  over the double yellow line. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6071.39s">Hit</a>  the speed bump, put his blade back down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6074.152s">What</a>  speed bump? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6075.433s">Well,</a>  whatever, the hump that's in the middle of the street, raised from the water damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6079.517s">Whatever</a>  you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6081.859s">Okay,</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6083.829s">He</a>  lifted his thing, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6085.51s">He</a>  probably would've, if he didn't see me, probably would've re-buried my driveway, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6090.933s">I'm</a>  not someone to complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6092.875s">In</a>  fact, this is not the first time this incident has happened in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6097.918s">A</a>  snow blower truck, City of Medford, the big one, came by in the snow storms of 2015 and shot three feet of snow onto my sidewalk, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6108.284s">Which</a>  is about 25 feet long from neighbor to neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6113.627s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6114.948s">I</a>  have a bobcat, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6118.111s">It's</a>  52 years old, still runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6120.573s">I</a>  had to remove that snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6122.235s">Okay,</a>  so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6124.177s">My</a>  question is, who's in charge of these people? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6126.659s">Who's</a>  supervising them? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6127.68s">Okay,</a>  and I'm not knocking them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6129.282s">And</a>  I'm gonna get to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6132.665s">I'm</a>  probably not the only resident that this has happened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6136.03s">Since</a>  the water break pipe two months ago, we've had this hump in the middle of the street across from side to side. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6141.255s">So</a>  the plow drivers do not come close to the curb as they're plowing because they want to avoid the hump. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6148.661s">So</a>  now the snow banks are extended about two and a half to five feet out from the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6156.028s">All</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6157.489s">Before</a>  it, which extended to the snow bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6159.391s">Okay,</a>  so anyway, before my house, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6162.99s">The</a>  snow bank is about four feet away from the curb, right before my driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6168.053s">Okay,</a>  and they keep continuing, it's not moving, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6174.956s">I</a>  decided that I was gonna move all the snow today, so I went 25 feet in front of my house, and I removed four feet of snow, 25 feet from my neighbor's to my driveway, picked up the snow, I got a little snow farm in the backyard now, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6193.587s">listen</a>  I'm getting kind of like tired of this so you know again I don't know who's not accountable for this stuff and again I try to do my part to help the city all right <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6203.942s">But</a>  the patient thing, especially when you're not feeling well and you try to work a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6209.083s">And</a>  I understand some of the guys that are in the municipality are not really experienced, some of them might not be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6215.305s">They</a>  learn from being in the municipalities for years, I get that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6219.006s">And</a>  a lot of them, they're tired, they're overworked, they just wanna get home, I get that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6224.388s">I'm</a>  not disrespecting anybody, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6226.068s">DPW</a>  method, it's not my intention here, but at my age, my patience with incompetence gets a little, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6233.625s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6234.525s">So</a>  I can do my part to respect the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6237.547s">I</a>  would like a little respect back, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6240.468s">You</a>  know, the Method DDTW is one of the finest municipalities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6243.73s">I</a>  know you guys know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6245.331s">But</a>  like I said, I just wanted to reiterate this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6248.933s">I've</a>  seen and done some things, and I'm not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6251.934s">I've</a>  been in this field of earth moving and snow removal for 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6257.577s">So</a>  I've seen how it takes a storm, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6261.408s">But</a>  this is a safety matter, and I mean like, I like to do one job once and not have to do it again, and this kinda like peed me off a little bit, and I don't mean to use that phrase, but it kinda really did.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6271.988s">I</a>  did receive some other calls, and... <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6274.03s">and</a>  I did make Brian Cairns aware of it, and we will send a letter to him from the clerk.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6283.376s">I</a>  mean, I don't wanna hurt anybody's jobs.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6285.257s">No</a>  one's looking to hurt anybody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6286.798s">I</a>  don't want anybody losing their jobs, I just know what I've seen and what I observed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6291.04s">You're</a>  not the only one that's complained about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6292.902s">Now,</a>  the front of my house, 314 Winthrop Street, you go by there, anyone of you who's wanna take a picture, I cleared four feet of snow from the curb, now the curb is visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6302.371s">So</a>  the next time around, if there's a snowstorm, you guys can come on in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6306.595s">But</a>  that bump has to be addressed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6308.336s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6311.058s">If</a>  you could send them to Commissioner Kerins. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6315.102s">Yes,</a>  this is Rick, please.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6318.564s">Regards</a>  to what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6319.866s">If</a>  we could just get an update from DPW with regards to the incident that happened on Winthrop Street near 314, but you said, I think it sounded like it went all the way down the street a couple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6331.618s">So</a>  we just can get a written update with regards to, you know, if he can make sure he knows who did it, if it was a contractor, if it was one of our personnel, and we make sure we do it right the next time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6342.586s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6343.227s">And</a>  I believe the sinking.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6344.788s">And</a>  the sinking.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6346.209s">Yeah,</a>  well, the sinkhole there from the leak, which probably won't get fixed till the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6351.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6353.395s">Name</a>  and address of the wreckage.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6354.956s">Castaneri,</a>  Cushing Street, Methodist. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6357.231s">I'm</a>  sorry sometimes that people are not satisfied with some of the work that's being done in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6362.115s">However,</a>  I'm not on either side of the party, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6367.62s">I</a>  must say, it seems to me that the DPW workers are overworked and understaffed, especially with these recent storms and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6378.029s">Maybe</a>  some of this free cash should be spent to hire <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6381.817s">some</a>  key positions in DPW, because they work really hard, and they're very tired.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6387.562s">That's</a>  what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6388.142s">Spent</a>  a tough few days with the DPW, and they've done a lot of work keeping up with the snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6396.409s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6398.17s">Good</a>  evening, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6402.233s">Last</a>  week at the State of the City, Mrs. Burke finally let us know that she's gonna have an access TV station, <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6410.752s">No,</a>  I'm not the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6411.913s">Councilor</a>  Pente had to suffer that, too, from these ignorant people that are supposed to get paid $30,000 a year to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6418.457s">That</a>  being said, she said there would be a TV station in late spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6422.599s">Now,</a>  I want you to hear the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6424.36s">March</a>  26th of last year at the school committee, Heidi Riccio said we'd have an access station in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6430.244s">Mrs.</a>  Burke came up and disagreed with her and said October. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6433.966s">I</a>  visited Roy Belson in November, and he said, Joe, we're going to have it in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6437.96s">February</a>  8th, we hear it's going to be late spring, which I take as June. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6442.463s">Now,</a>  this causes irreparable harm to the election 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6446.005s">For</a>  all you people running again, if you are running again, irreparable harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6449.807s">You</a>  don't have the access that we have in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6451.968s">Now,</a>  our esteemed city solicitor, who made it clear that I'm the city solicitor tonight, he had to emphasize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6457.612s">I</a>  guess people don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6459.333s">He</a>  told me that access is obsolete in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6462.234s">And</a>  I said, Mark, teaching children <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6465.842s">computers,</a>  teaching seniors computers, as they do in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6469.206s">The</a>  E.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6469.926s">brings</a>  the computers to the senior housing and the seniors learn computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6473.73s">I</a>  said, that's obsolete. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6474.991s">And</a>  he goes, oh, I guess you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6476.573s">Well,</a>  it's obsolete if you're Tom Brady and you're suspended by Roger Goodell for four weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6481.358s">Then</a>  Tom Brady's obsolete. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6482.94s">That's</a>  the standard our city solicitor uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6485.282s">It's</a>  self-serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6486.571s">And</a>  it's censorship, it's pure censorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6488.992s">Now</a>  what I propose, now that Mrs. Burke has said that the vocational school is getting the lion's share of the time for the access station, wait a minute, they already get the educational monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6500.798s">Why</a>  should they also get the access monies? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6502.759s">And</a>  access TV we'll have at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6504.52s">At</a>  night, Mrs. Burke, would you send your mother, a senior citizen, up the ramp? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6510.203s">at</a>  the vocational school at 7 o'clock at night, Mrs. Burke? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6514.889s">Why</a>  would you do that to my grandmother or anyone in my family? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6518.053s">Why</a>  would you do that, Mrs. Burke? <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6519.856s">We</a>  need what Mayor McGlynn's tribunal said, to have it in a central location. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6525.89s">I</a>  proposed a van. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6527.231s">We</a>  have 600 grand there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6529.052s">A</a>  van with two cameras that go over the cellular wires. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6532.375s">This</a>  is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6533.296s">You</a>  don't need cable anymore to do public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6536.618s">You</a>  just need the cellular wires. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6537.939s">Now,</a>  I'm very proud of our council president, Mr. Caraviello, who said the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6542.743s">I</a>  agree with him wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6544.384s">And</a>  I talked to Barbara Kerr. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6545.765s">We</a>  have some space for computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6547.927s">Learn</a>  computers at the library, Mr. Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6550.589s">That</a>  is what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6552.482s">bequeathed</a>  to the city for, for educational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6555.785s">So</a>  we can put some computers up there, have a van, the van goes from the Chevalier to the library and roams around town. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6562.691s">When</a>  Mr. Falco is speaking at a luncheon, we tape him. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6566.254s">When</a>  Mr. Scarpelli is doing a sports event, we tape him. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6569.637s">When</a>  Breonna Lungo-Koehn has something, a function, we tape our elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6575.722s">That's</a>  what it's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6577.623s">They</a>  have it in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6578.964s">So</a>  when I won an award on January 19th, Joe Kurtatone won an award and he said, you keep us politicians honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6586.669s">That's</a>  from Joe Kurtatone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6588.611s">And</a>  he was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6589.371s">And</a>  he got massive applause because he leaves us alone in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6593.534s">God</a>  bless him, he leaves us alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6595.356s">Love</a>  him or hate him, he did the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6598.258s">And</a>  then he said to us, I guess you people are looking for more funding, giving me the award. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6602.342s">I'm</a>  paraphrasing him. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6603.623s">Pretty</a>  funny, but he deserved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6605.444s">He</a>  said the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6606.665s">We're</a>  flourishing in Somerville, Mr. Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6609.267s">We</a>  are flourishing in Malden, where I'm a music director, Mr. Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6613.693s">So</a>  I'm a music director in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6615.954s">I'm</a>  a music director in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6617.554s">I</a>  have these titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6618.675s">I</a>  have these awards from Winchester and Somerville, Mr. Rumley, but our citizens, our seniors, our children do not have these awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6626.197s">They</a>  do not have our football games. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6628.357s">Malden</a>  has our Thanksgiving game. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6632.132s">I've</a>  been here talking for, what, since 2005, 2004, about public access issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6637.695s">It's</a>  13 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6639.156s">I</a>  think you know that I'm serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6641.798s">So</a>  if I have to file a class action suit with a lawyer and with some citizens, I intend to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6646.481s">We're</a>  going to have access in the city, in the middle of town, if I have to build one, if I have to build a for-profit access center, and then we will fight for the agreement to put it over Channel 3 and whatever Channel Verizon gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6658.848s">We</a>  need this in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6661.009s">The</a>  children need it, the senior citizens need it, and you as elected officials need to talk to Mrs. Burke, if she'll talk to you, if she's not evading you, need to talk to her and say, two hours for public access with a million dollars a year, that's not fair, Mrs. Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6677.398s">The</a>  VOC has educational money, let them use the educational money, do not touch our access money, because Mrs. Burke, I will see you in court.</p>

No, Steve's a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6793.658s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uOl8IpBqQPs&t=6795.18s">All</a>  right.</p>
