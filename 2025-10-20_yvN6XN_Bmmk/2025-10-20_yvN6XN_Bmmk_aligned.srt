Hi, I'm Anna Callahan.

2
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:11,210
I'm one of your current seven city councilors, and I'm running for re-election.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,037
I've only been here for one term, so less than two years, and I'm really proud of the work that we have done so far.

4
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:23,666
We took a lot of steps to rein in our rodent population with three ordinance to help our staff be more engaged.

5
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:28,810
We have helped make a bunch of steps toward more affordable housing.

6
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:39,340
We have also protected a lot of our residents from the Trump administration, and we have gotten more funding for our schools and for our roads.

7
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,223
I know those things matter to me so much.

8
00:00:43,163 --> 00:01:04,792
And you can really count on me to be a reliable vote for the values that I think we all share here, which is caring about each other, being an inclusive city that cares about everyone and takes care of each other, about, you know, looking at our climate and having sustainability goals, affordability goals, and affordable housing especially.

9
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,094
You can really count on me for those things.

10
00:01:08,854 --> 00:01:18,000
But I want to talk today a little bit about what makes me unique as a city councilor, and that is in the area of democracy and engaging people in the political process.

11
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:29,168
So I take it very seriously that only about 90% to 95% of people will never reach out to their city councilors or show up at a city council meeting.

12
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:36,493
And so I take it upon myself to go into the community to hear from those people who are not actively engaged.

13
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:38,994
And I actually have a team.

14
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:40,375
I have five teams of volunteers.

15
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:51,341
One of my volunteer teams helps me with the logistics of setting up these listening sessions in the community, which might be in a neighborhood or with a union or at a church.

16
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:57,117
I have another volunteer team that helps me before every city council meeting.

17
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:58,978
We go over every item on the agenda.

18
00:01:59,059 --> 00:01:59,739
We do research.

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,140
We reach out to people in the community.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,682
And then I have three policy teams.

21
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:11,827
And the most important thing for you to know is that if you have an idea on how to make our city better, you can come to me.

22
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:16,250
We'll talk about that idea, ideally with other friends of yours or neighbors.

23
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,654
And then I can hook you up with other people in the city who are also interested in that idea

24
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:25,357
so that we can all work together to make it a reality here in Medford.

25
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:43,154
My three current policy teams are working with the city to organize events where a ton of neighbors will come together to plant city sidewalk trees in some of our most barren neighborhoods, which are mostly in South Medford.

26
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:47,338
We've gotten like 70 people interested in doing that, so that's very exciting.

27
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,522
We have a couple of policy teams around housing.

28
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:51,743
One is around co-housing.

29
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:57,189
A number of seniors came to me and were really interested in this type of housing, so we're working toward that.

30
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:03,497
And then another one on home sharing, which is allowing

31
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:05,778
our seniors to age in place.

32
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:07,319
It's something that other cities have done.

33
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:12,082
It's been really successful and helps also with our affordable housing crisis.

34
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:21,308
And the most important thing for you to know is that if you have an idea to make Medford better, come to me, ideally with some other folks that you've been talking to about this idea.

35
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:30,934
I will help you to get a whole team together with other people throughout the city and whatever resources you need so that we can all work together to make Medford a better place.

36
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:31,795
Thank you so much.
