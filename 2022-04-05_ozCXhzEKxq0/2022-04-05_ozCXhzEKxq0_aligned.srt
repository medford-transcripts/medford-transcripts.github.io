1
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:09,124
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our middle school lottery today.

2
00:01:09,705 --> 00:01:15,554
Really appreciate you taking the time and the interest in your children's future as you head to middle school.

3
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,139
Do you want to let you know that we are broadcasting as well on YouTube.

4
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,072
So if you would like to go back and watch this process again, it will be on the district YouTube channel.

5
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:28,674
At this time, I'd like to just introduce our people around the table.

6
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:41,319
We have Kim Miles, who is our data coordinator and really is the person who helps to really build the lottery and make sure that everything is done in a very up and up fashion.

7
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:45,381
Bernadette Riccardelli, our director of curriculum instruction.

8
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:51,011
And our superintendent, who I'm now turning it over to, Dr. Maurice-Edward Vinson.

9
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:53,232
For those of you who don't know, I guess I should introduce myself.

10
00:01:53,712 --> 00:02:02,196
My name is Dr. Pete Cushing, and I'm the assistant superintendent of secondary, and really looking forward to working with your children as they move up to middle school next year.

11
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:05,138
But without any further ado, Dr. Edward Vinson.

12
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,539
Good afternoon, families.

13
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:13,722
I am your very proud superintendent, and I'm very excited to be here this afternoon.

14
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,277
to have us conduct the middle school lottery.

15
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:27,741
And again, as Dr. Cushing already said, everyone who's at the table, this is the team that has been working together to bring about today's lottery.

16
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:33,784
Dr. Riccidelli will be the point person that you email.

17
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:42,627
Be Riccidelli, R-I-C-C-I-A-R-D-E-L-L-I at Medford.

18
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:45,532
dot k 12 dot ma.us.

19
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:55,354
This is again, a process that as we go through each school, there will be two draws for every school.

20
00:02:56,294 --> 00:03:02,215
And Miss miles out there manager will be handling all of that information.

21
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:12,218
I do want to share today that our school website is down, they are servicing it.

22
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:12,598
So

23
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:20,945
Once the lottery is completed, we will be sending emails out later on this evening.

24
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:27,911
And we will also be posting the results on social media until the website is up and running again.

25
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:35,017
So normally, the lottery takes place and we post it as soon as possible onto the district website.

26
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:38,841
But the district website is down, it is being repaired.

27
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:42,434
but it may not be up and running until tomorrow.

28
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:49,438
So they are actively working on it, but we will get the results to you and we will also use social media.

29
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:55,180
So I wanna make sure that everyone can kind of know what to do, what their next step should be.

30
00:03:55,621 --> 00:04:03,765
Thank you for jumping on this call and I'm going to pass it back to Dr. Cushing or Dr. Riccadeli if they would like to share a few remarks.

31
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:08,166
So good afternoon, families.

32
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,167
It's great to see you.

33
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,148
This is a really exciting day for our grade five students.

34
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:19,472
So you will learn soon what middle school you're going to, whether it's the McGlynn or the Andrews, you're going to a great place.

35
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,534
So parents, you did receive a memo.

36
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:29,257
So once you find out what school your student is going to, there is a welcome orientation.

37
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:35,501
So if you refer back to that memo, May 10th from six to eight at the McGlynn Middle School,

38
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:38,830
and May 12 from 6 to 8 at the Andrews Middle School.

39
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,912
So I know you have that memo, but I just want to call your attention.

40
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:48,777
You will have an opportunity to visit those schools and you will know which school your child is going to at that point.

41
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,660
Dr. Cushing, do you have anything else to add?

42
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,221
Otherwise, we can go right over to Ms.

43
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,744
Miles and she can begin the lottery poll.

44
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,506
We'll begin at the Brooks.

45
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:11,790
The most harrowing part is making sure that the printers are working.

46
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,646
Don't remind me I had a technical difficulty but.

47
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:06,391
So the Brooks Lottery won.

48
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,352
Brooks School first draw.

49
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,953
And we'll do Brooks School again second draw.

50
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:26,808
do do

51
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:13,140
So the program that we use is called StatTrack and it's a random number generator.

52
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:35,356
that you put in the parameters, and it will generate the numbers to the individual schools.

53
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:49,944
I gotta say, right now, seeing so many middle schoolers on the call, I know many of you don't have your cameras on, but I gotta say, for those of you that do, you've got some really cool broadcast setups there as well.

54
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:55,445
In particular, Ryan, I'd like to give Ryan a shout out, because that is an awesome setup.

55
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:59,327
I want to say, though, that it's good to see, like, some other kids here.

56
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:11,756
Lee and Lam, all right, maybe with a friend or a brother or sister, I don't know, but it's really good to see so many of you here and taking an interest in your future, and it's really, really awesome.

57
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:17,960
So, you know, as we move to our next... The McGlynn Lottery 1.

58
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,862
McGlynn Lottery 1 is complete.

59
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:23,839
We'll now move to McGlynn lottery number two.

60
00:08:54,941 --> 00:09:01,603
McGlynn Lottery 2 is complete.

61
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:08,444
The next school we will be going to is the Mississippi.

62
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:29,777
Yeah.

63
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:30,198
Yeah.

64
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,876
Lottery number one is complete.

65
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:55,738
Mrs. Tucker, lottery number two coming up at this time.

66
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:58,460
You might have a note.

67
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,543
Sorry, we are out of paper.

68
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:03,544
Just give me a moment.

69
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:44,702
And the Mississauga lottery number two is complete.

70
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:52,024
I also just posted in the chat in case any of you don't have it the YouTube channel for the district.

71
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:56,305
I added that link to the chat for anybody who might be interested.

72
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:03,320
We do broadcast most of our events there, school committee meetings, meetings, such as these and other student focused events.

73
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,222
We do post and broadcast there.

74
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,166
So, now it's Robert's Robert's onto the rocks.

75
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:37,477
One complete.

76
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,212
The Roberts Elementary School try number one is complete.

77
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,029
And that completes Robert's.

78
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,790
Robert's school is now complete and all of our lottery drawers are complete.

79
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,751
Wanted to let everybody know that you have two great middle schools in Medford.

80
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:37,652
And on May 10th from 6 to 8, the McGlynn will be having an open house.

81
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:42,433
And on May 12, 2022, the Andrews will be having an open house.

82
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:57,864
What we're going to do now is going to take these, I'm going to scan them into our Google Drive or my Google Drive, and then I will share them out as quickly as possible to our district Facebook page, which I just put in the chat as well in case you are unaware of it.

83
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,006
You do not need to be a member of Facebook to view it.

84
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:00,927
It's open to all.

85
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:05,578
The link will be posted there and you will be able to find it.

86
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:13,024
And I will try to do that as quickly as possible as the district and city websites may be still down for service.

87
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:19,669
We will be having them posted to the email system as well.

88
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,412
So check your email if you have trouble getting to Facebook.

89
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:26,375
But that takes just a few minutes to generate and to push out.

90
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,718
Once again, I really want to thank you for taking the time today.

91
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,172
and I hope you have a wonderful evening.

92
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:45,902
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email us at briccadelli at medford.k12.ma.us or pcushing at medford.k12.ma.us.

93
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:52,207
Thank you all for being here, and as always, it's a great day to be a Mustang.
