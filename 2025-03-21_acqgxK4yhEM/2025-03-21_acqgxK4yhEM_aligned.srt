1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:05,162
Mr. President, one absent, please rise to salute the flag.

2
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:17,509
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,032
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello for motion to suspend the rules.

4
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:22,072
Thank you, Mr. President.

5
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:23,933
Mr. President, if I could suspend the rules.

6
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:24,634
All those in favor?

7
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:26,948
All those opposed, motion carries.

8
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:30,830
Mr. President, if we could suspend the rules to bring number 16076.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:41,115
The motion of Councilor Caviello to have item number 16076 before us, offered by Councilor Caviello.

10
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:46,938
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send condolences to the family of the Honorable Robert Drennan.

11
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,101
He is a former member of the Medford City Council and also served as Deputy Mayor.

12
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,522
Mr. Drennan was a World War II veteran.

13
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,069
and was awarded two battle stars.

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:12,373
Mr. Drennan was honored by the French General Consul with a certificate of appreciation for his World War II services and was among the American troops that liberated and debriefed the prisoners at Buchenwald concentration camp.

15
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:16,014
His presence in our community will be missed.

16
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:20,715
We ask that tonight's meeting be held in his honor.

17
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:21,916
Consul.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,296
Thank you, Mr. President.

19
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:30,580
Mr. Drennan, who passed away this week, is the second — I think just a couple weeks ago, we wished him a happy birthday.

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,981
And he's the second — he was the second-oldest city councilor next to former Councilor McGlynn.

21
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:49,024
And, you know, along with being a World War II veteran and being involved with the concentration camps, he was a good soldier and a good family man.

22
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:52,805
And I ask that this meeting be dedicated in his honor today, Mr. President.

23
00:01:53,379 --> 00:02:00,242
On the motion that this meeting be dedicated in Councilor Drenna's honor and memory, all those in favor?

24
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:01,722
All those opposed?

25
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:06,064
Please join us in a moment of silence for Deputy Mayor Drenna.

26
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:19,509
Mr. President.

27
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:20,970
Councilor Marks.

28
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:29,738
While we're in the suspension, Mr. President, we have a number of residents that would like to address the council on Toro Ave, Mr. President, if you would allow that.

29
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,340
Thank you, Counselor.

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,342
Do they need an introduction, Counselor, for the subject matter?

31
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:40,264
Allow the residents, Mr. President.

32
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:46,568
Presidents of Toro Ave, please present themselves before the rail.

33
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,906
Welcome, please state your name and address for the record.

34
00:02:56,588 --> 00:03:00,371
William Hanson, 22 Toro Avenue.

35
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:03,753
Peter Holman, Conchita Baudo, 39 Toro Avenue.

36
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,275
Patricia Hanson, 22 Toro Avenue.

37
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:10,379
Teresa Eisner, 24 Toro Avenue.

38
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,002
He already named me, Conchita Baudo, 39 Toro Avenue.

39
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,503
Tom Kubler, 1012 Toro Avenue.

40
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,841
Sean Birmingham, 28, Toroweth.

41
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:22,525
Thank you.

42
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,941
The purpose you wish to speak to someone, one person may speak at a time.

43
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:31,803
And please present yourself to the microphone.

44
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:39,168
Peter Hoban, and this is a neighbor living at 39 Toro Ave with Conchita Vado.

45
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:50,095
This was all brought about originally from a zoning petition for a variance by Tufts University and the potential buyers of 21 Toro Avenue.

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,322
21 Toro Avenue was a residence that was built in the 1840s.

47
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:05,948
It's a single family historical building and had an original lot of, I'm not sure the exact size, 15,000, 18,000 feet.

48
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:15,154
The variance was brought by potential buyers from Tufts University who were seeking a variance to put two additional houses on Toro Ave.

49
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:20,737
So all the neighbors here who live in the area were up in arms because first, the impact of Toro Ave.

50
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:25,286
to put two additional houses and the parking was horrendous.

51
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:28,115
We also have a situation where on Summer Street,

52
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:41,772
Tufts University owned the old grandfather's house, and if anybody's familiar with what happened with that, after they sold that to contractors, they put two additional residences out there, and the traffic was horrendous.

53
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:48,073
A couple of houses up from that particular house, another historic house was just sold recently.

54
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:51,434
And again, the contractors, they've maxed out the people.

55
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:56,995
Again, not having much experience with dealing with

56
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:21,836
of what we're here for, other than to kind of uniform presentation of the homeowners and residents of Medford, that it would be a tremendous disservice that one, the Tufts University, who, again, picked this house up about 25, 30 years ago, about $26,000, and that we're trying to sell it for a million.

57
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,437
That was about a 3,000, 4,000% profit, and I don't blame

58
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,143
The contract is that we're looking to buy the house and flip it over and make a million dollars.

59
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:33,924
That's the American way, I understand.

60
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:41,807
The upsetness that certainly Conchetta and I, she's lived in the neighborhood for about 40 plus years.

61
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:46,990
There was an original family that lived there, Priscilla, an elderly woman and her brother.

62
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,192
And they took care of the house and they were about fourth or fifth owners of it.

63
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:53,793
It certainly appeared to me, now Tufts,

64
00:05:54,263 --> 00:06:06,092
they weren't going to allow the contractors to tear the house down if they had to keep the original lot size student house and keep that.

65
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:10,716
But it would be up to zoning variance for the property to be developed.

66
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:19,623
Again, my concern and certainly most of the people here is the impact to put two additional houses is horrendous on the impact.

67
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:23,526
Again, the other people can address and have the photographs for safety issues.

68
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:34,938
The one thing that I believe, though, ought to be a major concern for MedFed, and it just burns me, and with all due respect to Tusk, my late wife graduated from Tusk grad school.

69
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:40,474
And my younger sister graduated from undergraduate school, so I have no animus against Tufts University.

70
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:52,918
I absolutely have animus against Tufts making a $3,000, $4,000 profit off of the $26,000 to maximize their sale with the idea to develop it.

71
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:58,020
As opposed to Tufts, ought to do the right thing is kind of a fiduciary say,

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,562
Hey, listen, this house is older than Tufts University.

73
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:06,066
Tufts University is coming up to its 200th anniversary about 1950.

74
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:09,948
Most of us, myself specifically, I don't think I'll be around for that.

75
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,050
But it would be nice to think that Tufts

76
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:23,541
didn't think about maximizing 4,000%, 3,000% profit and maybe held on to the place, put up a sign that, hey, Tufts, look what we did for the benefit of the Medford people.

77
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:30,243
We preserved something that was built in 1840 before our university was and preserved it.

78
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:35,225
I think, again, what this isn't about is some hardship owners

79
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:39,736
who are trying to put an extra room or two for their kids to live in a house.

80
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:48,039
This is about a university that has a fiduciary duty, I think, to the community to allow some preservation of history.

81
00:07:48,979 --> 00:08:02,663
It's one of the only original sites that they've had, and I suggest that the board consider the people's position on it, that it ought not to be just a profit-orientated

82
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:13,975
And I would defer to my other neighbors here, but that's kind of where we're coming from, more of an equitable argument that certainly Tufts owes to the city of Medford.

83
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,177
This body here is representing the city.

84
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:21,880
There's not a whole hell of a lot of places in Medford that can say that they actually look like it was since 1841.

85
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:32,530
And question, does the city of Medford really need two additional apartment buildings and the impact as opposed to like preservation of a historical market?

86
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,131
Was this matter presented by the zoning to the Zoning Board of Appeals?

87
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:38,232
It was, I believe that was.

88
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,572
Have they acted on the matter yet?

89
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:40,492
No, they have not.

90
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:47,954
We're here to talk to the city council and help us, guide us on how to continue with this.

91
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:52,515
At a Medford Historic District Commission in October,

92
00:08:53,856 --> 00:09:02,942
They noted that making a historic original house, a single house historic district, the mayor and the city solicitor were in favor of the designation.

93
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:09,706
Okay, and that's the October minutes from the historic commission, historic district commission.

94
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,808
And they go on to say that some of the members opposed of it.

95
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:23,094
But what we're here to do is we're here to find out how to go about making this property in its entirety.

96
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:25,004
a historic district.

97
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:43,974
We have 87 signatures so far, just from the Toro Avenue area and a few others, all wanting to help us make this, and the other buildings in the city, are the lots of historic value, over 150 years old, into historic districts.

98
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,195
So they've preserved the city.

99
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:53,199
There's also a draft already been prepared by the Historic District Commission, which is here,

100
00:09:54,443 --> 00:10:02,186
Um, back in July, I believe it was July that it was formed.

101
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:04,347
I lost the date on it.

102
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,908
I lose, you know, I'm not used to doing this stuff.

103
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:09,349
Yeah.

104
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:18,332
July, 2015 in the, in these Massachusetts, historic society, historic commission States in here.

105
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:24,273
that it's one of the few pristine properties in the city and that it should be preserved.

106
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:29,935
And if you're not familiar with what the house looks like, we can pass this around.

107
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,917
All right.

108
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:33,357
Thank you.

109
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:40,420
And this is a copy of the $500 survey that the historic district had done on the property.

110
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:43,641
Anything else to add?

111
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:49,397
Why not?

112
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:54,200
I guess the biggest thing, I live right directly across the street from the house.

113
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,921
I have for about 18 years.

114
00:10:56,182 --> 00:11:01,285
I've lived in Medford most of my life, all my life, I should say, up on Ashcroft Road.

115
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:08,389
One of the biggest reasons why I kept this house or moved into this house was because of the grandeur of this house across the street.

116
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,271
And it's not just parking.

117
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:11,211
I own a two-family.

118
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,312
I have four cars.

119
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:14,193
It's a driveway or whatever.

120
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,774
There's a lot more to it.

121
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:17,855
And I think that's the biggest thing.

122
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,621
is this house is a wonderful house.

123
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:28,914
It's sitting there, all the landscaping as you see the pitches, it's a gorgeous house and it should be kept.

124
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:32,591
And just to keep on adding houses onto it.

125
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,712
I mean, I'm very involved in Medford.

126
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,514
My kids go to Medford High.

127
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,236
And it's just part of it.

128
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:42,359
I mean, Medford's a fantastic city.

129
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,960
That's why we chose to stay here.

130
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,243
That's why we chose to stay there was because of this house and how beautiful the street is.

131
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:51,486
And just to keep what it looks like.

132
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:59,721
You know, I mean, just to keep on adding all these houses just doesn't add any value to Medford at all.

133
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,482
Not just our area.

134
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:03,283
You're taking away the historical areas.

135
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:14,029
Hi, my name is Emily McGallony.

136
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,950
I live on South Street, right around the corner from Touro Ave.

137
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,271
I bought a very old house, 1834.

138
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:23,156
Well, the oldest part is the 1700s.

139
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,658
It's on South Street right across from the river.

140
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,660
Bought it 18 years ago.

141
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,003
I grew up in Medford and came back to Medford after living in the suburbs.

142
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,785
As it stands right now, my house can be bought.

143
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:36,447
I have 2 3rds of an acre of land.

144
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,688
There's a beautiful Greek Revival house on it.

145
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:47,295
Without any laws protecting these houses in Medford, especially that area, because that was the shipbuilding area.

146
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,497
The person who built my house was a shipbuilder.

147
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:54,361
The paintings of his ships are in the Essex Maritime Museum.

148
00:12:54,921 --> 00:13:02,906
So as it stands right now, anybody could buy my house, actually tear it down, and build an apartment complex.

149
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:12,631
Because once you own a house, unless it's protected by some kind of historic preservation, an owner has the right to do whatever they want.

150
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,633
So I agree that more should be looked into as to how to save.

151
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:21,997
That particular area, like I said, that was—a lot of those homes were built by the shipbuilders.

152
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,559
And that's all I want to say.

153
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:25,319
Thank you.

154
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,519
Thank you.

155
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,341
My name is Robert Pater.

156
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:33,283
I live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of the Zargas Party.

157
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:46,269
First of all, to answer your question, Councilor De La Ruzo, Council President De La Ruzo, the Board of Appeals received a letter from Tufts University through their developers that they have rejected, and they're not going forward with the purchase of the sale of the piece of property.

158
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:52,925
And I would hope it's because at the board of appeals meeting on the night that it took place, there wasn't one person that was there for it from the neighborhood.

159
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,346
As a matter of fact, they were all against it.

160
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:55,506
That's number one.

161
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:58,247
Number two, I think the city of Medford has a responsibility.

162
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:05,909
If in fact they do believe in keeping its history and a piece of its history, here's a classic opportunity for them to engage in this particular part.

163
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,491
The method historical commission only has $700 a year in its budget.

164
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:13,852
It's a pittance as compared to what the value of properties are here in the city of Medford.

165
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:19,633
And right around the corner, with the demolition delay permit hanging on them, you have another piece of property.

166
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,354
It's called the Cabernet House.

167
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:22,534
It's a French colony house.

168
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:30,198
And that's due any day now to come up as an issue of whether it's going to be destroyed with a present purchase for value being a contractor.

169
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:35,800
You know, when you talk about history here in the city of Medford, it isn't that it's on Toroweb or South Street.

170
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,144
It's who owns the property.

171
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:50,493
At Tufts University, with a billion-dollar endowment, not a million or a hundred million, a billion-dollar endowment, there is no need right now for them to have this piece of property to be sold.

172
00:14:51,033 --> 00:15:03,662
Now, they're getting a little bit tricky with this, because what they're trying to do is sell the property last week on Zillow, advertising it, and then they subsequently changed the language, not to say that it could be subdivided.

173
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:05,683
It's just a single-house piece of property.

174
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:11,089
Now, the single home historical district, that's the terminology that needs to take place.

175
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:15,132
That's what puts the preservation restriction on this piece of property.

176
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:19,696
And Tufts University, if they want to really be the good neighbor, they can come up to the plate.

177
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,318
They have two good bites of the apple of this.

178
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,840
They can lead on this one here if they want.

179
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,125
They can make the application to the Commonwealth of Mass, for which there is a pamphlet that tells you that it's called There is a Difference.

180
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:32,807
It's all from the Mass Historical Society.

181
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,602
establishing historical districts, there's a dish they have out on them.

182
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:42,705
What they could do, they could go forward and make this application in behalf of preserving the piece of property.

183
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:47,707
Or in the alternative, what they could do, they could place a restriction on their deed.

184
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:59,213
So any subsequent for value who purchases that, which would be the next person for value, there would be a deed restriction that would be recorded at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in perpetuity, which means

185
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,871
it could never be subdivided.

186
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,753
The house and the land stays as one.

187
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:07,876
And that's all that the neighbors are looking for, to preserve their neighborhood.

188
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:17,824
Because if that does get itself subdivided and other houses go there, you will have an increase in parking, you will have an increase of traffic in the neighborhood for which they don't need at the present time.

189
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,447
As members of the Medford City Council, I believe you do.

190
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:26,551
If you really believe in history and preserving it and keeping it as a part of what the city of Medford's all about,

191
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:48,422
You do have a responsibility, and I would probably suggest and ask that you fellows and ladies make a pitch to the Medford Historical Commission to support the residents and the abutters and the people of Medford who want to keep this house as an historical piece of property and for the city of Medford to file with the Commonwealth of Mass Historical Commission.

192
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:51,104
If in fact Tufts University won't do it, in either way,

193
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:55,476
to preserve this as a historical landmark here in the city of Medford.

194
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,598
You know, Tufts University, this isn't like new to them.

195
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,181
They just got through doing this on grandfather's house on South Street.

196
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:09,126
And fortunately, on this piece of property, the residents are aware, they're smart enough, and they now realize what's going on.

197
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,528
That didn't happen on South Street, unfortunately.

198
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:12,949
That happened in the summertime.

199
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,832
This one here is a little bit more advanced where the neighborhood was aware of it.

200
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:21,355
And also, if you go to the last meeting and one of the meeting minutes of the historical commission,

201
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:36,495
the meetings of October 29th, 2015, what was presented that time to Tufts University that they would go forward and sell the property with the request of maintaining a historical piece of property, but not to disallow them to subdivide it.

202
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:40,498
And at that point in time, the developer and Tufts was not going to agree with that.

203
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,262
It doesn't cost a lot of money to make this filing of this application.

204
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,444
And what you're doing is you're preserving

205
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,026
something that the city has had.

206
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:55,227
If anybody knows the history of that property, it goes way back, way before 1840.

207
00:17:55,327 --> 00:18:04,331
It goes back to two brothers that owned that piece of property, who were involved not only in shipbuilding, but were also involved in marketing, you know, internationally.

208
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:18,518
And as the lady who just came and spoke before us, there are other houses on South Street that don't have an historical designation, and if they lose it, and somebody comes in and buys it, nobody's going to be able to do anything about it, because that's going to be their right to do it, whoever buys it to subdivide it.

209
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:23,138
Taking all of this into consideration, and you might be asking, why are we here tonight?

210
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:24,979
You're here tonight for one reason.

211
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:38,090
The Historical Commission hopefully will have a meeting, because they've been asked to have an emergency meeting, to put a stop to this and have Tufts University put a stop to this, or become a partner so it doesn't get itself subdivided in any shape, manner, or form.

212
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:42,614
Tufts University could sell that property today for a million dollars for whatever it might be.

213
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,556
The purchase of a value will give Tufts University the money.

214
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:46,777
They'll make their money.

215
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:47,738
It doesn't make any difference.

216
00:18:48,330 --> 00:19:03,274
But to have it with the condition of being subdivided, the question is, I don't believe Tussel's going to get any money back, so why would you want to give an outside developer an opportunity to make that money at the expense of the neighborhood, at the expense of the citizens of Medford, and at the expense of our city's history?

217
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:04,674
It doesn't make any difference.

218
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:12,196
I believe that there are plenty of people out there who would love to buy that house, live in that house knowing it's a piece of Medford, it's a piece of history,

219
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,116
and enjoy the land that's around it.

220
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:19,198
It's a unique opportunity that many homes in this community doesn't even have that opportunity.

221
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:27,323
With that being said, I would hope that somebody would be rational enough to realize that these folks aren't here, you know, on a lock.

222
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:41,370
They're here on a mission, and the mission is to employ you as our elected officials to look into this and be a positive and affirmative backer for their position to keep Medford's history alive and well and not to have it deteriorated into a subdivision

223
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:47,372
to be sold off to a developer, for that developer to make money, and again, we lose another piece of Medford's history.

224
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:47,992
Thank you.

225
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:51,414
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

226
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,095
Thank you, Mr. President.

227
00:19:53,115 --> 00:20:03,501
You know, it wasn't too long ago where, you know, I sat at those other meetings for Grandfather's House, and we watched as tough steam rolled us over on that.

228
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:05,962
That was another house that should have never been let go.

229
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:11,125
And Councilor Penta's right that if it took some time,

230
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:15,010
you can find a buyer who wants to move into that type of house.

231
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:30,117
And if I recall at the meeting that I went to, the builder was saying that he was going to find a buyer who wanted that type of house, and he pretty much reneged on everything he said on that one there.

232
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:33,939
So I think it's up to Tufts to step up to the plate on this and help the city out.

233
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:39,042
Just should be noted, and again, appreciate the time you've been working with us.

234
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,456
Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

235
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:52,738
Thank you, President De La Russo, and thank you for taking the time to come tonight to explain this all to us.

236
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,918
I know a number of emails have been going back and forth.

237
00:20:54,958 --> 00:21:00,139
And as of this morning, somebody did respond from the Medford Historical District Commission.

238
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,601
So has there been anything of the last few hours with regards to if an emergency meeting will be called?

239
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:06,121
No, we have not.

240
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:10,702
The problem with the emergency meeting is it needs to take notice.

241
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:13,594
William Hanson, 22 Toro.

242
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:18,097
He needs two days public notice in order to have an emergency meeting.

243
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,160
He has one of his board members is out of town on vacation.

244
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:27,003
And I don't know how many they need to hold the meeting to begin with.

245
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:28,517
And then there was a time frame.

246
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:39,069
Monday is the final day for bids for the House, the 22nd, that Tufts has put on it to try to get the final bids in.

247
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:46,516
Now, today we're sitting at the House, and there's probably, I would say, since the weekend, there's probably

248
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,561
I don't know, probably 15 families have looked at it, and probably just as many contractors.

249
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:59,363
Measuring the land tonight before we came here, there were people over there measuring the lot to see how they could slice and dice.

250
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:01,544
And that's what we're asking.

251
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:17,208
And with regards, maybe Council Penta could further explain, with regards to time frames, if the historic commission does complete the application, what's the time frame with regards to, you know... The application, the way it was explained to us,

252
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,433
The fastest they probably think it could be completed by would be within six to seven months, if that would be the case.

253
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:33,402
The quickest and the easiest way to do it would be to have Tufts University, they themselves, recognizing the fact that the neighbors don't want the property subdivided, they could just put an addendum or an attachment to the deed.

254
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:40,167
And while this is taking place, if it takes more than six months to sell the property, the attachments on the deed, it's duly recorded, it's a done deal.

255
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:43,510
And at the same time, the city will have its opportunity to not only do that.

256
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,051
You bring up a good question.

257
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:47,045
Because don't let it just be this house.

258
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,148
It's all the houses in this, all the historic pieces of property in this city.

259
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:56,573
And it should be something that should be looked at because I don't think you're going to want to deal with this one at a time, maybe every other month or every third or fourth month.

260
00:22:57,154 --> 00:23:05,341
I think it's time that the city either takes a real hard look at what it has for its history and its properties and its values and put it all together so you don't have to do that.

261
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:08,443
But to answer your question, six, seven months.

262
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:14,208
And then nobody spoke, but I know I, when I spoke to Bill and Pat, a few, maybe,

263
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:19,571
A few weeks ago, there was a major congestion problem on that street.

264
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:29,240
That's one of the biggest issues with regards to if you add three more homes there, you're going to add two more homes there, you're going to add another eight cars, and then you really don't have room for it.

265
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:41,295
Their proposal was to do two more curb cuts because they were going to add two more houses next to that house.

266
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:44,978
And so they want to make two more curb cuts to take away more parking.

267
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:48,000
And with Toro Avenue, we have a special restriction.

268
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,963
You can only park on the odd side every single winter.

269
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:55,746
You're not allowed to do odd, even like most of the city.

270
00:23:56,106 --> 00:24:00,950
And you can only park on that side, and they're taking away more curbs from the side we're supposed to park on.

271
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:10,693
And it's actually part of the Method Scholar, you know, the pathway we have through the, we have all the signs through the city of how to walk.

272
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:15,575
Toro Avenue is part of the pathway that comes right off of Summer Street.

273
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:21,757
It goes right down Toro, right past that historical house for bikers and walkers to enjoy.

274
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:30,820
Just as one councilor, I'd like to make a motion that we request that Tufts University take a hard look at putting this restriction on.

275
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:35,116
to preserve the area, the neighborhood, the street itself.

276
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:38,437
Obviously, we have parking issues.

277
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:49,441
But to preserve that house, which it seems 87 people on a petition, I as one council, and I'm sure my council colleagues agree, we need to do something from our part.

278
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:56,383
And I think making a recommendation not only to Tufts University, but also to the Historic District Commission

279
00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:01,032
to do what they can and hopefully set up an emergency meeting, even if they are missing a member.

280
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:07,197
Obviously, there's a number of people that need to be heard, and something needs to hopefully change.

281
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:13,422
And I agree, it needs to be looked at as a whole, so we don't see this every few months.

282
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:17,846
But right now, we're dealing with this house, and we need to be proactive.

283
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:20,608
Hopefully, the Historic Commission will help us do that.

284
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,791
On the motion of Vice President Longo Kern, Councilor Scarpelli.

285
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:32,512
I just thank you again for coming out tonight and to have the wealth of knowledge that Council Pat brings us is applauded.

286
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:41,237
But again, I think that I concur with my fellow colleague that we need to reach out to Tufts.

287
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:49,822
I think that seems to be the quickest way and to try to find, put a halt to this and maybe ask them for an extension.

288
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:58,330
as they go through their process to give the city it's time to do its due diligence and to this matter.

289
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,812
And then moving forward, I think it's a huge piece.

290
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:06,916
I know that I've talked to a few of the neighbors in the Carbonell house and that same situation.

291
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,177
So thank you.

292
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,879
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

293
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,161
Mr. President, thank you very much.

294
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:18,323
And I too agree that this is certainly a property that,

295
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,669
we should take a look at and we should preserve.

296
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:29,276
Um, I certainly think that a, uh, single district historical home is certainly a, uh, a good approach to protecting the neighborhood.

297
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:36,761
Mr. President, if we think back in council Penta, um, show you, you remember this, um, council paper one four dash six three five.

298
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:44,747
We had some discussion relative to a certain home and you and I worked together to ask the historical district commission to examine all the single family homes.

299
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:48,255
that could potentially be in single home historic districts.

300
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:50,636
And that was back in August of 2014.

301
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:57,459
Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request an update from the Medford Historical District Commission on that request.

302
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,981
Pursuant to the guidelines set forth.

303
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:03,963
That matter was number what?

304
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:05,363
That would be number 14-635.

305
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:05,403
14-635.

306
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,284
And it was passed on August 12, 2014.

307
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:27,768
In reviewing the Secretary of State's guideline on ways to establish local historic districts, one of the things that it notes is that it takes about 18 months for the process to be started and finished.

308
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:33,332
And we obviously have a little bit of a different situation in our hands right now.

309
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:43,599
And I think that it's important for us to work with Tufts University and to partner with Tufts University to ensure that there's a deed of restriction on the property, Mr. President, so that we can maintain the integrity of the neighborhood and the integrity of the home.

310
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:51,940
So with that being said, I'm in full support of Councilor Longo's motion, which turned into a resolution.

311
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,943
And I'd like to amend it by asking that we get an update from the Medford Historical District Commission relative to that agenda item.

312
00:27:58,544 --> 00:27:59,004
Very good.

313
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,666
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

314
00:28:02,886 --> 00:28:03,827
Thank you, Mr. President.

315
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:06,048
I want to thank the neighbors for coming out tonight.

316
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:11,752
You know, we just went through a very important election this past November.

317
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:13,593
And there was a ballot question.

318
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,534
relative to Community Preservation Act.

319
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:24,579
And one of the major points of the Community Preservation Act, which was supported by this community, was historic preservation.

320
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:29,301
So that tells me that people in this community want to preserve our history.

321
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:35,625
They don't want to let buildings like on Bradbury, it was one of the first homes built without the use of a nail.

322
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:41,088
It was peg-built, built with pegs back in the 1700s, and it was taken down.

323
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:43,229
And they put it actually, there was just a

324
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,497
a vacant lot there for many years.

325
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:58,144
Much of this goes on throughout the community, and unless residents gather together and support the preservation and support the integrity of their neighborhoods, I think we don't hear about it.

326
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:03,207
So I agree with Councilor Longo and Councilor Knight and Councilor Scott Pelley on this.

327
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:06,789
We should send a letter immediately to Tufts University.

328
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,952
You know, Tufts University, as we heard, their endowment is a billion dollars.

329
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,184
and to be good neighbors in this community, which they are on most occasions.

330
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:39,423
I think, Mr. President, that they should hold off for at least a year on this until we're able to, as a community, gather our hands around this and see what direction we go, whether it's the historical home district designation or whether or not the historic district commission wants to put some type of restriction on that property.

331
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,786
But clearly, something needs to be done, Mr. President, immediately.

332
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:47,027
And I also — I think we all got an email.

333
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:57,870
I think there's a gentleman in the audience that lives in the area that did a fair amount of work, Mr. Gallback, on the history of this particular piece of property.

334
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,071
And I know they mentioned shipbuilding.

335
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:07,433
We all knew the Mystic was popular for shipbuilding and rum and a lot of host of activities.

336
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:10,178
back some 150, 200 years ago.

337
00:30:10,638 --> 00:30:24,542
But I think it would be interesting to hear from Mr. Gullback regarding the significance of this property and the fact that the city of Meffitt really is missing a golden opportunity, not just on this home, but many other homes, Mr. President.

338
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:29,243
You know, I have people that tell me they live, my house is older.

339
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,283
I say, when was it built?

340
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,124
Oh, 1968 it was built.

341
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:37,225
You know, and people have no concept of, you know, historic

342
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:40,813
the need, Mr. President, for many years.

343
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:47,214
The direction of this city, under the old forefathers, was to rip down the old property and put something up new.

344
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:53,035
Our public library is a perfect scenario, which took place in our public library.

345
00:30:53,075 --> 00:31:03,418
And anything we can do to preserve the history that we have in this community, and at the same time moving forward, but preserve what we have, I think we're obligated, Mr. President.

346
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,178
So if we can hear from Mr. Goldbach,

347
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,982
on the preservation, I'd be interested in hearing.

348
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:10,823
We will in due course, Councillor.

349
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:13,685
If you could just remind us, your amendment was?

350
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:30,717
My amendment was more or less to go on with Councillor Longo and Councillor Knight mentioned about, I believe it was sending a letter to Tufts University asking them to hold off on any movement of this particular property until we can, as a community, get our hands around the situation.

351
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:37,239
So on the motion of Vice President Longo Kern as amended by Councilors Knight and Marks.

352
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,265
Do you have that Mr. Clerk?

353
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:53,239
Mr. President, you know, obviously we want them to slow the sale of the house, but the ultimate goal is to put a restriction on the deed.

354
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:03,350
So if we can't get them to agree to put the restriction on the deed, then the next best step would be to slow the sale down so that we can go through the process of designating this as a single home historic district.

355
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:04,311
Thank you.

356
00:32:04,471 --> 00:32:05,693
So I think the first ask should be.

357
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,775
to deed the restrictions, and then they can go about their business and sell it tomorrow if the deeded restrictions are in place and the neighborhood's going to remain the same.

358
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:21,043
But if, in fact, they're going to push back on the deeded restrictions, then we might want to ask for a little bit more time until we can turn it into what we need to turn it into.

359
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:22,324
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

360
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:23,705
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

361
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:27,829
The gentleman hasn't had a chance to speak, so you've spoken twice already.

362
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:29,831
The gentleman that spoke.

363
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:32,653
You don't have a point of information.

364
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:39,368
Thank you.

365
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:40,990
Two points.

366
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:48,195
The president of Tufts university, Walnut Hill royalty, Ian Barber-Rubel, who's the public, they're well aware of what you're talking about, about the restriction.

367
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:51,938
So the ball is well in their court and they've had this information for well over a month.

368
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,520
Um, and I, I just think that's important to note.

369
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,684
And I, and I think the strength of a roll call vote by the council would be apropos at this point in time.

370
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,326
Sorry, I upset your apple cart, Mr. President.

371
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,570
Please state your name and address for the record.

372
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,171
Thank you, Mr. President and Councilor.

373
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:11,792
My name is Steve Gailbach.

374
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:17,834
Along with my family, I've lived next door to 21 Toro at 11 Toro for the last 10 years, since 2006.

375
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:23,996
I have to admit, I didn't inquire into the history of this property until I attended the hearing at the end of January.

376
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:29,037
I heard quite a bit of fascinating history about it and decided I'm a lawyer.

377
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:32,719
I've done quite a bit of historical research and writing during the course of my career.

378
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,799
I guess it was about time to look into this.

379
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,440
What I found, frankly,

380
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:41,038
is somewhat different from some of the stories I heard that night.

381
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:43,858
There's far more here.

382
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,499
There is stuff that is not in the Medford Histories.

383
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:48,719
I've gone over to the library.

384
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:50,420
I've looked at the histories.

385
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,821
And just to give the quick version of it, which I think would be of very much of interest to Tufts University, okay, if you're going to send a letter to them.

386
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:05,903
Okay, there was a historical study done last year at the behest of the Historic District Commission.

387
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:11,013
And it was only able to trace the title of this house back to 1839.

388
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:21,018
I've been to the Registry of Dates now twice in the last couple weeks, and the records there are pretty disorganized and hard to go back beyond 1839.

389
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,960
But I just tried something on a flyer.

390
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,302
I just wanted to know why it was named for Turo.

391
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:34,848
And I looked in the grantee indexes for the early 1800s under the name Toro.

392
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:36,889
And I could hardly believe what I found.

393
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,954
There are a couple dozen deeds starting in 1808.

394
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:55,665
And basically the Toro family owned this neighborhood from the Mystic River, okay, going toward Tufts to the Middlesex Canal.

395
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:57,607
So I wondered, what's the Middlesex Canal?

396
00:34:58,872 --> 00:34:59,412
Where was it?

397
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,132
I heard about it.

398
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:01,813
I thought it probably followed the river.

399
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:02,613
Makes sense?

400
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:03,553
It didn't.

401
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:17,136
There's an online detailed map prepared just in 2008 for the Massachusetts Historic Commission, and it shows the route of the Middlesex Canal.

402
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:21,417
And is everyone here familiar with Summer Street?

403
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:25,077
So you've got South Street right along and parallel to the river.

404
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,178
As you go toward Tufts, the next parallel street to it,

405
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:36,968
is Summer Street, you go past that you have George, okay, Toro Avenue, as you probably know, is just one block long, goes between Summer and South.

406
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:45,434
What is today Summer Street, beginning in the early 1830s, that was the Middlesex Canal.

407
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:51,919
Summer Street follows exactly the path of the Middlesex Canal.

408
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:58,003
And there was a bridge over that canal at Toro Ave, and another bridge over the canal at Main Street.

409
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,351
So Toro Ave was pretty important.

410
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:12,556
As best I can figure from the deeds, and I missed one day because I went to the courthouse and it was closed for snow about a week ago, but I'm going to go back tomorrow and I'd be glad to submit the detail.

411
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:23,421
I've got my preliminary report here and I think by the end of the week I could give a council, you know, more detail and then you can decide what you'd like to put into a letter to Tufts.

412
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,682
But here's the bottom line.

413
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:32,085
The Toro family has largely been lost to Medford history.

414
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:38,007
You go back to all the histories of Medford and you really find virtually nothing about them.

415
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:48,590
Judah Toro was the most famous Jewish philanthropist in America in the 19th century.

416
00:36:49,352 --> 00:36:49,652
Okay?

417
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:52,113
There are books about him in the Library of Congress.

418
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:54,294
I've gotten scans of three of them.

419
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:55,315
Okay?

420
00:36:55,615 --> 00:37:07,240
When he died in 1854, his will was so generous that it was published, not just around America, but in foreign countries as an inspiration to people.

421
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,020
Okay?

422
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:15,363
Now, nobody has really suspected that Judah Toro had a connection to Medford, because he lived in New Orleans.

423
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:20,715
Funny thing, he grew up in Boston with his brother and sister.

424
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:27,679
He ended up going down to New Orleans, handled that part of the family shipping and merchandise business.

425
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,124
His brother Abraham handled the main part from Boston, but he built a second house in Medford.

426
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:42,109
He paid $1,100 in 1808 to buy a major part of our neighborhood.

427
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,690
That was a lot of money back then.

428
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:54,971
He had a house, which should be a historic landmark, but it was torn down in the early 1900s to build a series of apartment houses.

429
00:37:56,231 --> 00:38:03,157
That's what the Medford historical record volumes say from 100 years ago.

430
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:07,800
Those are probably the triple-deckers that are on Toro Avenue right along South.

431
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,841
You have a set of four of them.

432
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:14,365
But there's more, obviously, we need to nail down, but the point is that

433
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:27,659
Abraham Toro died an untimely death in 1822 when he went to the annual military parade in Boston and a cannon shot explosion spooked his horse.

434
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,642
He ended up taking a hard fall, compound fracture of his leg.

435
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:39,686
It turned into gangrene and he declared that he'd rather enter heaven with two legs than one.

436
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:43,928
So he did not let the surgeons at Mass General Hospital amputate.

437
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:53,251
He himself had endowed Mass General Hospital with so much money that according to a history in the Library of Congress, it made the director's head spin.

438
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:58,634
His brother Judah, okay, then became owner.

439
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:01,405
of the land in our neighborhood.

440
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,206
I don't think anybody's ever known that.

441
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:07,749
There's nothing in the history books, but it's there in the Middlesex Registry of Deeds.

442
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:19,297
And surprisingly, although he spent most of his time in New Orleans, he and his sister Rebecca, who lived in New York, they bought more land to fill out their land holdings.

443
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:24,301
During the 10 to 12 years after their brother's death, and then starting around 1836 to 1840,

444
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:29,605
They sold it off, it got subdivided, and it's what you have now.

445
00:39:30,505 --> 00:39:30,926
Okay?

446
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:32,927
Now, the Tufts connection.

447
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:47,299
Judah Turow's will was most famous, and his whole life of philanthropy was famous for being the biggest benefactor of the Unitarian Church in New Orleans.

448
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,481
The pastor of that church was a good friend of his.

449
00:39:50,378 --> 00:40:08,373
being the biggest benefactor, and it was in his will also, of the Jewish synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, which was the first synagogue in the British colonies, and his dad had been the rabbi there right at the start of the Revolutionary War, and also Mass General Hospital.

450
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:12,016
When you think of Tufts,

451
00:40:13,084 --> 00:40:18,968
what was tough started at, as it was the college of the Unitarian Church in Massachusetts, okay?

452
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:41,361
All we're doing here is really asking that what is probably the oldest surviving house on Touro family land, even if it was people after them that built it, plus the land itself, which is the only, you know, nice surviving residential, you know, grassy area other than the public park, which we really appreciate, beautiful park, okay?

453
00:40:43,244 --> 00:41:00,602
that that be somehow memorialized, not only for the architecture, which is impressive and old and historic, and that in itself would be ample reason, but this is to memorialize somebody who, he was one of the most important landowners in Medford.

454
00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:04,205
His brother was one of the most important citizens and a good friend of Governor Brooks.

455
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:08,182
And there's just a great story to be told here.

456
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:18,089
And in terms of the Jewish philanthropy aspect, Tufts is one of the biggest beneficiaries of generous Jewish philanthropy today.

457
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:24,914
So, I mean, if this isn't a story that, you know, strikes somebody at Tufts, but frankly, they never had a chance to hear it.

458
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:27,916
So, I'd be glad to give the material to counsel.

459
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:32,720
If you want to give it to Tufts, I think somebody over there would pay attention.

460
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,521
If you got a billion dollar endowment,

461
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:44,299
What we're talking about is pocket change in terms of impact on the residential value, but it could be huge for their director of fundraising.

462
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,220
Okay, that's all.

463
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:56,389
So on the motion of, did you need to speak one more time, sir?

464
00:41:58,473 --> 00:41:59,775
If I could, go ahead.

465
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:01,677
Sure, Peter, just a postscript on that.

466
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:05,962
Just so you're aware, what has been used by Tufts University is for visiting professors.

467
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,704
So it's not like that will sit there.

468
00:42:07,744 --> 00:42:11,549
I mean, the usage of that house up to about a year ago was visiting professors.

469
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:17,193
So I assume while the interim, something's happening, Tufts could go back and use it for their professorship.

470
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:17,953
It wasn't right now.

471
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:19,674
Although at the time we were there, it was easy.

472
00:42:19,694 --> 00:42:21,894
Some visit, they come in and stay a couple years.

473
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,775
So it certainly could be used by them.

474
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:25,175
Awesome.

475
00:42:25,195 --> 00:42:26,115
Counselor Scott-Powell.

476
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:32,097
Mr. President, if we can, maybe with this wonderful information and the history.

477
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:54,199
Maybe we can amend that to maybe meet with Barbara Rebell maybe soon and maybe instead of a letter, not knowing with the time sensitive constraints, maybe meeting with her and maybe she can help us move this along in a more rapid pace to assure that the residents and the history are told.

478
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,121
So if we can.

479
00:42:56,902 --> 00:43:01,823
So on the motion for approval by Vice President Langel-Kern, as amended, roll call has been requested.

480
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:03,024
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

481
00:43:04,524 --> 00:43:05,344
Councilor Caviello?

482
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:05,665
Yes.

483
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:07,045
Councilor Felco?

484
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:07,145
Yes.

485
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:07,985
Councilor Knight?

486
00:43:08,225 --> 00:43:08,605
Yes.

487
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:10,146
Vice President Langel-Kern?

488
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:10,266
Yes.

489
00:43:10,826 --> 00:43:11,486
Councilor Marks?

490
00:43:11,726 --> 00:43:11,986
Yes.

491
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:13,147
Councilor Scarpelli?

492
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:13,587
Yes.

493
00:43:14,187 --> 00:43:15,087
President DelaRusso?

494
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:15,527
Yes.

495
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,728
Before we call the roll, ma'am, you need to speak.

496
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:29,702
I just wanted to say that one of the things I noticed in the listing for that house, we have some, my household has some dear friends who live on Curtis Street, and we're also very concerned about that house.

497
00:43:29,763 --> 00:43:33,226
They were not happy with, at all, with what happened to Grandfather's house.

498
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:37,589
So they sent us the listing, and they said, you should buy this house.

499
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:40,511
Because of course, we just randomly buy houses, right?

500
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:44,153
But it was something that we actually thought about.

501
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:51,658
And then we read the listing more carefully, and it says that all of the offers have to be in by Monday, this coming Monday.

502
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,680
And we said, oh, there's no way we're going to get it together by then.

503
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:57,582
Now, whoa, that's a lot of feedback.

504
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:04,128
Frankly, we're probably not going to be ready for prime time in time for this house.

505
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:11,772
But it occurs to me that you know who can totally get it together by this coming Monday is people who turn over real estate for a living.

506
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:17,175
They probably have those kinds of packages and money and applications ready to go at a moment's notice.

507
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:20,357
You know who can't probably get it together by Monday is Medford families.

508
00:44:22,418 --> 00:44:24,399
If you were looking anyway, then that's one thing.

509
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:40,449
But if somebody were interested in possibly buying that specific place and was going to love it and make it their home and not turn it over and chop it into pieces and stuff like that, then yeah, that's a pretty quick deadline.

510
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:45,612
And I think one of the things that might be worth talking to them about is,

511
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:52,775
You know, you might get some folks who aren't just developers looking to chop it up if you make a deadline later than this coming Monday.

512
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:54,235
Thank you.

513
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:54,675
Sure.

514
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:59,496
On the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion carries.

515
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:05,978
On the motion of Council and I to revert back to the order of regular order of business, all those in favor?

516
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:06,638
All those opposed?

517
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:10,219
Motion carries, 16-071, offered by Councilor Caviello.

518
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:15,520
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Salem Street businesses parking lot

519
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:17,265
Have some lights installed.

520
00:45:17,545 --> 00:45:18,566
Councilor Carviello.

521
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:19,646
Thank you, Mr. President.

522
00:45:20,647 --> 00:45:32,474
Mr. President, the Salem Street lot that I'm talking about is the one in Method Square, not the one in Haines Square, where all the businesses park now.

523
00:45:33,134 --> 00:45:33,935
It's a dark lot.

524
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,396
There's no lighting in there.

525
00:45:35,876 --> 00:45:37,817
And we just opened up a brand new business next door.

526
00:45:37,837 --> 00:45:39,738
You're going to have customers parking in there.

527
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:44,581
And there is no lighting in that whole lot there.

528
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:45,062
It's dark.

529
00:45:45,963 --> 00:45:55,748
And I say, especially, you know, during this part of the year, five o'clock and all the business people who are now parked there have nothing to, you know, they can fall.

530
00:45:55,828 --> 00:45:57,609
Like I say, and now you have a new business.

531
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,310
Let's get, let's get some lights there.

532
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,110
Very good.

533
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,152
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Vice President Langer-Kern.

534
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:04,872
All those in favor?

535
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:08,114
All those against?

536
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:08,734
Carries.

537
00:46:08,754 --> 00:46:10,035
16-072 offered by Councilor Marks.

538
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:14,117
Be it resolved that the city solicitor be requested

539
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:39,989
to draft a home rule petition for submission to the general court, providing for the election of a seven-person municipal charter commission to be placed on the ballot at the next general election that will occur on November 8, 2016, thus removing the necessity of first securing the signatures of 15% of the voters in the city

540
00:46:41,770 --> 00:47:11,270
who were eligible to vote in the last state election, as is required by General Law, Chapter 43B, Paragraph 3, in that the Municipal Charter Commission, once elected, shall be charged with the duty of recommending revisions and amendments to the present city charter, in that their recommendations include, at a minimum, an amendment to the present city charter, instituting an appointment

541
00:47:12,023 --> 00:47:18,449
an appointed committee whose purposes will be to conduct a periodic review of the City Charter.

542
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:37,006
Further, that the Municipal Charter Commission, once elected, will be required to submit its final report of up to five recommendations for revisions or amendments to our present City Charter on or before June 30th, 2020.

543
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:55,791
2017, and that the recommended revisions or amendments be placed on the ballot for the next municipal election, which will take place in November 7th, 2017.

544
00:47:56,872 --> 00:47:58,894
Chair recognizes Councilor Mox.

545
00:48:00,495 --> 00:48:08,161
Thank you, Mr. President, and I'm honored tonight to offer this long-awaited resolution regarding

546
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:11,088
charter review within our community.

547
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:23,159
This is actually my third attempt to, before this body, to put forward a resolution dealing with charter review over the last five years.

548
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:33,828
And this resolution is focused on a short end time frame put forth to address the need of charter review.

549
00:48:34,588 --> 00:48:36,310
So this is a very focused plan.

550
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:50,620
that this is just the first step, and I hope many steps, to get input from the public and craft a home rule petition that eventually will go to the state legislature for approval.

551
00:48:51,180 --> 00:49:03,244
So, I'd like to give just a little background, if I could, and then I know there are a number of people that would like to speak on this issue, and I look forward to the comments that are made tonight, Mr. President.

552
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:11,563
A city charter is the constitution governing the municipal government that defines the powers the citizens agree to give their city government.

553
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:23,789
The charter defines which officials are elected, their term lengths, duties, powers, and responsibilities, and establishes the lines of authority for city departments.

554
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:31,353
Our current city charter calls for a modified Plan A form of government, which was approved under Chapter 605

555
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:36,800
of the Acts of 1986, some 29 years ago.

556
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:54,670
Once a community has a charter, there is often a provision for the periodic appointment of a charter review committee, whose purpose will be to conduct an examination of the city charter to determine the charter's ongoing utility and accuracy.

557
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,752
In the case of our charter, no such provision currently exists.

558
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:02,834
The intent of my resolution is to serve

559
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:12,458
as a launching pad aimed at citizen-driven decision-making regarding how our city is governed, assuring that the charter is working as intended.

560
00:50:13,618 --> 00:50:22,621
I'm going to ask, Mr. President, after discussion, that this matter be sent to a Committee of the Whole meeting and that we meet within the next week.

561
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:26,301
And the reason why I ask a week, Mr. President, I know we have a lot going on,

562
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:35,755
get this on the ballot for this upcoming November election, and that is the election of a seven-member board.

563
00:50:36,135 --> 00:50:38,116
We're under certain time constraints.

564
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:48,423
And so we have to meet, have a public hearing on this, where we can amend this particular resolution.

565
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:53,165
Anyone familiar with how a home rule petition functions?

566
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:57,448
It typically is originated by the mayor, the executive branch.

567
00:50:57,781 --> 00:51:00,903
And then it comes to the council, which is the legislative branch.

568
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:19,336
I'm actually starting the process off, and I had some dialogue and discussion with Mayor Burke, and many of the items that are in my resolution, we found mutual agreement on to move the process forward.

569
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,983
I think it's been healthy dialogue under the old administration.

570
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:32,867
If you mention charter change, they wanted a hanger from the highest tree in the city.

571
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:37,951
So I'm glad to see there's some movement now.

572
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:41,973
Like I said, this is just the first step in a process.

573
00:51:42,774 --> 00:51:49,338
And I want to thank Solicitor Rumley for his due diligence on checking whether or not

574
00:51:50,073 --> 00:52:00,121
we could use a federal state and federal election to put city names on for a charter review commission, which he was told that we can do so.

575
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:02,362
So we're able to do that this November.

576
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:16,553
And I want to thank all the residents over the past probably four or five years now that have gone out, got signatures, gone out, had public meetings, gone out and promoted

577
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,060
a review of a charter that hasn't been looked at in 29 years.

578
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:30,923
Any business operating under a business plan that hasn't reviewed their business plan in 29 years, it's safe to say they would no longer be in business.

579
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:32,984
And the City of Meffitt is no different.

580
00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:40,047
This charter is an important document in our city that dictates how government should operate.

581
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:44,929
And at the very least, it deserves to be scrutinized

582
00:52:45,683 --> 00:52:49,105
and to allow residents of this community to give input.

583
00:52:49,786 --> 00:52:53,989
And finally, their vote — not elected people voting on this.

584
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:55,590
It's not the council.

585
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:56,330
It's not the school committee.

586
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:56,951
It's not the mayor.

587
00:52:57,311 --> 00:53:05,857
It's the people of this community who will ultimately vote on whatever ballot questions are offered in the November election of 2017.

588
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:12,201
And that's assuming this process works as it's planned, Mr. President.

589
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:15,203
So, at this point, I would like to hear from my colleagues.

590
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:29,787
and any residents in the community, and to get this well-deserved process moving forward to a point that I think we can all be happy with, and eventually charter review, Mr. President.

591
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:32,648
Thank you, Mr. Counselor.

592
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:39,730
Good evening.

593
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,511
Please state your name and address for the record.

594
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:43,111
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

595
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:44,872
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

596
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,401
Thank you for this council for allowing me to speak about charter review.

597
00:53:48,982 --> 00:53:51,443
Thank you to Councilor Marks for presenting this resolution.

598
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:54,784
And thank you for allowing me to speak about charter review.

599
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:59,127
Those two words, charter review, sound about as boring as can be.

600
00:54:00,347 --> 00:54:04,829
But I assure you, it's perhaps the most important issue facing Medford today.

601
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:06,770
Why?

602
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,232
The charter is basically the blueprint of Medford.

603
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:12,473
Well, maybe we'll strike that too.

604
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:14,014
Blueprint also sounds really boring.

605
00:54:14,735 --> 00:54:16,716
Let's think about this in terms of biblical terms.

606
00:54:17,196 --> 00:54:19,817
The charter is the soul of Medford.

607
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:26,499
Maybe this sounds exaggerated, so let me illustrate an example of how the charter has affected our community.

608
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,040
Consider the library.

609
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:35,455
Right now, if you visit the library, you're going to have to walk through a bunch of buckets that are raining water on different parts of the area.

610
00:54:35,895 --> 00:54:36,895
The library is leaking.

611
00:54:37,516 --> 00:54:43,719
A number of months ago, over 200 or so children's books were destroyed as a result of water.

612
00:54:44,379 --> 00:54:49,662
But how does the charter have anything to do with this one example of the leaking library?

613
00:54:52,758 --> 00:55:03,326
For years, the library has been continuously underfunded by the city administration, the victim of numerous budget cuts.

614
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:14,375
Things became so lean in 2012 that Medford needed a special waiver from the state to maintain certification despite not meeting basic funding standards.

615
00:55:15,175 --> 00:55:18,558
For six years, this process continued.

616
00:55:19,462 --> 00:55:30,044
And even though members of the city came to petition city council for help about this issue, and city council continuously voted on improving the situation at the library, nothing was done.

617
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:40,427
The charter, which is the constitution for Medford, as Councilor Marks says, allows the city administration unilateral decisions about funding measures.

618
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:46,090
So, even though all of this issue came up, nothing got done.

619
00:55:46,990 --> 00:56:03,220
The issue became so bad that the state actually threatened to pull certification from the library system in Medford, and thankfully, through one last sort of 11th hour measure, a number of residents raised their voice and the city administration finally decided to act.

620
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:07,283
We have a new mayor now, and that's good news.

621
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:14,167
Many people are excited about the opportunity of addressing many of the crumbling buildings throughout our city.

622
00:56:14,868 --> 00:56:19,290
But nonetheless, even on the campaign trail, Mayor Burke supported this process.

623
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:20,791
Both candidates did.

624
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:26,875
While I was campaigning, we collected over 1,500 signatures, which is where we're at.

625
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:29,937
We're a little over 1,500 signatures for charter review right now.

626
00:56:30,907 --> 00:56:33,850
My group discussed this compromise measure tonight.

627
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:35,211
Overall, we think it's pretty good.

628
00:56:36,032 --> 00:56:42,877
A number of members of the group want to discuss clarifications and maybe some reservations about some ideas here.

629
00:56:43,478 --> 00:56:47,261
But I want to talk about this in more broad strokes.

630
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:49,803
1986, a lot has happened since the days of Hulk Hogan.

631
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:54,347
I don't know if you guys remember, but Halley's Comet visited us in 1986.

632
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:58,390
It's going to be visiting us again in 2076.

633
00:56:59,431 --> 00:57:02,953
I seriously hope that we can get this issue fast-tracked.

634
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:08,538
There is a number of people that are excited to add their voice to this process, and I thank you so much for bringing this issue up to us.

635
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,037
Thank you.

636
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:13,858
Welcome.

637
00:57:13,878 --> 00:57:15,359
Please state your name and address for the record.

638
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,302
Maxim Weinstein, 57 Ashland Street.

639
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:36,516
As Michael said, I think a number of us do have some questions, some reservations about some of the specific language in this, but I think we're also very thankful to Councillor Marks and to Solicitor Rumley and to the Mayor for considering this and working through

640
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:52,947
Some of the potential issues and and details and just starting the ball rolling I think as Michael said this is something that really is important both in the sense of the potential for positive change in the city, but also simply for

641
00:57:54,272 --> 00:57:56,733
reflecting engagement of the community.

642
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:11,837
I think one of the things we've seen in the past year or two, with a new mayor coming in, with some turnover on the council, is that people have started to get re-energized and re-engaged in what's going on in the city.

643
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:27,723
What's really important is for us to embrace that and to make sure that that continues and isn't a flash in the pan that happens once because the mayor of 28 years has stepped down and then disappears again.

644
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:34,966
And one of the ways you do that is by opening up these kinds of discussions like, how is our government structured?

645
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,626
How do we get people more involved?

646
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:40,648
What can we change to make for a better future?

647
00:58:41,388 --> 00:58:44,549
for the city and for the citizens of the city.

648
00:58:45,509 --> 00:58:51,310
So, as I said, I'm really supportive of this effort generally.

649
00:58:51,850 --> 00:59:02,712
I think some of the folks behind me are going to get into some of the specifics of some of the reservations and clarifications they're looking for, but I'm really looking forward to this process moving forward.

650
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:05,793
And again, thanks to Councilor Marks for starting the ball rolling.

651
00:59:11,688 --> 00:59:12,069
Welcome.

652
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:13,811
Please state your name and address for the record.

653
00:59:14,892 --> 00:59:15,393
Thank you.

654
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:18,757
Jay Spaulding, 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford.

655
00:59:19,718 --> 00:59:24,444
And again, I want to thank Councillor Marks for bringing this issue up.

656
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:27,968
This feedback is driving me nuts.

657
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:29,009
How about everybody else?

658
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,400
And I have a migraine.

659
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,421
OK.

660
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:36,942
So we were very excited about this.

661
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:43,964
Chowder Review is something that is near and dear to all of our hearts, and I think is a foundational bedrock of any community.

662
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:52,806
The fact that there hasn't been Chowder Review in Medford since the 80s is telltale.

663
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:57,628
We had some reservations and some clarifications.

664
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:04,250
And as a former teacher, I made a little T-chart for you.

665
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:14,994
So I'm going to read off a few of the reservations that we had as a group to this discussion.

666
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:20,936
The first was that the proposed

667
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:33,227
issue limits the number of changes that could be made under Charter Review to five, I believe.

668
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:48,619
And we were wondering why there's a limit to the number of changes that the Charter Review Commission, as it were, could recommend and the city residents could vote for.

669
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,021
We realized that

670
01:00:53,870 --> 01:01:04,280
overhauling the entire government in an Alice of Wonderland state of mind is not something that would be recommended.

671
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,764
However, limiting it to five is an arbitrary number.

672
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:12,227
We were wondering if that could be discussed.

673
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:15,150
The second thing...

674
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,419
when a blind person writes and can't read their own handwriting.

675
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:28,783
The language requires an appointed person.

676
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:32,225
And what does periodic mean?

677
01:01:33,105 --> 01:01:42,271
So, again, there's language in the resolution regarding appointed members.

678
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:49,016
and also periodic charter review.

679
01:01:50,116 --> 01:02:05,783
We would love to see something in the charter that stated X number of years, every X number of years, the Medford City Charter were to go under review.

680
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:09,244
We're wondering why this resolution says periodic.

681
01:02:09,304 --> 01:02:10,545
I have my guesses, but

682
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,587
That clarification would be fantastic.

683
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,331
What constitutes a change?

684
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:26,698
Again, with the limit of changes under this resolution, what constitutes a change?

685
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:36,707
Can I turn all of City Council into really cute Labrador retrievers?

686
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:41,565
Right?

687
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:42,766
That's a joke.

688
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:43,607
You can laugh.

689
01:02:43,707 --> 01:02:47,349
That wouldn't be a good idea, although retrievers are pretty great.

690
01:02:50,411 --> 01:02:51,452
So what's a change?

691
01:02:51,832 --> 01:02:54,994
And then what is the legal authority of this commission?

692
01:02:55,835 --> 01:03:03,240
So if this resolution were to pass today, if this city council were to agree

693
01:03:05,852 --> 01:03:31,635
It would go before the subcommittee of the whole, which city, you know, any member, according to open meeting laws in the state of, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, any resident, anybody in Medford can attend those, but there's no authority for anyone other than the city council to speak at that subcommittee of the whole regarding what the look, the creation of this

694
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:38,562
would be, so share a point of information.

695
01:03:39,743 --> 01:03:41,145
In my experiences, Ms.

696
01:03:41,365 --> 01:03:46,431
Baldwin, I have never seen any citizen of the Committee of the Whole be precluded from speaking at any point in time.

697
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:51,410
When the time is appropriate, I've never seen them be precluded from speaking, so I just wanted to... Absolutely.

698
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:53,251
Absolutely, sir.

699
01:03:53,271 --> 01:03:53,611
Thank you.

700
01:03:53,631 --> 01:03:57,073
And that's not what I was saying, and I have spoken at the Committee of the Whole.

701
01:03:57,513 --> 01:04:07,779
I'm saying more the authority to make and change and amend decisions is not something that anybody that has been spearheading charter review

702
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,220
would have any authority.

703
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:23,784
So what authority would an elected body of this Charter Review Commission have, so to speak?

704
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:29,986
So, yes, I'm 100% grateful to Councilor Marks.

705
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,087
I'm excited that this would be a working,

706
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:47,570
kind of a working relationship between the mayor, the city council, citizens who are in support of charter review and a long-term charter review plan.

707
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,491
But we do have some reservations and needs for clarification.

708
01:04:50,531 --> 01:04:50,911
Thank you.

709
01:04:51,311 --> 01:04:51,951
Thank you, Jay.

710
01:04:54,272 --> 01:04:54,992
Councilor Mox.

711
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:58,653
If I could, Mr. President, and I thank the speaker.

712
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:04,186
You know, this document is a working document.

713
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:12,633
And the reason why at the outset, when I started speaking, was to say that I'm not looking for approval tonight by any stretch of the imagination.

714
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:19,839
This is the first step presenting a document that, if you got 20 people in a room, there would have been 20 different documents.

715
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,021
So this is the starting point.

716
01:05:23,582 --> 01:05:28,606
The reason why it was discussed about limiting the number of changes was the fact that

717
01:05:29,323 --> 01:05:32,686
There was some concern that it may get confusing.

718
01:05:32,826 --> 01:05:39,431
Just say, because it hasn't been looked at in 29 years, this seven-member elected board comes out and says, you know what?

719
01:05:39,972 --> 01:05:41,653
This hasn't been reviewed in so many years.

720
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:43,514
We have 30 ballot questions.

721
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:53,202
At that point, you know, that'd be great that that research and homework was done in the due diligence, but that may pose a problem, having 30 questions on a ballot.

722
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:57,425
And I think one of the speakers prior to this mentioned that

723
01:05:58,743 --> 01:06:03,265
This is not like an Alice in Wonderland type chase.

724
01:06:03,325 --> 01:06:07,347
This, you know, we're trying to put together some meaningful changes.

725
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:11,288
And I am not opposed to limiting that restriction.

726
01:06:12,149 --> 01:06:20,872
But I just so you know where it came from was that we felt that we wanted to try to control the number of questions that would be on the ballot in 2017.

727
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:27,655
Now, maybe that wasn't a good idea, but it opens up conversation now, which I think is great for the community.

728
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:37,520
And I, as one member, am not opposed to having that limit taken off the home rule petition.

729
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:48,650
You also had a question regarding the appointed person and how, why it's periodic, it's listed.

730
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:50,552
And that, again,

731
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:54,078
rather than saying it should be annually, biannually.

732
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:59,522
I heard tonight someone mentioned to me they thought every 10 years we should look at it.

733
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,623
And I said, well, I think that sounds a little excessive.

734
01:07:02,063 --> 01:07:05,286
But so what I'm saying is everyone has a different opinion.

735
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:15,252
So the fact that we said periodic was just to get the conversation going, knowing that this wasn't the final document that was going to be sent to the state legislature.

736
01:07:15,312 --> 01:07:19,235
So I think that was the reasoning behind that.

737
01:07:19,937 --> 01:07:36,740
what constitutes a change, in my opinion, anything dealing with the current plan A government, which by the way is not a true plan A government, it's a modified plan A government, which has a host of other governmental issues built into it.

738
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:47,822
And anything from staggering terms to having the city auditor report to the council, to ward representation, to

739
01:07:49,238 --> 01:07:50,539
I mean, the list goes on and on.

740
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:59,586
There's a number of things, important issues that, in my opinion, can be changed through this elected body putting this on the ballot.

741
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:04,350
And they have the legal authority of a state statute.

742
01:08:04,911 --> 01:08:06,292
And I think that was your last question.

743
01:08:06,732 --> 01:08:09,535
So once we create this body, it's no different.

744
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:17,902
The only thing that this differs from is currently right now, if you read the state law, it says that communities are allowed to set up

745
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,180
a review commission.

746
01:08:19,781 --> 01:08:20,701
It tells you the number.

747
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,903
I believe it says seven, what we said, seven members.

748
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:28,125
But it also says that they have up to 18 months to act.

749
01:08:29,065 --> 01:08:41,211
And when I looked at it, knowing that the law says you have to get 15% of the elected, 15% of the voters in the community to sign a petition,

750
01:08:41,891 --> 01:08:44,272
The Home Rule petition circumvents that.

751
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:48,373
So I know there's been a group for the last several years going out trying to get signatures.

752
01:08:48,813 --> 01:09:00,275
We're trying to focus on not the task of getting signatures, but the task of promoting this, the task of putting together a document, and taking away the signature aspect.

753
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:07,957
And just say we went through with the regular process through state statute.

754
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:11,458
You're looking at, by the time I would assume, signatures

755
01:09:11,928 --> 01:09:14,349
are received, that this wouldn't be on the ballot until 2017.

756
01:09:14,549 --> 01:09:22,013
Then you're looking at an 18-month review process, which is dictated by state law.

757
01:09:22,373 --> 01:09:29,857
So you're looking at, potentially, if everything works out perfect, 2019 through 2020 to get something on the ballot.

758
01:09:30,638 --> 01:09:32,138
This expedites the process.

759
01:09:32,338 --> 01:09:35,920
We're looking at 2017 after public hearings.

760
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,242
It doesn't expedite it, meaning there's not going to be involvement.

761
01:09:39,562 --> 01:09:41,303
It expedites the signature process.

762
01:09:41,656 --> 01:09:46,860
It expedites the amount of time that this body will have to work on it.

763
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:57,267
We put out six months, and the only reason why we put out six months was it worked within the calendar for the clerk to have these names on the ballot.

764
01:09:57,788 --> 01:09:59,649
So we could say 12 months, but guess what?

765
01:09:59,669 --> 01:10:02,431
Then we're going to have to push it back another year, potentially two years.

766
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:11,398
So the reason why we said six months, we thought that was ample time for this body to get together, have public meetings, gather input, and make recommendations.

767
01:10:12,027 --> 01:10:14,988
So like I said, I'm open for any suggestions.

768
01:10:15,668 --> 01:10:17,429
I'm hoping we have a Committee of the Whole meeting.

769
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:18,950
Anyone's welcome to speak.

770
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:25,092
If we want to have a meeting here before the podium, I just mentioned Committee of the Whole because that's usually what happens.

771
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:27,473
I'm not opposed to doing it right here at the podium.

772
01:10:28,073 --> 01:10:33,055
Maybe next week we could dedicate a portion of the meeting to once again go over charter review.

773
01:10:33,556 --> 01:10:38,157
So by no stretch is this a way of circumventing public input.

774
01:10:38,457 --> 01:10:39,778
This is all public input.

775
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:42,216
This is initiated by the people.

776
01:10:43,316 --> 01:10:51,198
Mark Rumley told me that there's something in the state statute that says no elected officials can actually run for this Charter Review Committee.

777
01:10:51,638 --> 01:10:57,160
So anyone thinking, oh, they're going to rig it with all the elected officials, that can't happen, according to the city solicitor.

778
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,361
So we're hoping this is an open and notorious process, and I appreciate the questions.

779
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:03,442
Thank you, Mr. President.

780
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:08,223
The chair recognizes Councilor Scott Pelley.

781
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:15,603
If I can, I want to also thank my fellow colleague, Mr. President, Council Marks.

782
01:11:15,663 --> 01:11:26,367
I think this is something that, as we went through the process of our campaign, I think this is something that was in everybody's forefront of their goals.

783
01:11:26,668 --> 01:11:38,432
And I did some homework, and what I found what was interesting and might help some of these issues and questions is that this is a process that hasn't been looked at

784
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:51,208
since the 80s, and having amendments of questions limited to whatever it may be is something that could be bothersome.

785
01:11:52,108 --> 01:12:04,537
And when you look at what needs to take place in such a daunting task of charter review that hasn't been looked at in so long, I talked to

786
01:12:06,848 --> 01:12:08,109
City Councilor in Melrose.

787
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:10,709
I met with the Mayor of Somerville.

788
01:12:11,169 --> 01:12:22,493
Something that they've done, and they point to me into a direction that I think would be something we should talk about and maybe investigate and maybe look at this avenue.

789
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:26,514
The Collins Center at UMass Boston for Public Management.

790
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:34,437
I believe we've used that here in Medford to help with some issues with the Housing Authority and other issues, but if you

791
01:12:35,036 --> 01:13:02,535
look at the most recent information that I've gotten back is that looking at a process, a daunting process like this, going out to an organization that have gone to numerous communities and kind of narrowed and brought the community in as a professional organization, communities like such as Somerville, Everett, Amesbury, Melrose,

792
01:13:03,048 --> 01:13:22,979
They've used the Collins Center to come in and work with your community to really get the finite issues out on the table and it left that, the open and transparent process really to the whole community because that's part of their

793
01:13:25,695 --> 01:13:41,768
their workings is going out to the community and doing that type of work that, to be honest with you, committee of seven that are elected as we move forward, giving them the tools that will help the succeed to its fullest.

794
01:13:42,188 --> 01:13:43,650
I think it's something we should look into.

795
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:47,653
Um, and again, I, I appreciate and I applaud my, my colleague.

796
01:13:48,153 --> 01:13:53,858
And, uh, I know that, you know, Mr. Ruggiero who's been working his tail off, um,

797
01:13:54,733 --> 01:13:58,456
you know, to make this, to make this come forth full circle.

798
01:13:59,196 --> 01:14:03,280
I think that, you know, let's not try to reinvent the wheel.

799
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,122
Let's see, let's investigate as we go into this, into a meeting.

800
01:14:06,162 --> 01:14:12,707
And I applaud the committee, the whole meeting and, and look at maybe invite someone from the Collins Center and to talk to us.

801
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:21,914
And, and, and, and even, even if it's not the way to go, but just guide us in that, that, that form that says, this is how we've done it in neighboring communities.

802
01:14:22,415 --> 01:14:27,976
And it's daunting, and we don't want anything missed, being that it hasn't been looked at in 30 years.

803
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:41,520
And like I said, I applaud the constituents that have been working together to find the best possible outcome, and I applaud my fellow councilmen who's worked for years to try to get this on the ballot.

804
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:51,242
And I think looking at all the details and making sure that we do this right, and we open it up in a more transparent

805
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:53,636
process I think would be applauded.

806
01:14:53,736 --> 01:14:54,616
So thank you.

807
01:14:56,097 --> 01:14:56,897
Thank you, Councilor.

808
01:14:56,937 --> 01:14:58,258
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

809
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:00,199
Mr. President, thank you very much.

810
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:07,202
And just for clarification purposes, I know when Councilor Mox was answering some of the questions, he said, we did it this way, we did it that way.

811
01:15:07,982 --> 01:15:09,443
And I just wanted to be clear that

812
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:12,067
Is there a coalition or a group of people that helped put this together?

813
01:15:12,147 --> 01:15:17,969
Or is this something that was more driven through feedback that you've received from the constituency and from the conversations that we've had?

814
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:24,952
Or is this something that, you know, there's multiple working parts and working people that are actually working on a working group of some sort?

815
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:27,553
This was my resolution.

816
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,374
So this was strictly my resolution.

817
01:15:30,074 --> 01:15:37,537
I did have a conversation knowing that a home rule petition needs to be approved by both the executive branch and the legislative branch.

818
01:15:37,998 --> 01:15:42,820
So I did have a conversation with the mayor regarding what some of her concerns would be.

819
01:15:43,561 --> 01:15:50,184
And I think this is a compilation of getting the mayor's office and my resolution together.

820
01:15:50,264 --> 01:15:58,368
So when we eventually put this all together that we don't have to worry that the executive branch is not on board.

821
01:15:58,968 --> 01:16:02,290
And I think that goes a long way in moving this forward.

822
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:06,972
And the city solicitor helped me draft some of the language

823
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:12,852
especially some of the concerns we had regarding how should it be worded and so forth.

824
01:16:13,492 --> 01:16:24,718
Because this is a legal document and my request is actually for this to be sent once we approve it to the city solicitor so he can draft a home rule petition, which is a legal document.

825
01:16:25,399 --> 01:16:30,241
And that home rule petition, once it's signed by the mayor, will then come back to the council.

826
01:16:30,662 --> 01:16:32,483
So like I said, this is only the first step.

827
01:16:33,183 --> 01:16:37,005
It still has to get approved by this body, go to the mayor,

828
01:16:37,405 --> 01:16:39,646
And then the mayor has to approve it, then come back to the council.

829
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:42,828
And then come out in the same form it went in as and be approved by the council.

830
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:43,428
Right, right.

831
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:50,311
And then hopefully the state legislature will feel that this has to be acted upon quickly also.

832
01:16:50,331 --> 01:16:51,532
Thank you, council.

833
01:16:52,973 --> 01:16:53,493
Councilor Knight.

834
01:16:54,133 --> 01:16:54,434
That was it.

835
01:16:55,594 --> 01:16:57,015
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

836
01:16:57,175 --> 01:16:58,115
Thank you, Mr. President.

837
01:16:58,496 --> 01:17:06,980
I really like Councilor Scott Pelley's suggestion of bringing in the call on Senate, where this hasn't been done in so many years, and this group is

838
01:17:07,983 --> 01:17:20,647
has been doing it for other cities that may help us get a better handle on what actually needs to be done and more realistic goals than maybe what we know.

839
01:17:21,087 --> 01:17:25,708
And they may offer some better suggestions going forward than maybe we were even looking for in the beginning.

840
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,250
Thank you, Councillor.

841
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:33,760
Welcome.

842
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,681
Please state your name and address for the record.

843
01:17:36,121 --> 01:17:38,481
Will Walker, 9 Piedmont Road, Medford.

844
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:45,303
First, I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this resolution forward.

845
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:51,385
The charter review process that has been underway, I think, has picked up a great deal of steam.

846
01:17:51,745 --> 01:18:00,867
And one of the concerns that those of us who have been working on moving it forward have had is that we would like to be doing this with the cooperation of city government.

847
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:03,389
In particular, the Mayor's Office and the City Council.

848
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:08,673
So we're really grateful to see that that progress is actually happening.

849
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:22,443
And recognizing that having multiple and concurrent processes going forward on this can lead to some conflicts and misunderstandings that can confuse especially the citizens as they try to make sense of all of this.

850
01:18:25,696 --> 01:18:41,381
I understand that this is going to go to Committee of the Whole if it goes as is, and that that committee would then deliberate on what the actual wording of the thing to be sent to the state legislature would be, and then presumably it would come back to this body to be approved and sent over to the mayor and so forth.

851
01:18:45,122 --> 01:18:47,563
Whatever results from the Committee of the Whole goes to the mayor first.

852
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:49,203
Okay, and then it comes back?

853
01:18:49,223 --> 01:18:53,345
The mayor would have to approve it, then it would come back to us, and then it would be sent to the state legislature.

854
01:18:56,008 --> 01:19:11,955
With that in mind, as a policy scholar and as someone with a graduate degree in city planning and municipal policy in particular, there are a couple of things that I would request that the committee of the whole considers.

855
01:19:12,655 --> 01:19:14,756
One of these has already been discussed, the five change cap.

856
01:19:16,035 --> 01:19:24,059
The problem with a cap like that is that it makes the perhaps idealistic assumption that there are only five things that need to be changed.

857
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:26,360
It's a 30-year-old document.

858
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,303
A lot has changed in 30 years, as other people have commented, and that limitation can actually wind up hamstringing the process.

859
01:19:34,453 --> 01:19:38,794
It was mentioned earlier that there was a concern that there would be five ballot questions.

860
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:46,716
My understanding of how the charter review process goes is once that commission has produced the product of its work, that product is actually a new charter.

861
01:19:47,576 --> 01:19:57,979
And then that charter becomes a single ballot question in a yes or no fashion that the voters either approve that new charter, in which case it replaces the old charter, or they do not approve that new charter and the status quo is retained.

862
01:19:59,323 --> 01:20:12,751
In that being the case, and the city solicitor would know better than I, that being the case, there isn't any real worry necessarily that there would be so many ballot questions that it could blow the ballot or anything like that.

863
01:20:13,552 --> 01:20:22,638
There is, I agree, a concern about getting the job done in six months and getting a thorough job done in six months, but I think that the time limit

864
01:20:23,138 --> 01:20:31,532
The sense of urgency there is less important than getting it done and done well.

865
01:20:31,552 --> 01:20:35,718
I had a list of things that I wanted to talk about.

866
01:20:35,778 --> 01:20:37,100
Many of them have already been addressed.

867
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:43,010
One clarification that has not been addressed is there are multiple paths to charter review.

868
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:47,716
One of them is through the petition process that has been going around and currently, at last count, have 1500 signatures.

869
01:20:48,497 --> 01:20:49,838
It assuredly has more than that now.

870
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,206
That process winds up having, as I understand it, a greater authority

871
01:20:56,947 --> 01:21:09,378
to make changes to the charter than would an appointed body put forward by the city council or the mayor, which would, for obvious reasons of conflict of interest, not be able to, for example, extend city council terms indefinitely into the future, and so on and so forth.

872
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:29,911
home rule petition originates in the City Council and would have to be approved by the Mayor, residents of Medford should have clarified for them whether or not the elected body that would come from this process would be constrained as would an appointed body by the City Council or by the Mayor.

873
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:39,737
In other words, is this merely a novel appointment process and this seven-member body that Councilor Marks proposes here would be

874
01:21:40,237 --> 01:21:44,980
unable to make changes to, for example, term limits or other things that would otherwise be restricted?

875
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:53,045
Or do they have, as an elected body, the full power and freedom that would be afforded to the body that would result from the petition process?

876
01:21:54,906 --> 01:22:04,912
There is a stipulation in here, and I'm not sure how binding the language of the resolution is on the committee of the whole when they consider the document that they produce on that.

877
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:15,894
But there is a language in here that says, at a minimum, we have this change requiring that the city charter be amended to include this periodic review process.

878
01:22:15,914 --> 01:22:23,162
And that review process involves an appointed committee, presumably appointed by the city council or mayor, that would then perform that charter review.

879
01:22:23,302 --> 01:22:27,687
That body would most assuredly be limited in its power, which probably makes sense for the periodic process.

880
01:22:28,071 --> 01:22:50,180
But the question is, because of the language, at minimum, does that minimum mean here that it has to be exactly that, an appointed committee, or if the seven-member committee decides that actually they would rather that that period of review be done by an elected commission separate from city government, would that meet the standard in this language of the minimum, right?

881
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:54,442
Is that considered a greater or lesser effort for the purposes of this resolution?

882
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,137
Last thing, separate ballot questions.

883
01:23:00,157 --> 01:23:01,478
Yeah, that's basically what I have.

884
01:23:02,898 --> 01:23:09,441
I understand that this is a draft-in-living document that Councilor Marks just put forward, and I think it's a very commendable effort.

885
01:23:09,481 --> 01:23:11,902
Certainly, I'm very interested in seeing the final product.

886
01:23:12,482 --> 01:23:18,204
The last word that I have on this is that charter review and the processes around it are very, very technical.

887
01:23:18,865 --> 01:23:27,568
They're very complex, and they are often very confusing to people who don't study issues of constitutional law and policy structures directly.

888
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:34,589
And especially given that the Massachusetts state law has all of these procedures that look like one another but don't wind up with the same outcomes.

889
01:23:35,289 --> 01:23:55,353
To the extent possible that citizens and voters can be informed of what the meaning and significance of this process would be, I think that that would be very useful, especially to those of us who are organizing citizens and gathering signatures to determine whether or not we are satisfied that this process would be sufficient or whether or not we think that we still need something more.

890
01:23:55,793 --> 01:23:56,033
Thank you.

891
01:23:59,365 --> 01:24:00,085
Councilor Max.

892
01:24:01,026 --> 01:24:02,907
Just, uh, I can't answer all the questions.

893
01:24:02,947 --> 01:24:07,090
I think maybe some of them might be best directed to the city solicitor.

894
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:22,719
Uh, but, uh, regarding the, uh, one question, uh, the gentleman had regarding the, uh, sentence that says at a minimum, an amendment to the present city charter instituting an appointed committee whose purpose will be to conduct periodic review of the city charter.

895
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:28,243
Um, I think, uh, we felt that, um,

896
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:40,082
no matter what happens with the results and the recommendations that will appear on the ballot, that that one provision automatically is going to be a ballot question.

897
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:52,070
That, I think everyone I've spoken to feels that the one omission when this charter was changed back some years ago from E to A government was the lack of a provision that said this shall be reviewed.

898
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:57,856
And I think at the very, and that's why we worded it that way, can it be changed a little bit?

899
01:24:57,956 --> 01:25:03,960
Probably, but we wanted to make sure at a minimum that was going to be part of whatever questions appear on the ballot.

900
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,382
And then you mentioned about the elected body.

901
01:25:07,682 --> 01:25:12,125
This is a seven member body that's elected by the people.

902
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:19,610
So they will have every authority to go in and make any changes to the current city charter.

903
01:25:20,197 --> 01:25:25,599
And that would include ward representation, term limits, anything that exists under the charter.

904
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:30,400
So there's no restrictions within this elected body.

905
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:36,482
So I don't want anyone to think that this is an elected body that we're saying they're elected, but guess what?

906
01:25:36,522 --> 01:25:37,142
They're really not.

907
01:25:37,582 --> 01:25:38,082
They're really not.

908
01:25:38,102 --> 01:25:39,403
They're just people we're putting in there.

909
01:25:39,783 --> 01:25:43,184
These are elected people that run for this particular seat.

910
01:25:43,517 --> 01:25:53,104
and they'll have all the duly regulated authority to make it move forward charter review questions in the following year.

911
01:25:53,604 --> 01:25:56,666
So whatever recommendations they have, they're not going to be reviewed again.

912
01:25:56,967 --> 01:25:58,047
There's no review body.

913
01:25:58,268 --> 01:26:01,490
There's no one saying, wow, we don't like that, or we don't like that, or guess what?

914
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:02,991
The council really doesn't like that.

915
01:26:03,351 --> 01:26:07,174
They appear on the ballot automatically for a decision by the people.

916
01:26:07,854 --> 01:26:12,336
And it's my understanding, I know the gentleman mentioned that it could be done.

917
01:26:12,456 --> 01:26:18,018
One way is to have just a revision of the charter, and now you have a new charter.

918
01:26:18,138 --> 01:26:27,582
So if this was plan A, now we have this plan A. But I'm also under the impression we can offer particular ballot questions, revising the current plan A form of government.

919
01:26:28,103 --> 01:26:30,764
And that's the impression I got from the city solicitor.

920
01:26:31,164 --> 01:26:35,826
So that was part of the reasoning why, after so many years, that we didn't want

921
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:42,492
leave it open-ended, but because we thought there'd be a slew of ballot questions, and that may get confusing.

922
01:26:43,172 --> 01:26:52,535
So in my opinion, but like I said from the beginning, I'm not opposed to removing that language regarding the restrictions on the number of amendments that could be offered.

923
01:26:53,036 --> 01:26:53,876
Thank you, Counselor.

924
01:26:54,596 --> 01:26:55,316
Ma'am, welcome.

925
01:26:55,336 --> 01:26:56,837
Please state your name and address for the record.

926
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,834
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 21 Park Street.

927
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:06,681
I have met with the charter group and I was glad to see that possibly we can stop collecting signatures.

928
01:27:07,882 --> 01:27:14,328
But I think if you decide to have a meeting on this to change this, I would encourage you to televise this.

929
01:27:14,889 --> 01:27:17,311
I know the community of whole meetings are not televised.

930
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:24,213
This is probably one of the largest issues that's being discussed in the city because this will shape our entire city.

931
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:28,534
This charter hasn't been looked at since I was in elementary school.

932
01:27:28,794 --> 01:27:31,555
I'm not a young person anymore.

933
01:27:32,035 --> 01:27:36,116
So I would not want to see any restrictions on this charter.

934
01:27:36,216 --> 01:27:41,737
I would love to see the group elected every time to look at the charter, never appointed.

935
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,038
I would also like them to be able to

936
01:27:45,364 --> 01:27:52,153
look at everything because personally, I hope that these seven people will not be in agreement on what they want to see in this charter.

937
01:27:52,613 --> 01:27:57,780
So if I have my list of five or as a person elected, not saying that, but.

938
01:27:58,797 --> 01:28:04,421
I would want to say, well, I don't know if I want to let that person's resolution go through, because that's one less that I can get.

939
01:28:04,522 --> 01:28:07,023
So I'm going to fight them tooth and nail.

940
01:28:07,104 --> 01:28:08,465
And maybe we're not going to get anywhere.

941
01:28:08,545 --> 01:28:09,766
Maybe we're just going to go back and forth.

942
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:13,949
Maybe the things that are going to come out of it are going to be so small that they're not going to make a difference.

943
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:15,970
Maybe the things aren't going to go together.

944
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:19,073
And they're just one will pass and one won't pass.

945
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,454
And it won't change anything for the better.

946
01:28:21,855 --> 01:28:23,856
Maybe things don't need to be changed that much.

947
01:28:25,177 --> 01:28:35,024
I just don't think we should handcuff this group in any way, because we want this charter to be really looked at, because we want our city to be as great as it can be.

948
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:38,547
But thank you for putting on this resolution.

949
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:39,587
Thank you.

950
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:41,048
Good evening.

951
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:41,509
Welcome.

952
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:43,190
Please state your name and address for the record.

953
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:44,551
Thank you, Mr. President.

954
01:28:44,691 --> 01:28:46,832
I'm Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

955
01:28:48,419 --> 01:28:51,321
Thank you very much, Councilman Marks, for bringing this up.

956
01:28:52,601 --> 01:28:55,003
Always at your best and doing your due diligence.

957
01:28:55,483 --> 01:28:56,163
Love to see it.

958
01:28:56,623 --> 01:29:02,586
As you know, Dr. Starella and I tried to get the signatures for this about four or five years ago.

959
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:09,630
And then another group led by a former mayor candidate, Anthony D'Antonio, tried as well.

960
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:14,212
And now I'm glad to see that there's a third group trying to get this underway.

961
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:15,913
To be clear,

962
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:33,919
recent municipal election, why I think the mayor is on board with this, and I want to thank her too, is she won a very narrow election, and half of the city voted for Barpenta, who made it, I think, a forefront of his campaign.

963
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:37,581
And with all due respect, I think that's why we're talking about it tonight.

964
01:29:38,301 --> 01:29:39,181
I just had to say that.

965
01:29:40,762 --> 01:29:45,585
I'm a little squeamish about this Collins, is that what it's called?

966
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,300
call-in centre coming in.

967
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:55,742
While I think we should definitely entertain any positive suggestions, this is for Medford.

968
01:29:56,162 --> 01:30:08,026
It should be driven by Medford residents, as former Councillor Camuso had once said when this was in discussion before when he was a member of this body, and I wholeheartedly agree with that.

969
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:09,386
Without getting into

970
01:30:10,273 --> 01:30:19,701
any kind of quirky jokes or real bad municipal law technicalities, just a plain spoken guy.

971
01:30:19,821 --> 01:30:22,123
So I'm going to speak as plain as I can.

972
01:30:22,783 --> 01:30:26,746
This city has all of its power centered in the mayor's office.

973
01:30:27,487 --> 01:30:31,010
The city council's ultimate power basically is to cut the budget.

974
01:30:33,372 --> 01:30:35,673
After 30 years, that has to change.

975
01:30:36,414 --> 01:30:37,575
As a former candidate

976
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:42,220
for City Council, I struggled to run citywide.

977
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,762
Some candidates have the support of special interest groups, some don't.

978
01:30:46,122 --> 01:30:48,684
They're able to raise tens of thousands of dollars.

979
01:30:49,704 --> 01:30:53,586
I spent $94.50 in my campaign in 2013.

980
01:30:55,007 --> 01:31:00,030
I didn't ask for any money because I knew the special interest groups wouldn't support the kind of initiatives.

981
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:05,713
This is it, folks, people watching, people listening tonight, this is the way to get

982
01:31:06,183 --> 01:31:07,064
City government change.

983
01:31:07,104 --> 01:31:08,165
It's been 30 years.

984
01:31:09,326 --> 01:31:14,230
Councillor Marks brought up some real good things that this can provide.

985
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:17,954
I mean, we're a city with a police station that's falling apart.

986
01:31:18,334 --> 01:31:19,915
The force is understaffed.

987
01:31:20,276 --> 01:31:21,797
The school is falling apart.

988
01:31:22,137 --> 01:31:23,879
The streets and roads are falling apart.

989
01:31:26,301 --> 01:31:29,544
One of the speakers spoke tonight about the soul of this city.

990
01:31:31,098 --> 01:31:35,639
being the government, government affects the souls of this city.

991
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:42,461
And people that are watching should start calling in and emailing now your state representatives.

992
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:45,461
This should be on the ballot in November.

993
01:31:45,822 --> 01:31:46,722
No question about it.

994
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:47,802
Long overdue.

995
01:31:48,362 --> 01:31:50,943
Serious changes have to be made in the city of Medford.

996
01:31:51,283 --> 01:31:59,325
We've got people coming in here fighting government to keep a historical house in our community.

997
01:32:01,543 --> 01:32:02,524
It shouldn't be like that.

998
01:32:04,805 --> 01:32:07,567
The bulk of this people want something in Medford.

999
01:32:07,687 --> 01:32:08,307
They should get it.

1000
01:32:08,727 --> 01:32:12,850
They shouldn't have to worry about their kids at school with open doors.

1001
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:16,071
And I know this is coming up in future resolutions tonight.

1002
01:32:17,192 --> 01:32:18,753
But this is the way to do it.

1003
01:32:19,193 --> 01:32:22,015
We take a good, hard look.

1004
01:32:22,778 --> 01:32:24,259
at the condition the city's in.

1005
01:32:24,579 --> 01:32:29,141
We take a good hard look at why it's in that condition and what can be done about it.

1006
01:32:29,662 --> 01:32:33,444
Changing this city charter is paramount after 30 years.

1007
01:32:33,824 --> 01:32:34,724
Thank you, Mr. President.

1008
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:45,290
Mr. Capucci, why are you squeamish about bringing something outside health?

1009
01:32:45,871 --> 01:32:48,253
I'm not, I'm not squeamish about it.

1010
01:32:48,273 --> 01:32:49,774
Maybe that was a poor choice of words.

1011
01:32:50,114 --> 01:32:52,156
Like I said, I definitely would, would welcome.

1012
01:32:52,596 --> 01:33:00,823
Well, I think Mr. Weinstein brought up a point, what a daunting task this is and maybe some help would be welcome.

1013
01:33:01,543 --> 01:33:01,743
Right.

1014
01:33:01,763 --> 01:33:09,149
But at the end of the day, the city gets all its power and all its money from the residents of Medford.

1015
01:33:09,507 --> 01:33:15,331
Whatever this group comes in and suggests, if it's positive and helpful, yeah, I'd be all for it.

1016
01:33:15,711 --> 01:33:20,134
But at the end of the day, it should be decided by vote by the citizens of Medford.

1017
01:33:20,994 --> 01:33:21,315
I agree.

1018
01:33:21,335 --> 01:33:25,577
But I said, maybe a little guidance might be helpful, too, for all of us.

1019
01:33:26,278 --> 01:33:26,458
Right.

1020
01:33:26,538 --> 01:33:30,200
Well, to me, I look at it, it's not rocket science.

1021
01:33:30,601 --> 01:33:31,521
It's not really rocket science.

1022
01:33:31,561 --> 01:33:33,322
There's only one lawyer in this group.

1023
01:33:33,342 --> 01:33:35,344
There's only one lawyer in this group that knows legal.

1024
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,641
With all due respect, it's been 30 years.

1025
01:33:41,202 --> 01:33:43,203
There are serious problems in the city.

1026
01:33:43,423 --> 01:33:44,563
The water pipes, the streets falling apart.

1027
01:33:44,603 --> 01:33:45,664
We're all in agreement on that.

1028
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:47,965
We're all in agreement on that.

1029
01:33:48,626 --> 01:33:51,847
And power centralized into one office.

1030
01:33:52,408 --> 01:33:57,651
I mean, I don't see this call-in center coming in and saying anything different than I'm saying right now.

1031
01:33:59,071 --> 01:34:00,592
I welcome outside help.

1032
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,693
Absolutely.

1033
01:34:02,713 --> 01:34:02,693
100%.

1034
01:34:02,893 --> 01:34:05,495
But at the end of the day, the citizens who

1035
01:34:06,722 --> 01:34:13,264
live here, work here, die here, pay all the taxes of a property tax that goes up every year.

1036
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:18,766
Now a surcharge on that property tax, a meals tax, a sales tax, God knows what else.

1037
01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:25,067
Some businesses on the brink of closing down because of a three-year bridge project.

1038
01:34:25,728 --> 01:34:26,608
Something has to be done.

1039
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:34,190
Just so the discussions I had with the call center, just so you know, they reach out to the community.

1040
01:34:34,931 --> 01:34:37,152
That's part of their whole, right?

1041
01:34:37,212 --> 01:34:39,414
So that's, this is, it's exactly what you're saying.

1042
01:34:39,574 --> 01:34:39,934
You're right.

1043
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:41,635
But this is exactly what they do.

1044
01:34:41,995 --> 01:34:47,819
So maybe as you're going to enter community, the whole meetings, this is something we can entertain and look into.

1045
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:49,180
So I think it'll be helpful.

1046
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:49,660
I agree.

1047
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:53,822
And I'm thankful for your suggestion.

1048
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:54,803
I appreciate it.

1049
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:57,404
But yeah, your, uh, your passion.

1050
01:34:58,785 --> 01:34:59,586
Thank you very much.

1051
01:34:59,706 --> 01:35:01,267
I am very passionate about it, but

1052
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:08,922
I'm just worried about non-Medford residents coming in.

1053
01:35:09,362 --> 01:35:15,264
If they're a great group and they've had positive results in other cities, definitely let's look at that.

1054
01:35:15,604 --> 01:35:19,865
But my main point is at the end of the day, this belongs to Medford.

1055
01:35:22,886 --> 01:35:23,666
Good evening, ma'am.

1056
01:35:23,706 --> 01:35:25,406
Please state your name and address for the record.

1057
01:35:26,247 --> 01:35:28,127
I'm May Markybrook, 16 Glenwood Ave.

1058
01:35:29,417 --> 01:35:32,600
Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing up this subject.

1059
01:35:34,822 --> 01:35:44,650
As we all know, we've been 30 years waiting to have a review of our city charter.

1060
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:47,772
That's about one-third of my lifetime.

1061
01:35:49,754 --> 01:35:53,357
And about half, half of your lifetime of the councilors.

1062
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:55,498
At any rate,

1063
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:07,774
As we have mentioned in this discussion this evening, this subject has come up frequently.

1064
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:20,879
And mainly, the residents who have supported change have wanted to have approached this subject by getting signatures.

1065
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:24,441
And obviously, that is one option.

1066
01:36:25,181 --> 01:36:28,503
But it does seem as though that has not been successful thus far.

1067
01:36:29,505 --> 01:36:33,706
estimate that it would probably require about 9,000 signatures.

1068
01:36:34,767 --> 01:36:46,630
So what I've noticed in the last few months, three, four, five months, there have been some buzzwords going around the city.

1069
01:36:48,731 --> 01:36:52,152
Change, transparency.

1070
01:36:54,133 --> 01:36:56,113
Conversation, I love that one.

1071
01:36:56,834 --> 01:36:59,054
We're seeing that on the news every night now.

1072
01:36:59,574 --> 01:37:03,055
Well, we're going to have a conversation and transition.

1073
01:37:04,675 --> 01:37:20,738
And given the groundswell of interest here that residents have demonstrated, they want to be more actively involved in many things in our city and including the municipal affairs.

1074
01:37:21,759 --> 01:37:23,599
So I believe this is an ideal time

1075
01:37:25,203 --> 01:37:28,685
to have this subject come up for conversation.

1076
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:49,638
The resolution, as I have heard it discussed and proposed this evening, will be placed on the ballot, if this is approved, be placed on the ballot this year in November.

1077
01:37:50,859 --> 01:37:54,901
And it would go that the two

1078
01:37:55,254 --> 01:38:00,197
That would just be to establish a charter commission, nothing more.

1079
01:38:01,117 --> 01:38:04,319
So as you say, Councilor Marks, that's step number one.

1080
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:15,504
Then there would be a participation, obviously, by the residents because it's an elected commission.

1081
01:38:17,805 --> 01:38:20,687
And then this would allow

1082
01:38:22,449 --> 01:38:26,930
any recommendations or proposals to be on the ballot in November of 2017.

1083
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:42,134
Now, the Mass General Laws, Chapter 43, as you had mentioned, Councilor Marks, offers a number of choices in which a city can be governed.

1084
01:38:43,155 --> 01:38:51,857
And out of all the cities and towns in the Commonwealth, there are many, many variations of how cities and towns are administered.

1085
01:38:52,902 --> 01:39:03,827
So I believe this resolution will involve the voters of our community, promote conversation, transparency, and transition.

1086
01:39:04,447 --> 01:39:06,768
So I encourage us to go forward with this.

1087
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:07,708
Thank you very much.

1088
01:39:13,791 --> 01:39:17,993
My name is Judy Beatrice, 49 Wyman Street, lifelong resident of Medford.

1089
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:24,927
I was more than a third of my lifetime have lived through plan E change and that antagonistic event that happened in this one.

1090
01:39:25,827 --> 01:39:28,167
I agree with a lot of what the different groups have said here.

1091
01:39:28,227 --> 01:39:30,388
To me, this is about trust.

1092
01:39:31,588 --> 01:39:37,329
This is about trustworthiness, not only on the part of the citizenry, but also on the part of the council and the mayor.

1093
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:44,511
The fact that at least there has been some discussion here between the legislative body and the executive body is a beginning of trust.

1094
01:39:45,131 --> 01:39:48,312
But in order to trust, we have to also ourselves be trustworthy.

1095
01:39:48,837 --> 01:39:54,162
That means we have to trust ourselves enough to do the right thing for the right reason at the right time.

1096
01:39:54,742 --> 01:40:01,208
And I think we're at that time right now, that we now have an opportunity where we can actually make a difference and trust one another to go forward.

1097
01:40:01,788 --> 01:40:06,192
I brought with me all of the political rhetoric that was in papers and all the flyers that I received.

1098
01:40:06,653 --> 01:40:09,635
I received nothing in any of these that said we shouldn't go forward with this.

1099
01:40:10,196 --> 01:40:14,619
I think we have to start trusting one another and have open conversation and go forward.

1100
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,140
Thank you.

1101
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:24,312
My name is Henry Merowin, 8 Temple Street, Medford.

1102
01:40:26,914 --> 01:40:28,635
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1103
01:40:28,715 --> 01:40:34,700
Again, it's always a pleasure, and I didn't think I was going to live long enough to see this.

1104
01:40:35,801 --> 01:40:46,209
When we, in 1986, when we started this process, going into charter review, changing the form of government, my age started with three.

1105
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:49,712
Now my age started with six and going further.

1106
01:40:51,564 --> 01:40:56,408
The real question before the council is not who's going to be appointed.

1107
01:40:56,889 --> 01:40:58,671
It's not how many people is going to be appointed.

1108
01:40:59,051 --> 01:40:59,892
It's not who's going to.

1109
01:41:00,212 --> 01:41:10,061
The real question that is in front of you here is try to get us a home petition rule, a house rule petition.

1110
01:41:10,241 --> 01:41:11,502
That's what we're trying to accomplish.

1111
01:41:11,522 --> 01:41:15,586
30 years, we couldn't even talk about charter review.

1112
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:20,321
I believe there's about three or four groups who's been working on it.

1113
01:41:20,401 --> 01:41:36,149
I have seen us going into the charter review, except when somebody needed a raise, we wanted to pay our elected official more money, but we never did it, how the city operates, how we function as a body.

1114
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:39,770
Life is full of moment.

1115
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:42,992
Right now, this is a moment.

1116
01:41:43,612 --> 01:41:44,853
This is our moment.

1117
01:41:45,393 --> 01:41:46,514
This is your moment.

1118
01:41:48,571 --> 01:41:49,552
I'm supporting this.

1119
01:41:49,732 --> 01:41:49,932
Why?

1120
01:41:49,972 --> 01:41:52,133
Because that gave us a start, a beginning.

1121
01:41:52,734 --> 01:41:54,815
We can take the rest of the conversation.

1122
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:56,737
We can go into the debate.

1123
01:41:57,097 --> 01:42:04,382
But one thing for sure, we have an executive office right now who ran on that motion.

1124
01:42:05,562 --> 01:42:08,484
The two past candidates ran in that motion.

1125
01:42:09,285 --> 01:42:18,031
Extraordinary people such as you, I will call our elected official, do extraordinary things.

1126
01:42:18,504 --> 01:42:22,088
This is your chance to do something real for the city.

1127
01:42:22,528 --> 01:42:33,200
Just like in 1986, it was historic when we went from E to A, but today, 2016, make it historic to establish a beginning.

1128
01:42:34,268 --> 01:42:35,349
Let us start somewhere.

1129
01:42:35,549 --> 01:42:36,389
Let us do something.

1130
01:42:36,429 --> 01:42:40,372
Don't let me die without seeing a little change in this place.

1131
01:42:40,772 --> 01:42:41,573
Let's change it.

1132
01:42:41,913 --> 01:42:43,574
Don't hold it personally.

1133
01:42:43,954 --> 01:42:45,975
Okay, don't be afraid of the word change.

1134
01:42:46,215 --> 01:42:46,996
We need change.

1135
01:42:47,496 --> 01:42:48,637
We have to have change.

1136
01:42:49,718 --> 01:42:50,298
We get change.

1137
01:42:50,338 --> 01:42:52,659
We get two new city council today.

1138
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,401
That's changes, right?

1139
01:42:54,941 --> 01:42:58,683
We have the past president of the city council who's the mayor today.

1140
01:42:58,823 --> 01:42:59,644
That's changes.

1141
01:43:00,638 --> 01:43:05,660
But us, as citizens, us, as elected officials, you, OK?

1142
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,761
The one I think I voted for almost every single one of you.

1143
01:43:08,781 --> 01:43:09,641
You owe me something.

1144
01:43:09,681 --> 01:43:10,962
You owe the city something.

1145
01:43:14,363 --> 01:43:15,463
Change is going to come.

1146
01:43:15,763 --> 01:43:16,603
And this is what you do.

1147
01:43:16,643 --> 01:43:17,404
You legislate.

1148
01:43:20,205 --> 01:43:24,606
Councils, Scapelli, I can call him one of my sons, OK?

1149
01:43:24,726 --> 01:43:25,567
So are you.

1150
01:43:25,587 --> 01:43:26,347
Don't feel bad yet.

1151
01:43:27,227 --> 01:43:29,528
The point, bringing an outside.

1152
01:43:30,884 --> 01:43:31,204
body.

1153
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:34,246
To do this, it's not going to help us any better.

1154
01:43:35,007 --> 01:43:37,728
It's just going to keep it and push it another 30 years.

1155
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:39,990
I don't have to live 30 years.

1156
01:43:41,891 --> 01:43:44,813
We saw that as an example on TV3.

1157
01:43:45,413 --> 01:43:49,656
We bought outside, not even an outside, she was a judge right here in Medford.

1158
01:43:50,256 --> 01:43:51,097
It took forever.

1159
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:53,638
Until today, we're nowhere with it.

1160
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:00,803
the body a chance, whether I think Councilman Mark said it clear.

1161
01:44:00,883 --> 01:44:02,785
He says, well, I don't want it to pass tonight.

1162
01:44:03,425 --> 01:44:03,966
But guess what?

1163
01:44:04,767 --> 01:44:08,269
I want it to start somewhere positive tonight.

1164
01:44:08,369 --> 01:44:12,673
The longer we wait for it to pass, the harder it's going to be for us to go anywhere with it.

1165
01:44:14,554 --> 01:44:21,400
All we have to do, you have the city council, the mayor, the city solicitor,

1166
01:44:21,857 --> 01:44:23,378
They're on your side, that's that, and work.

1167
01:44:23,738 --> 01:44:25,539
And I think I had a private conversation.

1168
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:27,840
I went to Suffolk University today.

1169
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:33,063
I sat down for three hours reading chapter 43, trying to understand what was in there.

1170
01:44:33,603 --> 01:44:34,124
What do we do?

1171
01:44:34,184 --> 01:44:35,484
It's not that hard, OK?

1172
01:44:36,245 --> 01:44:37,525
So I'll leave it to that.

1173
01:44:37,685 --> 01:44:43,268
Whether we pass it tonight or we put it on the committee on the whole, it's good.

1174
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:46,670
We're going to keep debating on that until we go nowhere with it.

1175
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:48,451
We have to do something on it.

1176
01:44:49,272 --> 01:44:49,832
But I thank you.

1177
01:44:56,043 --> 01:45:00,205
Hi, my name is Mario Martin at 198 Harvard Street.

1178
01:45:01,245 --> 01:45:09,569
So I am really astounded to obviously see that today we're talking about charter review.

1179
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:12,651
Once again, I mean, we've talked about it quite a few times.

1180
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:15,952
But it really feels like today it's going in the right direction.

1181
01:45:18,213 --> 01:45:20,974
30 years ago, before I was born, by the way, I just turned 30.

1182
01:45:21,014 --> 01:45:21,715
Thank you.

1183
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:32,267
So before I was born, this was brought up, this was changed, and it was obviously in an effort to change the way the city was going.

1184
01:45:33,148 --> 01:45:41,356
What it's done is, it's put an extreme amount of stress on one person.

1185
01:45:42,317 --> 01:45:46,080
Who would want so much stress in one position?

1186
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:48,883
The mayor has the city

1187
01:45:50,668 --> 01:45:54,370
at that time on his, and now at this time, on her shoulders.

1188
01:45:54,950 --> 01:46:03,654
And it's, I won't say it's a burden, but it's a really, really tough and weighted weight to bear.

1189
01:46:03,974 --> 01:46:17,921
But today we're talking about it, and it's so much more important because over the past few years, people have been talking about it, gathering signatures,

1190
01:46:19,772 --> 01:46:21,353
and haven't gotten anywhere with it.

1191
01:46:22,954 --> 01:46:26,495
Now we have a group of citizens who have said, you know what?

1192
01:46:28,116 --> 01:46:37,681
I think it's time that we really, really, really seriously take back the true definition of democracy.

1193
01:46:38,001 --> 01:46:39,342
I think we need more democracy.

1194
01:46:40,843 --> 01:46:48,767
And this resolution that is being brought forward today by Mr. Marks, Councilor Marks, excuse me,

1195
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:59,332
is so much more closer to really, truly living the Medford dream, not so much the American dream, but the Medford dream.

1196
01:47:01,593 --> 01:47:12,676
It's crucial that we understand that it's not really going to be 6,000 signatures that a bunch of citizens are going to have to go out there and go start collecting.

1197
01:47:12,776 --> 01:47:18,077
It's more, may need 7,000 signatures because some of those residents aren't registered.

1198
01:47:20,019 --> 01:47:36,307
So this resolution, thus bypassing the petition of signatures, is really going to help instill that true definition of democracy that we really need here.

1199
01:47:36,827 --> 01:47:47,792
And this city council should be applauded for bringing this into the consideration finally, after so much time of disagreements between administrations, simply because

1200
01:47:48,923 --> 01:47:57,131
Without this, we're simply not going to be able to have the city council, the administration in general isn't going to have the tools to be able to govern.

1201
01:47:57,151 --> 01:47:58,953
I mean, what does the city council really have?

1202
01:47:59,313 --> 01:48:00,995
All they really vote on is the budget every year.

1203
01:48:01,295 --> 01:48:01,675
That's it.

1204
01:48:01,936 --> 01:48:02,796
You've got nothing else.

1205
01:48:03,637 --> 01:48:06,200
So let's balance the power out a little bit.

1206
01:48:09,486 --> 01:48:14,271
I think the role of a councilor is far more expansive than just the approval or the rejection of the budget, Mr. President.

1207
01:48:14,291 --> 01:48:17,414
We're responsible for the establishment of all our ordinances here in the community.

1208
01:48:18,134 --> 01:48:21,718
That's a very, very, very large role that we have.

1209
01:48:22,038 --> 01:48:24,941
One of those big roles would be the zoning ordinances, for example, Mr. President.

1210
01:48:24,981 --> 01:48:28,224
We just had a group come up here and discuss the zoning problems in their neighborhood and what's happening.

1211
01:48:28,284 --> 01:48:34,110
So I think to paint the picture as saying the council can't do anything except for pass a budget is not accurate.

1212
01:48:36,995 --> 01:48:40,836
The role of the council is simply to pass the budget.

1213
01:48:40,856 --> 01:48:55,300
Because anything else, unfortunately, that is either presented or talked about or is simply put forward to the city council has to be signed by the mayor.

1214
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:57,281
So with a balance of power.

1215
01:49:00,422 --> 01:49:03,042
I do not believe that that's the case as a matter of fact, Mr. President.

1216
01:49:03,062 --> 01:49:04,143
I do not believe that's the case.

1217
01:49:04,183 --> 01:49:05,143
I believe that's inaccurate.

1218
01:49:06,103 --> 01:49:11,425
you know, if we're going to get up here and talk about the structure of government and how government works, I think it's important that we're informed.

1219
01:49:13,566 --> 01:49:13,866
Thank you.

1220
01:49:14,266 --> 01:49:30,031
Um, regardless of which, uh, I truly, I truly want to, you know, congratulate and praise Mr. Mark, uh, excuse me, council Marks for, uh, for just listening to the, listening to the citizens, taking everything that everyone's campaigned on here and bring and bringing it forward.

1221
01:49:30,852 --> 01:49:34,433
Uh, another thing, Mr. Um, councilor Scarpelli and,

1222
01:49:35,344 --> 01:49:38,747
Councilor Carriello was mentioned about the call-in center.

1223
01:49:40,008 --> 01:49:48,356
I just wanted to say that personally, I disagree with it respectfully.

1224
01:49:49,116 --> 01:49:58,565
And the reason why I respectfully disagree with it, if it matters, is that, simply put, if we have an elected charter commission,

1225
01:49:59,307 --> 01:50:07,249
these members of this charter commission are most likely going to be residents who kind of know what's going on in Medford.

1226
01:50:08,229 --> 01:50:25,093
So these people would have gone through historical changes, know the history, understand what's going on in the community long enough, whereas bringing outside people is a great help and a great suggestion, you know, to kind of like, you know, get the conversation going, I should say.

1227
01:50:25,722 --> 01:50:35,966
And I think at some point they should be implemented, but no one's gonna know this city, no one's gonna know Medford, no one's gonna help Medford better than the citizens.

1228
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:45,410
So respectfully, it's not to undermine anyone or anything, it's just simply saying that I think that the citizens really should say.

1229
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:47,771
But overall, I wanted to say thank you, Mr. Marks.

1230
01:50:49,444 --> 01:51:02,989
And a very special thank you to the city solicitor for both the councilor, Michael Marks, and him working together towards getting this resolution going.

1231
01:51:03,029 --> 01:51:03,629
Thank you very much.

1232
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:07,230
If I can just clarify.

1233
01:51:08,871 --> 01:51:18,214
When we're talking about the Collins Center, people seem to think that what I'm saying, what the Collins Center does, is it eliminates our community.

1234
01:51:18,634 --> 01:51:19,034
It doesn't.

1235
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:20,793
It doesn't.

1236
01:51:21,494 --> 01:51:24,496
This is a daunting task that hasn't been looked at in 30 years.

1237
01:51:25,457 --> 01:51:33,562
This is what they do in a number of communities, over 30 communities that they've done this, that have looked in the mirror and done the same thing.

1238
01:51:33,903 --> 01:51:45,911
And all due respect to the, you know, the microgerios of the world who've worked their tails off to try to get 1,500 signatures, we're going in the right direction.

1239
01:51:47,572 --> 01:51:48,553
To get the word out,

1240
01:51:49,257 --> 01:52:02,680
and look at an organization like the Collins Center that work with public management as their profession in working with our community, that doesn't mean it excludes us or our community.

1241
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:07,081
It vets a lot of different issues and concerns that we just talked about.

1242
01:52:07,941 --> 01:52:12,862
The number of amendments, how do we get started, why it takes so long.

1243
01:52:14,242 --> 01:52:17,523
When you have an organization that's going to come in and aid us

1244
01:52:19,139 --> 01:52:33,988
and supporting that, and putting things into place in an organized fashion, so then we can look at it diplomatically, so we can look at it with an open mind, so we can look at it where professionals have helped us.

1245
01:52:35,629 --> 01:52:37,731
No one here has gone through a charter review.

1246
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:39,252
They have.

1247
01:52:40,152 --> 01:52:44,095
As much as I love Medford, I agree it's going to come back to us.

1248
01:52:45,195 --> 01:52:47,937
It's going to come back what is shared throughout our community.

1249
01:52:49,052 --> 01:52:54,793
This is an important historical, like we've talked about, historical event if it's done right.

1250
01:52:56,154 --> 01:53:04,015
So make it clear that this isn't an organization that I'm saying that we're gonna hand it off to somebody and then forget about it.

1251
01:53:05,156 --> 01:53:11,797
No, I think this is the avenue that's gonna help us drive this initiative, like other communities have done.

1252
01:53:13,138 --> 01:53:14,798
So if there's any confusion out there,

1253
01:53:17,217 --> 01:53:18,398
I want to make sure it's clarified.

1254
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:21,601
This has nothing to do with alienating our citizens.

1255
01:53:22,261 --> 01:53:23,482
This is getting them involved.

1256
01:53:24,363 --> 01:53:30,768
We've already talked about three organizations that have worked their tails off to get this through, and it's gone nowhere.

1257
01:53:34,351 --> 01:53:36,192
Nothing to get to their fault.

1258
01:53:36,513 --> 01:53:37,493
They've worked their butts off.

1259
01:53:38,734 --> 01:53:40,376
But here is something that is historical.

1260
01:53:41,897 --> 01:53:44,079
Why do it halfway?

1261
01:53:45,488 --> 01:53:56,735
Why not invest and investigate with an organization that has done this throughout multiple communities and led those communities to best practices for their citizens?

1262
01:53:58,436 --> 01:54:03,939
That's why we look at an organization like the Collins, it doesn't have to be the Collins Group.

1263
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:10,183
Harvard University, Boston University, they all have organizations that we can tap into.

1264
01:54:11,444 --> 01:54:12,945
And I think, to be honest with you,

1265
01:54:14,477 --> 01:54:17,618
at many different levels, not just charter review.

1266
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:20,578
So thank you, I apologize.

1267
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:26,999
Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

1268
01:54:28,339 --> 01:54:35,481
I just truly want to thank Councilor Marks, your persistence on this matter.

1269
01:54:36,241 --> 01:54:43,362
I know you've been a supporter of this for quite a while and also along with you, Councilor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

1270
01:54:44,382 --> 01:54:53,546
I was happy to see that the majority of the councilors that are here this evening, everybody brought this up in their election when they were running for the office.

1271
01:54:53,586 --> 01:54:56,728
And I think it was a very refreshing thing to see, finally see.

1272
01:55:00,449 --> 01:55:01,430
This is so important.

1273
01:55:01,450 --> 01:55:03,171
And I understand the calling center from there.

1274
01:55:03,231 --> 01:55:06,192
And I know that it's an advisory type of a situation.

1275
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:08,053
I mean, because like you say, we don't know everything.

1276
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:14,811
We don't know the pitfalls of people that have made changes and then have regretted those changes and have to wait five years to get them back on board.

1277
01:55:17,747 --> 01:55:34,037
I only look at this as taking the foot off the citizens' chest by changing the charter, because right now there's a lot of things that need to be looked at to help the citizens get along a little bit better, because right now we're inundated with everything.

1278
01:55:34,197 --> 01:55:35,058
Everything's going up.

1279
01:55:35,098 --> 01:55:35,938
The costs are going up.

1280
01:55:35,958 --> 01:55:36,639
This is going up.

1281
01:55:36,699 --> 01:55:38,680
Schools, infrastructure, everything.

1282
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:42,241
This is only a positive step for us.

1283
01:55:42,841 --> 01:55:48,103
And now that most of you, I'm looking for all your support on this endeavor for the citizens of Medford.

1284
01:55:48,904 --> 01:55:50,924
Talk the talk, now let's walk the walk.

1285
01:55:51,064 --> 01:55:51,805
Thank you very much.

1286
01:55:57,086 --> 01:55:59,387
Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford.

1287
01:55:59,427 --> 01:56:01,308
I want to thank Councilor Marks,

1288
01:56:02,598 --> 01:56:08,621
Certainly, Mr. D'Antonio, who worked very tirelessly for this, and Bob Capucci and Dr. Stirella, great, great people.

1289
01:56:09,081 --> 01:56:10,202
They care about this community.

1290
01:56:11,503 --> 01:56:14,244
How do we effectively change the charter?

1291
01:56:15,945 --> 01:56:17,106
Tomorrow, I'm on the radio.

1292
01:56:17,926 --> 01:56:23,629
People are welcome to call in on bostonfreeradio.com, 1 to 3 p.m.

1293
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:32,354
We can use radio and TV to effectively, effectively bring the information

1294
01:56:32,801 --> 01:56:39,323
to the 58,000 to 60,000 people who live in Medford and the businesses in Medford.

1295
01:56:40,323 --> 01:56:43,204
Now, you want to talk about the length of time, 30 years.

1296
01:56:46,024 --> 01:56:46,924
Unbelievable every week.

1297
01:56:47,945 --> 01:56:48,345
Every week.

1298
01:56:49,025 --> 01:56:49,385
I cannot.

1299
01:56:49,785 --> 01:56:55,146
You pay $30,000 for a counselor and he gets up every single week.

1300
01:56:55,166 --> 01:56:55,747
30 grand people.

1301
01:56:55,767 --> 01:56:57,127
I want you to see that on election day.

1302
01:56:58,807 --> 01:56:59,808
This is the topic, sir.

1303
01:57:00,368 --> 01:57:01,028
This is the topic.

1304
01:57:01,607 --> 01:57:04,528
The time to get things done, 30 years for charter change.

1305
01:57:05,748 --> 01:57:19,093
In early 2003, I met with the Human Rights Commissioner and the city solicitor about the very thing that can help bring about charter change, and that is TV3.

1306
01:57:19,113 --> 01:57:20,313
13 years have gone by.

1307
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:22,414
I have fought so hard.

1308
01:57:23,955 --> 01:57:28,477
I've tried every single angle, but this city just wants to censor.

1309
01:57:28,517 --> 01:57:29,838
We saw the censorship last week.

1310
01:57:30,198 --> 01:57:31,999
We see it week after week at this council.

1311
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:36,041
Chatter change can happen with access television.

1312
01:57:36,241 --> 01:57:40,143
Now, today, I paid my 100 bucks and I'm on the mass media exchange.

1313
01:57:40,163 --> 01:57:40,743
What does that mean?

1314
01:57:40,763 --> 01:57:43,024
It means Councilor Marks can have a town meeting.

1315
01:57:44,185 --> 01:57:46,526
He can get these fine people into a town meeting.

1316
01:57:46,666 --> 01:57:50,828
I can videotape it at one of my six stations, and we can upload it.

1317
01:57:51,995 --> 01:57:53,517
to the mass media exchange.

1318
01:57:53,537 --> 01:58:02,248
That means anyone in the country, most notably people in Massachusetts, can upload this program and we can have it on in all the surrounding cities and towns.

1319
01:58:03,029 --> 01:58:10,379
We can make a point to the new mayor that the promise of access, which she made at the second debate at the high school,

1320
01:58:11,728 --> 01:58:18,010
She noted after Bob Penta said that he wanted to bring access in January, she said, yes, I'm a proponent of access.

1321
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:24,091
Well, your honor, now's your time to be active, not lip service, but active.

1322
01:58:24,371 --> 01:58:32,634
Because I have waited 13 years, which is an awful long time, to bring information to the city, to help the library, to help the Chevalier, and to help charter review.

1323
01:58:34,494 --> 01:58:37,135
So we have Boston Free Radio.

1324
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:40,526
I want to bring a radio station to Medford, even if it's a for-profit.

1325
01:58:40,606 --> 01:58:41,706
I'm working on that right now.

1326
01:58:43,406 --> 01:58:44,687
And our access TV station.

1327
01:58:44,927 --> 01:58:46,567
That is how we have the conversation.

1328
01:58:47,087 --> 01:58:48,788
That is how we have the transparency.

1329
01:58:49,508 --> 01:58:52,069
That is how we move this city forward with television.

1330
01:58:52,609 --> 01:58:56,650
The media center will be where all the conversation starts on anything.

1331
01:58:56,750 --> 01:59:02,211
I don't care if it's a garden club or the Chevalier, but charter change is the most important thing right now.

1332
01:59:02,551 --> 01:59:05,512
And I want to thank you again, Councilor Mox and Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1333
01:59:06,037 --> 01:59:07,698
The two of you have been amazing.

1334
01:59:08,358 --> 01:59:11,559
Keep up the good work, keep up the fight, and don't let them wear you down.

1335
01:59:18,801 --> 01:59:21,682
Andrew Castanetti, Clinton Street, Method Mass.

1336
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:24,583
Do I have 10 minutes of time?

1337
01:59:24,603 --> 01:59:26,804
Is that how it works, the maximum?

1338
01:59:27,664 --> 01:59:31,045
I'll try to drop the vernacular and keep it real brief.

1339
01:59:31,085 --> 01:59:34,266
Maybe I'll take one minute and designate it by nine minutes to some other senator.

1340
01:59:37,309 --> 01:59:38,190
I'll make it very brief.

1341
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:45,033
Um, generally speaking, uh, I'm not for or against this so-called charter review.

1342
01:59:45,714 --> 01:59:49,856
However, I'm sure we should probably review.

1343
01:59:49,876 --> 01:59:52,418
This hasn't been done in three decades.

1344
01:59:53,318 --> 01:59:58,841
Um, check out the city's chapter and see if we need to improve it.

1345
01:59:59,682 --> 02:00:05,165
Um, I mean, after all businesses, corporations, I'm sure they changed their business plans from time to time.

1346
02:00:07,781 --> 02:00:16,304
So I would think a city that has a lot of public taxpayers, they would want to have better with themselves.

1347
02:00:18,184 --> 02:00:24,446
Um, if I could throw in an audit, I'd throw it in an audit or two while I'm at it, but I'm not going to bring that up anymore.

1348
02:00:26,107 --> 02:00:37,470
Um, let's see, maybe one, we could have, we want, okay.

1349
02:00:38,254 --> 02:00:48,256
On the charter review, some minor changes that might come about, or some may consider them quite major, actually.

1350
02:00:49,437 --> 02:00:55,758
And I can think of three, top of my head, and some of them have been discussed earlier, and I'm sure many times in the previous days.

1351
02:00:56,598 --> 02:01:04,840
Number one may want to change, let's see, P-A, so that would be,

1352
02:01:09,197 --> 02:01:10,178
and I can't read my writing.

1353
02:01:11,178 --> 02:01:15,221
And the second one could be term limits to get your attention back.

1354
02:01:16,282 --> 02:01:19,784
And the third one could be what representation, I believe.

1355
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,905
Yes, thank you, Councilor Marks.

1356
02:01:22,706 --> 02:01:31,091
And the first one I should read my writing because we may want to change the P-A-P-E.

1357
02:01:31,932 --> 02:01:32,332
What is it?

1358
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:34,914
Thank you.

1359
02:01:34,994 --> 02:01:37,376
Plan A, Plan E, vice versa.

1360
02:01:42,814 --> 02:01:50,956
The way that I read this resolution before me is that it would be amendments to our present city charter, so that I believe would restrict us to amendments just surrounding plan A of government.

1361
02:01:51,296 --> 02:01:54,796
I'm not the author of the resolution, and again, it's a work in progress.

1362
02:01:54,936 --> 02:01:55,757
That's the way that I read it.

1363
02:01:56,617 --> 02:01:57,477
Right, exactly.

1364
02:01:57,517 --> 02:01:58,517
It is a work in progress.

1365
02:01:59,157 --> 02:02:02,098
And I wrote a hormonal petition for some reason.

1366
02:02:02,997 --> 02:02:09,719
Oh yes, thank you Councilor Marks for bringing up the home rule petition to try to go that route if we get a favorable vote on this.

1367
02:02:10,259 --> 02:02:14,221
And I believe we should in the manner of fair government.

1368
02:02:15,801 --> 02:02:24,304
It would be huge because otherwise you need, I believe 20% of the registered voters, which is approximately 4,500, Mr. Finn, I believe.

1369
02:02:24,324 --> 02:02:24,684
Thank you.

1370
02:02:24,824 --> 02:02:25,424
And we only have 1,500.

1371
02:02:31,148 --> 02:02:35,590
So it's such a huge process, as Councilor Marks has alluded to many times.

1372
02:02:36,570 --> 02:02:58,878
And by the way, I don't know if anyone's remembering this, instead of me getting my owner-occupied real estate tax exemption for the last five years, never got it once, like they do in Somerville, Everett, Malden, but the CPA went on, and we got a 1.5% tax on top of our real estate, minus the exclusion, but the point is, they only needed $1,000

1373
02:03:00,375 --> 02:03:02,296
Approximately 500 signatures.

1374
02:03:03,837 --> 02:03:04,917
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

1375
02:03:05,017 --> 02:03:13,642
They put that on the ballot, but my friend Sergeant Barry Clemente never told me about when he told me to go vote that was on the back of the ballot to flip it over either.

1376
02:03:14,502 --> 02:03:16,723
So, I mean, let's call a diamond a diamond here.

1377
02:03:16,783 --> 02:03:17,924
Something is amiss.

1378
02:03:20,745 --> 02:03:21,545
I like your rules.

1379
02:03:22,206 --> 02:03:23,526
I hope Bernie does a better job.

1380
02:03:25,847 --> 02:03:28,809
We need to stop the corruption from the

1381
02:03:29,302 --> 02:03:31,183
Head down, as the singers would say.

1382
02:03:31,704 --> 02:03:33,305
Of course, there's no such thing as a mafia.

1383
02:03:34,045 --> 02:03:39,990
From the head down, we have to stop the corruption to the state, to the local level.

1384
02:03:40,110 --> 02:03:40,710
Stop it all.

1385
02:03:45,654 --> 02:03:46,494
My name is Robert Penter.

1386
02:03:46,514 --> 02:03:48,976
I live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of this board.

1387
02:03:49,896 --> 02:03:52,358
Quick correction.

1388
02:03:52,378 --> 02:03:54,880
I was a member of the Fire Charter Commission.

1389
02:03:55,983 --> 02:04:00,285
And that Charter Commission was a nine-member board at that time, duly authorized by state law.

1390
02:04:00,305 --> 02:04:01,665
So if it's seven now, I don't know.

1391
02:04:02,686 --> 02:04:03,766
That might have to be checked into.

1392
02:04:04,186 --> 02:04:08,968
But one of the things, we had a book that was submitted at that time regarding the Charter Commission.

1393
02:04:10,348 --> 02:04:13,389
And it had to be submitted with the majority and a minority report.

1394
02:04:13,409 --> 02:04:17,191
It had to be resubmitted to the Memphis City Council then at that time, and they had to vote it up or down.

1395
02:04:17,871 --> 02:04:20,092
And at that time, and I know the issues were five,

1396
02:04:20,742 --> 02:04:25,183
But there were eight things on the ballot question that was incorporated in the ballot summary.

1397
02:04:25,723 --> 02:04:31,145
And in that ballot summary in the book, it not only included the majority report, it included the minority report.

1398
02:04:31,645 --> 02:04:38,046
But I want to read one thing that's very important that should be an exact distinction that everybody knows what this charter commission can do.

1399
02:04:38,447 --> 02:04:43,868
We held at that point in time, 25 committee meetings and six public hearings.

1400
02:04:44,608 --> 02:04:46,309
And it was all relegated around the following.

1401
02:04:47,169 --> 02:04:47,489
It says,

1402
02:04:51,218 --> 02:04:55,842
The one line over here, notice of such public hearings shall be by public, oh wait a minute, not publication.

1403
02:04:56,563 --> 02:04:57,924
It was over here, I'm sorry.

1404
02:04:58,184 --> 02:05:09,714
The commission believes that although additional time and repetitive debate was the necessary consequences of such action, the commission and the citizens affected by the recommendations required such courtesies.

1405
02:05:10,295 --> 02:05:18,722
At that point in time, we were allotted, and again, by state statute, I don't know if it still allows, a legal representative, which would be an attorney at that point in time.

1406
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:22,732
We engaged someone who was a professional in the area of charter commission.

1407
02:05:23,292 --> 02:05:33,937
I think I agree with the folks who believe, whether it be the call-in center or anyone else like that, their recommendations cannot bode the same as Medford citizens who would come forward.

1408
02:05:33,977 --> 02:05:41,781
The legal person, the legal expertise would take the thoughts and recommendations and put it into the legalese of being in writing.

1409
02:05:43,322 --> 02:05:47,104
One other question I need to ask you, Counselor Marks, and I thank you for bringing this forward.

1410
02:05:47,684 --> 02:05:48,965
You used the word appointed.

1411
02:05:49,873 --> 02:05:54,517
And I'm assuming you mean elected in December, I mean in November, if that's the case.

1412
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:01,042
Cause that, that's a huge distinction in terminology.

1413
02:06:01,062 --> 02:06:03,084
There's two, there's two aspects.

1414
02:06:03,864 --> 02:06:10,409
Uh, the elected aspect is the creation in this November election of a seven member board elected.

1415
02:06:11,410 --> 02:06:17,175
Then we're asking for periodic review by an appointed board after this process takes place.

1416
02:06:17,908 --> 02:06:25,911
And that was that section that we referred to that said there should be a minimum, at a very minimum, that that'll be one of the questions saying there'll be periodic review.

1417
02:06:26,231 --> 02:06:28,832
And that's an appointed board, at least the way it stands right now.

1418
02:06:29,292 --> 02:06:32,513
So there's an elected board that's going to put the ballot questions on.

1419
02:06:32,533 --> 02:06:37,315
They're going to be elected this November, and the ballot questions will be on if everything works out next November.

1420
02:06:37,823 --> 02:06:46,490
And then subsequent to that, if everything passes, there will be a provision in there that says there shall be a periodic review.

1421
02:06:47,150 --> 02:06:49,832
Some people have thrown out different ideas, one year, two year, three.

1422
02:06:50,073 --> 02:06:51,434
And these are the things that we'll discuss.

1423
02:06:51,874 --> 02:06:58,359
But it's setting up the framework that says the omission right now that there is no review, we're going to create that.

1424
02:06:58,759 --> 02:07:03,603
The unfortunate part, and there was a couple of meetings that were held at the public library as it relates to the reviews.

1425
02:07:04,044 --> 02:07:07,046
The reviews could only become operative if and when

1426
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:10,902
It's presented as a charter commission update to the public.

1427
02:07:10,922 --> 02:07:17,106
You can have all the reviews you want, but to have it cast in stone three, four or five years, it would be a mandate that would be included.

1428
02:07:17,607 --> 02:07:24,292
That was one of the terminologies that we try to get into the budget, I mean, into the charter back in 1987, prior to the 1987.

1429
02:07:24,612 --> 02:07:29,495
Unfortunately, the majority of the members on the board didn't buy into it for whatever the reasons were back then.

1430
02:07:29,896 --> 02:07:36,901
There were a whole host of things that were discussed that what counselors, you know, having the city auditor come under the control of the council.

1431
02:07:37,234 --> 02:07:39,915
because that was a miscue that wasn't found in the legislation.

1432
02:07:39,935 --> 02:07:48,798
And let me tell you, the law as it's presently written has some grammatical mistakes in it, too, that are just starting to surface now.

1433
02:07:49,319 --> 02:07:52,260
So this is not going to be just like a very easy task.

1434
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:58,582
We went through every single word, every single sentence, the spelling, and the proper pronunciation.

1435
02:07:59,207 --> 02:08:02,008
in grammatical corrections, excuse me.

1436
02:08:02,768 --> 02:08:18,935
This is going to take a long time because it's been 33 years and there's a lot of changes that have taken place from 1977 when this first charter commission started by signatures from the street and finally got itself approved back in 1985 on the election ballot, 1986 it became operative with state statute.

1437
02:08:19,495 --> 02:08:24,899
So I would strongly suggest that the more multiple meetings that you have, the better it's going to be.

1438
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:27,041
And even if somebody wants to repeat themselves.

1439
02:08:27,561 --> 02:08:36,067
And I'll tell you, one of the classic things that took place during our charter meetings were the idea that we could change our minds because of the input that people brought.

1440
02:08:36,147 --> 02:08:38,949
And the input that people brought could sometimes change your mind.

1441
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:45,734
You become so stereotyped through the years because you never had this opportunity to hear somebody else speak or what their ideas might be.

1442
02:08:46,135 --> 02:08:47,656
Yeah, 30 years is a long time.

1443
02:08:47,736 --> 02:08:49,137
Some things maybe do stay the same.

1444
02:08:49,519 --> 02:08:50,740
Maybe some things have changed.

1445
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:56,362
But to go forward with change, you have to be willing to adapt and recognize it.

1446
02:08:56,642 --> 02:08:57,983
Yesterday just doesn't work today.

1447
02:08:58,243 --> 02:09:01,604
Or maybe some of the things of yesterday are just as good as they are today.

1448
02:09:02,225 --> 02:09:08,007
You need to get — if this is really going to be successful, you need to have as many meetings open and notorious to the public.

1449
02:09:08,407 --> 02:09:10,028
We had 25 committee meetings.

1450
02:09:10,448 --> 02:09:11,789
We had six public hearings.

1451
02:09:12,089 --> 02:09:13,409
And you couldn't ask for more than that.

1452
02:09:13,910 --> 02:09:16,011
We had a majority of — there was a nine-member board.

1453
02:09:16,591 --> 02:09:18,031
The final vote was six to three.

1454
02:09:18,392 --> 02:09:19,312
Doesn't make any difference.

1455
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,282
The law allows you to have that.

1456
02:09:22,262 --> 02:09:25,766
The taxpayers of this community got the booklet, majority, minority report.

1457
02:09:25,806 --> 02:09:29,730
They got the question in front with all the addendums, the adding and the subtractions to it.

1458
02:09:30,384 --> 02:09:31,405
That's the game plan.

1459
02:09:31,545 --> 02:09:33,046
It's going to take an awful lot of time.

1460
02:09:33,667 --> 02:09:45,498
So I just would strongly suggest that while you're taking this first step and going forward, you've got to keep an open mind to every single possibility that you would want to do with this plan A form of government.

1461
02:09:45,578 --> 02:09:52,804
And if you're getting a pushback that other people might say, we should review all forms of government, you have to entertain that because that's what a charter review is about.

1462
02:09:53,525 --> 02:09:53,785
Thank you.

1463
02:09:58,537 --> 02:09:59,398
Second, Councilman Marks.

1464
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:00,238
Motion, move approval.

1465
02:10:05,161 --> 02:10:06,942
For the Committee of the Whole.

1466
02:10:11,884 --> 02:10:12,665
Thank you, Mr. President.

1467
02:10:12,685 --> 02:10:15,807
I think there was some valid issues brought up tonight.

1468
02:10:16,587 --> 02:10:19,609
And I know I've mentioned the Committee of the Whole meeting.

1469
02:10:20,029 --> 02:10:23,951
From what I heard tonight, I think residents would like to have this televised.

1470
02:10:25,022 --> 02:10:34,465
at a meeting, and I would request that we have a public hearing, rather than a committee of the whole meeting, at our next regularly scheduled council meeting.

1471
02:10:35,046 --> 02:10:41,968
So people can tune in, see what's going on in the process, whether they want to attend the meeting or just listen to it on TV.

1472
02:10:42,933 --> 02:10:47,714
And that, you know.

1473
02:10:48,254 --> 02:10:54,416
No, we have, during our regular meeting, we have, like we do with other hearings, we have a hearing on charter review.

1474
02:10:54,996 --> 02:10:57,137
And then we can get up and discuss the issues.

1475
02:10:57,497 --> 02:10:58,617
At least it'll be televised.

1476
02:10:59,297 --> 02:11:06,099
And for those that think that they can't speak during the Committee of the Whole meeting, and maybe some people were shut out at certain meetings, I don't know.

1477
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:11,500
And that, I don't want anyone to think that, you know, Committee of the Whole meeting would shut people out.

1478
02:11:11,873 --> 02:11:14,215
And I think the best place to have it would be up here at the podium.

1479
02:11:14,695 --> 02:11:18,939
So I would offer that, Mr. President, as a roll call vote.

1480
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:20,220
Public meeting.

1481
02:11:22,422 --> 02:11:23,943
No.

1482
02:11:24,784 --> 02:11:28,487
Public hearing be held here next Tuesday night.

1483
02:11:29,548 --> 02:11:33,171
So we can keep, well not whenever, so we can keep this ball rolling.

1484
02:11:42,882 --> 02:12:01,401
Amendment to create a public hearing next Tuesday.

1485
02:12:02,182 --> 02:12:05,425
Right, next Tuesday, 7 o'clock here regarding charter review.

1486
02:12:11,037 --> 02:12:11,378
Yes, yes.

1487
02:12:11,438 --> 02:12:13,659
So it's a petition to draft a, a, um,

1488
02:12:37,098 --> 02:12:40,999
Mr. President, to draft this home rule petition.

1489
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:54,504
So this needs to be tabled, Mr. President, and then we need to have a public hearing on the matter, if that's the councilor's intention.

1490
02:12:55,745 --> 02:13:01,107
Or the paper can be sent as it is to committee of the whole.

1491
02:13:03,195 --> 02:13:08,078
Well, Mr. President, whatever it is, I'm asking for a public hearing next week on the paper.

1492
02:13:08,718 --> 02:13:11,640
Uh, this paper clearly it's not ready to go anywhere.

1493
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:18,924
And if that's the way the council chooses to go, that's fine with me.

1494
02:13:20,084 --> 02:13:22,986
And then next week will be used to allow people to come up.

1495
02:13:23,566 --> 02:13:26,308
And, uh, you know, we've all talked about charter review.

1496
02:13:26,908 --> 02:13:28,249
Uh, let's put it on the table.

1497
02:13:28,529 --> 02:13:29,870
Let's go through the action items.

1498
02:13:30,347 --> 02:13:40,294
what's out there, what's outstanding, what we believe needs to be updated, then it gets sent to the city solicitor for a drafting of a home rule petition.

1499
02:13:40,454 --> 02:13:41,274
That's fine.

1500
02:13:52,636 --> 02:13:57,257
An item as imperative, an item as important as our charter shouldn't be something that we're rushing through, Mr. President.

1501
02:13:57,277 --> 02:14:05,480
I think we can take both, we can go both routes, but I think that at the very least, you know, the council represented that he wanted to have a committee of the whole on the matter.

1502
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:07,360
That was something that I could certainly live with.

1503
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:10,401
I want to take a little bit more time to digest this, a little bit more time to look at it.

1504
02:14:10,881 --> 02:14:14,162
It's going to take a long time to become an expert on charters, Mr. President.

1505
02:14:14,705 --> 02:14:18,168
So with that being said, I would be opposed to having a public hearing next week.

1506
02:14:18,308 --> 02:14:21,992
I don't think that that's a problem, having a public hearing on the matter, but I think it should be when we're all ready.

1507
02:14:22,472 --> 02:14:27,597
And I think that we will know when we're all ready when we come out of the Committee of the Whole with some of the questions that we have answered and answered.

1508
02:14:27,637 --> 02:14:32,701
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm not going to withdraw my motion to have the matter referred to the Committee of the Whole.

1509
02:14:33,021 --> 02:14:36,805
I feel as though it's going to be an opportunity for us to educate ourselves and learn a little bit more before we have to

1510
02:14:37,245 --> 02:14:41,188
come up here and actually take a stance on certain issues and certain aspects of issues, Mr. President.

1511
02:14:41,208 --> 02:14:45,331
Like I said, I want to become an expert on it before I come up here and deliberate on it.

1512
02:14:45,351 --> 02:14:55,499
The Vice President By no means am I trying to jam this down.

1513
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:57,661
And I'm not insinuating that you are, Counselor.

1514
02:14:57,681 --> 02:14:59,403
I'm sorry to come across that way if I had.

1515
02:14:59,463 --> 02:15:02,725
Mr. President, this has been a long-going issue for many years.

1516
02:15:02,765 --> 02:15:06,228
Some of us are new to the Council and some that have been around for a number of years.

1517
02:15:06,602 --> 02:15:08,464
know this has been on the table for a number of years.

1518
02:15:09,084 --> 02:15:18,832
I hesitate sending this to Committee of the Whole or subcommittee because honestly, quite frankly, those committees are burial grounds.

1519
02:15:19,833 --> 02:15:26,058
And we can go right now through the list of things that I've been waiting for on Committee of the Whole meetings.

1520
02:15:27,059 --> 02:15:28,860
I've been waiting for subcommittee meetings.

1521
02:15:29,781 --> 02:15:33,624
And quite frankly, I think the best way of doing the people's business

1522
02:15:34,067 --> 02:15:40,609
is to allow the people to view this, the people that can't come up, to allow them to view this at home, and everyone should be prepared.

1523
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:43,610
Go home, do your homework, do your due diligence.

1524
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:47,671
Everyone should be prepared to answer the questions of where they stand.

1525
02:15:48,132 --> 02:15:49,192
That's why we got elected.

1526
02:15:49,693 --> 02:15:52,974
So, you know, I don't think we're jamming this down anyone's throat.

1527
02:15:53,494 --> 02:15:59,276
Everyone mentioned this during election, how great charter review is, and you've had plenty of time to do homework.

1528
02:15:59,917 --> 02:16:03,038
And so I don't think I'm trying to jam this through, Mr. President.

1529
02:16:03,418 --> 02:16:16,422
From what I heard from residents here tonight is they thought it would be best to have it at an open public meeting, which the Committee of the Whole is too, but a televised meeting, which would allow people from home to view good government in progress.

1530
02:16:17,103 --> 02:16:18,283
And, you know,

1531
02:16:19,344 --> 02:16:20,544
I still want to stick with that.

1532
02:16:20,564 --> 02:16:24,527
You know, this is the first step in many steps.

1533
02:16:25,307 --> 02:16:29,630
And, you know, if I hear the word daunting task one more time, you have to start somewhere.

1534
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:31,671
You have to start somewhere.

1535
02:16:32,051 --> 02:16:33,352
This is a start.

1536
02:16:37,475 --> 02:16:39,196
This is not a perfect document.

1537
02:16:39,456 --> 02:16:43,959
But like I said at the beginning, if you put 20 people in a room, you're going to come out with 20 different documents.

1538
02:16:44,359 --> 02:16:45,540
This is a starting point.

1539
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:47,141
I think it's a good starting point.

1540
02:16:47,494 --> 02:16:56,822
And I don't see any reason why a public hearing next week, Mr. President, with all the issues still before us, medical marijuana, want to go to taxicab licenses.

1541
02:16:57,102 --> 02:17:00,245
We can go through the list of things that are outstanding before this council.

1542
02:17:00,485 --> 02:17:03,308
The Community Preservation Act, which was approved in November.

1543
02:17:03,888 --> 02:17:05,390
We haven't had any discussion on that.

1544
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:10,795
So to say we're going to stick it in a subcommittee or a committee of the whole meeting, I'm not buying it.

1545
02:17:10,815 --> 02:17:11,675
I've been around here for a while.

1546
02:17:11,695 --> 02:17:12,316
I'm not buying it.

1547
02:17:12,756 --> 02:17:13,377
I'm not buying it.

1548
02:17:18,429 --> 02:17:21,612
Mr. President, I'm unsure what's before us to vote on.

1549
02:17:22,853 --> 02:17:30,000
If there are three separate items, I'm hearing being entertained, committee of the whole, tabling.

1550
02:17:30,329 --> 02:17:32,350
That was my item and I read, read, read.

1551
02:17:32,550 --> 02:17:35,311
So I don't know whose motions are whose.

1552
02:17:36,191 --> 02:17:37,851
I'd like some clarity, Mr. President.

1553
02:17:38,472 --> 02:17:54,297
And I think in my opinion, the wise move would to be have a discussion in committee of the whole first, have the benefit of the city solicitor's presence for advice on this matter, and then start from there.

1554
02:17:58,432 --> 02:18:03,197
Like I said, I mean, you know, I think that this is a matter that's appropriate for Committee of the Whole.

1555
02:18:03,277 --> 02:18:07,842
If we go into the Committee of the Whole, and like you said, 20 different people go in there with 20 different versions, that's okay.

1556
02:18:08,162 --> 02:18:13,187
The seven legislators in this community will sit down, and we'll come up with maybe our seven different versions.

1557
02:18:13,467 --> 02:18:15,469
Then we'll present those, and then we can hammer out the details.

1558
02:18:15,529 --> 02:18:18,672
We can look at the commonalities and look at the differences, Mr. President.

1559
02:18:18,712 --> 02:18:19,593
But I think that, you know,

1560
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:22,632
in an effort for us to be successful and to do this the right way.

1561
02:18:22,652 --> 02:18:24,334
I think we need to slow the process down a little bit.

1562
02:18:24,374 --> 02:18:30,340
I think we need to have a committee of the whole to further discuss our options, to have the solicitor there to provide us with some advice and consent as well.

1563
02:18:32,122 --> 02:18:40,590
What I'll do, with respect to my council colleague, slow the process down.

1564
02:18:40,650 --> 02:18:41,151
It's been 30 years.

1565
02:18:41,171 --> 02:18:41,671
It's 30 years.

1566
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:50,368
Any slower, I got the floor, any slower we'll be going in reverse.

1567
02:18:50,949 --> 02:18:54,196
So I'm not quite sure how we slow the process down after 30 years.

1568
02:18:58,582 --> 02:19:02,165
The process is slowed because there's no community support to gather the signatures.

1569
02:19:02,705 --> 02:19:04,886
If they got the signatures, the issue would be on the ballot.

1570
02:19:04,907 --> 02:19:05,507
It wouldn't be a problem.

1571
02:19:05,527 --> 02:19:09,190
We wouldn't be having this discussion, but there aren't enough signatures.

1572
02:19:09,690 --> 02:19:11,931
There aren't enough signatures to put the matter on the ballot.

1573
02:19:12,272 --> 02:19:19,657
And I don't feel comfortable bypassing full participation of the residents in the city of Medford to put an item on the ballot for something that's as significant as charter reform.

1574
02:19:19,797 --> 02:19:20,318
Mr. President.

1575
02:19:20,338 --> 02:19:21,459
I just don't feel comfortable doing it.

1576
02:19:21,479 --> 02:19:22,000
Mr. President.

1577
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:23,301
A special end to these auspices.

1578
02:19:23,842 --> 02:19:25,123
A special end to these auspices.

1579
02:19:25,143 --> 02:19:26,044
Mr. President, with all due respect.

1580
02:19:26,084 --> 02:19:30,549
When the council has a closed door meeting and they come up with this, this proposal, which actually.

1581
02:19:30,569 --> 02:19:32,411
I'm glad the council has shown its true colors.

1582
02:19:32,431 --> 02:19:33,072
Which actually.

1583
02:19:33,092 --> 02:19:34,333
You just said he's opposed to it.

1584
02:19:34,554 --> 02:19:35,034
Just come up.

1585
02:19:35,875 --> 02:19:37,436
I'm opposed to this process, absolutely.

1586
02:19:37,456 --> 02:19:39,216
The truth will set you free, counselor.

1587
02:19:39,376 --> 02:19:41,537
I think the paper before the council... If you're against it, you're against it.

1588
02:19:41,577 --> 02:19:41,997
That's all.

1589
02:19:42,077 --> 02:19:45,118
No, the paper before the council... Don't try to slow down the process if you're against it.

1590
02:19:45,158 --> 02:19:48,780
The paper before the council is based on the theory of charter review.

1591
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,220
If you're against it, you're against it.

1592
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:50,760
Not charter change.

1593
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,001
Don't try to slow the process down.

1594
02:19:52,621 --> 02:19:53,721
Let people know where you stand.

1595
02:19:53,741 --> 02:19:58,343
The paper before the council is based on the theory that there's a need for charter change.

1596
02:19:59,274 --> 02:20:00,055
Not charter review.

1597
02:20:00,275 --> 02:20:00,635
Which is it?

1598
02:20:00,675 --> 02:20:01,296
Review or change?

1599
02:20:01,716 --> 02:20:03,217
If you're against it, you're against it.

1600
02:20:03,237 --> 02:20:03,818
Just come out and say it.

1601
02:20:03,838 --> 02:20:04,619
I'm against the process.

1602
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:06,900
I'm against the mechanism that's been presented to us this evening.

1603
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:09,703
I absolutely am 110% against that mechanism.

1604
02:20:10,163 --> 02:20:11,524
I'm not going to be a pot and parcel.

1605
02:20:11,644 --> 02:20:20,231
All the books are closed door deal that was cut that excludes certain particular portions of the charter, and that defines parameters and limits the scope.

1606
02:20:20,372 --> 02:20:21,052
Absolutely not.

1607
02:20:21,112 --> 02:20:23,154
I'm absolutely not going to be supportive of that.

1608
02:20:23,174 --> 02:20:23,874
Shut his mic off.

1609
02:20:31,125 --> 02:20:34,046
I'll be honest with you, Mr. President.

1610
02:20:36,387 --> 02:20:48,012
I watched this council work in previous years, and as I went door to door and talking to constituents, one of the biggest things that they talked about every single day is what just went on right there.

1611
02:20:48,853 --> 02:20:49,493
That's a shame.

1612
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:53,702
So I will tell you, I will tell you, I have the floor, thank you.

1613
02:20:54,203 --> 02:21:05,391
What I want you to know, what I want you to know is I applaud my colleague's passion for what, bringing that forward, bringing it forward.

1614
02:21:06,131 --> 02:21:15,358
But as a new council, counselor, who was elected by our constituency, and hopefully some of you in the audience.

1615
02:21:16,278 --> 02:21:19,881
I don't really, to me the applause is nice, but

1616
02:21:20,498 --> 02:21:22,639
This isn't a forum for an applause in that sense.

1617
02:21:22,979 --> 02:21:26,561
I'm looking at doing something that's monumental in this community.

1618
02:21:27,882 --> 02:21:30,583
And for one, I did some homework today.

1619
02:21:31,444 --> 02:21:33,264
And I applaud that we should have a meeting.

1620
02:21:33,445 --> 02:21:34,545
And I want to move this forward.

1621
02:21:35,225 --> 02:21:45,070
But I have some reservations and some different input from other communities that helped and went through this process already.

1622
02:21:45,571 --> 02:21:46,371
So as I-

1623
02:21:49,537 --> 02:21:50,958
The gentleman has all this information.

1624
02:21:50,998 --> 02:21:57,404
Why didn't he go to some of these public meetings that have been held for the last three years and present this information he's armed with?

1625
02:21:58,065 --> 02:22:00,026
I mean, that would be the right thing to do.

1626
02:22:00,066 --> 02:22:02,869
Why didn't he attend these meetings and present it?

1627
02:22:03,189 --> 02:22:08,634
So that's great to have information, and I'm glad you're armed with information, but now's the time, the night to act.

1628
02:22:08,814 --> 02:22:11,697
I appreciate the passion, again, but again,

1629
02:22:13,063 --> 02:22:22,890
When this came forward the other evening, that the councilor explained to me how the process went and how he met with the mayor and how that process went.

1630
02:22:23,350 --> 02:22:26,472
This is exactly what we didn't want in our community.

1631
02:22:27,453 --> 02:22:32,016
That a councilor met with the mayor and tried to figure out five amendments.

1632
02:22:32,417 --> 02:22:34,158
These are issues that we just talked about.

1633
02:22:35,138 --> 02:22:36,139
So this is the process.

1634
02:22:36,599 --> 02:22:41,323
I just, I just, when you make, when you're talking about this issue and making,

1635
02:22:44,998 --> 02:22:51,941
I don't know why the gentleman would be angry because one of the things he spoke about was increased communication between this branch and the mayor.

1636
02:22:52,621 --> 02:22:55,862
Now we're increasing communication and people are upset what's going on.

1637
02:22:56,222 --> 02:22:58,203
Oh my God, people are meeting with the mayor.

1638
02:22:58,603 --> 02:23:00,224
Oh my God, what's happening?

1639
02:23:00,244 --> 02:23:02,044
We heard from a person at the podium tonight.

1640
02:23:02,205 --> 02:23:03,025
What about trust?

1641
02:23:03,665 --> 02:23:04,505
What about trust?

1642
02:23:06,166 --> 02:23:08,227
You have every right to meet with the mayor just like I do.

1643
02:23:10,242 --> 02:23:13,763
I don't want banter back and forth in a negative way, because that's what hurts our community.

1644
02:23:14,204 --> 02:23:15,324
That's what hurts our community.

1645
02:23:15,864 --> 02:23:17,745
There's so many positives we can go through.

1646
02:23:18,085 --> 02:23:19,726
And charter review is a positive.

1647
02:23:20,506 --> 02:23:26,849
And good communication with city government, the constituents in our community that make up our community.

1648
02:23:27,229 --> 02:23:28,730
This is what we need to work together.

1649
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:30,670
This is what we need.

1650
02:23:31,471 --> 02:23:35,973
So whether one council believes in one thing or the other, there's nothing wrong with that.

1651
02:23:37,013 --> 02:23:38,934
This is what we were elected for, to have our own opinions.

1652
02:23:39,922 --> 02:23:54,288
But personally, in my opinion, with such a huge issue in front of us, having this and talking about it in a committee of the whole, which was first presented by this counselor, I thought it was a very good idea.

1653
02:23:54,508 --> 02:23:59,490
And if we want to move forward to bring that to the public hearing after that, I welcome it.

1654
02:24:00,291 --> 02:24:05,633
But I think having that meeting together, so we can vet out so many different issues openly,

1655
02:24:07,290 --> 02:24:10,171
and then come onto the floor and then share those, I welcome it.

1656
02:24:12,131 --> 02:24:18,073
But again, I appreciate the passion, but there's a difference between passion and ignorance.

1657
02:24:18,933 --> 02:24:19,293
Thank you.

1658
02:24:25,135 --> 02:24:33,917
You know, I respect my colleague and everything he had to say, but that was a low blow.

1659
02:24:34,718 --> 02:24:35,658
That was a low blow.

1660
02:24:37,382 --> 02:24:38,385
That was a low blow.

1661
02:24:38,405 --> 02:24:39,227
Yeah, you didn't mention names.

1662
02:24:39,267 --> 02:24:40,130
That was a low blow.

1663
02:24:40,591 --> 02:24:41,192
Let me tell you.

1664
02:24:42,155 --> 02:24:42,777
Let me tell you.

1665
02:24:43,399 --> 02:24:44,401
And Mr. President.

1666
02:24:45,813 --> 02:24:52,214
Does it make sense to have a Committee of the Whole meeting and then come out and tell people what we did in the Committee of the Whole meeting and have another meeting out here?

1667
02:24:52,634 --> 02:24:53,354
Does it make sense?

1668
02:24:54,034 --> 02:24:57,315
It makes sense to have a public — what are people afraid of in this community?

1669
02:24:57,495 --> 02:24:59,796
To have a public meeting and discuss charter change.

1670
02:25:00,196 --> 02:25:01,616
Maybe people will know where you stand.

1671
02:25:02,276 --> 02:25:06,217
God forbid people know where elected people stand on an issue, Mr. President.

1672
02:25:06,237 --> 02:25:07,537
That's all I have to say.

1673
02:25:07,557 --> 02:25:11,878
The Press My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1674
02:25:12,018 --> 02:25:13,498
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1675
02:25:14,763 --> 02:25:19,765
So taking a step back here, I want to understand what we're advocating for.

1676
02:25:19,785 --> 02:25:23,207
I'm all for having more conversations about charter review.

1677
02:25:23,227 --> 02:25:26,068
We've been having them once a month in the Magoon Room in the library.

1678
02:25:27,229 --> 02:25:36,073
But on the same token, right now, without having the city solicitor actually draft a document, we're just talking.

1679
02:25:36,754 --> 02:25:43,337
We're not talking about any actual object where we can begin to discuss the pros and the cons of it.

1680
02:25:43,970 --> 02:25:47,812
Thus, I understand wanting to have more conversation.

1681
02:25:47,832 --> 02:25:48,873
I think it's a great idea.

1682
02:25:49,534 --> 02:25:59,220
But referring the issue to the city solicitor for a draft, not the final draft, but for an actual document that we can use as a starting point of charter review.

1683
02:26:00,002 --> 02:26:03,245
I think overall, everyone agrees that we should have charter review.

1684
02:26:03,285 --> 02:26:04,686
The question is where we should go now.

1685
02:26:05,086 --> 02:26:08,449
Well, we don't want this to turn into another point of contention.

1686
02:26:09,270 --> 02:26:15,155
If we have an object where we can actually discuss, review, at home, doing your homework,

1687
02:26:15,575 --> 02:26:18,577
We can call other people, see what they think about this document.

1688
02:26:19,297 --> 02:26:24,419
If we have a draft document in hand, then we'll be able to move forward more adequately.

1689
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:32,944
Just a number of people have come here tonight, but you have to understand, for some of them, it's not easy to come to city council chambers.

1690
02:26:32,984 --> 02:26:35,425
We have a number of members that are disabled.

1691
02:26:36,025 --> 02:26:41,187
We have a number of members that have difficulty making it from the bus schedule.

1692
02:26:41,327 --> 02:26:47,109
Now, of course, we don't want to rush into this process overnight, but let's move forward.

1693
02:26:47,669 --> 02:26:52,931
By referring the issue to the city solicitor, he'll have a draft for us ready next Tuesday.

1694
02:26:53,331 --> 02:26:54,671
We can look at it online.

1695
02:26:55,172 --> 02:26:56,272
That's moving forward.

1696
02:26:56,992 --> 02:27:03,415
Opening up another open-ended conversation, perhaps that could lead to more contentious arguments.

1697
02:27:03,755 --> 02:27:04,055
Thank you.

1698
02:27:09,658 --> 02:27:10,760
Thank you, Mr. President.

1699
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:12,943
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1700
02:27:13,324 --> 02:27:14,706
We have to have that talking.

1701
02:27:15,327 --> 02:27:20,957
We have to have that discussion and community input in a public hearing so that the solicitor

1702
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:24,662
can take that input and create the document.

1703
02:27:24,923 --> 02:27:27,004
That's what creates the document.

1704
02:27:27,224 --> 02:27:33,149
So we can have, you know, definite item a for chatter review to have a discussion and further meetings.

1705
02:27:33,489 --> 02:27:39,154
As Councillor Penta pointed out, it took 26 meetings and 6 public hearings.

1706
02:27:39,914 --> 02:27:41,015
That's where it starts.

1707
02:27:41,496 --> 02:27:43,598
Councilor Marks, 100% behind you.

1708
02:27:43,818 --> 02:27:45,280
You're absolutely right.

1709
02:27:45,741 --> 02:27:47,362
We have to have this meeting.

1710
02:27:48,243 --> 02:27:50,906
It is the City of Medford's government.

1711
02:27:51,527 --> 02:27:52,628
That's where you start it.

1712
02:27:52,908 --> 02:27:55,531
That's where it starts and the discussion and the talk.

1713
02:27:55,952 --> 02:28:01,037
And yeah, everybody's going to have an opinion and there are going to be times of contention

1714
02:28:01,778 --> 02:28:04,959
That is never ignorance, it's passion.

1715
02:28:05,279 --> 02:28:06,739
We love our city and the Medford.

1716
02:28:07,619 --> 02:28:08,719
We want it to work right.

1717
02:28:09,079 --> 02:28:14,380
Let's have that discussion and invite Medford to this podium to talk about it next Tuesday night.

1718
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:15,500
Please, thank you.

1719
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:22,522
I really am not sure what to say, but

1720
02:28:30,948 --> 02:28:33,670
I can't believe what happened here in this council tonight.

1721
02:28:37,153 --> 02:28:39,415
We should all be working together.

1722
02:28:40,455 --> 02:28:53,986
And I believe to delay a conversation on this subject, which the citizens and the voters of this city are eager to have, been 30 years.

1723
02:28:54,126 --> 02:28:55,687
Are we going to wait another 10, 20, 30 years?

1724
02:28:55,707 --> 02:28:56,508
I don't think so.

1725
02:29:00,205 --> 02:29:06,349
And I don't think that some of the people, some of the councilors, are hearing the voices in our community.

1726
02:29:07,570 --> 02:29:09,472
And I believe it would be a disservice.

1727
02:29:10,472 --> 02:29:18,138
I have been living in this city my entire life, and I am proud of this city, and I am proud of this council, but I'm not proud of it tonight.

1728
02:29:19,723 --> 02:29:25,925
And I cannot see what could possibly objection be to having a public meeting.

1729
02:29:26,225 --> 02:29:29,966
This is the first evening that this subject has been brought up in public.

1730
02:29:30,866 --> 02:29:44,110
It's a huge subject, as you all know, probably more than I do, but it deserves time and it deserves the input from the citizens of this community.

1731
02:29:44,951 --> 02:29:49,412
And I strongly urge everyone to work together, go forward,

1732
02:29:50,364 --> 02:29:58,430
And if it means just having one meeting, I, I, I would be totally devastated to hear that this subject is going to be tabled.

1733
02:30:09,357 --> 02:30:13,420
Well, let's work together on this and let's not get divided.

1734
02:30:18,964 --> 02:30:19,284
Thank you.

1735
02:30:24,399 --> 02:30:27,280
Mario Martin, 198 Harvard Street.

1736
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:30,962
I want to say I'm really surprised at just what happened here over the last few minutes.

1737
02:30:31,122 --> 02:30:33,463
It's shocking.

1738
02:30:34,804 --> 02:30:40,906
Quite frankly, I mean, tonight's the night to make the decision.

1739
02:30:41,486 --> 02:30:52,131
So whether we take this to a committee of the whole, which a lot of residents won't agree with, because again, as Councilor Mark said, it's going to be buried.

1740
02:30:52,671 --> 02:30:54,052
And we're just going to waste some more time.

1741
02:30:54,639 --> 02:30:57,821
but the citizens have been talking about this for years.

1742
02:30:57,881 --> 02:30:58,841
It's not about tonight.

1743
02:30:58,941 --> 02:31:06,425
We mentioned this, uh, last year, same time during the previous session and it didn't go and it didn't go anywhere.

1744
02:31:07,785 --> 02:31:09,146
The only thing we want is democracy.

1745
02:31:09,226 --> 02:31:14,208
We just want a democratic, uh, way of governing our city.

1746
02:31:14,308 --> 02:31:23,553
And, and, and, and we want to give the city council and this administration the tools to govern, but you know, just,

1747
02:31:25,324 --> 02:31:32,986
With all this being said, ignorance is not the subject that this should be going.

1748
02:31:33,746 --> 02:31:42,888
And tonight isn't about making a decision on whether charter review should be evaluated tonight.

1749
02:31:43,188 --> 02:31:44,989
It's about bypassing the signatures.

1750
02:31:45,409 --> 02:31:47,929
It's not about being an expert.

1751
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:50,610
You're elected, you should be an expert.

1752
02:31:53,832 --> 02:31:59,078
I personally feel as though the initiative petition process is actually the bedrock of the democratic process.

1753
02:32:00,419 --> 02:32:06,185
And circumventing that process would in itself actually be less democratic than allowing you to go out and collect the signatures.

1754
02:32:06,205 --> 02:32:12,092
Whether we make a decision at a committee of the whole next week or tonight, the signatures are going to be done.

1755
02:32:12,252 --> 02:32:15,135
The signatures will be taken and we'll do it on our own.

1756
02:32:17,310 --> 02:32:17,810
Let him finish.

1757
02:32:17,890 --> 02:32:18,291
Let him go.

1758
02:32:18,331 --> 02:32:19,671
That's all I got to say.

1759
02:32:19,751 --> 02:32:24,254
Whether it's decided upon tonight, tomorrow, next week, next month.

1760
02:32:27,155 --> 02:32:29,457
So, Mr. President, my point of information was this.

1761
02:32:30,477 --> 02:32:40,603
The initiative petition process is actually the bedrock of a democratic foundation, all right, where citizens can actually go collect signatures and force something to be put in the ballot when they feel as though they're not being represented.

1762
02:32:40,943 --> 02:32:44,525
So to bypass that process, I think, is problematic right now.

1763
02:32:44,585 --> 02:32:45,185
And I want to weigh it.

1764
02:32:45,525 --> 02:32:46,626
I want to weigh it, Mr. President.

1765
02:32:46,905 --> 02:32:47,665
That's where I'm coming from.

1766
02:32:47,785 --> 02:32:49,606
I certainly think that this is a noble cause.

1767
02:32:50,066 --> 02:32:55,427
I certainly think that this resolution was based on a theory that there is a need for charter review, and that's something that I don't disagree with.

1768
02:32:55,907 --> 02:32:59,408
But I do disagree with the process that we're looking at here and bypassing the signature route.

1769
02:32:59,448 --> 02:33:01,128
Mr. President, I don't know if I'm crazy about that idea.

1770
02:33:02,109 --> 02:33:13,511
I'd be more inclined to support something that comes from the people, where we have the opportunity to engage full participation, where we know right at first hand, right there, the signatures are there.

1771
02:33:13,531 --> 02:33:14,071
They're on the ballot.

1772
02:33:14,111 --> 02:33:14,452
It's going.

1773
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:15,092
And that's it.

1774
02:33:15,152 --> 02:33:16,512
And if we look at the reforms that happened

1775
02:33:17,047 --> 02:33:26,810
back in 86, it's my understanding, after doing a little bit of a history lesson, Mr. President, that the council refused to put recommendations on the ballot that were made when the signatures were collected.

1776
02:33:26,930 --> 02:33:28,530
And that's where the problem started.

1777
02:33:28,550 --> 02:33:29,291
And I might be wrong.

1778
02:33:29,491 --> 02:33:30,031
I might be wrong.

1779
02:33:30,371 --> 02:33:32,332
But, you know, Mr. President, that's what I've been looking at.

1780
02:33:32,632 --> 02:33:39,374
And, you know, I think that, you know, right now, if we're going to be talking about the democratic process, circumventing the signatures is not it.

1781
02:33:40,954 --> 02:33:41,474
Circumventing.

1782
02:33:41,554 --> 02:33:42,155
I'm not done yet.

1783
02:33:42,175 --> 02:33:43,695
Circumventing the signatures.

1784
02:33:51,296 --> 02:33:53,077
Thank you, Council President.

1785
02:33:53,578 --> 02:34:00,722
Circumventing the signatures really just shows that this city council is actually paying attention to what the community is saying.

1786
02:34:01,062 --> 02:34:02,563
And we want a charter review.

1787
02:34:03,004 --> 02:34:14,091
And whether we get the help of the city council or not, we're going to use the democratic process and our power as citizens to bring a better form of government in this city.

1788
02:34:14,471 --> 02:34:15,132
And that's what we need.

1789
02:34:15,172 --> 02:34:15,872
And that's what we want.

1790
02:34:16,072 --> 02:34:17,053
And that's what we're going to work for.

1791
02:34:17,457 --> 02:34:18,918
And that's why this is on the table today.

1792
02:34:19,718 --> 02:34:24,039
Vote with your heart, Councilman.

1793
02:34:24,059 --> 02:34:24,620
Councilwoman Harris.

1794
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:26,820
Thank you, President Carviello.

1795
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:32,142
I just would ask my council colleagues to maybe entertain a compromise.

1796
02:34:32,483 --> 02:34:34,463
We have a public meeting next Tuesday.

1797
02:34:34,483 --> 02:34:40,065
And then I understand we need some digestion and we need some time to sit with the solicitor.

1798
02:34:40,385 --> 02:34:47,168
So maybe the week after we can sit with the solicitor based on what we heard at the public hearing, based on our recommendations and concerns.

1799
02:34:47,683 --> 02:34:59,428
And then at that time, he drafts an ordinance and then have a third meeting, hopefully a final meeting, whether that's committee of the whole or, you know, on the floor where we actually will decide whether or not to take a vote on it.

1800
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:02,830
I mean, I think that would solve all the problems.

1801
02:35:05,471 --> 02:35:09,052
I don't think I was asking for anything different than what counsel just said, Mr. President.

1802
02:35:12,174 --> 02:35:14,555
Leonard Galyona, 86 channel road.

1803
02:35:15,315 --> 02:35:16,916
I wasn't going to speak tonight, but, um,

1804
02:35:17,383 --> 02:35:20,965
I've been watching city council meetings for over 50 years as a lifelong resident.

1805
02:35:21,806 --> 02:35:30,091
And I sat back and said to myself, this is one of the best city council meetings I've seen in many years.

1806
02:35:30,111 --> 02:35:35,754
I think Councilor Marks has to be applauded for bringing the proposal forward.

1807
02:35:36,134 --> 02:35:45,700
I think Mayor Stephanie Macchini-Burke and her leadership in terms of a compromise has to be complimented and all the councils have to be complimenting.

1808
02:35:46,090 --> 02:35:52,571
complement the entertaining charter review, which the people have waited a long time for.

1809
02:35:53,411 --> 02:36:01,313
And I don't think there's much of a difference between the councilors in terms of how it goes forward.

1810
02:36:01,573 --> 02:36:10,695
And I think what Councilor Brianna Longo-Curran just offered as an alternative or a compromise is a very good idea.

1811
02:36:11,135 --> 02:36:15,816
And I would just urge the councilors to—I know there's a lot of passion involved.

1812
02:36:16,355 --> 02:36:23,938
But we're all professional people here, and you folks were elected to the office, and you're doing a great job.

1813
02:36:24,018 --> 02:36:29,400
And just tone it down a bit and work together, and I think this thing will move forward on its own.

1814
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:30,220
Thank you.

1815
02:36:34,562 --> 02:36:35,502
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1816
02:36:35,542 --> 02:36:36,743
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1817
02:36:36,823 --> 02:36:39,444
I just want to make a brief clarification to a point that was brought up.

1818
02:36:40,477 --> 02:36:42,118
We are still collecting signatures.

1819
02:36:42,178 --> 02:36:43,579
That process hasn't stalled.

1820
02:36:43,619 --> 02:36:44,359
It hasn't failed.

1821
02:36:44,379 --> 02:36:48,981
We've collected over 200 just this month, and we had a number of really snowy and rainy days.

1822
02:36:50,222 --> 02:36:53,243
We will keep getting signatures, whichever process.

1823
02:36:53,303 --> 02:36:56,264
We want as many people involved in this process as possible.

1824
02:36:57,185 --> 02:36:59,606
We don't see this as an either-or kind of deal.

1825
02:36:59,746 --> 02:37:04,248
We want to just get signatures to let people know this is going on, to invite them into the conversation.

1826
02:37:04,961 --> 02:37:06,802
So I just wanted to make a clarification.

1827
02:37:06,822 --> 02:37:08,564
We're actually doing really great work.

1828
02:37:08,764 --> 02:37:12,066
We're moving forward, and I'm really proud of all the people that have collected signatures.

1829
02:37:12,106 --> 02:37:12,386
Thank you.

1830
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:22,433
William Walker, 9 Piedmont Road.

1831
02:37:23,154 --> 02:37:25,496
I would like to add one more item to my clarifications.

1832
02:37:25,636 --> 02:37:26,436
My understanding with the

1833
02:37:28,243 --> 02:37:37,888
The resolution, as it's written in the agenda that I have, and I'm not sure what state it's in right now, is that this is intended to waive the signature requirement, but otherwise continue the process.

1834
02:37:38,368 --> 02:37:49,233
That process would include whether or not charter review at all happened as a ballot question, as a yes or no proposition to the voters that would then decide whether or not charter review would proceed.

1835
02:37:49,993 --> 02:37:59,902
At the exact same time as that question is being asked, yes, there are people that are running for the position of commission, but those people may be running in vain if, in fact, a charter review is voted down.

1836
02:38:00,863 --> 02:38:07,688
If that is not the intention of this resolution, then that should be clarified, because that's the process as it is in state law.

1837
02:38:08,149 --> 02:38:08,349
Thank you.

1838
02:38:21,897 --> 02:38:24,078
I think we all got a little lost on this.

1839
02:38:24,978 --> 02:38:30,660
The intent of the resolution was to request that the solicitor draft a whole new petition.

1840
02:38:31,480 --> 02:38:34,281
And I think we all got a little bit off track.

1841
02:38:34,922 --> 02:38:38,783
To try to change, not try to change.

1842
02:38:38,803 --> 02:38:41,184
That's all we were requesting.

1843
02:38:41,524 --> 02:38:46,666
So I think everybody got a little sidelined in all the passion that happened over the last ten minutes.

1844
02:38:46,686 --> 02:38:49,327
Yeah, name and address were the right place.

1845
02:38:49,890 --> 02:38:50,230
Thank you.

1846
02:38:50,250 --> 02:38:56,755
Jean Martington, Cumming Street, and I hope to channel May and not some of the other people in this chamber, so I'm going to try to say it calmly.

1847
02:38:57,556 --> 02:39:00,158
First of all, Mr. Marks, I want to thank you for bringing this forward.

1848
02:39:00,418 --> 02:39:01,219
This is overdue.

1849
02:39:01,979 --> 02:39:03,040
It's very much overdue.

1850
02:39:03,781 --> 02:39:08,184
And the simplest thing is what he just said.

1851
02:39:08,965 --> 02:39:09,886
Let's keep it simple.

1852
02:39:10,526 --> 02:39:15,010
Let's do the first thing first, which is to have the solicitor draw up a draft.

1853
02:39:15,945 --> 02:39:27,068
And the reason why we need to do that is because the psychology of Medford, and I am going to speak on that, and I can do that calmly, is that we have had an A form of government for 30 years.

1854
02:39:27,568 --> 02:39:34,970
The people have been passive participants in government for 30 years.

1855
02:39:34,990 --> 02:39:36,450
30 years of passive government.

1856
02:39:36,790 --> 02:39:38,190
They don't know how to get involved.

1857
02:39:38,591 --> 02:39:39,971
They don't know how to come forward.

1858
02:39:40,211 --> 02:39:41,431
They're afraid to come forward.

1859
02:39:41,691 --> 02:39:43,572
They've gotten used to not coming forward.

1860
02:39:44,532 --> 02:39:47,154
And so we have a lot of rectifying to do.

1861
02:39:47,975 --> 02:39:49,416
And so let's keep it simple.

1862
02:39:52,678 --> 02:39:54,179
That's why the signatures didn't work.

1863
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:56,041
Because the people are passive.

1864
02:39:56,401 --> 02:39:57,021
And they're afraid.

1865
02:39:57,081 --> 02:40:02,986
And when people have change come in their face, they're confronted with change and they freak out a little bit.

1866
02:40:03,486 --> 02:40:04,587
So we have to

1867
02:40:05,031 --> 02:40:06,652
We have to take this as a process.

1868
02:40:07,112 --> 02:40:09,193
But the signatures alone isn't going to work.

1869
02:40:09,513 --> 02:40:16,016
So I thank Mr. Marks for bringing this forward, because the signatures, it's painstakingly slow.

1870
02:40:16,676 --> 02:40:18,817
And it's too slow for us to change that way.

1871
02:40:19,297 --> 02:40:22,439
This is a valid option, by the way, as far as I'm concerned.

1872
02:40:22,879 --> 02:40:26,620
It's in the charter under the mass state laws that we can do it this way.

1873
02:40:26,981 --> 02:40:30,322
So this is not bypassing the signature process.

1874
02:40:30,850 --> 02:40:31,671
But it's legitimate.

1875
02:40:31,811 --> 02:40:34,874
It is bypassing the signature process, and I do understand that, Mr. Knight.

1876
02:40:35,515 --> 02:40:43,043
But it's a legitimate way to move forward, and it is the way that we need to because the people are not

1877
02:40:44,507 --> 02:40:47,229
used to participating in the government and local government.

1878
02:40:47,649 --> 02:40:53,612
And to have a meeting of the whole, you can have a meeting of the whole here in this forum in public.

1879
02:40:54,212 --> 02:40:54,433
Yes.

1880
02:40:54,693 --> 02:40:58,055
I think, again, part of the reason we got off track is... Oh, yeah.

1881
02:40:58,315 --> 02:41:03,217
It's... No, yeah, but we got off track because that's not what the Council of Marks resolution is.

1882
02:41:03,718 --> 02:41:03,938
Okay.

1883
02:41:05,979 --> 02:41:06,800
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1884
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:08,141
So thank you for correcting me.

1885
02:41:08,421 --> 02:41:13,785
And I hope that I was channeling a little bit of May and, and not some of the other folks in the hall tonight.

1886
02:41:14,105 --> 02:41:15,446
So, cause I look up to her.

1887
02:41:15,786 --> 02:41:16,667
She's a great role model.

1888
02:41:17,007 --> 02:41:17,267
Okay.

1889
02:41:17,287 --> 02:41:17,587
Thank you.

1890
02:41:18,508 --> 02:41:21,550
That's right.

1891
02:41:24,953 --> 02:41:26,154
Mr. President, two quick comments.

1892
02:41:26,194 --> 02:41:28,195
Barpenta zero summit road farmer member.

1893
02:41:28,913 --> 02:41:37,318
You know, I'm standing on this side of the rail, and I feel somewhat vindicated, because when I sat over there, I was watching the same thing people accused me of what took place here tonight.

1894
02:41:38,659 --> 02:41:39,860
I don't know if it's this.

1895
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:41,401
Maybe it's the seat, George.

1896
02:41:41,421 --> 02:41:43,142
It could be the seat.

1897
02:41:43,182 --> 02:41:44,263
I don't know, you know?

1898
02:41:44,923 --> 02:41:52,888
But again, refreshing my memory, going back when we did this, we had conversations like this way back when.

1899
02:41:53,453 --> 02:41:56,655
when people would come from the audience when they were talking about childhood change.

1900
02:41:56,695 --> 02:41:58,536
Now, we had big issues back then.

1901
02:41:58,556 --> 02:42:00,317
It was the former city manager at that time.

1902
02:42:00,938 --> 02:42:01,838
He was one of the issues.

1903
02:42:01,858 --> 02:42:05,241
And the other one was taking over the police department, having a police commissioner.

1904
02:42:05,521 --> 02:42:08,062
That stirred the pot within the city of Medford at that point in time.

1905
02:42:08,403 --> 02:42:10,444
And that's the reason why the signatures went out.

1906
02:42:10,564 --> 02:42:11,705
I'm going to disagree with you, Janie.

1907
02:42:12,025 --> 02:42:16,268
I think signatures or this route, either route works, depending.

1908
02:42:16,648 --> 02:42:17,468
And they're both legal.

1909
02:42:17,548 --> 02:42:19,210
So you can't say that they don't work.

1910
02:42:20,445 --> 02:42:24,387
I would support Council Mark's proposition of having a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1911
02:42:24,407 --> 02:42:33,611
And Mr. President, even though it's a resolution to have the City of Sicily draft a proposal, in this proposal there are ingredients.

1912
02:42:34,211 --> 02:42:44,296
And I'm assuming that's what the Committee of the Whole will elicit from the people who will come to the podium, talk about what the ingredients might be, and that's the beginning of getting this process going.

1913
02:42:45,216 --> 02:42:47,157
Passion ran very deep here tonight.

1914
02:42:47,973 --> 02:42:52,116
But don't let it interfere with the eye on the prize.

1915
02:42:52,176 --> 02:43:00,141
And the eye on the prize is making sure that the people of the city have an opportunity to review this charter as many ways as possible.

1916
02:43:00,481 --> 02:43:10,228
And they're afforded that opportunity to talk about it, to discuss it, and vote on it as many times as need be before the final product is presented to the taxpayers of this community.

1917
02:43:10,508 --> 02:43:10,808
Thank you.

1918
02:43:11,769 --> 02:43:13,510
And thank you, Council Member.

1919
02:43:14,773 --> 02:43:30,570
was being resolved that the city solicitor be requested to draft a home rule petition for submission to the general court, providing for the election of a seven-person municipal charter commission to be placed on the ballot at the next general election that will occur on November 8th.

1920
02:43:31,911 --> 02:43:47,639
Thus removing the necessity of first securing the signatures of 50% of the voters in the city who were eligible to vote in the last election as required by general laws chapter 43b section 3 in the municipal charter commission.

1921
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:57,065
Once elected, shall be charged with the duty of recommending revisions in amendments to the present city charter and their recommendations include, at a minimum,

1922
02:43:59,215 --> 02:44:08,250
an amendment to the present city charter instituting an appointed committee whose purpose will be to conduct a periodic review of the city charter.

1923
02:44:09,421 --> 02:44:32,368
that the Municipal Charter Commission, once elected, will be required to submit its final report of up to five recommendations or revisions or amendments to our present city charter on or before June 30th, 2017, and that the recommended revisions or amendments be placed on the ballot for the next municipal election, which will be placed, which will take place on November 7th, 2017.

1924
02:44:32,448 --> 02:44:38,130
Well, Councilor Marks, your motion is to refer this to the solicitor, correct?

1925
02:44:39,573 --> 02:44:39,733
No.

1926
02:44:46,215 --> 02:44:47,856
I'm sorry.

1927
02:44:47,916 --> 02:44:48,836
Thank you, Mr. President.

1928
02:44:51,037 --> 02:44:53,338
Ultimately, this is going to be referred to the city solicitor.

1929
02:44:53,858 --> 02:45:04,982
But what needs to take place first is that we as a council, along with the citizens, have to come up to a consensus regarding the language, as was mentioned at the podium many times,

1930
02:45:05,392 --> 02:45:17,019
regarding some of the key issues, whether or not we're going to limit the number of amendments, whether or not the periodic review, or maybe it should be three or five years.

1931
02:45:17,379 --> 02:45:25,824
We have to frame that first, and whatever we frame then gets sent to the city solicitor, so then he can put it in good working order as a home rule petition.

1932
02:45:26,184 --> 02:45:34,409
So I think we're trying to put the cart before the horse, you know, so I would withdraw any motion that I made, Mr. President, and I would go based on

1933
02:45:35,133 --> 02:45:38,956
The public hearing, I think that's what Councilor Longo mentioned about having a public hearing.

1934
02:45:39,416 --> 02:45:40,237
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1935
02:45:40,978 --> 02:45:44,881
And if members don't like that... I'll withdraw my motions.

1936
02:45:44,941 --> 02:45:48,283
My original motion was to have a Committee of the Whole meeting, so I'll withdraw that.

1937
02:45:48,704 --> 02:45:51,466
This paper, for all intents and purposes, can be tabled.

1938
02:45:52,607 --> 02:45:54,828
It's the framework we're going to work with, but it can be tabled.

1939
02:45:54,848 --> 02:45:55,429
That would be fine.

1940
02:46:01,508 --> 02:46:03,349
Motion number 16-0-7-2.

1941
02:46:03,749 --> 02:46:05,971
The table, but there'll be no more discussion.

1942
02:46:06,031 --> 02:46:07,972
Table, but with a public hearing.

1943
02:46:09,713 --> 02:46:12,415
Now, well, that's a second.

1944
02:46:12,435 --> 02:46:13,276
That's a separate motion.

1945
02:46:18,379 --> 02:46:19,480
No, you asked me what I wanted to do.

1946
02:46:19,540 --> 02:46:20,360
I didn't put out a motion.

1947
02:46:20,380 --> 02:46:21,301
You asked me what I'd like to do.

1948
02:46:23,502 --> 02:46:25,223
You asked me and I said, I'd like to table.

1949
02:46:25,283 --> 02:46:26,404
I didn't offer a motion to table.

1950
02:46:31,248 --> 02:46:37,213
We want to entertain a motion to have a public hearing.

1951
02:46:37,233 --> 02:46:37,553
Yes.

1952
02:46:37,593 --> 02:46:38,094
Move approval.

1953
02:46:38,174 --> 02:46:44,179
All right, move approval.

1954
02:46:44,639 --> 02:46:45,520
Roll call vote.

1955
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:50,324
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1956
02:46:51,585 --> 02:46:52,426
That's next week, right?

1957
02:46:52,466 --> 02:46:53,526
Next week we'll have that.

1958
02:46:53,566 --> 02:46:55,028
That's next week.

1959
02:46:56,807 --> 02:46:59,889
And you said a week after when you proposed on a compromise.

1960
02:47:00,070 --> 02:47:00,510
That's all right.

1961
02:47:00,830 --> 02:47:01,391
That's fine.

1962
02:47:01,471 --> 02:47:03,973
I'm fine with that.

1963
02:47:04,093 --> 02:47:04,753
All right.

1964
02:47:05,814 --> 02:47:09,697
So committee of the whole next week, public hearing week after the public.

1965
02:47:09,737 --> 02:47:10,397
No, no, no.

1966
02:47:10,477 --> 02:47:12,499
Same, same, same night, same night.

1967
02:47:12,559 --> 02:47:13,740
I can live with that.

1968
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:14,761
Roll call vote.

1969
02:47:14,781 --> 02:47:14,821
Uh,

1970
02:47:25,087 --> 02:47:46,303
clarity Mr. President so I can be clear the motion is to have a committee of the whole week meeting next week and then to have a public hearing on the same matter that same night thank you yes

We have a motion.

2009
02:48:13,325 --> 02:48:13,685

We have a motion.

2011
02:48:14,326 --> 02:48:14,786
We have a motion.

2012
02:48:14,806 --> 02:48:15,566
We have a motion.

2013
02:48:15,586 --> 02:48:16,086
We have a motion.

2014
02:48:16,326 --> 02:48:16,747
We have a motion.

2015
02:48:16,767 --> 02:48:17,387
We have a motion

2016
02:48:17,841 --> 02:48:23,463
is being sent to committee of the whole to be convened through the president next week.

2017
02:48:24,123 --> 02:48:31,446
And then we will also request a public hearing on the matter in the council again next week.

2018
02:48:31,866 --> 02:48:32,247
Thank you.

2019
02:48:34,407 --> 02:48:35,368
Is there a roll call?

2020
02:48:48,162 --> 02:48:48,382
Yes.

2021
02:48:48,402 --> 02:48:53,627
Motion of six in affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

2022
02:48:53,907 --> 02:48:54,467
Thank you.

2023
02:48:55,128 --> 02:48:56,109
All right.

2024
02:48:56,129 --> 02:49:03,154
16-073 offered by Vice President Leclerc.

2025
02:49:14,987 --> 02:49:25,269
He has resolved that the school department forward to the City Council a copy of the written notification policy that all principals should follow, which is to be drafted by March.

2026
02:49:26,349 --> 02:49:30,370
Councilwoman Locario.

2027
02:49:30,470 --> 02:49:31,930
Thank you, President Carviello.

2028
02:49:34,350 --> 02:49:44,092
We discussed the matter with a few parents last Tuesday, and the school committee superintendent and I believe a number of

2029
02:49:44,845 --> 02:49:55,030
administrators had a hearing on the matter where parents got to ask questions, school committee members got to ask questions last Wednesday.

2030
02:49:55,050 --> 02:50:06,275
I wasn't at that meeting, but I did follow it, and it's been on TV, televised, and it was updated on different channels.

2031
02:50:11,244 --> 02:50:21,886
The one motion that was passed, I believe, is that a notification policy be drafted and that all principals should be aware of it and follow it.

2032
02:50:22,566 --> 02:50:25,687
I think that was a great motion, and I'm happy it went forward.

2033
02:50:26,487 --> 02:50:31,588
I would like to be forwarded a copy of that notification policy.

2034
02:50:31,608 --> 02:50:38,369
I believe that there needs to be a crisis communication plan to get accurate information.

2035
02:50:38,927 --> 02:50:48,875
to parents, to teachers, to staff members, to people who work in the certain schools, to the police department, and especially to the students.

2036
02:50:50,016 --> 02:50:56,501
We discussed it last week, so I'm not going to reiterate the problems that I saw with parents getting notification at 6 p.m.

2037
02:50:57,422 --> 02:51:01,345
the night of a bomb threat, which took place between 9 and 10 a.m.

2038
02:51:03,865 --> 02:51:06,045
But that is a serious problem.

2039
02:51:06,066 --> 02:51:09,946
I think that was admitted that it was a little late with notification.

2040
02:51:12,247 --> 02:51:18,168
I know that the city of Arlington, who also had a bomb threat, I believe it was about 10 a.m.

2041
02:51:19,048 --> 02:51:30,211
on February 2nd, which I believe is the same day that Medford did, they had notification going out by the Medford Police Department that was 20 minutes after the actual threat.

2042
02:51:31,738 --> 02:51:34,600
It was noticed by the city of Arlington.

2043
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:38,664
Arlington High School received what is believed to be a low-grade bomb threat.

2044
02:51:38,684 --> 02:51:41,246
This is moved this morning via phone call.

2045
02:51:41,266 --> 02:51:43,808
The school is currently sheltering in place as a precaution.

2046
02:51:44,269 --> 02:51:47,011
Please do not respond or call the school at this time.

2047
02:51:48,632 --> 02:51:53,777
Parents and staff were later notified that the students were being evacuated.

2048
02:51:53,837 --> 02:51:54,858
That was at 1048 to the front lawn.

2049
02:51:56,670 --> 02:51:58,271
waiting for premises to be checked.

2050
02:51:58,411 --> 02:52:03,113
Once the building is deemed safe, students will return to the building, not being dismissed at this time.

2051
02:52:03,974 --> 02:52:11,437
Then 17 minutes later, another update, school has been cleared, students returning to the building at this time.

2052
02:52:12,438 --> 02:52:22,763
That is something that I believe is needed for the city of Medford, not only with regards to bomb threats, but with regards to anything that has to do with parents, staff,

2053
02:52:23,156 --> 02:52:32,479
students getting notification of a serious incident, or maybe not even a serious incident, maybe a drill like a lockdown drill that happened at the Roberts Elementary School.

2054
02:52:33,060 --> 02:52:45,464
We need more parent communication, and I'm glad that the school committee voted, I believe, six in the affirmative to put a notification policy in place.

2055
02:52:45,484 --> 02:52:51,226
I think it's definitely a good thing that all the principals should follow it and that it should be uniform.

2056
02:52:51,865 --> 02:53:00,126
I would just like a copy because, you know, I apologize that I am getting phone calls from a number of parents, a number of concerned parents.

2057
02:53:01,167 --> 02:53:05,787
I've heard from students at the high school, people, personnel who work in the building.

2058
02:53:06,648 --> 02:53:15,069
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry that I'm getting these phone calls because I do feel like we're public officials and we get the complaints no matter what.

2059
02:53:15,209 --> 02:53:17,609
People have a right to complain to whoever they want.

2060
02:53:17,669 --> 02:53:20,650
And I am, I mean, I must've got stopped.

2061
02:53:21,531 --> 02:53:22,552
three different places.

2062
02:53:22,912 --> 02:53:23,833
I've got phone calls.

2063
02:53:23,873 --> 02:53:25,034
I got Facebook messages.

2064
02:53:25,154 --> 02:53:28,757
I've got emails from concerned parents.

2065
02:53:28,797 --> 02:53:31,439
So this needs to be discussed.

2066
02:53:31,499 --> 02:53:32,600
We need to be updated.

2067
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:39,646
We need to know what needs to be put in the budget or changed in the school budget, because that is something we're going to approve in June.

2068
02:53:40,727 --> 02:53:42,749
And we need the information.

2069
02:53:43,009 --> 02:53:44,951
So I want to be able to have this policy.

2070
02:53:45,131 --> 02:53:48,494
I want to be able to notify parents that it's in place.

2071
02:53:48,534 --> 02:53:50,135
And this is what's going to happen next time

2072
02:53:50,700 --> 02:53:52,581
Or hopefully, there's never a next time.

2073
02:53:52,621 --> 02:53:57,382
But if this A, B, or C happens, this is when you're going to be notified.

2074
02:53:57,422 --> 02:53:58,722
This is how you're going to be notified.

2075
02:53:59,343 --> 02:54:02,724
So I hope this is an extensive notification policy.

2076
02:54:02,824 --> 02:54:04,864
And it addresses who, what, when, where, and why.

2077
02:54:05,625 --> 02:54:07,025
Because it's important for parents.

2078
02:54:07,065 --> 02:54:08,225
It's important for students.

2079
02:54:08,405 --> 02:54:16,868
And I think I was blamed last week by the superintendent that I was creating fear among Medford residents.

2080
02:54:16,928 --> 02:54:19,909
And I really have to rebut that and say it's quite the opposite.

2081
02:54:20,518 --> 02:54:26,743
not giving timely notification or with no transparency actually creates fear.

2082
02:54:27,283 --> 02:54:37,130
And that's a number of parents have stated that to me, that fear was created by not knowing what happened at the school till 6 p.m.

2083
02:54:38,411 --> 02:54:39,372
And that's unfortunate.

2084
02:54:39,452 --> 02:54:45,216
So I do want to stay on top of the issue and I'd like to be given the notification policy in a timely manner.

2085
02:54:45,256 --> 02:54:47,478
And hopefully this does come to fruition in March.

2086
02:54:48,237 --> 02:54:58,864
and we're able to review it and give insight and call whatever school committee members we would like to or speak about it on the floor if we need to again.

2087
02:54:59,545 --> 02:55:13,674
But I definitely think it's something that I would like to see and I'd like to make sure that it does happen and that it's uniform throughout our schools and that all the principals take it very seriously because parent notification, student notification is

2088
02:55:14,730 --> 02:55:19,651
extremely important, especially where we've seen a situation where it's gone bad over the last couple weeks.

2089
02:55:23,212 --> 02:55:27,253
I thank my colleague.

2090
02:55:27,973 --> 02:55:38,175
I did, but I believe to answer a few of those questions, the superintendent on the request of a school committee member, Mia McStone, one of the biggest

2091
02:55:39,018 --> 02:56:01,638
concerns was the commitment of communication and making sure that is in print and delivered throughout the school system in a uniform manner, not only for major emergencies, but something as simple as snow days and making sure that every school has the same policy in place and when things go out.

2092
02:56:01,658 --> 02:56:03,720
I think that was very important.

2093
02:56:06,902 --> 02:56:18,607
Other than that, I know that if we can, I also want to make sure that we have that copy from the superintendent that he mentioned that will be done the first meeting of March in the school committee.

2094
02:56:18,627 --> 02:56:19,527
So thank you.

2095
02:56:19,647 --> 02:56:20,867
Thank you.

2096
02:56:21,128 --> 02:56:24,169
On the motion that we send this to the superintendent.

2097
02:56:24,189 --> 02:56:29,811
Mr. President, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of this body.

2098
02:56:29,991 --> 02:56:35,173
Last Tuesday night, along with myself and other taxpayers who came up before this podium,

2099
02:56:35,678 --> 02:56:54,228
The resolution that was introduced by Councilor Langel-Kern found itself in a libelous rebuttal by our superintendent, Mr. Belson, where he not only attacked Councilor Langel-Kern, Councilor Marks, myself, and resident citizens who came before this podium to express their freedom of speech rights,

2100
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:58,183
as it relates to what's going on at Medford High School regarding a bomb threat.

2101
02:56:58,724 --> 02:57:08,153
As Councilor Lungo-Kern just alluded to, when a bomb threat takes place between 8 and 9 in the morning and parents aren't told until around 6 o'clock at night, that's an 8 to 9 hour spread.

2102
02:57:08,673 --> 02:57:10,955
The lack of communication was huge there.

2103
02:57:11,576 --> 02:57:13,858
And we were led to believe that protocols were in place.

2104
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:17,081
And I think it was you, Councilor Scalpelli, along with Councilor Falco,

2105
02:57:17,421 --> 02:57:24,524
who indicated that you worked on a protocol procedure, and you were going to check it out the next night to make sure and to ensure the protocol was kept.

2106
02:57:25,004 --> 02:57:31,006
Now we're finding out that something is being manufactured, and it'll be ready sometime in March as it relates to what's going on.

2107
02:57:31,807 --> 02:57:41,911
The interesting part about that, in his libelous commentary that he wrote, he indicated that we were instilling fear within this community because we were here talking about this bomb that took place.

2108
02:57:42,411 --> 02:57:45,552
And I think it was Mr. Candy, in his comment in return,

2109
02:57:46,013 --> 02:57:50,596
for which he's re-quoted, he stated, you create fear when you don't inform the people.

2110
02:57:51,036 --> 02:57:51,797
And that's what happened.

2111
02:57:51,817 --> 02:57:54,339
They didn't get informed for almost eight to nine hours.

2112
02:57:55,059 --> 02:57:56,000
There wasn't a lockdown.

2113
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:56,680
There was nothing.

2114
02:57:57,101 --> 02:58:04,926
No student, no teacher knew that there was a bomb threat that took place in that school, whether it was high level, low level, or big level, for whatever it might be.

2115
02:58:07,067 --> 02:58:09,969
You know, the same situation took place at Everett last week.

2116
02:58:10,770 --> 02:58:13,872
And the same problem existed, a lack of communication,

2117
02:58:14,248 --> 02:58:16,648
between the school administration to the parents.

2118
02:58:17,569 --> 02:58:21,869
And because of that, you just can't do that.

2119
02:58:22,730 --> 02:58:29,011
The superintendent should not be the sole provider of alleging that he can take care of the kids in that school.

2120
02:58:29,911 --> 02:58:33,372
You can't relay that commentary back to every single parent in that school.

2121
02:58:34,512 --> 02:58:36,052
That's not right, it's not fair.

2122
02:58:36,072 --> 02:58:40,713
If it was his kids or your children, it'd be a different story.

2123
02:58:42,044 --> 02:58:52,128
And the irony to this whole classic event was on the next night, up at the high school, in the library, a meeting on safety at Medford High School.

2124
02:58:53,789 --> 02:59:03,633
Well, if anyone went up there, you could walk into the building, no security guard, you could walk down the corridor to the library, no security guard, walk into the library.

2125
02:59:05,214 --> 02:59:07,135
What do you see, a police officer inside the library?

2126
02:59:07,468 --> 02:59:09,991
but no one at the front door, and nobody in the hallway.

2127
02:59:10,191 --> 02:59:15,536
And it's just as Councilor Marks alluded to, anybody could have walked into that building, put anything in that building at any time.

2128
02:59:15,816 --> 02:59:17,899
That's not instilling fear, that's the facts.

2129
02:59:18,179 --> 02:59:21,002
That's the hot, cold facts of what we're talking about.

2130
02:59:21,222 --> 02:59:24,125
And when you cut 80% of your security budget in the school department,

2131
02:59:24,685 --> 02:59:26,948
Over the past five or six years, that's what you get.

2132
02:59:27,468 --> 02:59:28,749
An insecure situation.

2133
02:59:29,030 --> 02:59:30,311
That's not instilling fear.

2134
02:59:30,611 --> 02:59:34,955
That's telling you you need to get your act together and protect those children up at that school.

2135
02:59:35,155 --> 02:59:36,196
Because that's what it's all about.

2136
02:59:36,236 --> 02:59:39,980
That's their responsibility as a school committee and as a superintendent.

2137
02:59:41,373 --> 02:59:43,455
That's a damn shame that that even took place.

2138
02:59:44,116 --> 02:59:51,064
And it's a shame that you're now hearing that you're going to get something that Councilor Alongo-Kern has alluded to, you want a copy of it when it comes out.

2139
02:59:51,685 --> 02:59:54,829
So apparently there wasn't any problem, I mean, any protocol.

2140
02:59:55,269 --> 02:59:57,512
There wasn't any management technique to take place.

2141
02:59:58,874 --> 03:00:00,856
And as of yesterday, from what I understand,

2142
03:00:01,232 --> 03:00:09,194
from speaking to some of the students and a few of the teachers, they still weren't aware until many days after the fact that a bomb threat had taken place in that building.

2143
03:00:09,794 --> 03:00:12,575
That is absolutely not fair and not right.

2144
03:00:13,295 --> 03:00:14,116
Absolutely not.

2145
03:00:14,296 --> 03:00:22,418
And I think it needs to be understood what a lockdown is as compared to what an evacuation is, as compared to a low level, a high level, and what a risk might be.

2146
03:00:23,278 --> 03:00:25,859
A teacher's not going to be Houdini to try to figure this out.

2147
03:00:26,019 --> 03:00:29,940
And apparently, a parent isn't, especially if they're not even notified.

2148
03:00:31,020 --> 03:00:54,037
Yes, I will stand here and I say I resent the libelous comment made by the superintendent of schools who said because I came up here, and you, Councilor Lungo-Kern, and you, Councilor Marks, and you, the citizens of this city, came up here to talk about a most egregious situation that's taking place in our city, and that's a lack of public safety and the communication to a parent if, in fact, public safety is challenged.

2149
03:00:54,617 --> 03:01:03,322
You, Mr. Superintendent, you should be ashamed of yourself for writing that commentary and you should probably resign because of what you said and what you wrote.

2150
03:01:04,043 --> 03:01:04,983
How dare you?

2151
03:01:05,263 --> 03:01:14,349
How dare you insinuate that anyone who comes for a podium and expresses their opinion is causing fear when in fact they were representing facts.

2152
03:01:14,869 --> 03:01:16,110
F-A-C-T-S.

2153
03:01:16,470 --> 03:01:19,672
Facts that took place under your watch, Mr. Superintendent.

2154
03:01:20,653 --> 03:01:23,154
Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me to make my comment.

2155
03:01:23,805 --> 03:01:26,106
Thank you.

2156
03:01:26,787 --> 03:01:39,133
Just to be clear, Mr. President, the, the comment that was made was to get the information that was going to be presented the following evening to see what protocol was put in place.

2157
03:01:39,754 --> 03:01:51,000
Now there was protocol in place that as a school team member, we reviewed, but at the time where the comment was mentioned, not talking to the superintendent will understand the protocol they followed.

2158
03:01:51,320 --> 03:01:52,821
We wouldn't know that to the following evening.

2159
03:01:52,861 --> 03:01:53,061
That's,

2160
03:01:53,491 --> 03:01:57,394
That's what I believe my fellow councilors, Mr. Falcon and myself, were alluding to.

2161
03:01:58,495 --> 03:01:58,856
Thank you.

2162
03:01:59,056 --> 03:01:59,336
Thank you.

2163
03:01:59,356 --> 03:02:02,759
Name and address of the record.

2164
03:02:03,219 --> 03:02:04,300
Thank you, Mr. President.

2165
03:02:04,641 --> 03:02:06,802
Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

2166
03:02:08,264 --> 03:02:11,026
Thank you, Councilor Longo Kern, for bringing this up.

2167
03:02:11,586 --> 03:02:18,873
And I have to second and echo the sentiments of the previous speaker, Mr. Robert Penter.

2168
03:02:22,530 --> 03:02:45,542
public official that's appointed to be getting the kind of money he's making a year on taxpayer dollars, to put out a letter like that that accuses, by name, private citizens of using inflammatory speech, was, I think, the exact word that he used, it's reprehensible.

2169
03:02:45,882 --> 03:02:50,925
We're talking earlier about the Charter Review and getting signatures and having an open podium.

2170
03:02:52,277 --> 03:02:53,878
This is all part of a free country.

2171
03:02:54,358 --> 03:03:06,205
Using words like that from the superintendent of schools of all people against private citizens, talking about instilling fear, that might scare people away from this podium, which might be the objective.

2172
03:03:06,566 --> 03:03:08,487
I'm not saying it is, but it might be.

2173
03:03:08,987 --> 03:03:10,168
And that's unconscionable.

2174
03:03:10,508 --> 03:03:14,130
That, to me, instills a lot of passion.

2175
03:03:14,930 --> 03:03:16,091
We live in a free country.

2176
03:03:16,151 --> 03:03:17,412
It comes with responsibility.

2177
03:03:17,765 --> 03:03:22,467
can't run in here and scream fire and not have consequences of that.

2178
03:03:22,707 --> 03:03:38,472
But this city council last Tuesday night had a very good resolution brought forth that was excellent for this forum, since it's this city council that decides the budget for the protocols to be made by the superintendent and the school committee.

2179
03:03:39,400 --> 03:03:49,945
I am beside myself when I comprehend this letter put out by the superintendent of schools that would frighten people away from this podium.

2180
03:03:50,185 --> 03:03:51,726
That's not what this country is all about.

2181
03:03:52,146 --> 03:03:57,329
And he really should either consider retiring or the mayor should consider replacing them.

2182
03:03:59,229 --> 03:04:08,834
Because this, I think, is something that could be the grounds for a recall vote of the administration if action isn't taken.

2183
03:04:09,418 --> 03:04:10,079
on this letter.

2184
03:04:10,739 --> 03:04:16,423
I wish he would apologize to the citizens he named specifically and to the citizens of Medford.

2185
03:04:16,483 --> 03:04:17,464
Thank you, Mr. President.

2186
03:04:19,946 --> 03:04:20,946
Name and address of the record, sir.

2187
03:04:21,207 --> 03:04:21,747
Good evening.

2188
03:04:21,787 --> 03:04:23,468
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

2189
03:04:25,350 --> 03:04:27,351
Superintendent named me in the letter.

2190
03:04:28,072 --> 03:04:31,374
I didn't realize I had the power of a mayor or a city council or a school committee person.

2191
03:04:31,394 --> 03:04:32,615
I didn't realize I was that big in this.

2192
03:04:32,815 --> 03:04:38,519
I thought I was just a little guy, but Superintendent Belson, I went to the school that evening.

2193
03:04:39,028 --> 03:04:41,892
And there's a woman behind me, and I turned to her and I said, do you see security?

2194
03:04:41,952 --> 03:04:44,396
And she was in a rage over no security.

2195
03:04:44,777 --> 03:04:51,206
So I took out the iPhone and I have security desk, and you can see it up on YouTube, empty, empty.

2196
03:04:51,547 --> 03:04:52,408
Counselor Penta's right.

2197
03:04:53,592 --> 03:04:57,754
The one policeman there was Chief Sacco, and he was busy, engaged in the conversation.

2198
03:04:58,094 --> 03:05:00,475
So he wasn't in a position to help us.

2199
03:05:01,255 --> 03:05:04,577
We had a police officer sitting there with Roy Bellson, our mayor.

2200
03:05:04,837 --> 03:05:06,398
I was waiting to hear from our mayor.

2201
03:05:06,418 --> 03:05:07,038
She said nothing.

2202
03:05:07,438 --> 03:05:10,099
The new PR person, I didn't hear much.

2203
03:05:11,320 --> 03:05:13,121
Paulette van der Kloot did speak.

2204
03:05:13,901 --> 03:05:15,042
Thank you, Paulette van der Kloot.

2205
03:05:15,062 --> 03:05:15,602
That was good.

2206
03:05:16,522 --> 03:05:17,783
We need communication.

2207
03:05:18,643 --> 03:05:19,584
So I took videos.

2208
03:05:20,624 --> 03:05:20,944
I left.

2209
03:05:23,652 --> 03:05:34,538
What boggled my mind was that last Tuesday night, when we were almost censored, there were three officers of the law on the second floor of Medford City Hall, three officers of the law who didn't need to be there.

2210
03:05:34,838 --> 03:05:40,781
And then the next night, we talk about a bomb threat, but there was no security and no police officers.

2211
03:05:41,702 --> 03:05:47,325
There were people walking around, and I won't out anyone, but I asked, I said, where's the security?

2212
03:05:47,365 --> 03:05:48,265
And they laughed.

2213
03:05:48,846 --> 03:05:51,327
They laughed a condescending laugh, which I'm sure

2214
03:05:51,924 --> 03:05:58,149
Superintendent, it was aimed at you because there was no security and your own employees laughed when I brought it up.

2215
03:05:58,649 --> 03:05:59,550
This is disgraceful.

2216
03:05:59,630 --> 03:06:02,052
So, the superintendent wanted to reference me.

2217
03:06:03,654 --> 03:06:07,296
Here's my echoing what Mr. Capucci said.

2218
03:06:07,937 --> 03:06:09,538
Mr. Belson, you're too complacent.

2219
03:06:09,618 --> 03:06:10,279
It's time to go.

2220
03:06:10,999 --> 03:06:11,420
Thank you, sir.

2221
03:06:14,462 --> 03:06:15,263
Name and address of the record.

2222
03:06:15,607 --> 03:06:17,648
Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2223
03:06:18,488 --> 03:06:19,969
I am a parent in the community.

2224
03:06:20,129 --> 03:06:22,850
I've had children in the school for 14 years.

2225
03:06:22,870 --> 03:06:36,455
I've gone through six principals, and I can attest that the notification system, if it does exist, is not known to these principals, because I've had six very different and unique experiences with notification.

2226
03:06:36,475 --> 03:06:38,196
I've been complaining about this for years.

2227
03:06:38,376 --> 03:06:41,717
So I was very excited to see Paul at Vanderclute put this resolution up.

2228
03:06:42,283 --> 03:06:46,726
And I hope that as parents we find out what the system is and it's implemented.

2229
03:06:47,346 --> 03:06:49,447
And maybe our PR person can help craft it.

2230
03:06:50,468 --> 03:06:50,788
Thanks.

2231
03:06:53,169 --> 03:06:59,153
On the motion that we send this to the superintendent for him to follow up and give us his answer by March.

2232
03:06:59,173 --> 03:07:00,494
All in favor?

2233
03:07:01,174 --> 03:07:01,294
Aye.

2234
03:07:01,534 --> 03:07:02,795
Roll call vote when requested.

2235
03:07:19,729 --> 03:07:24,231
Yes, and in the motion of 6-0, one absent, motion passes.

2236
03:07:24,251 --> 03:07:27,832
16-074 offered by Vice President.

2237
03:07:29,612 --> 03:07:35,094
Excuse me?

2238
03:07:35,154 --> 03:07:41,396
I will read the motion, let her read the motion first and then we'll make that motion.

2239
03:07:41,416 --> 03:07:46,538
16-074 offered by Vice President of Council, Vice President Mungo Kern, be it resolved that the Methodist School Committee

2240
03:07:47,002 --> 03:07:57,911
and Memphis City Council to be provided a detailed report as to exactly which security cameras at Memphis High School are broken, along with an update of when they'll be fixed and replaced.

2241
03:07:58,051 --> 03:08:04,676
And I would ask also the same thing, if we could send this, but discuss this in executive session, Madam Vice President.

2242
03:08:06,698 --> 03:08:06,918
OK.

2243
03:08:06,938 --> 03:08:12,843
There's no, nobody's going to tell me right now which cameras are broken.

2244
03:08:12,903 --> 03:08:13,964
So I think it was, um,

2245
03:08:16,513 --> 03:08:23,256
brought up on Wednesday night that 10 to 14 percent of all cameras at the high school are broken.

2246
03:08:23,796 --> 03:08:28,159
I don't know the actual number.

2247
03:08:28,199 --> 03:08:29,739
That's kind of what I'm asking.

2248
03:08:29,799 --> 03:08:40,464
My issue with the whole situation is that there are cameras broken at the high school, and obviously we have the money or the school department has the money to fix it.

2249
03:08:40,544 --> 03:08:43,626
We just hired a public relations

2250
03:08:44,448 --> 03:08:49,231
or actually just implemented a new position, which is a public relations job, for $90,000.

2251
03:08:49,812 --> 03:08:59,518
So if we have money like that to hire and create new jobs, then we obviously have the money somewhere to fix the cameras that are broken.

2252
03:08:59,638 --> 03:09:00,759
I think that's necessary.

2253
03:09:00,959 --> 03:09:02,820
We put the cameras in for a reason.

2254
03:09:04,261 --> 03:09:09,065
If one or two are broken, they should be fixed, never mind 10% to 15% of the cameras being broken.

2255
03:09:16,300 --> 03:09:23,863
We're living in some times where, which is the reason why we put cameras in and around our high school.

2256
03:09:26,924 --> 03:09:36,228
I feel it's almost sad that so many are broken at this day and age.

2257
03:09:36,988 --> 03:09:42,230
So I would ask that we find out exactly how many are broken, if that is the true accurate figure.

2258
03:09:43,088 --> 03:09:45,630
how and when they're going to be fixed or replaced.

2259
03:09:49,652 --> 03:09:49,992
Thank you.

2260
03:09:50,012 --> 03:09:53,274
Mr. President, I want to thank Council Longo current for bringing this up.

2261
03:09:54,014 --> 03:10:03,740
Um, you know, it was mentioned that, uh, security at the high school in the past, I think it's five to eight years has been cut by 80% at one point back in, I think it was 2008.

2262
03:10:04,040 --> 03:10:07,862
Um, there were eight security guards at the high school.

2263
03:10:08,323 --> 03:10:12,245
There's currently one security guy at the high school and part of the reasoning

2264
03:10:12,958 --> 03:10:28,874
that were in committee reports is the fact that with the increase in technology, that the need to have security guards actually physically walking around the building, you know, this technology replaced the physical walking around the building.

2265
03:10:29,454 --> 03:10:31,917
And now what we're seeing is this technology

2266
03:10:32,307 --> 03:10:34,568
which the superintendent stated at the meeting.

2267
03:10:34,928 --> 03:10:35,668
I'm not stating.

2268
03:10:36,008 --> 03:10:44,330
The cameras that are on the outside of the buildings, not just the high school, around all the school buildings are not good in New England weather.

2269
03:10:44,890 --> 03:10:46,450
They're not good for New England weather.

2270
03:10:46,490 --> 03:10:48,471
He said this at an open public meeting.

2271
03:10:49,031 --> 03:10:54,512
So I'm not sure who was responsible for these cameras, but we happen to live in New England.

2272
03:10:55,334 --> 03:10:58,497
And you know, we happen to get snow and rain and wind like we got tonight.

2273
03:10:58,977 --> 03:11:04,482
So I'm not quite sure why these cameras and the numbers that were mentioned were percentages.

2274
03:11:04,982 --> 03:11:14,150
So it was the superintendent of school at a public meeting said 10% of the 144, I think he said 144, 145 cameras currently are not working.

2275
03:11:14,511 --> 03:11:21,897
Then he went on to say another 5% are working, but visually when you replay them, you can't make out what's on the tape.

2276
03:11:22,477 --> 03:11:24,538
So, that's 15 percent right there.

2277
03:11:25,779 --> 03:11:28,760
This was set at an open public meeting, Mr. President.

2278
03:11:28,780 --> 03:11:31,561
So, we're not talking about particulars.

2279
03:11:32,061 --> 03:11:34,382
But, really, that's a concern.

2280
03:11:34,943 --> 03:11:51,850
And it's a larger concern because in the call that I received, because I have two kids that attend the high school, was that 18 hours of tape was poured over to make sure that there was no hanky-panky going on the night before and days before.

2281
03:11:52,511 --> 03:11:54,692
And I would question the tape that they looked at.

2282
03:11:55,173 --> 03:11:58,975
I would question the fact that which cameras were working and weren't working.

2283
03:11:59,235 --> 03:12:02,857
So if you had a camera in the back of the building that wasn't working, they didn't look over that tape.

2284
03:12:02,997 --> 03:12:05,799
That tape just, you know, that didn't matter for security.

2285
03:12:06,119 --> 03:12:12,062
So there really is a concern here, Mr. President, outside of the lack of notification that we talked about.

2286
03:12:12,345 --> 03:12:20,414
It was mentioned the fact that even students, till today, I've asked both my kids, has there been any mention about what took place in the building?

2287
03:12:20,974 --> 03:12:21,975
These are young adults.

2288
03:12:22,656 --> 03:12:27,842
We're talking 15, 16, 17, 18 years old, and you don't tell them what took place in their building?

2289
03:12:28,643 --> 03:12:29,964
Shame on the administration.

2290
03:12:30,465 --> 03:12:31,706
Shame on them, Mr. President.

2291
03:12:32,952 --> 03:12:40,715
And another issue, Mr. President, part of the protocol, there's a number of steps that they can take when something like this happens.

2292
03:12:41,116 --> 03:12:45,597
One of them is a lockdown, one of them is a stand down, and one is evacuation.

2293
03:12:46,298 --> 03:12:53,081
The superintendent chose not to do evacuation, and that was after his insight into the issue.

2294
03:12:53,361 --> 03:12:55,782
He chose not to do a lockdown.

2295
03:12:56,841 --> 03:13:04,706
but he chose to do a stand down, which means students have to remain in their classrooms and they shouldn't be in the hall and they shouldn't be walking around.

2296
03:13:05,366 --> 03:13:13,711
The only problem is with the protocol that took places, the superintendent did not notify teachers that are in the classroom of the stand down.

2297
03:13:14,431 --> 03:13:21,876
So they didn't know that children weren't supposed to be going to the restroom or changing classes or doing whatever they were supposed to be doing, Mr. President.

2298
03:13:22,376 --> 03:13:24,097
So there was clearly,

2299
03:13:25,306 --> 03:13:26,147
A mistake, Mr. President.

2300
03:13:26,167 --> 03:13:27,650
We're talking about cameras at the moment.

2301
03:13:27,930 --> 03:13:29,112
Right, I know we're talking.

2302
03:13:29,132 --> 03:13:31,355
This all has everything to do with what took place.

2303
03:13:31,375 --> 03:13:32,437
We're talking about cameras.

2304
03:13:32,777 --> 03:13:33,759
Right, I know we are.

2305
03:13:35,171 --> 03:13:39,655
So there's clearly a breach in what took place at the high school.

2306
03:13:40,215 --> 03:13:45,259
And rather than come out and say, I would feel more comfortable if the superintendent came out and said, you know what?

2307
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:47,902
There was clearly some notification issues.

2308
03:13:48,222 --> 03:13:49,983
We're going to try to improve upon this.

2309
03:13:50,304 --> 03:13:55,728
But instead, he pointed the blame to people speaking, people speaking up on the issue.

2310
03:13:56,269 --> 03:14:02,574
And I think that's a shame, Mr. President, because he's supposed to be the educational leader of this community, not a politician.

2311
03:14:03,433 --> 03:14:04,574
Yeah, I know we're talking about campus.

2312
03:14:04,594 --> 03:14:05,955
We're talking about campus, Councilman.

2313
03:14:05,975 --> 03:14:06,475
Right, right.

2314
03:14:07,035 --> 03:14:09,017
You're keeping a good chart on what we're talking about.

2315
03:14:09,597 --> 03:14:11,418
And this all has everything to do with it.

2316
03:14:11,838 --> 03:14:16,281
So, you know, I know some of the members of the school committee don't want to hear this, but you know what?

2317
03:14:16,602 --> 03:14:17,862
It is what it is, Mr. President.

2318
03:14:18,323 --> 03:14:18,623
Thank you.

2319
03:14:20,984 --> 03:14:22,906
Vice President, Councilman, Vice President.

2320
03:14:22,966 --> 03:14:24,907
I'll yield to the gentleman.

2321
03:14:26,862 --> 03:14:28,003
I'll never go for the record, please.

2322
03:14:28,263 --> 03:14:32,105
Alex Frankel 9 clearly wrote on the general issue of security at the high school.

2323
03:14:32,145 --> 03:14:37,869
I think we need to stop waiting for bomb threats and things to happen to look over the procedures and protocols that go on.

2324
03:14:38,369 --> 03:14:47,375
It was not long ago where I was in the library and I was sitting next to what I presumed to be a student printing something out and a kid walked up and was like, hey, what are you doing here?

2325
03:14:47,715 --> 03:14:49,196
You graduated three years ago.

2326
03:14:49,756 --> 03:14:52,458
And I at the time, I would never question, you know,

2327
03:14:53,588 --> 03:14:55,169
Why is that not security?

2328
03:14:55,549 --> 03:14:56,450
I wouldn't think about that.

2329
03:14:56,470 --> 03:15:03,474
But now, looking at the bomb threats, looking at what's going on, I think we need to look at more things when it comes to security cameras, when it comes to security guards.

2330
03:15:04,034 --> 03:15:07,036
I can walk in and out of the school at any point in time.

2331
03:15:07,076 --> 03:15:10,138
I've had to leave the school during school to go home and grab a binder.

2332
03:15:10,158 --> 03:15:11,859
I've never been asked, do you have a pass?

2333
03:15:11,939 --> 03:15:12,679
Why are you leaving?

2334
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:17,282
I think there needs to be a bigger overlook at security measures in the high school.

2335
03:15:17,842 --> 03:15:18,203
Thank you.

2336
03:15:21,345 --> 03:15:22,105
Counsel Lungacorn.

2337
03:15:22,675 --> 03:15:23,035
Thank you.

2338
03:15:23,355 --> 03:15:24,236
Gina, one second.

2339
03:15:24,716 --> 03:15:34,741
On that note, I'd actually like to amend this and ask that the school committee look into, it's been brought to my attention, the doors are not locked at the high school.

2340
03:15:34,821 --> 03:15:48,087
So I'd ask the school committee to review security as a whole, not only just the cameras, but the doors being locked and entrance to the building, that there is, we do beef up more security.

2341
03:15:49,417 --> 03:15:49,978
at the building.

2342
03:15:50,018 --> 03:15:51,519
I think that's extremely important.

2343
03:15:51,919 --> 03:15:53,641
You hear students speaking out on that.

2344
03:15:54,021 --> 03:15:55,522
Parents have brought that up to me.

2345
03:15:56,203 --> 03:16:06,431
It was brought up last week that right even after the bomb threat, I think the gentleman who stands at the entrance of the high school kind of was walked around, maybe went to the bathroom.

2346
03:16:07,032 --> 03:16:11,836
So there definitely needs to, I know the Roberts School, that's the school I deal with because my child goes there.

2347
03:16:12,237 --> 03:16:20,161
That's locked, you need to ring the bell to get in, and you have somebody sitting right at the entrance to ask what are you there for, where are you going, and to sign in.

2348
03:16:20,541 --> 03:16:27,225
So I think we need more security measures at the high school before something terrible happens.

2349
03:16:30,066 --> 03:16:30,446
Thank you.

2350
03:16:31,007 --> 03:16:31,667
Move the question?

2351
03:16:31,707 --> 03:16:31,927
Sorry.

2352
03:16:34,892 --> 03:16:35,813
Name and address for the record, please.

2353
03:16:36,253 --> 03:16:37,094
Gene Martin, thank you.

2354
03:16:37,514 --> 03:16:38,315
10 Cummings Street.

2355
03:16:38,475 --> 03:16:47,762
And I just wanted to say this is a public safety issue, so it is under the purview of the City Council, because it's about a public building and what goes on in a public building as far as safety.

2356
03:16:48,162 --> 03:16:49,644
And that involves the police department.

2357
03:16:49,684 --> 03:16:51,625
That also involves your oversight.

2358
03:16:52,366 --> 03:16:57,690
You are—I do agree that there are certain things that the City Council should not

2359
03:16:58,190 --> 03:17:08,558
have purview over when it comes to what qualifies to become a teacher, what degrees or credentials an aide in a classroom needs to have.

2360
03:17:08,959 --> 03:17:10,420
That's absolutely within the purview.

2361
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:11,321
Gene, we're talking about cameras.

2362
03:17:11,581 --> 03:17:12,302
Right.

2363
03:17:13,022 --> 03:17:13,402
Thank you.

2364
03:17:13,723 --> 03:17:15,024
Thank you for getting me back on track.

2365
03:17:15,304 --> 03:17:17,586
But it is important to point out that this is a public.

2366
03:17:18,006 --> 03:17:20,168
Now, that said, Mr. Knight is right.

2367
03:17:20,208 --> 03:17:24,491
I do not need to know, nor should I know, where all the cameras are.

2368
03:17:24,712 --> 03:17:25,192
That is correct.

2369
03:17:25,973 --> 03:17:27,034
That is where we agree.

2370
03:17:28,067 --> 03:17:51,285
Um, but it goes back to the point of money and maintenance and the same old, same old of what used to happen under the old administration, which is that maintenance is never kept up on any building and public safety inside the public school system is part of the maintenance plan that needs to be, you know, um,

2371
03:17:51,805 --> 03:17:54,648
put forward in the new year, in the new administration.

2372
03:17:55,128 --> 03:18:03,655
And then when that falls through the cracks, somebody needs to be held accountable for why is it that 15 or 20 or 25 percent of all the cameras have not been updated.

2373
03:18:04,116 --> 03:18:05,317
Who's going to be in charge of that?

2374
03:18:05,965 --> 03:18:08,307
and who's going to be held accountable for that.

2375
03:18:08,868 --> 03:18:11,470
And it needs to happen because it is a public safety issue.

2376
03:18:11,851 --> 03:18:27,465
And what happens in today, today's world with bullying, you could catch it on camera, but if you can't figure out who's bullying who, who's attacking who, or who's graffitiing on a wall locker, it could be minor stuff like that, or it could be, you know, letting a guy in or a girl in.

2377
03:18:27,925 --> 03:18:30,367
to set a bomb, because that's the world we live in.

2378
03:18:31,028 --> 03:18:35,712
So we do need to have those, because that does save manpower, or woman power.

2379
03:18:36,272 --> 03:18:40,235
It saves human resources, the cameras do.

2380
03:18:40,796 --> 03:18:42,137
So I brought it back to the cameras.

2381
03:18:42,157 --> 03:18:43,358
Thank you for keeping me on track.

2382
03:18:43,578 --> 03:18:43,899
Thank you.

2383
03:18:44,099 --> 03:18:44,399
Thank you.

2384
03:18:44,519 --> 03:18:44,859
Thank you.

2385
03:18:45,360 --> 03:18:47,582
Move the question as amended by Councilor Langevin.

2386
03:18:49,303 --> 03:18:50,204
Roll call has been requested.

2387
03:19:05,712 --> 03:19:05,932
Yes.

2388
03:19:09,214 --> 03:19:12,176
And motion 5 to 1, one absent, one motion passes.

2389
03:19:12,196 --> 03:19:20,602
4-2, motion passes.

2390
03:19:20,622 --> 03:19:34,030
16-075 offered by Vice President Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis School Committee and the Memphis City Council be given the list of names and occupations of the 12 people who did the sweep after the bomb threat call came in on Friday, February 1st, 2016.

2391
03:19:35,448 --> 03:19:45,397
be it further resolved that we be provided that the training that those 12 people had to do such a sweep, especially the custodians who were asked to, who were asked and allowed to take part.

2392
03:19:46,097 --> 03:19:46,698
Counselor Longo.

2393
03:19:48,861 --> 03:19:50,843
Thank you, President Carviello.

2394
03:19:51,603 --> 03:19:53,184
Point of privilege, Counselor Knight.

2395
03:19:53,485 --> 03:19:57,068
A question as to whether or not this matter will be more appropriately heard in executive session.

2396
03:19:57,748 --> 03:20:11,019
Rule number four of the top ten reasons to go into executive session, as published by the Attorney General, would indicate that to discuss the deployment of security personnel, devices, or strategies with respect thereto would be an appropriate reason to go into executive session, Mr. President.

2397
03:20:12,700 --> 03:20:15,342
I don't feel as though it's appropriate to air out the business of what training

2398
03:20:15,729 --> 03:20:19,251
and what people are going to be conducting public safety sweeps in our schools.

2399
03:20:19,451 --> 03:20:20,511
All it does is make them a target.

2400
03:20:21,572 --> 03:20:23,273
When we get that information, it will be a public record.

2401
03:20:23,293 --> 03:20:25,193
It will be forwarded to this council in writing.

2402
03:20:25,213 --> 03:20:30,036
So as such, I feel as though it would be more appropriate to have this discussion in the executive session.

2403
03:20:30,756 --> 03:20:33,397
However, I would rely on the body to make a determination, Mr. President.

2404
03:20:33,757 --> 03:20:35,958
Second.

2405
03:20:35,978 --> 03:20:36,519
Councilor Lockhart.

2406
03:20:36,759 --> 03:20:38,039
Thank you, President Carvalho.

2407
03:20:38,099 --> 03:20:39,620
Same with the last resolution.

2408
03:20:39,660 --> 03:20:42,882
I don't have the names of the people that did the sweep.

2409
03:20:45,311 --> 03:20:47,012
I have no idea about what the training is.

2410
03:20:47,052 --> 03:20:49,974
The resolution's purpose is to ask what that training is.

2411
03:20:51,195 --> 03:20:56,239
So I would like to move forward with just discussing it to get the answers.

2412
03:20:56,339 --> 03:21:02,363
And if we happen to get the answers, then maybe at that point we get the answers in executive session and keep names private.

2413
03:21:02,383 --> 03:21:05,485
It has nothing to do with the names in general.

2414
03:21:05,966 --> 03:21:10,569
It has to do with, I think, something that was discussed on Wednesday.

2415
03:21:10,649 --> 03:21:14,932
The superintendent of schools, actually, I believe it was Dr. Perella from

2416
03:21:15,598 --> 03:21:20,600
my recollection stated that there was custodians involved in a sweep.

2417
03:21:21,440 --> 03:21:43,268
And I just found that, number one, do they have the training would be my first question, because I maybe understand if they were entering the building or staying in the building with trained police officers or with a canine to maybe look and see if there's any suspicious packaging or any type of something being out of place.

2418
03:21:44,103 --> 03:21:50,546
From what I understand, I believe the custodians were the main personnel that did the sweep.

2419
03:21:50,646 --> 03:21:53,267
So I guess my question is, who did the sweep?

2420
03:21:53,327 --> 03:21:54,868
Because I've got calls from teachers.

2421
03:21:54,968 --> 03:21:56,268
I've got calls from staff.

2422
03:21:56,728 --> 03:22:06,573
I've got calls from parents of students who said they did not see a fire truck, a police car, a police officer at all in the building.

2423
03:22:08,122 --> 03:22:10,443
Nobody went in classrooms.

2424
03:22:10,803 --> 03:22:12,024
Nobody went in offices.

2425
03:22:12,904 --> 03:22:16,126
So really, what was swept and how was it swept?

2426
03:22:16,326 --> 03:22:27,151
Because it sounds like one person made the decision of what to do, and we were left with custodians doing sweeps of, you know, if it was a no level, maybe.

2427
03:22:27,531 --> 03:22:30,392
We're talking low level bomb threat.

2428
03:22:30,672 --> 03:22:33,734
This means possible, whether it's 1% or 2%.

2429
03:22:34,034 --> 03:22:36,755
That's too much of a percent when you have

2430
03:22:37,215 --> 03:22:40,877
hundreds of students and staff members and teachers in the building.

2431
03:22:41,457 --> 03:22:47,220
So I really have a concern with custodians doing the sweep and really how swept this was.

2432
03:22:47,780 --> 03:23:02,088
You had Falmouth, backpacks were checked, police were brought in, dogs were brought in, Mashpee was evacuated, police were brought in, Bourne had a bomb threat, swept by police and canines, Arlington Catholic was evacuated after a bomb threat, St.

2433
03:23:02,228 --> 03:23:05,970
Agnes, BC High, bomb squad called to the scene.

2434
03:23:08,259 --> 03:23:15,244
You know, with this happening around us, and Medford's having sweeps with our custodians, is that enough?

2435
03:23:15,344 --> 03:23:16,846
I question, is it enough?

2436
03:23:17,326 --> 03:23:29,275
And I respectfully ask our school committee, who is on the issue, I know they're on the issue, they had the meeting on Wednesday, they've passed resolves, and I know the discussion for them is not over.

2437
03:23:29,635 --> 03:23:37,942
So I respectfully ask, and parents are respectfully asking me, I've gotten calls and updates about what went on on Wednesday, even though, you know,

2438
03:23:38,634 --> 03:23:42,275
kind of looked into it myself, and people are disturbed.

2439
03:23:43,776 --> 03:23:46,676
Parents are disturbed, and they want answers.

2440
03:23:47,176 --> 03:23:51,018
They don't want to just say, we should have done things differently.

2441
03:23:51,318 --> 03:23:52,158
They want answers.

2442
03:23:52,218 --> 03:23:53,718
How is it going to be done next time?

2443
03:23:53,758 --> 03:23:57,700
Not just this type of situation, but how are we going to handle emergencies?

2444
03:23:57,820 --> 03:23:59,380
How are we going to handle notification?

2445
03:23:59,720 --> 03:24:02,221
How are we going to handle sweeps if we have to do it again?

2446
03:24:02,241 --> 03:24:06,162
I understand it's a robocall, and a number of cities and towns are getting it.

2447
03:24:06,404 --> 03:24:08,065
But we need to take it seriously.

2448
03:24:08,245 --> 03:24:15,887
It sounds like it was, from the beginning, right after the call, it was evaluated as a hoax.

2449
03:24:17,067 --> 03:24:25,090
Well, obviously, we now know it was a hoax, but we need to do more to keep our community safe.

2450
03:24:27,851 --> 03:24:28,131
Thank you.

2451
03:24:28,211 --> 03:24:29,451
Councilor Marks.

2452
03:24:29,491 --> 03:24:30,271
Thank you, Mr. President.

2453
03:24:30,291 --> 03:24:32,652
I want to thank Councilor Wango Kern for bringing this up.

2454
03:24:36,974 --> 03:24:49,003
in their Monday night school committee meeting, I think it was on February 1st, also had passed out a copy of the Massachusetts Bomb Threat Response Guidance.

2455
03:24:49,924 --> 03:24:51,725
And this is guidance.

2456
03:24:51,906 --> 03:25:04,896
It's a one-page, front and back, that's approved by the Fire Chiefs Association of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Police Chief Association, Massachusetts Major City Chiefs, and Mass.

2457
03:25:04,976 --> 03:25:06,657
Association of School Superintendents.

2458
03:25:07,526 --> 03:25:15,653
And it goes on to go through the planning and preparation, threat assessments, low risk, medium risk.

2459
03:25:16,353 --> 03:25:22,759
It goes on to tell you the difference between shelter in place, evacuation, the decision tree.

2460
03:25:23,519 --> 03:25:29,884
And it also, Mr. President, mentions searching the building, all risk levels.

2461
03:25:30,065 --> 03:25:31,566
So this would include our risk level.

2462
03:25:32,587 --> 03:25:34,108
And I find it telling that

2463
03:25:34,498 --> 03:25:43,525
This is what the superintendent passed out, and it says, search team should include police, fire, and school officials.

2464
03:25:45,767 --> 03:25:55,755
Now, I'm not sure if custodians are considered school officials, but I would think that is headmasters, superintendents, principals, and not custodians, Mr. President.

2465
03:25:56,578 --> 03:26:04,419
Here's another example of the administration not even following the protocol that's lined out in the literature that they're sending.

2466
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:12,101
And secondly, I had a discussion with the chief of the custodians.

2467
03:26:13,161 --> 03:26:19,822
And I asked him, I said, how do you get custodians or union members to go around looking for bombs?

2468
03:26:21,082 --> 03:26:24,763
I mean, last I checked on a job description,

2469
03:26:25,375 --> 03:26:35,900
empty barrels, they clean floors, they may do other stuff in the building, but bomb detection is not one of the requirements under their skill level.

2470
03:26:36,460 --> 03:26:38,161
So I'm not quite sure how that happens.

2471
03:26:38,641 --> 03:26:41,662
And then I was told that it's voluntary.

2472
03:26:42,222 --> 03:26:45,704
So they asked the custodians, who wants a volunteer to go look for bombs?

2473
03:26:46,844 --> 03:26:52,447
And I guess, you know, it's by a raising of the hand, who wants to go look for bombs?

2474
03:26:53,252 --> 03:27:00,454
Also, it mentions in here that bomb-sniffing dogs are available to the city.

2475
03:27:01,274 --> 03:27:07,856
And the superintendent, at an open public meeting, stated that bomb-sniffing dogs are available.

2476
03:27:08,216 --> 03:27:17,419
However, after 20 minutes, their nose becomes insensitized, and it's such a large building that they become rendered useless.

2477
03:27:18,399 --> 03:27:23,041
So apparently our custodians have a better nose for bomb sniffing than bomb sniffing dogs.

2478
03:27:24,201 --> 03:27:26,282
So I question that judgment too.

2479
03:27:26,642 --> 03:27:44,289
If we're part of NMLAC, which is a seven or eight member city wide enforcement agency that supplements like bombs and other things that may go on in the community that we don't have access to immediately.

2480
03:27:45,343 --> 03:27:51,846
I question the reason why bomb-sniffing dogs were not brought in, Mr. President.

2481
03:27:53,947 --> 03:27:55,948
This is definitely not a laughing matter.

2482
03:27:56,248 --> 03:28:02,330
This is an important matter of safety in our community, and anyone who thinks otherwise should have their head examined.

2483
03:28:09,592 --> 03:28:14,456
Are we going with the executive session discussion?

2484
03:28:14,476 --> 03:28:15,157
Executive session.

2485
03:28:15,217 --> 03:28:15,397
Okay.

2486
03:28:15,417 --> 03:28:15,737
Thank you.

2487
03:28:15,777 --> 03:28:16,258
Thank you.

2488
03:28:16,338 --> 03:28:18,139
On the motion.

2489
03:28:18,319 --> 03:28:19,140
It was as well.

2490
03:28:19,160 --> 03:28:19,941
Roll call, please.

2491
03:28:54,315 --> 03:28:54,515
Yes.

2492
03:28:55,635 --> 03:28:57,896
Motion of 4-2.

2493
03:28:57,956 --> 03:28:59,197
Motion passes with one absence.

2494
03:29:03,618 --> 03:29:04,698
Motion is in the hands of the clerk.

2495
03:29:05,559 --> 03:29:16,822
Be it resolved that the administration provide, I'm sorry, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the administration provide an update regarding Council Resolve 15-356 and 15-686 requesting a crosswalk on Forest Street

2496
03:29:23,357 --> 03:29:24,497
between King and Cedar.

2497
03:29:25,318 --> 03:29:25,878
Councilor Knight.

2498
03:29:27,778 --> 03:29:29,079
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2499
03:29:30,539 --> 03:29:49,025
Following the hails of the grand opening of the beautiful McNally Park, this council unanimously approved a request to the administration to install a traffic signal and crosswalk somewhere in the vicinity of Cedar Road and King Street crossing Forest Street so that individuals that would like to go to this new park that we just spent millions of dollars on were able to do so safely.

2500
03:29:50,461 --> 03:29:52,042
We didn't get a response from the administration.

2501
03:29:52,062 --> 03:29:53,262
We put another paper forward.

2502
03:29:53,803 --> 03:29:55,423
That paper is also cited in the resolution.

2503
03:29:56,204 --> 03:29:58,245
And I'm looking for a follow-up.

2504
03:29:58,465 --> 03:30:03,027
I don't see any crosswalk there, and I'm wondering if there are any plans to do it in the springtime, Mr. President.

2505
03:30:03,287 --> 03:30:04,508
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

2506
03:30:04,548 --> 03:30:11,251
If we could send that to the DBW for an answer.

2507
03:30:11,612 --> 03:30:12,312
All those in favor?

2508
03:30:13,833 --> 03:30:14,353
Motion passes.

2509
03:30:16,178 --> 03:30:29,888
Offered by Council of Ninth, be it resolved that the administration provide an update regarding Council Paper 15-523 regarding the probate status of 56 Boynton Road.

2510
03:30:30,268 --> 03:30:30,869
Council of Ninth.

2511
03:30:31,818 --> 03:30:34,019
Yes, Mr. President, this is an important neighborhood issue.

2512
03:30:34,039 --> 03:30:41,822
A number of residents came down and spoke out against the property at 56 Boynton Road, which is an abandoned and condemned property, Mr. President.

2513
03:30:41,862 --> 03:30:46,424
It's my understanding that the matter was going through probate court, probate litigation.

2514
03:30:46,524 --> 03:30:48,925
However, it seems like it's taking an inordinate amount of time.

2515
03:30:49,382 --> 03:30:51,223
for us to come to a resolve on this.

2516
03:30:51,323 --> 03:30:52,804
The building is a public nuisance.

2517
03:30:52,864 --> 03:30:54,744
The building is an eyesore in the neighborhood.

2518
03:30:55,845 --> 03:30:59,507
It is a calling card for animals of all types.

2519
03:30:59,967 --> 03:31:05,069
And it's my hope that we can get an update on this, Mr. President, because I think it's time that we need to move and take action.

2520
03:31:08,471 --> 03:31:09,051
Move approval.

2521
03:31:09,271 --> 03:31:09,591
Thank you.

2522
03:31:11,132 --> 03:31:17,835
Offered by Councilmember Kern, be it resolved that the still leaking roof at Bethel Public Library be discussed.

2523
03:31:21,089 --> 03:31:23,471
Thank you, President Carviello.

2524
03:31:23,491 --> 03:31:25,393
I would just like to bring this up.

2525
03:31:25,433 --> 03:31:27,255
I was in the library today with my daughter.

2526
03:31:28,095 --> 03:31:34,881
And the roof is not only leaking, but it's leaking in multiple spots.

2527
03:31:34,921 --> 03:31:42,208
And there's buckets in the children's section, catching water right almost near the movie section.

2528
03:31:42,388 --> 03:31:46,992
It's so bad that the carpet is, it seemed like the carpet was wet with the bucket.

2529
03:31:49,953 --> 03:31:52,314
I was obviously very frustrated.

2530
03:31:52,594 --> 03:31:54,575
We've discussed this a number of times.

2531
03:31:54,635 --> 03:31:59,797
You know, if you're at home and you hear a drip in your house, you call the roofing company immediately.

2532
03:31:59,817 --> 03:32:03,138
I feel like we've asked the administration to do that.

2533
03:32:03,218 --> 03:32:11,121
I know they were having somebody in to take a look and estimate, but that was probably about three, four weeks ago.

2534
03:32:11,641 --> 03:32:15,983
So I would just like an update, not only ask for an update,

2535
03:32:16,376 --> 03:32:18,016
you know, what the status is with the roof.

2536
03:32:18,056 --> 03:32:21,057
I'm not sure if any of my colleagues know what the status is.

2537
03:32:21,657 --> 03:32:26,438
I tried to talk to Barbara Kerr, but she wasn't in at the time.

2538
03:32:26,458 --> 03:32:28,938
I was right there early in the morning.

2539
03:32:29,558 --> 03:32:31,699
So number one, what's the status of the roof?

2540
03:32:32,099 --> 03:32:38,920
And number two, ask the administration to fix it immediately before it creates more of a problem.

2541
03:32:39,620 --> 03:32:45,301
The snow and slush that we got yesterday was very heavy, obviously, and it's

2542
03:32:45,654 --> 03:32:49,996
creating, I guarantee it's creating even more damage than there was a month ago.

2543
03:32:50,016 --> 03:32:52,397
It's unacceptable.

2544
03:32:52,597 --> 03:32:59,981
I know we discussed short-term and long-term goals for the library, but that library needs a new roof, and it should be done immediately.

2545
03:33:01,582 --> 03:33:03,383
My daughter asked, what is the dripping?

2546
03:33:03,863 --> 03:33:05,364
And I was just embarrassed.

2547
03:33:07,425 --> 03:33:08,605
And it's just unfortunate.

2548
03:33:08,726 --> 03:33:13,688
Motion to send that on to the DPW, the mayor's office for Councilor Knight.

2549
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:18,803
Motion to amend the paper, Mr. President, to request an update on the selection process of a new library director.

2550
03:33:20,485 --> 03:33:21,165
We can amend that.

2551
03:33:24,167 --> 03:33:29,091
On the update, if you could put up the- Mr. Boutilier retired.

2552
03:33:29,111 --> 03:33:30,432
There's a vacancy right now.

2553
03:33:30,472 --> 03:33:31,513
The vacancy of the library.

2554
03:33:33,618 --> 03:33:41,042
And for your ratification, I have spoken with the mayor about bringing the library building commission to MedFed, and she is in favor of it.

2555
03:33:41,062 --> 03:33:50,626
And we're in the process of trying to set up something in the next couple weeks to bring to the MedFed to hopefully get some money for the library, which is available through the state.

2556
03:33:52,427 --> 03:33:56,809
I think that's great, and I think the library needs rehab.

2557
03:33:56,829 --> 03:34:02,292
I mean, I'm usually just in the children's section, maybe some romantic novels, just to clear my head at night.

2558
03:34:03,657 --> 03:34:08,141
In the children's section, I mean, there's chairs, they're ripping, they're falling apart.

2559
03:34:08,161 --> 03:34:13,666
I mean, we just need a revamp from chairs, tables, rugs.

2560
03:34:13,966 --> 03:34:18,970
I mean, whether we gut it, whether we add a second floor, we need to have a plan.

2561
03:34:19,431 --> 03:34:23,074
I'm begging the administration to let us know what her plan is.

2562
03:34:23,094 --> 03:34:26,477
I would actually maybe amend this to have a committee of the whole meeting.

2563
03:34:26,853 --> 03:34:30,295
to invite the mayor to discuss it so we know where we're going forward.

2564
03:34:30,315 --> 03:34:36,338
I think the roof needs to be done before our committee of the whole because next week, obviously, is going to be about charter review.

2565
03:34:36,918 --> 03:34:38,499
But that roof needs to be done.

2566
03:34:38,739 --> 03:34:42,181
And we cannot wait for any other outside funding, state funding.

2567
03:34:42,261 --> 03:34:49,725
That roof needs to be fixed before the roof comes crashing down and we ruin the whole children's section, or even possibly more.

2568
03:34:50,420 --> 03:34:54,184
So I know one of us should advocate for this every week.

2569
03:34:54,204 --> 03:34:55,705
We should bring it up every week.

2570
03:34:55,785 --> 03:34:58,808
I mean, it should be brought up every day with a leaky roof.

2571
03:34:59,468 --> 03:35:00,089
Unbelievable.

2572
03:35:00,709 --> 03:35:01,050
Thank you.

2573
03:35:01,230 --> 03:35:03,832
If we could send that to the mayor for her immediate attention, Mr. Clark.

2574
03:35:07,836 --> 03:35:08,957
Roll call has been requested.

2575
03:35:08,977 --> 03:35:11,119
As amended.

2576
03:35:24,515 --> 03:35:27,116
Yes, a motion of six in the affirmative, one absent.

2577
03:35:27,196 --> 03:35:27,896
Motion passes.

2578
03:35:28,736 --> 03:35:35,577
Offered by Councilor Scott Petty, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send condolences to the family of Fortunata Puccio.

2579
03:35:35,637 --> 03:35:40,938
Mrs. Puccio raised her four children, Anthony, Lorenzo, Maria, and Danny here in Medford.

2580
03:35:42,158 --> 03:35:42,919
Councilor Scott Petty.

2581
03:35:46,379 --> 03:35:47,680
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

2582
03:35:47,700 --> 03:35:48,220
Mr. Puccio.

2583
03:35:50,698 --> 03:35:52,259
A very strong Meffitt family.

2584
03:35:52,539 --> 03:35:53,640
I grew up on the Felsway.

2585
03:35:57,343 --> 03:35:58,184
Went to school with them.

2586
03:35:59,185 --> 03:36:07,171
Their parents are great people and I know they're hurting immensely today, so I just wanted to send the condolences from our body to their family.

2587
03:36:07,191 --> 03:36:08,392
If we could stand for a moment of silence.

2588
03:36:20,145 --> 03:36:20,525
Thank you.

2589
03:36:20,926 --> 03:36:21,506
I'll be brief.

2590
03:36:21,546 --> 03:36:26,688
I know it's late, but if we could get an update, maybe the clerk has some answers for us.

2591
03:36:26,728 --> 03:36:33,651
We had a meeting with MassDOT two weeks ago, and we had a number of resolutions that came out of that.

2592
03:36:33,911 --> 03:36:41,354
One, I know that Councilor Scarpelli, too, has been pushing for, is to have a point person in the city looking over the project.

2593
03:36:42,094 --> 03:36:44,875
So I was just wondering if the administration has...

2594
03:36:49,323 --> 03:36:50,144
I thought we had somebody.

2595
03:36:50,584 --> 03:36:50,864
No, I'm.

2596
03:36:51,625 --> 03:36:55,948
I'm afraid still didn't get to one person.

2597
03:36:55,988 --> 03:36:59,350
But I believe Mr. Carroll is still.

2598
03:37:00,211 --> 03:37:03,513
Yeah, the business owners haven't heard anything at that meeting.

2599
03:37:03,573 --> 03:37:10,458
We were told we could always reach out to OCD engineering or the building department.

2600
03:37:10,839 --> 03:37:17,964
But we asked specifically, is there going to be, we need one person to maybe go down once or twice a week, check it out, talk to the businesses.

2601
03:37:18,388 --> 03:37:32,036
have great communication with MassDOT, the council, and all parties involved, because obviously we have a long project ahead of us and a lot of problems that have taken place in the past.

2602
03:37:32,096 --> 03:37:37,399
And we would want to try to move forward on a day-to-day basis, knowing what's going on, when it's going on.

2603
03:37:39,020 --> 03:37:46,744
And we want to have a point person, not only that we can talk to, but that we can say to a business owner, call this person from OCD.

2604
03:37:46,824 --> 03:37:47,725
That's a point person.

2605
03:37:48,277 --> 03:37:52,021
She has direct contact with MassDOT on a daily basis.

2606
03:37:52,101 --> 03:37:53,482
She's walking by the area.

2607
03:37:53,582 --> 03:37:58,267
I mean, we've asked for that a number of times, and I think it's very important.

2608
03:37:58,347 --> 03:38:00,249
This project's going to be another year and a half.

2609
03:38:01,250 --> 03:38:06,395
We need a point person, not just somebody we can call and get a call back.

2610
03:38:06,435 --> 03:38:11,840
We know exactly who to contact to get answers to whatever's going on in the area.

2611
03:38:14,998 --> 03:38:21,460
It has been brought to my attention by the administration, Mr. President, that MassDOT will be putting in a crosswalk.

2612
03:38:21,560 --> 03:38:27,662
I've been led to believe that they were coming down to make a study if that can be done.

2613
03:38:27,742 --> 03:38:29,582
That determination has not been made yet.

2614
03:38:30,502 --> 03:38:33,383
Unless it's been made.

2615
03:38:34,223 --> 03:38:37,044
I've had discussions, but maybe we can get an update from the administration on that.

2616
03:38:37,064 --> 03:38:41,045
If we can get an update on the crosswalk on Main Street.

2617
03:38:48,125 --> 03:38:52,767
All in favor?

2618
03:38:53,668 --> 03:38:54,288
Aye.

2619
03:38:55,048 --> 03:38:56,609
Brickets?

2620
03:38:57,349 --> 03:38:58,270
What change would that be?

2621
03:39:02,472 --> 03:39:11,816
Other than that, you find everything in order?

2622
03:39:13,176 --> 03:39:13,957
Motion to adjourn.

2623
03:39:14,677 --> 03:39:15,197
All in favor?

2624
03:39:16,098 --> 03:39:16,378
Thank you.
