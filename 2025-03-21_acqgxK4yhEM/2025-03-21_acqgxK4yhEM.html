    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=21.192s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=22.292s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could suspend the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=23.953s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=25.187s">All</a>  those opposed, motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=27.348s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could suspend the rules to bring number 16076.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=31.05s">The</a>  motion of Councilor Caraviello to have item number 16076 before us, offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=41.655s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council send condolences to the family of the Honorable Robert Drennan. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=47.799s">He</a>  is a former member of the Medford City Council and also served as Deputy Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=52.661s">Mr.</a>  Drennan was a World War II veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=55.289s">and</a>  was awarded two battle stars. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=57.73s">Mr.</a>  Drennan was honored by the French General Consul with a certificate of appreciation for his World War II services and was among the American troops that liberated and debriefed the prisoners at Buchenwald concentration camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=74.014s">His</a>  presence in our community will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=76.854s">We</a>  ask that tonight's meeting be held in his honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=81.515s">Consul.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=82.416s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=84.358s">Mr.</a>  Drennan, who passed away this week, is the second — I think just a couple weeks ago, we wished him a happy birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=91.48s">And</a>  he's the second — he was the second-oldest city councilor next to former Councilor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=97.821s">And,</a>  you know, along with being a World War II veteran and being involved with the concentration camps, he was a good soldier and a good family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=109.564s">And</a>  I ask that this meeting be dedicated in his honor today, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=113.379s">On</a>  the motion that this meeting be dedicated in Councilor Drenna's honor and memory, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=121.022s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=122.443s">Please</a>  join us in a moment of silence for Deputy Mayor Drenna.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=152.559s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=153.82s">Do</a>  they need an introduction, Councilor, for the subject matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=158.843s">Allow</a>  the residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=163.026s">Presidents</a>  of Toro Ave, please present themselves before the rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=171.484s">Welcome,</a>  please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=176.588s">William</a>  Hanson, 22 Toro Avenue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=184.394s">Patricia</a>  Hanson, 22 Toro Avenue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=188.177s">Teresa</a>  Eisner, 24 Toro Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=191.319s">He</a>  already named me, Conchita Baudo, 39 Toro Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=199.748s">Sean</a>  Birmingham, 28, Toroweth. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=202.143s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=205.079s">The</a>  purpose you wish to speak to someone, one person may speak at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=209.682s">And</a>  please present yourself to the microphone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=212.183s">Peter</a>  Hoban, and this is a neighbor living at 39 Toro Ave with Conchita Vado. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=219.788s">This</a>  was all brought about originally from a zoning petition for a variance by Tufts University and the potential buyers of 21 Toro Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=231.5s">21</a>  Toro Avenue was a residence that was built in the 1840s. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=236.103s">It's</a>  a single family historical building and had an original lot of, I'm not sure the exact size, 15,000, 18,000 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=245.968s">The</a>  variance was brought by potential buyers from Tufts University who were seeking a variance to put two additional houses on Toro Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=255.194s">So</a>  all the neighbors here who live in the area were up in arms because first, the impact of Toro Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=261.514s">to</a>  put two additional houses and the parking was horrendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=265.828s">We</a>  also have a situation where on Summer Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=268.569s">Tufts</a>  University owned the old grandfather's house, and if anybody's familiar with what happened with that, after they sold that to contractors, they put two additional residences out there, and the traffic was horrendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=282.372s">A</a>  couple of houses up from that particular house, another historic house was just sold recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=288.433s">And</a>  again, the contractors, they've maxed out the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=292.414s">Again,</a>  not having much experience with dealing with <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=298.941s">of</a>  what we're here for, other than to kind of uniform presentation of the homeowners and residents of Medford, that it would be a tremendous disservice that one, the Tufts University, who, again, picked this house up about 25, 30 years ago, about $26,000, and that we're trying to sell it for a million. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=321.856s">That</a>  was about a 3,000, 4,000% profit, and I don't blame <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=326.38s">The</a>  contract is that we're looking to buy the house and flip it over and make a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=332.183s">That's</a>  the American way, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=333.944s">The</a>  upsetness that certainly Conchetta and I, she's lived in the neighborhood for about 40 plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=341.847s">There</a>  was an original family that lived there, Priscilla, an elderly woman and her brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=347.57s">And</a>  they took care of the house and they were about fourth or fifth owners of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=351.712s">It</a>  certainly appeared to me, now Tufts, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=354.263s">they</a>  weren't going to allow the contractors to tear the house down if they had to keep the original lot size student house and keep that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=366.132s">But</a>  it would be up to zoning variance for the property to be developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=372.077s">Again,</a>  my concern and certainly most of the people here is the impact to put two additional houses is horrendous on the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=380.384s">Again,</a>  the other people can address and have the photographs for safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=383.994s">The</a>  one thing that I believe, though, ought to be a major concern for MedFed, and it just burns me, and with all due respect to Tusk, my late wife graduated from Tusk grad school. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=395.452s">And</a>  my younger sister graduated from undergraduate school, so I have no animus against Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=400.954s">I</a>  absolutely have animus against Tufts making a $3,000, $4,000 profit off of the $26,000 to maximize their sale with the idea to develop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=413.378s">As</a>  opposed to Tufts, ought to do the right thing is kind of a fiduciary say, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=418.64s">Hey,</a>  listen, this house is older than Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=422.163s">Tufts</a>  University is coming up to its 200th anniversary about 1950. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=426.806s">Most</a>  of us, myself specifically, I don't think I'll be around for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=430.349s">But</a>  it would be nice to think that Tufts <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=432.597s">didn't</a>  think about maximizing 4,000%, 3,000% profit and maybe held on to the place, put up a sign that, hey, Tufts, look what we did for the benefit of the Medford people. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=443.841s">We</a>  preserved something that was built in 1840 before our university was and preserved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=451.324s">I</a>  think, again, what this isn't about is some hardship owners <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=455.895s">who</a>  are trying to put an extra room or two for their kids to live in a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=460.156s">This</a>  is about a university that has a fiduciary duty, I think, to the community to allow some preservation of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=468.979s">It's</a>  one of the only original sites that they've had, and I suggest that the board consider the people's position on it, that it ought not to be just a profit-orientated <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=484.029s">And</a>  I would defer to my other neighbors here, but that's kind of where we're coming from, more of an equitable argument that certainly Tufts owes to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=494.375s">This</a>  body here is representing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=496.417s">There's</a>  not a whole hell of a lot of places in Medford that can say that they actually look like it was since 1841. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=503.428s">And</a>  question, does the city of Medford really need two additional apartment buildings and the impact as opposed to like preservation of a historical market?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=512.89s">Was</a>  this matter presented by the zoning to the Zoning Board of Appeals?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=516.771s">It</a>  was, I believe that was.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=518.292s">Have</a>  they acted on the matter yet?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=519.692s">No,</a>  they have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=521.412s">We're</a>  here to talk to the city council and help us, guide us on how to continue with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=529.314s">At</a>  a Medford Historic District Commission in October, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=533.856s">They</a>  noted that making a historic original house, a single house historic district, the mayor and the city solicitor were in favor of the designation. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=544.263s">Okay,</a>  and that's the October minutes from the historic commission, historic district commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=550.827s">And</a>  they go on to say that some of the members opposed of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=555.269s">But</a>  what we're here to do is we're here to find out how to go about making this property in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=563.803s">a</a>  historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=566.384s">We</a>  have 87 signatures so far, just from the Toro Avenue area and a few others, all wanting to help us make this, and the other buildings in the city, are the lots of historic value, over 150 years old, into historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=584.754s">So</a>  they've preserved the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=587.776s">There's</a>  also a draft already been prepared by the Historic District Commission, which is here, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=594.443s">Um,</a>  back in July, I believe it was July that it was formed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=603.326s">I</a>  lost the date on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=604.607s">I</a>  lose, you know, I'm not used to doing this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=609.129s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=609.369s">July,</a>  2015 in the, in these Massachusetts, historic society, historic commission States in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=618.891s">that</a>  it's one of the few pristine properties in the city and that it should be preserved.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=626.034s">And</a>  if you're not familiar with what the house looks like, we can pass this around. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=629.955s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=633.057s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=633.437s">And</a>  this is a copy of the $500 survey that the historic district had done on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=643.001s">Anything</a>  else to add?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=649.097s">Why</a>  not? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=651.038s">I</a>  guess the biggest thing, I live right directly across the street from the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=654.42s">I</a>  have for about 18 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=656.182s">I've</a>  lived in Medford most of my life, all my life, I should say, up on Ashcroft Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=661.685s">One</a>  of the biggest reasons why I kept this house or moved into this house was because of the grandeur of this house across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=669.19s">And</a>  it's not just parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=670.311s">I</a>  own a two-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=671.271s">I</a>  have four cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=672.332s">It's</a>  a driveway or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=674.653s">There's</a>  a lot more to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=676.014s">And</a>  I think that's the biggest thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=678.896s">is</a>  this house is a wonderful house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=682.122s">It's</a>  sitting there, all the landscaping as you see the pitches, it's a gorgeous house and it should be kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=690.329s">And</a>  just to keep on adding houses onto it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=692.611s">I</a>  mean, I'm very involved in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=695.133s">My</a>  kids go to Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=697.234s">And</a>  it's just part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=699.376s">I</a>  mean, Medford's a fantastic city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=702.399s">That's</a>  why we chose to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=703.98s">That's</a>  why we chose to stay there was because of this house and how beautiful the street is. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=709.184s">And</a>  just to keep what it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=712.837s">You</a>  know, I mean, just to keep on adding all these houses just doesn't add any value to Medford at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=720.581s">Not</a>  just our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=721.502s">You're</a>  taking away the historical areas.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=732.368s">Hi,</a>  my name is Emily McGallony. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=734.169s">I</a>  live on South Street, right around the corner from Touro Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=737.67s">I</a>  bought a very old house, 1834. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=741.215s">Well,</a>  the oldest part is the 1700s. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=743.277s">It's</a>  on South Street right across from the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=746.319s">Bought</a>  it 18 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=747.78s">I</a>  grew up in Medford and came back to Medford after living in the suburbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=752.484s">As</a>  it stands right now, my house can be bought. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=754.826s">I</a>  have 2 3rds of an acre of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=756.467s">There's</a>  a beautiful Greek Revival house on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=760.23s">Without</a>  any laws protecting these houses in Medford, especially that area, because that was the shipbuilding area. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=767.375s">The</a>  person who built my house was a shipbuilder. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=770.499s">The</a>  paintings of his ships are in the Essex Maritime Museum. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=774.921s">So</a>  as it stands right now, anybody could buy my house, actually tear it down, and build an apartment complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=783.606s">Because</a>  once you own a house, unless it's protected by some kind of historic preservation, an owner has the right to do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=792.731s">So</a>  I agree that more should be looked into as to how to save. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=797.195s">That</a>  particular area, like I said, that was—a lot of those homes were built by the shipbuilders. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=802.718s">And</a>  that's all I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=804.899s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=805.599s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=809.141s">My</a>  name is Robert Pater. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=810.461s">I</a>  live at Zero Summit Road, a former member of the Zargas Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=813.903s">First</a>  of all, to answer your question, Councilor De La Ruzo, Council President De La Ruzo, the Board of Appeals received a letter from Tufts University through their developers that they have rejected, and they're not going forward with the purchase of the sale of the piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=826.723s">And</a>  I would hope it's because at the board of appeals meeting on the night that it took place, there wasn't one person that was there for it from the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=832.985s">As</a>  a matter of fact, they were all against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=834.786s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=835.646s">Number</a>  two, I think the city of Medford has a responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=838.747s">If</a>  in fact they do believe in keeping its history and a piece of its history, here's a classic opportunity for them to engage in this particular part. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=846.39s">The</a>  method historical commission only has $700 a year in its budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=850.111s">It's</a>  a pittance as compared to what the value of properties are here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=854.331s">And</a>  right around the corner, with the demolition delay permit hanging on them, you have another piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=860.153s">It's</a>  called the Cabernet House. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=861.414s">It's</a>  a French colony house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=862.975s">And</a>  that's due any day now to come up as an issue of whether it's going to be destroyed with a present purchase for value being a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=870.658s">You</a>  know, when you talk about history here in the city of Medford, it isn't that it's on Toroweb or South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=876.443s">It's</a>  who owns the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=878.244s">At</a>  Tufts University, with a billion-dollar endowment, not a million or a hundred million, a billion-dollar endowment, there is no need right now for them to have this piece of property to be sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=891.033s">Now,</a>  they're getting a little bit tricky with this, because what they're trying to do is sell the property last week on Zillow, advertising it, and then they subsequently changed the language, not to say that it could be subdivided. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=903.982s">It's</a>  just a single-house piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=906.545s">Now,</a>  the single home historical district, that's the terminology that needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=911.489s">That's</a>  what puts the preservation restriction on this piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=915.793s">And</a>  Tufts University, if they want to really be the good neighbor, they can come up to the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=919.716s">They</a>  have two good bites of the apple of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=922.118s">They</a>  can lead on this one here if they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=923.86s">They</a>  can make the application to the Commonwealth of Mass, for which there is a pamphlet that tells you that it's called There is a Difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=930.786s">It's</a>  all from the Mass Historical Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=933.94s">establishing</a>  historical districts, there's a dish they have out on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=938.002s">What</a>  they could do, they could go forward and make this application in behalf of preserving the piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=943.385s">Or</a>  in the alternative, what they could do, they could place a restriction on their deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=948.287s">So</a>  any subsequent for value who purchases that, which would be the next person for value, there would be a deed restriction that would be recorded at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds in perpetuity, which means <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=959.57s">it</a>  could never be subdivided. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=961.351s">The</a>  house and the land stays as one. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=964.274s">And</a>  that's all that the neighbors are looking for, to preserve their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=968.437s">Because</a>  if that does get itself subdivided and other houses go there, you will have an increase in parking, you will have an increase of traffic in the neighborhood for which they don't need at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=979.225s">As</a>  members of the Medford City Council, I believe you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=981.567s">If</a>  you really believe in history and preserving it and keeping it as a part of what the city of Medford's all about, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=987.002s">You</a>  do have a responsibility, and I would probably suggest and ask that you fellows and ladies make a pitch to the Medford Historical Commission to support the residents and the abutters and the people of Medford who want to keep this house as an historical piece of property and for the city of Medford to file with the Commonwealth of Mass Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1008.602s">If</a>  in fact Tufts University won't do it, in either way, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1011.693s">to</a>  preserve this as a historical landmark here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1016.056s">You</a>  know, Tufts University, this isn't like new to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1018.958s">They</a>  just got through doing this on grandfather's house on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1023.021s">And</a>  fortunately, on this piece of property, the residents are aware, they're smart enough, and they now realize what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1029.546s">That</a>  didn't happen on South Street, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1031.828s">That</a>  happened in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1033.549s">This</a>  one here is a little bit more advanced where the neighborhood was aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1037.252s">And</a>  also, if you go to the last meeting and one of the meeting minutes of the historical commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1042.305s">the</a>  meetings of October 29th, 2015, what was presented that time to Tufts University that they would go forward and sell the property with the request of maintaining a historical piece of property, but not to disallow them to subdivide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1056.795s">And</a>  at that point in time, the developer and Tufts was not going to agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1063.48s">It</a>  doesn't cost a lot of money to make this filing of this application. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1067.943s">And</a>  what you're doing is you're preserving <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1069.925s">something</a>  that the city has had. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1071.066s">If</a>  anybody knows the history of that property, it goes way back, way before 1840. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1075.327s">It</a>  goes back to two brothers that owned that piece of property, who were involved not only in shipbuilding, but were also involved in marketing, you know, internationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1085.132s">And</a>  as the lady who just came and spoke before us, there are other houses on South Street that don't have an historical designation, and if they lose it, and somebody comes in and buys it, nobody's going to be able to do anything about it, because that's going to be their right to do it, whoever buys it to subdivide it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1099.815s">Taking</a>  all of this into consideration, and you might be asking, why are we here tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1103.398s">You're</a>  here tonight for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1105.48s">The</a>  Historical Commission hopefully will have a meeting, because they've been asked to have an emergency meeting, to put a stop to this and have Tufts University put a stop to this, or become a partner so it doesn't get itself subdivided in any shape, manner, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1119.071s">Tufts</a>  University could sell that property today for a million dollars for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1123.314s">The</a>  purchase of a value will give Tufts University the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1126.017s">They'll</a>  make their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1126.797s">It</a>  doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1128.33s">But</a>  to have it with the condition of being subdivided, the question is, I don't believe Tussel's going to get any money back, so why would you want to give an outside developer an opportunity to make that money at the expense of the neighborhood, at the expense of the citizens of Medford, and at the expense of our city's history? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1143.574s">It</a>  doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1145.014s">I</a>  believe that there are plenty of people out there who would love to buy that house, live in that house knowing it's a piece of Medford, it's a piece of history, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1152.535s">and</a>  enjoy the land that's around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1154.356s">It's</a>  a unique opportunity that many homes in this community doesn't even have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1159.819s">With</a>  that being said, I would hope that somebody would be rational enough to realize that these folks aren't here, you know, on a lock. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1167.343s">They're</a>  here on a mission, and the mission is to employ you as our elected officials to look into this and be a positive and affirmative backer for their position to keep Medford's history alive and well and not to have it deteriorated into a subdivision <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1181.689s">to</a>  be sold off to a developer, for that developer to make money, and again, we lose another piece of Medford's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1187.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1189.713s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1192.375s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1193.115s">You</a>  know, it wasn't too long ago where, you know, I sat at those other meetings for Grandfather's House, and we watched as tough steam rolled us over on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1204.301s">That</a>  was another house that should have never been let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1206.683s">And</a>  Councilor Penta's right that if it took some time, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1211.848s">you</a>  can find a buyer who wants to move into that type of house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1215.59s">And</a>  if I recall at the meeting that I went to, the builder was saying that he was going to find a buyer who wanted that type of house, and he pretty much reneged on everything he said on that one there. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1230.137s">So</a>  I think it's up to Tufts to step up to the plate on this and help the city out. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1233.959s">Just</a>  should be noted, and again, appreciate the time you've been working with us.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1244.376s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1247.636s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo, and thank you for taking the time to come tonight to explain this all to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1252.798s">I</a>  know a number of emails have been going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1254.958s">And</a>  as of this morning, somebody did respond from the Medford Historical District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1260.319s">So</a>  has there been anything of the last few hours with regards to if an emergency meeting will be called? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1265.621s">No,</a>  we have not.</p>

    <p>[Judy Beatrice]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1266.141s">The</a>  problem with the emergency meeting is it needs to take notice.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1271.952s">William</a>  Hanson, 22 Toro. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1274.314s">He</a>  needs two days public notice in order to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1278.877s">He</a>  has one of his board members is out of town on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1283.521s">And</a>  I don't know how many they need to hold the meeting to begin with.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1287.276s">And</a>  then there was a time frame.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1289.558s">Monday</a>  is the final day for bids for the House, the 22nd, that Tufts has put on it to try to get the final bids in. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1299.669s">Now,</a>  today we're sitting at the House, and there's probably, I would say, since the weekend, there's probably <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1307.6s">I</a>  don't know, probably 15 families have looked at it, and probably just as many contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1312.681s">Measuring</a>  the land tonight before we came here, there were people over there measuring the lot to see how they could slice and dice. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1320.483s">And</a>  that's what we're asking.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1322.344s">And</a>  with regards, maybe Council Penta could further explain, with regards to time frames, if the historic commission does complete the application, what's the time frame with regards to, you know... The application, the way it was explained to us,</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1337.769s">The</a>  fastest they probably think it could be completed by would be within six to seven months, if that would be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1342.833s">The</a>  quickest and the easiest way to do it would be to have Tufts University, they themselves, recognizing the fact that the neighbors don't want the property subdivided, they could just put an addendum or an attachment to the deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1353.982s">And</a>  while this is taking place, if it takes more than six months to sell the property, the attachments on the deed, it's duly recorded, it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1360.327s">And</a>  at the same time, the city will have its opportunity to not only do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1364.17s">You</a>  bring up a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1365.444s">Because</a>  don't let it just be this house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1367.266s">It's</a>  all the houses in this, all the historic pieces of property in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1370.568s">And</a>  it should be something that should be looked at because I don't think you're going to want to deal with this one at a time, maybe every other month or every third or fourth month. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1377.154s">I</a>  think it's time that the city either takes a real hard look at what it has for its history and its properties and its values and put it all together so you don't have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1385.481s">But</a>  to answer your question, six, seven months.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1388.883s">And</a>  then nobody spoke, but I know I, when I spoke to Bill and Pat, a few, maybe, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1394.767s">A</a>  few weeks ago, there was a major congestion problem on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1400.713s">That's</a>  one of the biggest issues with regards to if you add three more homes there, you're going to add two more homes there, you're going to add another eight cars, and then you really don't have room for it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1414.87s">Their</a>  proposal was to do two more curb cuts because they were going to add two more houses next to that house. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1421.856s">And</a>  so they want to make two more curb cuts to take away more parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1425.398s">And</a>  with Toro Avenue, we have a special restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1428.02s">You</a>  can only park on the odd side every single winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1432.463s">You're</a>  not allowed to do odd, even like most of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1436.106s">And</a>  you can only park on that side, and they're taking away more curbs from the side we're supposed to park on. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1442.951s">And</a>  it's actually part of the Method Scholar, you know, the pathway we have through the, we have all the signs through the city of how to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1450.934s">Toro</a>  Avenue is part of the pathway that comes right off of Summer Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1455.875s">It</a>  goes right down Toro, right past that historical house for bikers and walkers to enjoy.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1464.038s">Just</a>  as one councilor, I'd like to make a motion that we request that Tufts University take a hard look at putting this restriction on. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1471.335s">to</a>  preserve the area, the neighborhood, the street itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1476.737s">Obviously,</a>  we have parking issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1478.697s">But</a>  to preserve that house, which it seems 87 people on a petition, I as one council, and I'm sure my council colleagues agree, we need to do something from our part. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1489.581s">And</a>  I think making a recommendation not only to Tufts University, but also to the Historic District Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1497.069s">to</a>  do what they can and hopefully set up an emergency meeting, even if they are missing a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1501.573s">Obviously,</a>  there's a number of people that need to be heard, and something needs to hopefully change. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1507.638s">And</a>  I agree, it needs to be looked at as a whole, so we don't see this every few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1513.783s">But</a>  right now, we're dealing with this house, and we need to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1518.206s">Hopefully,</a>  the Historic Commission will help us do that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1521.049s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1524.528s">I</a>  just thank you again for coming out tonight and to have the wealth of knowledge that Council Pat brings us is applauded. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1532.572s">But</a>  again, I think that I concur with my fellow colleague that we need to reach out to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1541.738s">I</a>  think that seems to be the quickest way and to try to find, put a halt to this and maybe ask them for an extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1550.505s">as</a>  they go through their process to give the city it's time to do its due diligence and to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1558.47s">And</a>  then moving forward, I think it's a huge piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1561.852s">I</a>  know that I've talked to a few of the neighbors in the Carbonell house and that same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1566.976s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1570.958s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1573.78s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1575.261s">And</a>  I too agree that this is certainly a property that, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1578.828s">we</a>  should take a look at and we should preserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1581.33s">Um,</a>  I certainly think that a, uh, single district historical home is certainly a, uh, a good approach to protecting the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1589.436s">Mr.</a>  President, if we think back in Councilor Penta, um, show you, you remember this, um, council paper one four dash six three five. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1597.181s">We</a>  had some discussion relative to a certain home and you and I worked together to ask the historical district commission to examine all the single family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1605.113s">that</a>  could potentially be in single home historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1608.595s">And</a>  that was back in August of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1611.656s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to amend the paper and request an update from the Medford Historical District Commission on that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1618.44s">Pursuant</a>  to the guidelines set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1621.381s">That</a>  matter was number what? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1624.783s">That</a>  would be number 14-635. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1625.383s">14-635.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1625.423s">And</a>  it was passed on August 12, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1635.16s">In</a>  reviewing the Secretary of State's guideline on ways to establish local historic districts, one of the things that it notes is that it takes about 18 months for the process to be started and finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1648.449s">And</a>  we obviously have a little bit of a different situation in our hands right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1653.412s">And</a>  I think that it's important for us to work with Tufts University and to partner with Tufts University to ensure that there's a deed of restriction on the property, Mr. President, so that we can maintain the integrity of the neighborhood and the integrity of the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1664.315s">So</a>  with that being said, I'm in full support of Councilor Longo's motion, which turned into a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1672.4s">And</a>  I'd like to amend it by asking that we get an update from the Medford Historical District Commission relative to that agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1678.544s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1679.905s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1682.886s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1683.847s">I</a>  want to thank the neighbors for coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1687.309s">You</a>  know, we just went through a very important election this past November. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1692.472s">And</a>  there was a ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1694.433s">relative</a>  to Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1697.315s">And</a>  one of the major points of the Community Preservation Act, which was supported by this community, was historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1705.239s">So</a>  that tells me that people in this community want to preserve our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1709.742s">They</a>  don't want to let buildings like on Bradbury, it was one of the first homes built without the use of a nail. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1715.985s">It</a>  was peg-built, built with pegs back in the 1700s, and it was taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1721.968s">And</a>  they put it actually, there was just a <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1723.856s">a</a>  vacant lot there for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1726.578s">Much</a>  of this goes on throughout the community, and unless residents gather together and support the preservation and support the integrity of their neighborhoods, I think we don't hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1738.464s">So</a>  I agree with Councilor Longo and Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1743.847s">We</a>  should send a letter immediately to Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1747.71s">You</a>  know, Tufts University, as we heard, their endowment is a billion dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1752.64s">and</a>  to be good neighbors in this community, which they are on most occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1758.245s">I</a>  think, Mr. President, that they should hold off for at least a year on this until we're able to, as a community, gather our hands around this and see what direction we go, whether it's the historical home district designation or whether or not the historic district commission wants to put some type of restriction on that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1780.245s">But</a>  clearly, something needs to be done, Mr. President, immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1784.466s">And</a>  I also — I think we all got an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1787.047s">I</a>  think there's a gentleman in the audience that lives in the area that did a fair amount of work, Mr. Gallback, on the history of this particular piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1798.57s">And</a>  I know they mentioned shipbuilding. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1802.091s">We</a>  all knew the Mystic was popular for shipbuilding and rum and a lot of host of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1808.137s">back</a>  some 150, 200 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1810.638s">But</a>  I think it would be interesting to hear from Mr. Gullback regarding the significance of this property and the fact that the city of Medford really is missing a golden opportunity, not just on this home, but many other homes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1825.322s">You</a>  know, I have people that tell me they live, my house is older. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1829.463s">I</a>  say, when was it built? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1830.563s">Oh,</a>  1968 it was built. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1833.564s">You</a>  know, and people have no concept of, you know, historic <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1837.992s">the</a>  need, Mr. President, for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1841.513s">The</a>  direction of this city, under the old forefathers, was to rip down the old property and put something up new. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1847.894s">Our</a>  public library is a perfect scenario, which took place in our public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1853.075s">And</a>  anything we can do to preserve the history that we have in this community, and at the same time moving forward, but preserve what we have, I think we're obligated, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1863.738s">So</a>  if we can hear from Mr. Goldbach, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1866.741s">on</a>  the preservation, I'd be interested in hearing.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1869.362s">We</a>  will in due course, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1870.864s">If</a>  you could just remind us, your amendment was?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1875.487s">My</a>  amendment was more or less to go on with Councilor Longo and Councilor Knight mentioned about, I believe it was sending a letter to Tufts University asking them to hold off on any movement of this particular property until we can, as a community, get our hands around the situation.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1891.174s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended by Councilors Knight and Marks.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1898.46s">Do</a>  you have that Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1907.553s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, obviously we want them to slow the sale of the house, but the ultimate goal is to put a restriction on the deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1913.98s">So</a>  if we can't get them to agree to put the restriction on the deed, then the next best step would be to slow the sale down so that we can go through the process of designating this as a single home historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1923.891s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1924.471s">So</a>  I think the first ask should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1926.67s">to</a>  deed the restrictions, and then they can go about their business and sell it tomorrow if the deeded restrictions are in place and the neighborhood's going to remain the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1933.496s">But</a>  if, in fact, they're going to push back on the deeded restrictions, then we might want to ask for a little bit more time until we can turn it into what we need to turn it into.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1941.463s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1942.724s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1944.306s">The</a>  gentleman hasn't had a chance to speak, so you've spoken twice already. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1948.269s">The</a>  gentleman that spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1951.372s">You</a>  don't have a point of information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1959.008s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1960.489s">Two</a>  points. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1961.13s">The</a>  president of Tufts university, Walnut Hill royalty, Ian Barber-Rubel, who's the public, they're well aware of what you're talking about, about the restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1968.695s">So</a>  the ball is well in their court and they've had this information for well over a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1971.958s">Um,</a>  and I, I just think that's important to note. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1974.6s">And</a>  I, and I think the strength of a roll call vote by the council would be apropos at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1980.625s">Sorry,</a>  I upset your apple cart, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1987.19s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1988.59s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President and Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1990.591s">My</a>  name is Steve Gailbach. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1991.952s">Along</a>  with my family, I've lived next door to 21 Toro at 11 Toro for the last 10 years, since 2006. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=1998.574s">I</a>  have to admit, I didn't inquire into the history of this property until I attended the hearing at the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2004.576s">I</a>  heard quite a bit of fascinating history about it and decided I'm a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2009.057s">I've</a>  done quite a bit of historical research and writing during the course of my career. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2013.119s">I</a>  guess it was about time to look into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2015.5s">What</a>  I found, frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2017.997s">is</a>  somewhat different from some of the stories I heard that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2022.938s">There's</a>  far more here. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2025.059s">There</a>  is stuff that is not in the Medford Histories. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2027.539s">I've</a>  gone over to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2028.739s">I've</a>  looked at the histories. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2030.58s">And</a>  just to give the quick version of it, which I think would be of very much of interest to Tufts University, okay, if you're going to send a letter to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2038.701s">Okay,</a>  there was a historical study done last year at the behest of the Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2046.731s">And</a>  it was only able to trace the title of this house back to 1839. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2051.573s">I've</a>  been to the Registry of Dates now twice in the last couple weeks, and the records there are pretty disorganized and hard to go back beyond 1839. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2062.579s">But</a>  I just tried something on a flyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2065.38s">I</a>  just wanted to know why it was named for Turo. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2069.323s">And</a>  I looked in the grantee indexes for the early 1800s under the name Toro. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2075.308s">And</a>  I could hardly believe what I found. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2077.73s">There</a>  are a couple dozen deeds starting in 1808. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2083.895s">And</a>  basically the Toro family owned this neighborhood from the Mystic River, okay, going toward Tufts to the Middlesex Canal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2095.985s">So</a>  I wondered, what's the Middlesex Canal? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2098.872s">Where</a>  was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2099.472s">I</a>  heard about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2100.512s">I</a>  thought it probably followed the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2102.113s">Makes</a>  sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2103.213s">It</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2104.753s">There's</a>  an online detailed map prepared just in 2008 for the Massachusetts Historic Commission, and it shows the route of the Middlesex Canal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2118.056s">And</a>  is everyone here familiar with Summer Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2121.997s">So</a>  you've got South Street right along and parallel to the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2125.557s">As</a>  you go toward Tufts, the next parallel street to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2128.922s">is</a>  Summer Street, you go past that you have George, okay, Toro Avenue, as you probably know, is just one block long, goes between Summer and South. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2138.909s">What</a>  is today Summer Street, beginning in the early 1830s, that was the Middlesex Canal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2146.215s">Summer</a>  Street follows exactly the path of the Middlesex Canal. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2152.499s">And</a>  there was a bridge over that canal at Toro Ave, and another bridge over the canal at Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2158.71s">So</a>  Toro Ave was pretty important. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2162.332s">As</a>  best I can figure from the deeds, and I missed one day because I went to the courthouse and it was closed for snow about a week ago, but I'm going to go back tomorrow and I'd be glad to submit the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2172.596s">I've</a>  got my preliminary report here and I think by the end of the week I could give a council, you know, more detail and then you can decide what you'd like to put into a letter to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2184.101s">But</a>  here's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2186.784s">The</a>  Toro family has largely been lost to Medford history. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2192.386s">You</a>  go back to all the histories of Medford and you really find virtually nothing about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2199.087s">Judah</a>  Toro was the most famous Jewish philanthropist in America in the 19th century. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2209.352s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2209.692s">There</a>  are books about him in the Library of Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2212.193s">I've</a>  gotten scans of three of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2214.994s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2215.615s">When</a>  he died in 1854, his will was so generous that it was published, not just around America, but in foreign countries as an inspiration to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2227.64s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2229.06s">Now,</a>  nobody has really suspected that Judah Toro had a connection to Medford, because he lived in New Orleans. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2236.692s">Funny</a>  thing, he grew up in Boston with his brother and sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2241.495s">He</a>  ended up going down to New Orleans, handled that part of the family shipping and merchandise business. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2248.2s">His</a>  brother Abraham handled the main part from Boston, but he built a second house in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2256.605s">He</a>  paid $1,100 in 1808 to buy a major part of our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2262.129s">That</a>  was a lot of money back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2264.783s">He</a>  had a house, which should be a historic landmark, but it was torn down in the early 1900s to build a series of apartment houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2276.231s">That's</a>  what the Medford historical record volumes say from 100 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2283.517s">Those</a>  are probably the triple-deckers that are on Toro Avenue right along South. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2287.84s">You</a>  have a set of four of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2289.581s">But</a>  there's more, obviously, we need to nail down, but the point is that <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2294.952s">Abraham</a>  Toro died an untimely death in 1822 when he went to the annual military parade in Boston and a cannon shot explosion spooked his horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2308.359s">He</a>  ended up taking a hard fall, compound fracture of his leg. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2313.462s">It</a>  turned into gangrene and he declared that he'd rather enter heaven with two legs than one. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2319.806s">So</a>  he did not let the surgeons at Mass General Hospital amputate. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2324.687s">He</a>  himself had endowed Mass General Hospital with so much money that according to a history in the Library of Congress, it made the director's head spin. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2334.011s">His</a>  brother Judah, okay, then became owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2339.744s">of</a>  the land in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2342.166s">I</a>  don't think anybody's ever known that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2343.226s">There's</a>  nothing in the history books, but it's there in the Middlesex Registry of Deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2348.21s">And</a>  surprisingly, although he spent most of his time in New Orleans, he and his sister Rebecca, who lived in New York, they bought more land to fill out their land holdings. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2359.918s">During</a>  the 10 to 12 years after their brother's death, and then starting around 1836 to 1840, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2366.502s">They</a>  sold it off, it got subdivided, and it's what you have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2370.505s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2371.586s">Now,</a>  the Tufts connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2374.328s">Judah</a>  Turow's will was most famous, and his whole life of philanthropy was famous for being the biggest benefactor of the Unitarian Church in New Orleans. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2387.479s">The</a>  pastor of that church was a good friend of his. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2390.378s">being</a>  the biggest benefactor, and it was in his will also, of the Jewish synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, which was the first synagogue in the British colonies, and his dad had been the rabbi there right at the start of the Revolutionary War, and also Mass General Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2409.134s">When</a>  you think of Tufts, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2413.084s">what</a>  was tough started at, as it was the college of the Unitarian Church in Massachusetts, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2419.428s">All</a>  we're doing here is really asking that what is probably the oldest surviving house on Touro family land, even if it was people after them that built it, plus the land itself, which is the only, you know, nice surviving residential, you know, grassy area other than the public park, which we really appreciate, beautiful park, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2443.244s">that</a>  that be somehow memorialized, not only for the architecture, which is impressive and old and historic, and that in itself would be ample reason, but this is to memorialize somebody who, he was one of the most important landowners in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2460.662s">His</a>  brother was one of the most important citizens and a good friend of Governor Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2466.161s">And</a>  there's just a great story to be told here. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2468.542s">And</a>  in terms of the Jewish philanthropy aspect, Tufts is one of the biggest beneficiaries of generous Jewish philanthropy today. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2478.169s">So,</a>  I mean, if this isn't a story that, you know, strikes somebody at Tufts, but frankly, they never had a chance to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2485.695s">So,</a>  I'd be glad to give the material to counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2488.617s">If</a>  you want to give it to Tufts, I think somebody over there would pay attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2492.74s">If</a>  you got a billion dollar endowment, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2494.972s">What</a>  we're talking about is pocket change in terms of impact on the residential value, but it could be huge for their director of fundraising. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2504.319s">Okay,</a>  that's all.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2513.827s">So</a>  on the motion of, did you need to speak one more time, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2518.473s">If</a>  I could, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2519.915s">Sure,</a>  Peter, just a postscript on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2521.917s">Just</a>  so you're aware, what has been used by Tufts University is for visiting professors. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2526.323s">So</a>  it's not like that will sit there. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2527.744s">I</a>  mean, the usage of that house up to about a year ago was visiting professors. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2531.912s">So</a>  I assume while the interim, something's happening, Tufts could go back and use it for their professorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2537.273s">It</a>  wasn't right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2538.294s">Although</a>  at the time we were there, it was easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2539.694s">Some</a>  visit, they come in and stay a couple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2541.914s">So</a>  it certainly could be used by them.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2544.335s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2545.195s">Councilor</a>  Scott-Powell. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2546.396s">Mr.</a>  President, if we can, maybe with this wonderful information and the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2552.778s">Maybe</a>  we can amend that to maybe meet with Barbara Rebell maybe soon and maybe instead of a letter, not knowing with the time sensitive constraints, maybe meeting with her and maybe she can help us move this along in a more rapid pace to assure that the residents and the history are told. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2574.26s">So</a>  if we can.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2576.902s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, as amended, roll call has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2581.863s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2584.524s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2585.444s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2586.365s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2587.085s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2587.425s">Councilor</a>  Knight?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=2588.225s">Yes.</a> </p>
