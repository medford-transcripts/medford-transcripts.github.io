[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks?

12
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:22,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Present.

13
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:24,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

14
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:25,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,035
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

16
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:27,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

17
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:47,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:57,375
[SPEAKER_12]: 17296, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Medford Fire Station, Engine 3 on Salem Street, be discussed.

20
00:00:59,036 --> 00:00:59,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Mox.

21
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:02,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

22
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:14,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the opportunity last week to take a tour of engine three, ladder two, which is the fire station on Salem Street, 276 Salem Street.

23
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:28,495
[SPEAKER_10]: And if members recall back some three years ago, this council voted for phase one of a refurbishing of many of our fire stations throughout the community.

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,022
[SPEAKER_10]: by the way, which did not include Engine 1, which was the headquarters.

25
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:43,104
[SPEAKER_10]: And many of the stations got some major and minor upgrades to the station.

26
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:53,107
[SPEAKER_10]: The one in particular that I viewed, Mr. President, at Engine 3 on Salem Street was work that was performed back in April of 2014.

27
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:58,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a little under three years ago.

28
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:02,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the time, the station had a list of priorities.

29
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:10,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there were five separate sections of priorities, of which each section contained

30
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,046
[SPEAKER_10]: 10 or 11 items that needed to be done as a punch list.

31
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:22,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the major items at engine three was the floor where the engine truck sits.

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:33,693
[SPEAKER_10]: And that particular floor, the cement was splitting and the slab was deteriorating because of the splitting of the cement floor.

33
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:51,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the time, it was discussed by the chief of the fire department as well as the captain of Salem Street Fire Station that that was going to be one of the major recommendations for renovation.

34
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:57,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And if anyone's familiar, there's actually two bays at Salem Street.

35
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:00,569
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were only going to work on the bay to the right.

36
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:15,756
[SPEAKER_10]: The work involved repairing the slab, which is the top cement floor, and also laying down a new epoxy coating on the floor.

37
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:24,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's like a rubberized, similar to a rubberized flooring, which expands and contracts.

38
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,379
[SPEAKER_10]: So that work was done at a cost of $91,000 three years ago.

39
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:38,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And many of the holes that were on the slab floor were patched.

40
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:44,405
[SPEAKER_10]: The epoxy was placed on the floor itself.

41
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:52,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And three years later, Mr. President, and I have a picture here for my colleagues, if they'd like to see it.

42
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,071
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually the bottom of the cement floor that you can see from the basement.

43
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a couple of real good pictures

44
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:08,882
[SPEAKER_10]: that show the cement peeling off from the bottom of the floor that we just paid $91,000 for.

45
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:18,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know about you, but I'm outraged to see this type of shoddy craftsmanship and lack of concern by the city

46
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,671
[SPEAKER_10]: after just paying $91,000 to have this work done.

47
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:40,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if the work is still under warranty, Mr. President, but someone from this city needs to get a hold of the contractor or the subcontractor immediately and have them go down to that site because we're in the same situation we were

48
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:45,999
[SPEAKER_10]: roughly three and a half years ago when we commissioned this work to be done.

49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,205
[SPEAKER_10]: We commissioned it because the cement was splitting, like we're seeing in this picture.

50
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're already seeing cracks on the epoxy floor.

51
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,591
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is made to expand and contract.

52
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,715
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to see cracks on epoxy floors.

53
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:04,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're already starting to see cracks on the floor, Mr. President.

54
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:29,942
[SPEAKER_10]: So my first motion would be that that floor, the bay to the right-hand side, be reviewed immediately by our building department, be reviewed by Paul Moky, our building commissioner, and the appropriate channels be reached to get a hold of this contractor or subcontractor that did the work, Mr. President.

55
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:35,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, if we're not aware, if you could pass that around, that'd be great.

56
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:42,415
[SPEAKER_10]: They also replaced the overhead doors in both bays.

57
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:46,077
[SPEAKER_10]: So there were two overhead doors put in at a cost of $40,000.

58
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:55,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they put the doors in, they have to meet new requirement now, new state code.

59
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:57,904
[SPEAKER_10]: And the code calls for

60
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,802
[SPEAKER_10]: what they refer to as safety lights.

61
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:07,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't have them in a lot of our stations because they haven't been upgraded, but Engine 1 has the safety lights.

62
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:09,455
[SPEAKER_10]: They look like traffic lights.

63
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,040
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a green light, big green light, and a red light.

64
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:16,921
[SPEAKER_10]: and you'll have two of them at the entrance to each door.

65
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:22,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And this alerts the driver of the truck when it's safe to pull out.

66
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,069
[SPEAKER_10]: When the doors go up, the light turns green.

67
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,071
[SPEAKER_10]: If the door's not up, the light's red.

68
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,413
[SPEAKER_10]: The driver, it's another safety precaution.

69
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:32,397
[SPEAKER_10]: They know not to exit the building, because that means the door's down.

70
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the new overhead lights were put in.

71
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:36,922
[SPEAKER_10]: They look terrific.

72
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,764
[SPEAKER_10]: both bays at engine three.

73
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:48,410
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there was never enough money, and the specs of the project did not call to wire these particular lights.

74
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,792
[SPEAKER_10]: So they've been up there for three years, and they're not wired.

75
00:06:52,452 --> 00:07:01,799
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're not serving any type of safety concern for the fire station, and they're not fully operating.

76
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a major concern, Mr. President, that such

77
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:18,222
[SPEAKER_10]: A basic improvement with safety lights, there was no thought about wiring the lights and that wasn't part of the spec.

78
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:26,091
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mr. President, I would ask that that be the second motion that we get a response back from the city administration.

79
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:36,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we find out who the clerk of the works was on this particular project and find out why the safety lights, uh, were not included.

80
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:45,158
[SPEAKER_10]: The wiring of the safety lights were not included in the bid specs and why just the lights were put up, uh, in this particular station.

81
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:47,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, without being wired.

82
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:57,208
[SPEAKER_10]: There were a number of other concerns that I won't address here tonight, Mr. President, but I did want to call to the council's attention.

83
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,989
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of discussion about a new fire headquarters.

84
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,690
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of discussion.

85
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:11,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't forget, the fire headquarters, I believe, is out of the six fire stations, it's the third newest.

86
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:14,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're talking about replacing the third newest.

87
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:33,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have these other stations, like Engine 4, Engine 3, what I just spoke about, Engine 5, that are far older than our headquarters and, in my opinion, need the same amount of work, if not more, than the headquarters, Mr. President.

88
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:41,166
[SPEAKER_10]: What I wanted to call to my colleagues' attention, and I know it's been raised here before on the council,

89
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:46,657
[SPEAKER_10]: is that the fact that we just got a second set of turnout here.

90
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:52,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And the firefighters are ecstatic now they finally got a second set of turnout here.

91
00:08:52,698 --> 00:09:07,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And the issue remains, Mr. President, that we still don't have the basic necessity, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn found out when we did the tour at the headquarters, we have what they refer to as an extractor, which is

92
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:15,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it's a giant washing machine that's like on steroids that cleans this heavy-duty turnout gear.

93
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,669
[SPEAKER_10]: And bless you.

94
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,330
[SPEAKER_10]: This heavy-duty turnout gear.

95
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:27,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have one extractor, one giant washing machine for over 120 firefighters.

96
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,466
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes roughly 45 minutes.

97
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:36,567
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you do the math, you'll figure out we're in dire need of these extractors.

98
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:43,109
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes about 45 minutes to wash one uniform, and it takes about two hours to dry.

99
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's on an average.

100
00:09:45,910 --> 00:10:05,565
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have one extractor, so this means that after a fire goff a bit, the firefighters have to take their uniform from North Method, from West Method, from Haines Square, down to the headquarters, and wait in line to use the extractors.

101
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,253
[SPEAKER_10]: From what I've been told, the extractors, the drying washing machines, about $7,000.

102
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:14,696
[SPEAKER_10]: The dryer that they use is about $6,000.

103
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:25,364
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can equip a fire station with an extractor and a dryer at a cost of about $13,000 and then another maybe $1,200 to $1,500 to properly wire it.

104
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:39,188
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're talking anywhere from maybe $14,000 to $15,000 to make sure, Mr. President, that this is not you or I washing our suit coat after we're done with a council meeting.

105
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:46,150
[SPEAKER_10]: This is washing off the contaminants that leach into the firefighter's skin when they're on these uniforms.

106
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:53,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And I recently read an article, and if anyone's interested in looking at it,

107
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:59,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an article on high cancer rate and risk hazards for firefighters.

108
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,319
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a November 20, 2016 article, and it's out of San Francisco.

109
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:12,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And it states that prevention in San Francisco sounds like a washing machine.

110
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:16,722
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they address cancer prevention.

111
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:19,903
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no secret to this, Mr. President.

112
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:35,169
[SPEAKER_10]: It's done all over the country, and it's very successful in washing the turnout gear in a timely fashion and not sitting it back into the fire station, which is happening now, and cross-contaminating the new uniforms with the old uniforms.

113
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,149
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a major concern.

114
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:46,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And according to the International Association of Firefighters, it says 63% of firefighters will get cancer at some point.

115
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,811
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a staggering number.

116
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:52,834
[SPEAKER_10]: When I read that, I said, you got to be kidding me.

117
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can anticipate Mr. President.

118
00:11:56,657 --> 00:12:02,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's awful to say that 63% of our firefighters, we have 120 of them at some point.

119
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:09,143
[SPEAKER_10]: make or track some type of cancer.

120
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:15,266
[SPEAKER_10]: And anything we can do, Mr. President, there are things that are probably out of our control.

121
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,868
[SPEAKER_10]: We try to provide the latest and greatest equipment.

122
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:24,672
[SPEAKER_10]: But anything we can do as a city to help mitigate that, we are obligated to do that, Mr. President.

123
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,413
[SPEAKER_10]: We are obligated to do it.

124
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:33,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And to have one extractor to wash these turnout gears is a complete disgrace.

125
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:35,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And the administration

126
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:40,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll even say this council should be ashamed of ourselves, Mr. President.

127
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:48,856
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be ashamed of ourselves to let this linger on, especially with the facts and figures that we have on cancer rates, Mr. President.

128
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:55,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I read an article recently, I believe it was in the Boston Globe, and they did a study statewide.

129
00:12:56,261 --> 00:13:03,627
[SPEAKER_10]: And Method was at near the top for cancer rates among active and retired firefighters.

130
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,121
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alarming, Mr. President.

131
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,442
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alarming.

132
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:08,943
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not a giant city.

133
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:16,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be near the top of the rate for cancer rates among the state is very concerning for me.

134
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:28,159
[SPEAKER_10]: We had the mayor here a couple of weeks ago, and she stood up and she turned around to the firefighters and she said, whatever we can do to help and protect the people that protect us, I'm on board.

135
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,682
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was a great line, Mr. President.

136
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:34,740
[SPEAKER_10]: But actions speak louder than words.

137
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:49,298
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the mayor's on board, Mr. President, I would expect, and I talked to the union president, I would expect, Mr. President, tomorrow that the mayor will have a purchase order.

138
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:55,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow morning, a purchase order for two new extractors and two new dryers.

139
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,824
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the one at the headquarters and put two new ones, extractors and dryers, in the other stations.

140
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:09,509
[SPEAKER_10]: This way, we'll have three stations that are equipped to accommodate the firefighters throughout this community.

141
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not a giant expense.

142
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:19,075
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking $35,000 to $40,000 to ensure an additional safeguard for our firefighters.

143
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:31,487
[SPEAKER_10]: The article goes on, Mr. President, to say, it's easy to look at the plumes of billowing black smoke from a massive fire and know they aren't healthy.

144
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:37,433
[SPEAKER_10]: While firefighters are putting out flames, priority one is protection from the heat in those flames.

145
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,154
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what their turnout gear is for.

146
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:45,316
[SPEAKER_10]: The gear is doing its job, keeping firefighters from getting overheated and burned.

147
00:14:45,856 --> 00:14:52,179
[SPEAKER_10]: But while in a fire environment, they're soaking up the toxins that are in the smoke and heated gases.

148
00:14:52,679 --> 00:15:02,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's believed the toxins from years of putting out flames are soaking into the turnout, fireproof fabric, and slowly leaching in to the firefighter's skin.

149
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,365
[SPEAKER_10]: This is alarming, Mr. President, knowing the current condition

150
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,370
[SPEAKER_10]: and currently how we're treating our turnout gear in our stations.

151
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:12,611
[SPEAKER_10]: It's alarming.

152
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:18,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's alarming when you walk into a station and you smell a burnt smell.

153
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:23,420
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like you're in a fire somewhere.

154
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,162
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the burnt smell of their gear, Mr. President.

155
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:28,663
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly what it is.

156
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:34,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're putting these uniforms on and these particular pieces of gear

157
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:45,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I just read, slowly but surely, Mr. President, if these aren't properly washed, the toxins are leaching into this skin.

158
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:46,068
[SPEAKER_10]: You are correct.

159
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:56,915
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that my first motion is that two additional extractors and two additional dryers

160
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:16,657
[SPEAKER_10]: be purchased immediately by this administration, purchase orders, and that they be located wherever the fire chief or the brave men and women of the fire department believe they're needed, Mr. President, and also that each fire station have a separate area.

161
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Langel, Kern, and I, when we toured

162
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:22,220
[SPEAKER_10]: of the headquarters, that was one of their major concerns.

163
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,361
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have a second storage area for their gear.

164
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:39,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So you might have a pristine set of turnout gear you just got, and it's housed next to the gear that's waiting to be washed that was just in a house fire or just in a car fire that released toxins.

165
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,429
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unacceptable, Mr. President.

166
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:46,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So in addition, my motion would be the two

167
00:16:48,119 --> 00:17:01,386
[SPEAKER_10]: extractors, the two dryers, that each station that they find some space, Mr. President, where they can locate another set of turnout gear so there's not cross-contamination among the turnout gear.

168
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:10,891
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that this be taken in a roll call vote because of the importance of this matter

169
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:17,986
[SPEAKER_10]: And that we receive a response immediately from the administration regarding this resolution, Mr. President.

170
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:18,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

171
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,589
[SPEAKER_12]: I think each machine does three uniforms, I think you told me.

172
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,671
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm correct.

173
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:28,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And it takes about 45 minutes per cycle.

174
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

175
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

176
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:35,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank Council Marks for bringing this forward tonight.

177
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:40,420
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be doing everything we can to keep our firefighters safe.

178
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:47,920
[SPEAKER_07]: especially buying the extractors to wash the turnout gear, that should be a no-brainer.

179
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,982
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be done, and we should make sure that we take care of that right away.

180
00:17:52,062 --> 00:18:03,746
[SPEAKER_07]: But just getting back to one of the council's other points with regard to Engine 3, I did have the opportunity a little while back to go down to Engine 3 as well.

181
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And they took me into the basement.

182
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,268
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave me a tour of the facility.

183
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:10,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're right, it's definitely

184
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:15,896
[SPEAKER_07]: scary to see when you go underneath that bay and you see crumbling cement.

185
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:25,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's, it's, it's just, it's scary to actually see that firsthand and it's crumbling all over the place and something needs to be done.

186
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:32,506
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, what, but as I walked through the fire station, um, you know, it's, it's that, but there's other issues as well.

187
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:37,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and, uh, and my tour and I've gone to a couple of other fire stations as well.

188
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um,

189
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:39,745
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of issues.

190
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:45,487
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of issues throughout our city in our fire stations and that need to be addressed.

191
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:46,947
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to be addressed sooner than later.

192
00:18:47,748 --> 00:19:03,132
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, one of the things, just to, if I could go back a little bit, you know, prior to being on the city council, I was on the school committee and, uh, during the budget time, which is, you know, one of the most important times of the year is, uh, you know, you're going through the budget and you know, what you allocate to building maintenance.

193
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, you know what I remember,

194
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It was my first time through the budget.

195
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:12,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked the director of buildings and grounds, what are we doing for preventive maintenance?

196
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And he looked at me and said, Mr. Falco, we're doing nothing.

197
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:17,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was Mr. Edwards.

198
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:17,673
[SPEAKER_07]: That was back in 2010.

199
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:36,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I did then is I offered a motion, a resolution, that the school committee go out and tour each of the buildings throughout our community to actually see what's broken, what's fixed, and to have committee of the whole meetings to actually see firsthand as a group what needs to be addressed.

200
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:38,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did that.

201
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:39,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was very effective.

202
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:43,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all went, all at the same time, to each of the facilities.

203
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, how the buildings were being taken care of, what was broken, what was fixed, what needed to be addressed, what needed to be addressed right away, so we could appropriate money in the budget.

204
00:19:52,722 --> 00:20:01,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in the draft capital plan that we got a glimpse at back a little while ago, there's some money there in the upcoming years.

205
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:05,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's about $2.5 million for firehouse improvements.

206
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:23,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And if Councilor Marks wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution that we schedule Committee of the Wholes to go to each firehouse in the city as a group so we can take a look at the issues because there are issues out there that need to be addressed.

207
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:28,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can go from building to building and see what needs to be done, what's broken, what needs to be repaired.

208
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:30,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and he's right.

209
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:32,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I went to the fire station in West Bedford.

210
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:35,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the gear is right behind the truck.

211
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:38,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, 15 feet from the truck is all the fire gear.

212
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's dangerous.

213
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:46,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, cancer is a major concern, and we need to make sure that we're addressing these situations, but just general situations.

214
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:51,909
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was down at the West Bedford Fire Station, I think the shower had no door on it.

215
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:56,590
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you know, that's — to me, that should be a simple fix.

216
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it shouldn't — they shouldn't have to wait forever to get a door fixed in the shower.

217
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:11,422
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take a look at some of our buildings, I mean, when I went down to South Medford and I went to West, you take a look at the, and actually I'm trying to think of Salem Street, Salem Street did have the same issue.

218
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:14,825
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take a look at the heating, it's terribly inefficient.

219
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:22,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a thousand degrees, you know, in one room, you have to open up the windows to cool it down in the middle of the winter.

220
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are things that need to be addressed.

221
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:30,638
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we should have our environmental, Alicia Hunt go down and take a look to see if there's anything that we could be doing.

222
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,252
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, to make these buildings more cost-effective, more efficient.

223
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:35,573
[SPEAKER_07]: They aren't older buildings.

224
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:38,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So these need to be a top priority.

225
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:51,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I could amend the resolution that, Mr. President, if you could schedule a committee of the whole meetings so we could go out and take a look at each facility as a group and take a look at what needs to be addressed, because the budget's coming up.

226
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:58,910
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that we have maintenance in there to do these things, but we also need to make sure that we can prioritize these items when it comes to — when we look at our capital budget.

227
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,190
[SPEAKER_07]: The President.

228
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like the chief to accompany us?

229
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,893
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine with me.

230
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:15,636
[SPEAKER_10]: The President Just to follow up on Councilor Falco's suggestion, and I think it's a worthy suggestion.

231
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:25,978
[SPEAKER_10]: At the time when we did phase one, the chief put together a punch list, which I have a copy of, Latitude Engine 3.

232
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:29,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a two-page punch list of

233
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:31,684
[SPEAKER_10]: items that he wanted to see done.

234
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:42,149
[SPEAKER_10]: And out of the just say 50 items on here, I think the city addressed maybe six of them, but I think it would be helpful cause I'm sure this punch list still exists for each station.

235
00:22:42,469 --> 00:22:43,369
[SPEAKER_10]: You went through each station.

236
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:50,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So prior to us meeting, I think it would be helpful to have a listing of what they feel the improvements as necessary.

237
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,134
[SPEAKER_10]: And also regarding the $2.5 million, um,

238
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:57,532
[SPEAKER_10]: There that's the mayor's draft proposal.

239
00:22:57,953 --> 00:23:01,360
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no money to back anything in the mayor's draft proposal.

240
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:06,732
[SPEAKER_10]: These are just recommendations that the mayor put out there and we asked as a council.

241
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:15,037
[SPEAKER_10]: on two occasions just within the last two weeks, where will the $2.5 million be spent and what stations?

242
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:19,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have not received a response yet from the administration, Mr. President.

243
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,324
[SPEAKER_10]: So the mayor could put down anything she wants in her draft capital plan, making it look like things are being done in the community.

244
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:30,867
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no money, first of all, that backs any of those items.

245
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:44,215
[SPEAKER_10]: And secondly, Mr. President, she doesn't even know, when we ask the questions, when her department heads are here, if they can explain what $2.5 million of the mayor's line item is going to go towards, they can't answer it.

246
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,037
[SPEAKER_10]: So what kind of proposal is that, Mr. President?

247
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:54,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Any monkey can write something down, but if there's nothing behind it, Mr. President, to back it up, it's meaningless.

248
00:23:55,682 --> 00:24:01,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you have the department head sitting here, and you have the mayor's chief of staff, and she can't answer a question,

249
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:02,817
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the two point?

250
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:03,858
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it, a secret?

251
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:08,960
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

252
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Just lip service again.

253
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

254
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:14,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank my colleague Councilor Falco for bringing that up.

255
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:15,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

256
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:18,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco, do you have anything further?

257
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,083
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be all.

258
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:26,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we could do it on a Saturday when, uh, when maybe we'll have more time, uh, for everybody else.

259
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:27,326
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll talk to the chief.

260
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:27,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.

261
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:28,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

262
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:29,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scott Belly.

263
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:30,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

264
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:31,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I,

265
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:34,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank my fellow colleagues for bringing this issue up.

266
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:39,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that back in budget time when we discussed, we talked to each individual department.

267
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:49,117
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we talked about was the implementation of the wash machine and having that implemented.

268
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:56,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the biggest concerns they had was that most of our stations don't have the capability

269
00:24:56,894 --> 00:25:02,179
[SPEAKER_09]: from the electrical standpoint and plumbing standpoint to do what's needed to have that machine.

270
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:19,497
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can ask, I'd like to see if you wouldn't mind that we can amend it to ask the building department to find out, Mr. Moki, if they can look into to see which departments, which fire stations can, that have the capability to make sure that

271
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:24,364
[SPEAKER_09]: because if it's that simple, it should be that simple.

272
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:27,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, these are dire issues that are very concerning.

273
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:47,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that that was one of the concerns that was brought up when I've talked to the rank and file and what the reasoning was, why they couldn't put in the washing machine for the turnout gear was because the stations weren't compatible for the electricity and the water that was needed there.

274
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:54,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I, if we can reach out to the chief too, and, uh, have another amendment put on that.

275
00:25:55,499 --> 00:26:05,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought there was discussion that there was a grant that was supposedly coming out for two more of these, uh, uh, wash machines and dryers.

276
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:06,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It never did.

277
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:07,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

278
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:12,603
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, if we can get an update on that and what happened with that too, or that'd be important.

279
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:16,464
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, and again, I follow up with what else would counsel Falco said,

280
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,353
[SPEAKER_09]: That was one of the biggest pieces.

281
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:24,455
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, um, that with the school committee looking at the schools now, obviously we didn't do, we couldn't do everything.

282
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:29,437
[SPEAKER_09]: It was impossible to do, but what it did was we finally had, and that wasn't it.

283
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:36,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I, my answer to that was with the schools was, uh, it's a rolling, um, um, plan.

284
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're always doing capital improvement.

285
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:41,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that if we can get,

286
00:26:42,510 --> 00:27:10,392
[SPEAKER_09]: a list, not just in the fire departments, but in all of our municipal buildings, and what we see as more dire actions that need to be taken, and then categorize them so we know what needs to be done and what's really at its last legs that are going to cost us when it's too late.

287
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:11,613
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's important.

288
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:24,573
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the concerns I got back with when we talk about new buildings, new, new police station, new schools, what are the plans in place to make sure that we're, we have a plan in place for upkeep.

289
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:38,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's important that we, we, uh, ask the city administration that if we can have a, um, a plan in place and what, uh, a working plan in place with the city administration on all of our municipal buildings.

290
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:40,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

291
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:40,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

292
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:43,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

293
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:48,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to thank Councilor Mraks for bringing up the issue with regards to the extractors.

294
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:50,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it a little differently.

295
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when we took the tour, we had a lot of information coming in our head.

296
00:27:54,224 --> 00:28:01,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have sworn the men and women of the fire department said the machine that's there now is actually not an extractor.

297
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:05,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a washing machine, and it does one at a time, like you had mentioned, and they were

298
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:14,261
[SPEAKER_06]: wanting and in need of extractors, and the new extractors, if they got one, does three uniforms at a time.

299
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:21,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's, either way, especially, that's something that shocked me, the fact that we didn't have an extractor.

300
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:26,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could stand corrected, but we didn't have an extractor.

301
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:33,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think something to point out with regard to that is not only they're going into fires and they have the soot on their uniforms,

302
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:37,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're being stored, especially at Engine 1.

303
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:42,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I hear, it sounds like all the stations, they're being stored right next to the diesel trucks.

304
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:45,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So the trucks are coming in and out, probably on a daily basis.

305
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you go in there, Council Member Knox was right, you smell something.

306
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:55,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know if it was from the uniforms being in the fire so often and not being extracted.

307
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:57,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also smell like fuel.

308
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:02,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could see a layer of soot on the lockers where the uniforms are stored.

309
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:08,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And you look up on the fan, and there's another, you could see the layer of, it was just black.

310
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:17,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can imagine what's going into our men and women's lungs after, number one, after a fire, and after re-wearing the uniform over and over again.

311
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:25,619
[SPEAKER_06]: But also just, after I was told that story, and then I went and checked out the kitchen, which is a huge door open right next to the trucks.

312
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:30,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what they're taking in, just sitting there 24 hours on their 24-hour shift,

313
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:35,653
[SPEAKER_06]: It's extremely concerning.

314
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:39,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's why I brought it up the last few weeks when we've been discussing these issues.

315
00:29:40,036 --> 00:30:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think as many extractors as we can get, whether that be, I think it's a good resolve to start with two, two washers, two dryers, two extractors, and we figure out a way to put them in one or two of our stations because these men and women said that sometimes they're coming on their off hours because it only does one uniform at a time and they are,

316
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:10,911
[SPEAKER_06]: not in queue during their 24-hour shift, so they either have to ask somebody to help them, or they have to come back on their time off to be able to wash and dry their uniform.

317
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:16,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think that's absolutely ridiculous, especially with the rates that we're hearing with regards to cancer.

318
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:23,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something, if that is $10,000 or $100,000, we need to spend some money to clean their uniforms.

319
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:25,536
[SPEAKER_06]: They're breathing in every day.

320
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:30,197
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's extremely important to bring up on a separate night, I know it's been a

321
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:36,024
[SPEAKER_06]: couple heated debates and discussions over the last few weeks, but I definitely think this was in need of being brought up.

322
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:43,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I too was told a couple of weeks ago that they, fire department themselves wrote a grant for a washer, for an extractor and a dryer.

323
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:48,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded like they were getting it at the time, but it may have changed within the last two weeks.

324
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,111
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they said the chief had wrote in the grant, but it never came through.

325
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:01,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's why a grant writer that I brought up a couple weeks ago, I mean, we need a grant writer, part-time, full-time.

326
00:31:01,582 --> 00:31:14,491
[SPEAKER_06]: We need somebody to help the fire department, the police department, every department in the city get the equipment and funding that is out there to use for, so we don't have to use City of Medford taxpayers' money.

327
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:23,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a grant writer will go a heck of a long way, and I'm sure there's other opportunities for extractors and things like that that we could be going after, and we just aren't.

328
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:24,898
[SPEAKER_06]: As a community, our department heads are doing

329
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:30,284
[SPEAKER_06]: the union heads the best they can, but it's just not, I think there's more out there that we can be grasping.

330
00:31:30,364 --> 00:31:31,805
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one point I wanted to make.

331
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:42,810
[SPEAKER_06]: The second point with engine three, I think the council voted like three or four times because I know when Louise Miller was our finance director, we hounded her.

332
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:54,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember specifically hounding her with regards to the fact that when we put the million to 2 million and a half into the updates and the fire stations, there was a one year warranty.

333
00:31:55,077 --> 00:32:02,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if anybody else recalls it, but I remember grilling her on multiple occasions within the first six to nine months saying, where's the punch list?

334
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:03,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's our OPM?

335
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:08,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Did the OPM go through it three months after, six months after?

336
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:15,573
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to capitalize on that warranty and make sure everything is done, was done correctly, and it hasn't faded, ripped, or teared.

337
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:22,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I, you know, obviously, we upset her, we asked her so much, but the job obviously wasn't done.

338
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:51,753
[SPEAKER_06]: how it should have been done because that's that I'm sure that those pictures which tell us you know say a thousand words occurred within that time frame one year and we could have capitalized and made that those contractors do the work right if it wasn't done correctly and this council tried I think we took three or four votes to ask about that one-year warranty and what needed to be done and if the OPM took took a walk through more than more than once or a couple times to see what

339
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:58,641
[SPEAKER_06]: what was failing and what needed to be brought up to the contractor and we really didn't get anywhere with regards to our votes.

340
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:02,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think Councilor Marks and I second the resolve.

341
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:04,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

342
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:04,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Neill.

343
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:06,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Mr. President.

344
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:17,489
[SPEAKER_13]: I do recall leadership from 1032 here a couple weeks ago indicating that they were pursuing a charitable donation for the extractors but I also think that we can't have too many.

345
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,137
[SPEAKER_13]: We only have one now, 10 of them.

346
00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:19,657
[SPEAKER_13]: More heart.

347
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:25,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we have enough stations to place them as long as we have the space needs and the infrastructure needs to, um, to meet the capabilities.

348
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:29,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, we should, we should have more than two, three, four, five, as many as we can get.

349
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,541
[SPEAKER_13]: We should get our hands on.

350
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:40,265
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, I'd like to amend the paper to request an update, um, from the administration relative to the status of the charitable donations of the extract is similar to the grant that, um, councilor Scarpelli added.

351
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:44,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, councilor Falco and I had the opportunity to tour the West Medford fire station.

352
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:50,175
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that was most alarming to me was the fact that the actual smoke detectors in the fire station don't work.

353
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:59,642
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd also like to further amend the resolution asking that an inspection be conducted to ensure that all of the fire alarms in our fire stations are operational, Mr. President.

354
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,023
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a fire in the fire station, and the firefighters don't know about it.

355
00:34:02,063 --> 00:34:03,925
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have a serious problem here.

356
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:06,506
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really think that's vital, especially

357
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:19,813
[SPEAKER_13]: when Council Marks brought this resolution forward in the interest of public safety and with a concern of public safety, um, you know, with the lights, um, same thing goes for having an operational smoke alarm in the building that they live in for their 24 hour shift, Mr. President.

358
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:26,738
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd ask that an inspection be conducted to ensure that all fire alarms in each station are operational and up to code.

359
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:27,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

360
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:29,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Also marks.

361
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:34,763
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and I've been saying this for a number of years now,

363
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:43,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Our municipal buildings, and I'm not sure if it works the same way on the school side, our municipal buildings are not reviewed on an annual basis.

364
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:56,878
[SPEAKER_10]: You would think, Mr. President, that the building commissioner would have an annual review of all our municipal buildings and make a list of what's needed and then move forward on repairs.

365
00:34:57,478 --> 00:34:59,359
[SPEAKER_10]: That does not happen on the municipal side.

366
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:00,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure about the school side.

367
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:04,267
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can tell you right now, it's not happening on the city side.

368
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:15,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And the city relies on the firefighters or the police department to bring forward initiatives and work on building maintenance.

369
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:18,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just not going to happen that way, Mr. President.

370
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:20,936
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're seeing the results of it.

371
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:27,660
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you go on Salem Street, and, you know, there's signs on almost all the windows, do not open the window.

372
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:31,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And I asked the captain, I said, why would you put a sign, do not open the window?

373
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,123
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, open the window.

374
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:40,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I opened it, Mr. President, and the spring-loaded mechanism was shot, and literally you could take your fingers off.

375
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,808
[SPEAKER_10]: It came down like a hatchet.

376
00:35:43,669 --> 00:35:48,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was every single window in the building, every single window.

377
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:51,233
[SPEAKER_10]: These are things, Mr. President,

378
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:59,982
[SPEAKER_10]: that the building commissioner should be going throughout all our buildings and writing a thorough report on the condition and the status of each building.

379
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:04,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, Mr. President, it's like a gag order.

380
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,288
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw it happen with the DPW yard.

381
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:19,279
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a building that should have been condemned for at least 10 years, and we went to the Board of Health, we went to the building commissioner as a council, and we said, please, will you go down and take a look at the DPW yard?

382
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:23,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the time they came back and they said they don't see any problem with it.

383
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:26,497
[SPEAKER_10]: The building should have been condemned, Mr. President.

384
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:28,698
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's a gag order.

385
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:37,940
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an unwritten gag order in this city that doesn't allow the administrative staff and the department heads to do their job.

386
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:48,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Because all you need is a set of eyes, Mr. President, to walk into any of these municipal buildings and you can see the lack of maintenance and what's going on.

387
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:53,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't fault the building commissioner, because he's on that gag order.

388
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:55,280
[SPEAKER_10]: He's on that gag order.

389
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,961
[SPEAKER_10]: He's worried that he'll lose his job if he brings up issues, Mr. President.

390
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:02,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a concern.

391
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:04,902
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a concern, Mr. President.

392
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:06,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And that needs to stop.

393
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:08,003
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to stop.

394
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:10,684
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, as a council, have to send that message out.

395
00:37:12,185 --> 00:37:13,765
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unacceptable, Mr. President.

396
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd ask anyone to take a look.

397
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone in the public is welcome to go into any of these city buildings.

398
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:22,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a walk in.

399
00:37:23,396 --> 00:37:24,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know what you see in the building.

400
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:32,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know if you think the condition is where you'd like to lay down for 24 hours a shift, Mr. President.

401
00:37:33,365 --> 00:37:34,166
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unacceptable.

402
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:47,337
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we as a council request that the building commissioner do an annual review on all our municipal buildings, and that it start effective tomorrow.

403
00:37:48,418 --> 00:37:50,099
[SPEAKER_10]: An annual review, Mr. President.

404
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,601
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to make that a separate motion.

405
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, yeah, if you want to make a separate motion.

406
00:37:55,403 --> 00:38:00,027
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be receiving annual reports on the condition of our buildings, Mr. President.

407
00:38:01,635 --> 00:38:10,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So then when the mayor comes forward and says, I'd like to expend $22 million for a new police station, we don't have to say, why do you need that, Madam President?

408
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:16,458
[SPEAKER_10]: We know, we're already armed with the information year after year on the needs of our facilities.

409
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't happen now.

410
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:28,140
[SPEAKER_10]: It should have happened with the library, it should have happened with the DPW, it should have happened with the police station, and it should have happened with all these fire stations, Mr. President.

411
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:34,801
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that that be part of the vote tonight too, in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

412
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:35,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

413
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:39,103
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, Councilor Falco.

414
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:40,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

415
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:42,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say I second that last motion.

416
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, we take a look at our buildings in our city.

417
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:48,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, our buildings are one of our most important assets on the books.

418
00:38:48,888 --> 00:38:51,669
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when, when, uh, you know, when,

419
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:57,452
[SPEAKER_07]: myself and Councilor Scarpelli went out and, you know, we looked at the, we're on the school committee, we looked out at the school buildings.

420
00:38:57,492 --> 00:39:08,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's to ensure that, you know, those buildings are going to be, you know, uh, kept up so that, you know, it ensures that those buildings are around for future generations of Method students.

421
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:19,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really need to make sure that we're doing the same thing with all city buildings and make sure that, um, you know, uh, all the routine maintenance has taken place and the preventive maintenance has taken place because that's, you know,

422
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:22,276
[SPEAKER_07]: buildings are expensive to replace.

423
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:23,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing that now at the police station.

424
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:27,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, we really need to make sure we stay on top of this issue.

425
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:32,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's a good resolution that, uh, we do get a report back from the, uh, building commissioner.

426
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:36,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's, uh, it's, it's something that we need to keep an eye on.

427
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:41,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like I said before, it's probably one of the most important assets that we have on the books is our buildings.

428
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:43,047
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

429
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:43,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

00:43:00,896 --> 00:43:01,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

465
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:01,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

466
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:02,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

467
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:03,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

468

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lone Curran?

469
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:04,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

470
00:43:05,178 --> 00:43:05,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks?

471
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:06,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

472
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:07,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:09,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

476
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven in the affirmative.

477
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,721
[SPEAKER_12]: A motion passes.

478
00:43:14,963 --> 00:43:32,809
[SPEAKER_12]: 17 297 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas new commercial and residential development is occurring throughout our city, whereas the exterior lighting from these developments is having a negative impact on our existing neighbors.

479
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:43,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved that the zoning and ordinance subcommittee develop an ordinance with regard to exterior lighting to provide clear guidelines for its installation,

480
00:43:43,425 --> 00:43:48,227
[SPEAKER_12]: and regulations that will limit the wattages and luminance of the outdoor lights.

481
00:43:48,748 --> 00:43:49,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

482
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:51,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

483
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:59,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I've received a number of phone calls in a number of different neighborhoods, uh, over the past couple of months regarding lighting, uh, from various buildings, uh, throughout our city.

484
00:43:59,953 --> 00:44:12,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, uh, you know, I received a call from a resident down in Emerson street actually, uh, specifically, um, with regard to the built a new building, they put a lighting on the outside, but the lighting literally shines,

485
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:15,633
[SPEAKER_07]: into this person's house.

486
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:21,216
[SPEAKER_07]: It really has a negative impact on his quality of life at night.

487
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:29,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And if he wants to go spend time in his yard, the yard is lit up all the time and it's a problem.

488
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a problem in other corners of our city as well.

489
00:44:34,043 --> 00:44:41,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I looked into it and I talked to the code enforcement officer, he had mentioned to me that we actually do not have an ordinance with regard to exterior lighting.

490
00:44:42,255 --> 00:45:05,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I bring this resolution forward tonight because I think this is something that we should look into, especially since we're hearing about more and more development in our city, we need to make sure that we have regulations and ordinances in place to help guide development and developers to make sure that our existing neighborhoods, you know, are not negatively impacted by, you know, lighting that's too bright.

491
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I agree we need to have lighting, I think lighting is a great

492
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:14,873
[SPEAKER_07]: crime deterrent, but I also believe that it needs to be, um, you know, not too bright.

493
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:16,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be regulated to some degree.

494
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:31,056
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I just wanted to bring this forward tonight and if he could move it to, uh, um, the subcommittee on, um, zoning to work, uh, to work on a resolution, uh, I would, uh, yeah, I think that's a good idea and I'd like to move approval.

495
00:45:31,516 --> 00:45:31,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

496
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:34,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Mr. President.

497
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:39,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think that this is a great initiative and it's something that the subcommittee should certainly look into.

498
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:53,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to amend the paper to request recommendations from the building department and the electrical division, as well as the chief of police, as to what recommendations they may have in terms of outdoor lights, wattages, lumens, so on and so forth.

499
00:45:53,928 --> 00:46:00,611
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that when we're talking about wattage and lumens, that's a little bit outside the level of expertise of everybody behind this rail.

500
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:02,431
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that would be very helpful, Mr. President.

501
00:46:02,451 --> 00:46:06,273
[SPEAKER_13]: But one concern I do have is obviously the ability to ensure the public safety.

502
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:13,825
[SPEAKER_13]: And Chief Sacco has appeared before this council on a number of times in the past indicating that one of the number one deterrents to crime is well-lit streets.

503
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:18,988
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're going to have to walk a fine line here and there's going to have to be some balancing, Mr. President.

504
00:46:19,008 --> 00:46:22,931
[SPEAKER_13]: But I certainly think it's a worthwhile endeavor that deserves exploration, research, and study.

505
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:23,912
[SPEAKER_13]: And I move for approval.

506
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:24,972
[SPEAKER_13]: As amended.

507
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:27,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Dello Russo.

508
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:30,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I think this is a very thoughtful measure.

509
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:39,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank my colleague for this and, uh, I, uh, eagerly look forward to, uh, addressing this issue in subcommittee.

510
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:40,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

511
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:51,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Councilor Dello Russo on the motion as, as amended by councilor knife, name and address for the record, please.

512
00:46:55,134 --> 00:46:55,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

513
00:46:55,514 --> 00:46:58,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman street method, Massachusetts.

514
00:46:59,556 --> 00:46:59,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

515
00:47:00,255 --> 00:47:03,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm speaking about the subject of the new growth.

516
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,361
[SPEAKER_12]: We are not talking about new growth.

517
00:47:07,722 --> 00:47:08,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about lighting.

518
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:09,503
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about lighting.

519
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:16,249
[SPEAKER_08]: It says here, I believe, whereas new commercial and residential development is occurring throughout the city.

520
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,411
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how the paragraph started.

521
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:20,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And it talks about lighting.

522
00:47:20,453 --> 00:47:20,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

523
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to talk about lighting and the new growth.

524
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:26,298
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all in the same paragraph of the resolution, I believe it's called.

525
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:27,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, sir.

526
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's a nice idea to keep the blind and lights out of our eyes.

527
00:47:35,712 --> 00:47:35,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

528
00:47:36,032 --> 00:47:36,872
[SPEAKER_08]: The councilor fell.

529
00:47:36,932 --> 00:47:38,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Go appreciate that.

530
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:57,018
[SPEAKER_08]: But more importantly, I feel it would be better to amend this and add to the resolution to make sure that any and all new real estate tax growth be first used to offset any and all prop two and a half real estate tax increases.

531
00:47:57,558 --> 00:47:59,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I don't believe there is any law,

532
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,231
[SPEAKER_08]: that mandates that the city must increase the real estate taxes at all.

533
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:21,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Therefore, but if you still insist on raising our real estate taxes, again, I'll allow the last 50 years plus stand and at least use our new growth tax monies to offset any prop two and a half proposed increases.

534
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:26,415
[SPEAKER_08]: And for once, give the middle class a break.

535
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:29,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Simply put, I'm wondering,

536
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:57,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Out loud, if you or anyone in political power here in 02155 can finally get this extra new growth, real estate taxes, to help lower the middle class real estate tax bill, instead of this so-called new real estate tax growth, as stated in the paragraph, is working against us, as in we need more schools, police, fire,

537
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:10,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And it adds to our total of last year's real estate tax bill, not to mention the infrastructure costs.

538
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:17,996
[SPEAKER_08]: So it adds more money to the inflated bill of the real estate tax, which is over $100 million to that levy.

539
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:24,583
[SPEAKER_08]: So then, meaning next year, they're going to take 2.5% of an overinflated bill.

540
00:49:26,288 --> 00:49:33,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody have any ideas to help the middle class, especially the lower middle class while it still exists, to help the middle class?

541
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:37,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone on this new growth business?

542
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:41,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

543
00:49:41,698 --> 00:49:42,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your silence.

544
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:43,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

545
00:49:45,661 --> 00:49:47,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're talking about, oh, okay, thank you.

546
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:53,746
[SPEAKER_06]: With regards to the new development, I know that's part of it, and the lighting, there was a meeting

547
00:49:54,279 --> 00:50:08,528
[SPEAKER_06]: last week that Council Marks and President Caraviello and I attended with regards to the potential redevelopment of Salem Street and Canal Street, complex 21 potential units or less.

548
00:50:09,229 --> 00:50:15,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing that did surprise me, which I thought was a great thing, was they had a lighting expert at that meeting.

549
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:21,417
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we could look into, I don't know if we could ask the question, if you don't mind me amending the paper.

550
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:23,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a requirement?

551
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Because maybe it would be something we could potentially ask developers to provide a lighting.

552
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was interesting.

553
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:36,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they had an expert on everything, so I'm really not sure with regards to which ones were required and which ones weren't.

554
00:50:36,877 --> 00:50:39,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But we could maybe get an update and look into that.

555
00:50:39,298 --> 00:50:48,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even if it's just on a small basis, having somebody to at least identify what the lighting plan is is going to be beneficial for the neighbors in the neighborhood.

556
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was an interesting

557
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:52,059
[SPEAKER_06]: portion of the three hour meeting we attended last week.

558
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:58,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could look into that further and ask the question, is a lighting specialist required?

559
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:00,404
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, when is it required?

560
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:02,265
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't mind.

561
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:06,067
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can amend that motion, Mr. Clerk.

562
00:51:06,687 --> 00:51:10,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is a going to the zone.

563
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:11,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we can ask that in committee.

564
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:22,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

565
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:33,119
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Lungo-Koehn, do I have a second?

566
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Second by Councilor Knight.

567
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:38,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, roll call has been requested.

568
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:44,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco made the motion, seconded by Councilor Knight.

569
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:50,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dello Russo?

570
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:51,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Affirmative.

571
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:52,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

572
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:53,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

573
00:51:53,706 --> 00:51:54,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

574
00:51:54,307 --> 00:51:54,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

575
00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:55,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kerr?

576
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:56,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

577
00:51:56,688 --> 00:51:57,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks?

578
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:57,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

579
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

580
00:51:59,068 --> 00:51:59,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

581
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:00,669
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

582
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:01,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

583
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:02,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven in the affirmative.

584
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:03,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

585
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:14,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules, to take hands at the paper clip.

586
00:52:14,454 --> 00:52:16,475
[SPEAKER_12]: 17-299 offered by Councilor Knight.

587
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved that the DPW Commissioner,

588
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:28,529
[SPEAKER_12]: direct the engineering department to provide the city council with the construction schedule for resurfacing of Evans Street.

589
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:29,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

590
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:36,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, this was a matter that came up before this council a number of times, most recently before the cold months when the ground froze.

591
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:43,634
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been brought to my attention that they were going to be having some pre-construction meetings and a construction schedule was going to be established.

592
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:47,915
[SPEAKER_13]: So for that reason, Mr. President, I think that the residents on Evans Street have waited long enough

593
00:52:48,557 --> 00:52:50,498
[SPEAKER_13]: And this roadway needs to be repaved.

594
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:53,960
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm asking for a copy of the construction schedule from the engineering department, Mr. President.

595
00:52:55,561 --> 00:53:05,467
[SPEAKER_13]: As I sit here and think about this resolution and the need for resurfacing on Evans Street, I do also recall that we had an extended discussion relative to Parris Street as well.

596
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:11,891
[SPEAKER_13]: And these two projects were kind of working hand in hand as the council discussed them in the past, Mr. President, over the spring.

597
00:53:12,532 --> 00:53:17,655
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm asking that we amend the paper to also include a breakdown for the construction schedule of Parris Street and Evans Street.

598
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,141
[SPEAKER_13]: and I move for approval.

599
00:53:19,661 --> 00:53:19,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

600
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,964
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

601
00:53:24,344 --> 00:53:24,784
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor?

602
00:53:24,804 --> 00:53:24,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

603
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:28,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

604
00:53:28,587 --> 00:53:32,449
[SPEAKER_12]: 17-300 offered by Councilor Knight.

605
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:42,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved that the DPW Commissioner direct the Engineering Department to respond to the following items outlined in Council Resolution 16-404,

606
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,012
[SPEAKER_12]: adopted by the council on 4, 19, 2016.

607
00:53:52,354 --> 00:54:11,969
[SPEAKER_12]: One, listing of all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed or are scheduled to perform any digging or excavation work from January 1st, 2014 to date, including the street addresses of where the work took place or was scheduled to take place.

608
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:12,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Number two,

609
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:30,326
[SPEAKER_12]: A listing of all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed any digging or excavation work that have not been completed in accordance with the established City of Medford standards from January 14th to date, including the street addresses of where the work took place.

610
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:41,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Number three, a complete schedule of repair work for all roadways and sidewalks where public utilities have performed any digging or excavation work

611
00:54:41,884 --> 00:54:53,929
[SPEAKER_12]: that have not been completed in accordance with established City of Medford standards from January 2014 to date, including the street address of where the work is to take place.

612
00:54:54,229 --> 00:54:54,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

613
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:56,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Mr. President.

614
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:07,334
[SPEAKER_13]: This was issued last April relative to a response to some concerns about excavation work done up in the Lawrence Estates along Crocker, along Traincroft, along Lincoln Road.

615
00:55:08,714 --> 00:55:10,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, it was a six-part

616
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:12,580
[SPEAKER_13]: resolution that was sent to the administration.

617
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:18,704
[SPEAKER_13]: A number of the items were addressed that were related to trees and utility wires.

618
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:27,670
[SPEAKER_13]: But we still have questions and concerns, Mr. President, about who's watching the shop when it comes to public utilities doing trench work, what type of trench management system they have in place.

619
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,793
[SPEAKER_13]: So ultimately, this resolution asks what's been done and what's scheduled to be done and where.

620
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:38,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Has the utility met its obligation to the City of Medford to return the street into the condition that it was left in?

621
00:55:39,397 --> 00:55:40,438
[SPEAKER_13]: And if not,

622
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:44,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are the street addresses where this work hasn't been returned to the pristine condition, Mr. President?

623
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:47,077
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that this is an important issue in our community.

624
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:57,081
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also think that it's something that needs to be looked at a little bit closer because, quite frankly, I think that the public utilities are running roughshod over the public ways in our city.

625
00:55:57,501 --> 00:56:10,145
[SPEAKER_13]: This coupled with the fact that the Everett to Winchester project has been approved and the pipeline through the Winthrop Street Corridor has looked like it's going to happen.

626
00:56:10,759 --> 00:56:18,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, within the next couple of years, Mr. President, I think it's very important that we hold our public utilities accountable for the work that they do in our community to ensure strong quality of life in the neighborhoods.

627
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:19,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

628
00:56:19,706 --> 00:56:20,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

629
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:25,470
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, I just said, I thank my colleague for bringing this up.

630
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:39,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this has been a bone of contentions with myself that making sure that we hold, um, um, these contractors, um, to what their intent intended to, uh, complete with the city's,

631
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:50,845
[SPEAKER_09]: road works and I think that if we can, I'd like to see if there's a way we can reach out to the community itself if they have some construction work.

632
00:56:50,865 --> 00:57:03,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that we have a neighbour in the heights had contacted me that the contractor last year put down the hot top but didn't replace the cement on the sidewalk.

633
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:07,357
[SPEAKER_09]: So even if they could reach out to the city administration

634
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:10,202
[SPEAKER_09]: the C click fix.

635
00:57:10,262 --> 00:57:17,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the, if there are any other locations that the community can help us with some of those addresses to be, to be helpful.

636
00:57:17,706 --> 00:57:20,528
[SPEAKER_09]: But I appreciate Mr. Knight for bringing this up.

637
00:57:20,608 --> 00:57:26,251
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a, it's, it's an issue that I hear way too often our community from neighbors.

638
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:27,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

639
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:28,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

640
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:29,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scott.

641
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:30,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dello Russo.

642
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:35,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this up and speaking on it.

643
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:35,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

644
00:57:37,472 --> 00:57:52,804
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm grateful for the thorough work and wording of this resolution, I'm disappointed, Mr. President, that so much of it we're hearing again, and we haven't gotten the answers in the past that we've asked for.

645
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:55,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

646
00:57:56,066 --> 00:58:04,593
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by, by Councilor Scarpelli, all those, all those, Councilor Monks?

647
00:58:05,593 --> 00:58:06,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Monks?

648
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:11,792
[SPEAKER_10]: response back from your resolution, I think regarding Winthrop street in front of the American legion.

649
00:58:12,332 --> 00:58:14,672
[SPEAKER_10]: We have not, we have not got a response back.

650
00:58:16,153 --> 00:58:23,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if we, if the council wouldn't mind, because that, that was a road work that was done by an outside contract.

651
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:25,236
[SPEAKER_12]: The heads now as they go over the right.

652
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:25,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

653
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:29,997
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can amend that Mr. Clerk, councilor knife.

654
00:58:30,588 --> 00:58:42,910
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly have no problem amending the paper, and I know that Councilor Marks talks a lot about thermoplastic sidewalks, and that bump right there is probably the most effective speed bump that I've seen in the community in a number of years.

655
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:48,431
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe we have an alternative to thermoplastic speed bumps, Mr. President, going forward.

656
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:59,073
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by President Karygiannis.

657
00:58:59,353 --> 00:58:59,993
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favour?

658
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

659
00:59:04,443 --> 00:59:05,284
[SPEAKER_12]: We have two more.

660
00:59:07,326 --> 00:59:20,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Phyllis Patton on the moment of occasion of her 90th birthday.

661
00:59:20,577 --> 00:59:21,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

662
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:24,128
[SPEAKER_13]: 80th birthday, Mr. President.

663
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:26,069
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Mrs. Patton.

664
00:59:26,089 --> 00:59:28,991
[SPEAKER_13]: She's been great to us down there, especially at St.

665
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:32,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph's School, but I don't want to give her another 10 years, Mr. President.

666
00:59:32,894 --> 00:59:35,776
[SPEAKER_13]: So... Oh, I'm sorry.

667
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:37,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't read your writing.

668
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:37,858

00:59:38,058 --> 00:59:39,679
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize.

00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:40,720
[SPEAKER_12]: 80th birthday, Mr. President.

672
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Anybody involved with St.

673
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:45,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Joe's Parish has in one way or another come across Miss Phyllis Patton.

674
00:59:45,963 --> 00:59:51,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I first met her, I think, when I was in first grade going through CCD, and then I had the pleasure of

675
00:59:51,915 --> 01:00:00,799
[SPEAKER_13]: playing some sports with her son, Ross, who was a great athlete growing up and, um, have been able to develop a relationship with her daughter, Robin, over the years, um, and her husband, Billy Raymond.

676
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,681
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, it's with great pleasure that I bring this resolution forward, Mr. President.

677
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:08,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I want to wish Phyllis a happy 80th birthday, although I don't see her as much as I used to in the past.

678
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:12,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, she's in our thoughts and I just want to hope that she had a wonderful day and wish her a happy birthday.

679
01:00:13,065 --> 01:00:13,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

680
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:14,146
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

681
01:00:14,646 --> 01:00:14,726
Aye.

682
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:15,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

683
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:18,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Offered by councilor Scarpelli.

684
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:24,926
[SPEAKER_12]: and President Caraviello, Councilor Falco, and Councilor Marks.

685
01:00:25,546 --> 01:00:37,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deepest, sincere condolences to the family of Jim Coughlin, a former teacher in the Medford Public Schools on his recent passing.

686
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:39,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

687
01:00:40,218 --> 01:00:41,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

688
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Coughlin was, I think everybody here one way or another knew his

689
01:00:47,663 --> 01:00:52,385
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, Mr. Kaufman himself is a former phys ed teacher and the method public schools.

690
01:00:52,985 --> 01:00:56,346
[SPEAKER_09]: He was also a coach at the high school level.

691
01:00:57,006 --> 01:01:01,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, um, he ran the pool for us for a little bit over on main street.

692
01:01:02,568 --> 01:01:14,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if you know, Jim, um, you know that, uh, he had a really, uh, look like mean exterior, but it wasn't, he was a great person.

693
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:15,393
[SPEAKER_09]: He was, um,

694
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:22,835
[SPEAKER_09]: a man who graduated Norwich with a military background that his sons and family have followed.

695
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:30,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that he meant so much to our community, and his wife, Paula, who also works in our system.

696
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:37,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to reach out to them and give them our thoughts and prayers.

697
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:44,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that yesterday, two days ago, during their week, I made a promise in that

698
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:54,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be reaching out to the state delegation, something that they brought to my attention, that our cruisers do not have AEDs.

699
01:01:55,739 --> 01:01:58,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that you just overlook and you don't know.

700
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:12,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And something that was alarming to me as I talked to the family is that the cruiser that was there, if they were fitted with the AED, that Jim possibly could have survived.

701
01:02:14,745 --> 01:02:19,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I will make it a promise to reach out to state delegation to see if we could change this in the state.

702
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:21,430
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was the wishes of the family.

703
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:23,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And I made sure that I'd bring that up.

704
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:28,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, and it's a fight that I'll take on for Jim and the Coughlin family.

705
01:02:28,616 --> 01:02:33,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, uh, we're going to miss him and, um, and, uh, prayers to the family.

706
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:34,840
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

707
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

708
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:36,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

709
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:37,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

710
01:02:38,103 --> 01:02:43,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I had the privilege of, uh, having, uh, Jim Coughlin is a physical education teacher.

711
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:48,337
[SPEAKER_07]: when I was in high school, a number of times, through my four years at Medford High School.

712
01:02:48,437 --> 01:02:56,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Great guy, always very supportive, very encouraging, especially when I told him I was running for public office.

713
01:02:57,382 --> 01:03:07,627
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hadn't seen him for a while, and then when my kids started taking swimming lessons down at Tufts Pool, I bumped into him there and got some, you know, kind of, you know, friendship continued from there.

714
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:10,769
[SPEAKER_07]: But just a really nice, all-around guy.

715
01:03:11,547 --> 01:03:13,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, he was, he was no nonsense.

716
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,249
[SPEAKER_07]: He was, he was great.

717
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,669
[SPEAKER_07]: He always told it like it was.

718
01:03:15,889 --> 01:03:21,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, he will, he will, he will be sorely missed, but, um, just, just fabulous person.

719
01:03:21,412 --> 01:03:22,133
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

720
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:22,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

721
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:27,035
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could please stand for a moment of council locks.

722
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:28,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

723
01:03:28,616 --> 01:03:32,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I too, uh, would like to, uh, echo my colleagues sentiments.

724
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:35,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I've known the coffin family for a number of years.

725
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and, uh, I too had, uh, Mr. Coughlin,

726
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:42,683
[SPEAKER_10]: and Mr. English at gym at the high school.

727
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:50,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And I could tell you, if you did not pay attention while you were in gym class, there were ramifications.

728
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:53,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of them being those big, round, red balls.

729
01:03:55,088 --> 01:03:59,850
[SPEAKER_10]: If you were talking or out of line, you would quickly find one of those next to your head.

730
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:08,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, Jimmy, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, he had a tough shell, but a heart of gold.

731
01:04:08,768 --> 01:04:13,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was just a good family man, a great husband, a father, a grandfather.

732
01:04:14,509 --> 01:04:16,749
[SPEAKER_10]: And he won't be sorely missed, Mr. President.

733
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:18,610
[SPEAKER_12]: The President Thank you, Vice President Marx.

734
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:20,530
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could stand for a moment of silence, please.

735
01:04:29,672 --> 01:04:30,652
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll run the suspension.

736
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:31,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight.

737
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:34,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight Yes, Mr. President.

738
01:04:34,513 --> 01:04:36,433
[SPEAKER_13]: This council put forward a number of resolutions.

739
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:43,905
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, requesting that the administration add to the names of the Veterans Memorial Park on Winthrop street.

740
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:50,089
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, in our packets this week we have received a letter announcing that the mayor will be commissioning an additional plaque.

741
01:04:50,569 --> 01:04:53,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, last week we discussed this at the meeting, we made the announcement.

742
01:04:54,032 --> 01:04:57,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, however, in our packets today, we also have the eligibility requirements, Mr. President.

743
01:04:58,074 --> 01:05:04,498
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to be clear that, um, for consideration to get your name put on the Veterans Memorial at Winthrop street,

744
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,341
[SPEAKER_13]: you have to have an application postmarked by March 15th, which is just around the corner, Mr. President, next week.

745
01:05:11,262 --> 01:05:18,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Eligibility requirements would include that you enlisted while a resident of Medford and being honorably discharged, but there are also exemptions.

746
01:05:20,664 --> 01:05:29,487
[SPEAKER_13]: If you enlisted from another city or town but resided in Medford for no less than 30 years and were a World War II or Korean War veteran, then you'd be eligible for placement on the monument.

747
01:05:31,763 --> 01:05:37,927
[SPEAKER_13]: enlisted from another city or town but resided in Medford for no less than 20 years and were a Vietnam veteran, you would be eligible for placement on the monument.

748
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:50,296
[SPEAKER_13]: If you served in Operation Desert Storm or Desert Shield or Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and enlisted after 9-11-2001, you do not have an entry requirement.

749
01:05:50,336 --> 01:05:52,578
[SPEAKER_13]: However, you must be a current Medford resident.

750
01:05:53,418 --> 01:06:00,223
[SPEAKER_13]: For any further information, Mr. President, you can contact, obviously, the members of the Veterans Service Subcommittee, the Director of Veterans Service, or the administration.

751
01:06:00,546 --> 01:06:08,252
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did want to be sure that this was out there, because a number of individuals in the community have contacted me relative to getting their loved ones or their own names placed on the plaque.

752
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:29,547
[SPEAKER_13]: And the list that we have here, Mr. President, is a list to date corrected on 2-21-17, which outlines Patrick Andriotola, John O'Brien, Richard Perella, Robert Emma, Carl Hicks, George White, and Calvin Chin as veterans that are eligible for placement on the monument.

753
01:06:30,794 --> 01:06:31,332
[SPEAKER_13]: reckon that.

754
01:06:31,694 --> 01:06:35,337
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a number of other individuals in our community that are eligible for placement, Mr. President.

755
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:38,700
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last time it was updated was in 2014.

756
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,121
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was three years ago.

757
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:53,051
[SPEAKER_13]: And as World War II veterans and members of our greatest generation continue to age, the opportunities for them to wait two and three and four years to see their name put on this plaque aren't necessarily there anymore.

758
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:55,713
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's very important that we get this information out there.

759
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:58,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank my council colleagues for entertaining me.

760
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would ask that this matter be received and placed on file.

761
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Eden is here from, uh, uh, the transcript.

762
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:08,462
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's something, if you can get that in the paper for this week, it'd be greatly appreciated.

763
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:10,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, all right.

764
01:07:10,683 --> 01:07:11,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

765
01:07:13,604 --> 01:07:14,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

766
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:16,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I yield to Councilor Marks.

767
01:07:16,726 --> 01:07:17,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

768
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:24,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just thinking that regarding notification, it would be nice maybe if we can do a reverse 9-1-1 call to the entire city.

769
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:31,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I agree with, uh, Councilor Knight that, uh, you know, especially for someone that was in World War II and,

770
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:32,913
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, the Korean war and so forth.

771
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:36,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, they're not getting any younger and, uh, time is of the essence.

772
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:54,540
[SPEAKER_12]: So, uh, if the administration to, to, uh, have the mayor, we, we rest the mayor to have a reverse 911 call to the veteran, to all the community requesting all veterans, uh, to get their name in before they take a cutoff date.

773
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:55,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

774
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

775
01:08:00,963 --> 01:08:07,885
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under suspension, I just wanted to mention really quick that tomorrow night is our monthly community police meeting.

01:09:53,702 --> 01:09:54,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

809
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:55,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

810
01:09:56,242 --> 01:10:03,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I stated last week, when you point a finger at one person, you're pointing three back at yourself.

811
01:10:03,164 --> 01:10:08,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody wiser than me said, when you make a complaint, when you criticize,

812
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:14,414
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have at least three solutions ready for that to solve the problem.

813
01:10:14,874 --> 01:10:18,835
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that spirit, I rewrote the Medford's proclamation.

814
01:10:20,275 --> 01:10:27,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, our nation was originally established for the purpose of expanding the British Empire and for the purpose of supplying England with its natural resources.

815
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:34,718
[SPEAKER_00]: It thereby established a few key colonies in Massachusetts and Virginia, Medford being among them.

816
01:10:35,378 --> 01:10:38,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, the British colonists, in order to achieve their goal,

817
01:10:38,804 --> 01:10:43,365
[SPEAKER_00]: had but one obstacle, the Pawtuckets, who were already living here.

818
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:53,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So the British colonists began taking the land of the native peoples, and in some cases, enslaving them, while others died of disease and famine, Medford being among them.

819
01:10:54,368 --> 01:11:07,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the British Empire was a participant in both the practice of indentured servitude and the institution of African slavery, Medford being among them, we therefore acknowledge that our nation did not start out as a perfect one.

820
01:11:08,538 --> 01:11:34,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, the colonists eventually revolted against British rule for grievances not settled, and on April 19th, 1775, 59 of Medford's men fought in the battles of Lexington and Concord, resulting in war between England and the burgeoning United States, having won their independence, yet still carrying remnants of its old colonial institutions, slavery among them.

821
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, the colonists became visionaries

822
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:50,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Having just been released as subjects of a king, they therefore enshrined certain individual protections from the government, knowing the potential abuses of government as they drew up our country's U.S.

823
01:11:50,275 --> 01:11:50,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution.

824
01:11:51,876 --> 01:11:53,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, it was the U.S.

825
01:11:53,517 --> 01:12:05,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution itself that allowed our own Medford abolitionists, Prince Hall and Lydia Maria Child, the ability to use this most powerful of all government instruments through the enshrined rights of speech

826
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:21,284
[SPEAKER_00]: press, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances, whereas Sergeant William Lawrence was the first of many volunteers to give his life for Medford and our nation in the Battle of Bull Run during the Civil War as a member of the Lawrence Light Guard.

827
01:12:25,344 --> 01:12:34,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas our Medford citizens and soldiers were both instrumental in arguing in the greatest of all debates in this nation, the unresolved issue of human bondage

828
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:54,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Hall and Child led the consciousness of the majority in favor of the minority and giving rise to the Civil War, which freed our nation of its original design and liberated all peoples held against their will by adding the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S.

829
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:54,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Constitution.

830
01:12:55,385 --> 01:12:55,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost done.

831
01:12:56,585 --> 01:13:03,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we who are fortunate enough to live in this most blessed of cities, knowing and understanding our history,

832
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:06,112
[SPEAKER_00]: are especially dedicated to justice for all.

833
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:10,295
[SPEAKER_00]: We in Medford know the power of one voice and all that it can accomplish.

834
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:19,421
[SPEAKER_00]: We in Medford have lived among those who have laid down their lives in the pursuit of our nation's freedoms and cherish those rights unequivocally.

835
01:13:20,202 --> 01:13:33,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Having shed blood in both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars to defeat tyranny externally and internally, we are dedicated to protecting the rights of individuals to live without fear of persecution,

836
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:36,981
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter their race or any other minority designation.

837
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:47,003
[SPEAKER_00]: We value the individual as a whole person to be respected, freed from fear, and hold up the ability of the individual to live life to their fullest.

838
01:13:47,863 --> 01:13:55,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford values all thoughts and perspectives, regardless of how unpopular the person is who states them or how unpopular the concept may be.

839
01:13:56,404 --> 01:13:57,985
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe all voices are welcome.

840
01:13:58,765 --> 01:14:01,045
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much, and I'll give this to the mayor tomorrow.

841
01:14:01,786 --> 01:14:02,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Ms.

842
01:14:02,186 --> 01:14:02,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Barton.

843
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:02,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

844
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:11,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

845
01:14:11,409 --> 01:14:12,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by Councilor Falgo.

846
01:14:12,909 --> 01:14:13,949
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor, aye.

847
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:24,592
[SPEAKER_12]: The records, the table records of the meeting of February 14, 2017 were passed to Councilor Dello Russo.

848
01:14:24,912 --> 01:14:27,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Dello Russo, after your exhaustive investigation,

849
01:14:28,517 --> 01:14:33,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, after a thorough and exhaustive investigation... Do you deem them in order?

850
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:53,812
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that the following correction be made to the records of that meeting, under paper number 17-079, which made the whole committee report, and that Councilor Falco be marked as in attendance, present at that meeting.

851
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:55,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

852
01:14:57,252 --> 01:15:02,975
[SPEAKER_12]: The records of the meeting of February 28, 2017 were passed to Councilor Knight.

853
01:15:03,476 --> 01:15:05,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

854
01:15:17,644 --> 01:15:26,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I found the papers in order with the exception of paper 17-088 and subsection A amended by Councilor Knight that Massachusetts Highway Department

855
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:29,592
[SPEAKER_13]: provide a maintenance schedule for the area.

856
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:38,818
[SPEAKER_13]: This, uh, correction has been emailed to the city clerk and also under item B amended by Councilor Caraviello, the state representative did not receive a copy on the resolution and amendment.

857
01:15:39,038 --> 01:15:40,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the two changes that needed to be made.

858
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I've emailed the copy of those to the city clerk.

859
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:44,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I'd move for approval as amended.

860
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:46,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

861
01:15:46,644 --> 01:15:47,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Lococo.

862
01:15:48,405 --> 01:15:50,206
[SPEAKER_06]: After we take that vote, just a public announcement.

863
01:15:50,627 --> 01:15:51,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

864
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:53,829
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by council on eight to accept the records.

865
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded by councilor Scarpelli.

866
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:56,271
[SPEAKER_12]: All the favor.

867
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:56,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

868
01:15:57,806 --> 01:16:05,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to announce that this Sunday is the fourth annual Running of the Leprechauns, 5K, benefiting the Boston Children's Hospital.

869
01:16:06,169 --> 01:16:09,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Sunday morning, starts at 11 a.m.

870
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:12,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe registration begins at 9.30, 10.

871
01:16:13,051 --> 01:16:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: That's at 321 Winthrop Street in Medford.

872
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:19,092
[SPEAKER_06]: It starts in Medford, 5K, goes through Medford Square.

873
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:23,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Great cause, so I suggest anybody, it's gonna be cold, but it'll be fun.

874
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:25,361
[SPEAKER_06]: where you get your green on.

875
01:16:26,202 --> 01:16:26,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I will do my errands.

876
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:29,623
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am a, I am beneficiary of the children's hospital.

877
01:16:29,983 --> 01:16:31,163
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will be there.

878
01:16:33,104 --> 01:16:36,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm running on the motion to adjourn.

879
01:16:36,145 --> 01:16:36,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

880
01:16:36,385 --> 01:16:38,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you want, I'm sorry.

881
01:16:38,546 --> 01:16:40,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you want to speak?

882
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:46,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

883
01:16:46,693 --> 01:16:47,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

884
01:16:47,374 --> 01:16:47,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

885
01:16:48,715 --> 01:16:49,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

886
01:16:49,936 --> 01:16:53,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Sharon Diaso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Avenue, Medford.

887
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:53,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

888
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:55,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question.

889
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:11,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my friends and I were wondering what the report summation was for the committee on the whole meeting regarding the spending plan for the architect $2 million bill for the police station.

890
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:13,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Briefly, how does that stand?

891
01:17:13,894 --> 01:17:14,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And also,

892
01:17:16,861 --> 01:17:22,402
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering, is there any other way that's less affordable?

893
01:17:23,383 --> 01:17:34,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that inflation sets in, but I believe a few weeks ago, Councilor Marks had presented a report that was presented by an engineer that was $350,000.

894
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:42,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I know things increase in three and a half years, but I'm certainly hoping, and we are, a whole bunch of us, that a $2 million bill

895
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:54,595
[SPEAKER_01]: is not being put on the city, I would assume that there are many, many people who you know yourselves through doing work in the city that can do a more affordable appraisal on those buildings.

896
01:17:55,355 --> 01:18:10,522
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides that, why in the world would the mayor or anyone think of a $21 million project when the outside structure of that building, which has been looked at by contractor friends of my own who have had business there, called me and wanted to know,

897
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:12,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sound.

898
01:18:12,825 --> 01:18:27,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is the whole police force and the chief waiting all these years when you could have built up a floor, sandblasted or waterblasted the building, and gutted the inside and cleaned it for those poor people all these years?

899
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:32,411
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand why everything is waiting until the 11th hour for ruthless spending.

900
01:18:32,731 --> 01:18:34,712
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd like to know the status of that, please.

901
01:18:35,332 --> 01:18:38,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're pawns, but we're trying to use our imaginations.

902
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:45,041
[SPEAKER_01]: to accommodate those policemen in a long waiting of years and to help the taxpayers a little bit in the community.

903
01:18:45,461 --> 01:18:46,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

904
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:46,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

905
01:18:46,741 --> 01:18:47,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

906
01:18:48,222 --> 01:18:54,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to answer a question through the chair, I'm not sure if you saw last week's meeting, but we took a few votes.

907
01:18:55,505 --> 01:19:01,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It passed for its first reading, and then I was going to ask the clerk, when will it be up for its third reading before the council?

908
01:19:03,069 --> 01:19:05,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor, when will it be up for its third reading?

909
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:07,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Two weeks, three weeks?

910
01:19:09,931 --> 01:19:10,851
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on the agenda.

911
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:14,512
[SPEAKER_11]: So no, I don't know if I made the paper this week.

912
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:25,894
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be, it'll be in this Thursday's edition of the transcript because the transcript goes to press at I think eight o'clock on Tuesday.

913
01:19:25,914 --> 01:19:27,735
[SPEAKER_12]: So sometimes it doesn't make it in there.

914
01:19:28,075 --> 01:19:31,276
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll be on on the nine and then 10 days after that.

915
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:37,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably so March 21st meeting will, it will take its third reading by vote of the city council.

916
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's when you maybe want to come speak in opposition or make your voice heard.

917
01:19:44,582 --> 01:19:50,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're hoping that you can come up with a devise another plan that's less costly than $2 million to have an architect.

918
01:19:51,405 --> 01:19:55,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't anyone think of any other person or company?

919
01:19:57,107 --> 01:20:09,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how a mayor can just come in new and be part of the budget directing in the city and have a plan devised by some architect, who I'm sure was

920
01:20:10,124 --> 01:20:16,947
[SPEAKER_01]: quite capable, how could it jump from a $350,000 company to $2 million?

921
01:20:18,508 --> 01:20:21,189
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't even imagine how someone came up with that figure.

922
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

923
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:23,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

924
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:34,036
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor answered us through the chair on February 27th, said on the 14th it is 10% of budget cost and the actual loan order is for $2 million.

925
01:20:34,076 --> 01:20:36,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's believing that that's 10% of the actual budget cost.

926
01:20:39,169 --> 01:20:39,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was the number.

927
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:40,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right.

928
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:41,371
[SPEAKER_06]: A million seven million seven.

929
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:47,074
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was the actual number of the budget that council and I would like to speak.

930
01:20:47,094 --> 01:20:57,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Mr. President, um, Mr. Cito, Mr. Sisto raises a number of good questions and we've got a number of good answers from the administration, um, that are all public record that have been sent to this council.

931
01:20:57,701 --> 01:21:04,506
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, I don't think there'd be a problem if you gave your address to the city messenger, the city clerk could provide you with copies of what we received as well.

932
01:21:04,546 --> 01:21:07,348
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd like to see copies of the financials that the council received.

933
01:21:09,004 --> 01:21:09,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

934
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:13,733
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Knight.

935
01:21:13,973 --> 01:21:14,634
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favour?
