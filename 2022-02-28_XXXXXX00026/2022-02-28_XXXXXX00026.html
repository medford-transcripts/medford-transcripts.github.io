    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=4.532">Hey</a>  Medford Bites listeners. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=6.192">In</a>  today's episode, I talk with the owner of a barber shop in West Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=10.513">Interestingly</a>  enough, the first black female business in West Medford was a hairdressing salon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=16.675">Fausenia</a>  Booker was trained at Elizabeth Oliver Newton's West Medford Basement Salon before Fausenia and her close friend, Evelyn Tyner, saved up enough money to build and open their own shop in West Medford Square in 1957, calling it Fausenia's Beauty Shop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=35.339">After</a>  Fausenia's passing in 2006, a short film was made about her and the other influential women of her time titled, A Legacy of Women and Hairdressing in West Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=47.804">This</a>  information was gathered from Place, Race, and Memory, the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=55.667">This</a>  book contains lots of other history of the West Medford neighborhood, and I picked up a copy at the public library. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=62.07">I</a>  had a really great time making today's episode, and I hope you enjoy the interview as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=71.58">All</a>  right, thanks so much for joining me today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=73.682">I'm</a>  wondering if you could just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about yourself.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=79.248">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=79.809">My</a>  name is Donald Morton. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=83.487">people</a>  refer to me as he, him. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=86.608">Yeah,</a>  myself, I'm a 39 year old African American male, born in Boston. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=91.97">I'm</a>  from Somerville. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=94.591">And</a>  I'm a professional barber. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=99.126">I'm</a>  a man of many trades as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=100.728">Barbering</a>  is my thing, that's my passion.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=102.629">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=103.53">And</a>  we're sitting here in your shop today so we might hear some of the noise of a barber shop in the background.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=108.575">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=110.196">Live</a>  and direct.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=110.877">Exactly,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=113.119">So</a>  the question that I ask everybody on the podcast is just what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=120.045">Well</a>  I can easily answer that one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=122.046">My</a>  spot is Semolina. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=125.564">It's</a>  because they got a bomb bolognese. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=128.646">Their</a>  bolognese is amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=129.847">And</a>  I can get a pretty good old-fashioned over there, and they give you the big cube of ice.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=133.59">Oh,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=134.19">Just</a>  that one cube is all I need. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=135.611">Nice.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=136.652">Yeah,</a>  they were doing takeaway cocktails during the pandemic.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=140.295">Yeah,</a>  yes, yes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=141.776">I</a>  missed them during the pandemic, but every opportunity I get to go in there, I'm in there.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=146.56">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=147.38">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=148.381">So</a>  I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what led you to be a professional barber and open this shop.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=154.322">Well,</a>  I love school, but I think it started in school, high school more so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=160.763">I</a>  showed up every day, but I didn't really like having the authority figure telling me what to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=167.205">I</a>  still showed up because it was fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=169.565">I</a>  liked to learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=171.125">Then</a>  after I finished school, I got right into work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=174.346">I</a>  had some good jobs, but it was the managerial part of it I didn't like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=180.247">Somebody</a>  telling me what to do and stuff like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=184.203">I</a>  was at Wits Inn with a job that I worked and there was a shift that I didn't particularly like which was a night shift and I was bored so I just started reading the book and I read now also was reading the magazine and I just in the back of the magazine is always a column of people that they're featuring and I seen a column on a barber who made about like 200 grand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=204.759">Barbers</a>  don't make that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=207.428">The</a>  next day I just called the barber school and it was on from there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=211.172">I</a>  knew nothing about cutting hair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=212.733">I</a>  never went to the barber shop because I had dreads. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=215.476">Long</a>  hair, I never utilized any services in the barber shop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=219.059">But</a>  I went to school to learn it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=220.74">I</a>  told myself, I knew a lot of people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=224.448">I</a>  played sports from where I worked, and like the social aspect of that, I knew a lot of people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=230.053">I</a>  said, you know, people are gonna mess with me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=232.035">That</a>  wasn't the case though, at first.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=236.819">And</a>  what do you like about owning a barbershop? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=239.001">What</a>  do you like about it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=240.322">I'm</a>  still learning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=242.404">It</a>  was easier to build the barbershop than it is to actually manage and run the business because, you know, I put together <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=250.711">put</a>  together a pretty good team, and then the hardest part is making sure that they can take care of their livelihood. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=257.315">That's</a>  the hardest part. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=258.636">Every</a>  day, so when I'm not in the business, I'm working on the business for them, ultimately myself as well.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=266.52">Yeah,</a>  so figuring out how to support your staff, that feels like a big responsibility for any business owner.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=273.464">I</a>  don't look at them as staff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=275.004">I</a>  always tell people, I'm not hiring. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=277.346">Because</a>  if I was hiring, they'd be employees. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=279.127">They're</a>  not employees of mine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=280.687">They're</a>  their own boss. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=282.068">They're</a>  independent contractors, self-employed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=285.11">So</a>  I like to refer to them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=286.33">I</a>  guess that would be their pronouns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=287.571">Is</a>  that how you do it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=288.551">Is</a>  that how it goes? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=291.713">Yeah,</a>  I had a purpose for this, I actually had a goal, actually I didn't meet that goal at the time that I had set for it and I almost gave up from this purpose and just moved on to something else, but it was a few contributing factors that sparked. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=313.217">the</a>  fire to actually get it done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=316.16">Honestly,</a>  I didn't think I could, I knew I could do it, I just didn't know how, when it took.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=321.184">Yeah,</a>  so what did you learn about that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=324.427">Learn</a>  about the process? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=325.508">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=327.21">That</a>  money goes fast, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=332.335">If</a>  you have a budget, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=335.468">to</a>  work with, that's not it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=338.549">You're</a>  gonna need more on the back end. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=341.249">And</a>  literally, it takes money to make money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=346.67">That</a>  phrase is literal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=349.511">Everything</a>  costs money, but you have to do it in order to move forward to opening your doors and keeping the business going, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=356.812">And</a>  then even in this process, now like the thousand dollar <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=364.781">The</a>  thousands are like hundreds now because you're spending them so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=369.753">The</a>  hundreds become like 5, 10s and 20s. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=373.828">What</a>  was pocket change is now exactly this is how much this cost it's like wow Like literally this morning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=381.011">I</a>  just got an estimate for a frame from the sidewalk for the spring and summertime Yeah, and it's a custom-made frame the estimate was about eight hundred and fifty dollars said for that thing I have to make it this I'm gonna make a decision on it, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=395.377">You</a>  know, those are the things.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=396.657">That's</a>  like those boards that you put right in the house.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=398.198">Yeah,</a>  but it's a custom A-frame, you don't want to go cheap, it doesn't get blown away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=401.819">Like</a>  when you're walking by, that's the first thing you see, it's going to catch your eye, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=405.36">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=405.561">Then</a>  you're going to be intrigued on why this is so beautiful and you're going to want to come in, stuff like that, you know?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=411.082">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=411.583">Well,</a>  speaking of that, can you talk about the name? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=413.203">How</a>  you came up with the name for this?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=414.224">Well,</a>  I had this name. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=416.105">I</a>  had this name a long time ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=417.626">I'm</a>  pretty creative, I give that to myself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=420.509">Hannah</a>  got her name and stuff from just stuff like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=423.672">Hannah's</a>  one of the barbers here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=426.455">So</a>  back in, I bounced around a few shops when I first started and the game was very cutthroat and very ugly and I landed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=438.973">I</a>  landed at a barbershop that made me feel like I was part of something, I was part of a team. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=445.837">And</a>  then we relied on each other to grow and be progressive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=449.96">And</a>  I never had some, the barber name that I go by, I've had for years is Barack Obama. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=458.005">And</a>  by the time, that happened in like 2009 I believe when Barack Obama was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=464.532">in</a>  politics, obviously he was a politician, I think he was, you know, he put his foot in the presidential race, it could be 2009, 2010, and I wanted to come up with a design for my logo, and I'm on Google, I'm on Google, I'm putting stuff together, and I was just searching presidential stuff, and so I guess the United States, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=492.155">military</a>  armed forces, I want to say, if I'm not saying it right, their logo is an anchor with, I think, a serpent, a robe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=501.343">It</a>  just symbolizes all the, so that was my original design. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=506.307">And</a>  then the commander-in-chief, the president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=513.713">So</a>  that's how I came up with the name Frontliner Fresh, because my thing was the commander-in-chief of the Frontliner Fresh. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=521.16">And</a>  then one of my friends asked me, what is your logo going to be? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=525.403">What</a>  is the mantra for the front line of Fresh? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=528.124">And</a>  I'm like, I never knew what really a mantra was to attach to anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=532.087">And</a>  I was like, you know what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=534.648">A</a>  tailored experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=536.229">And</a>  from that, I was like, you know what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=538.13">A</a>  tailored experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=540.277">You</a>  go to a tailor to get a suit, when you get your suit made, you're gonna get a tie, and that's how, you see the logo, if you look at the logo, it's a bow tie on one end, and it goes into the neck duster, which is the brush that we use to dust you off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=554.681">Also,</a>  we are the front line of Fresh, the front line of how you, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=559.868">How</a>  you look is how you feel and how you dress. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=562.37">So</a>  we're on the front lines of that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=563.811">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=564.652">Yeah,</a>  I was going to ask you, what is your hope for your customers? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=567.374">How</a>  they feel when they come in here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=568.735">How</a>  they feel when they leave?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=570.237">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=570.657">First</a>  and foremost, it's about being comfortable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=573.719">And</a>  then the experience you get in the chair, and then some barbershop dancers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=579.404">And</a>  then when you leave, you're like, you know what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=580.885">You</a>  already feel like, yeah, I'm going to come back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=582.587">This</a>  is where we need it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=584.288">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=585.349">We</a>  remember your name. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=586.87">You</a>  remember your haircut, and you walk by. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=589.194">In</a>  this neighborhood, people walk by a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=590.896">They</a>  patron every business on this block. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=592.919">So</a>  you just say hi.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=595.742">Yeah,</a>  it's definitely a different feel. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=597.023">I</a>  remember coming in here versus going to a salon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=599.706">I</a>  think I came in the beginning of December. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=602.008">You</a>  guys were watching Home Alone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=603.489">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=603.829">And</a>  we were just chatting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=605.351">I</a>  remember having a really nice conversation with you guys.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=607.773">And</a>  you actually bigged this up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=609.455">You</a>  bigged this up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=611.156">You</a>  posted the first picture on Google. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=615.46">And</a>  that picture got a lot of traction.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=617.282">Oh,</a>  nice.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=617.782">Yeah,</a>  you bigged this up big time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=619.103">I</a>  appreciate you for that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=620.465">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=620.965">And</a>  the other feel that I wanted for this shop was people to come in and see that, walk by or come in and see that we have diversity in the barbershop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=629.913">That's</a>  one thing that I wanted, that was one of the main reasons, purposes of the barbershop was to have diversity.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=636.099">Why</a>  was that important to you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=637.8">Just</a>  to get a different feel because I wanted to be all-inclusive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=642.104">I've</a>  been in the barbershop with all males and it's a male-dominated industry and I've always said, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=647.848">to</a>  myself that women can do this too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=653.576">Don't</a>  be intimidated, but you just have to put your foot in the dirt and just get after it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=657.761">I</a>  knew my vision for the shop was to have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=662.325">Hannah</a>  is a woman, but she's a barber. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=665.126">She's</a>  not a woman barber. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=666.627">I</a>  don't call her, I don't say she's a female barber. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=668.487">She's</a>  a barber. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=669.208">Then</a>  there's myself, African American male. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=672.089">She's</a>  a Caucasian woman. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=674.329">Then</a>  I have another team member, Jairo. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=676.77">He's</a>  Hispanic descent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=678.211">He's</a>  Dominican in art. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=679.091">He's</a>  another Caucasian male. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=680.272">So</a>  it's like you come in, you're like, of course the United Nations a barber.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=684.513">Yeah,</a>  it's nice to be able to see yourself kind of like reflected in the people that work here and knowing that they're going to be cutting your hair, they understand something about you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=692.537">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=693.398">That</a>  adds, like the conversation piece adds to the experience as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=697.48">It's</a>  like, you know, everybody has their own interests.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=700.081">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=700.561">What</a>  she does, you hop into that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=701.882">What</a>  he does, his baseball sports is his thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=704.243">He's</a>  a father. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=705.184">She</a>  likes to ski. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=706.905">We</a>  talk about that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=707.905">You</a>  know, me, I'm just like, all right, I'm all in it.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=709.826">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=710.326">This</a>  guy over here likes to talk about his cars. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=712.768">So,</a>  you know.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=713.488">Yeah,</a>  I think we had a conversation about Catholic school and gay marriage when I was having my hair cut.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=721.069">You</a>  should feel comfortable having a conversation because it's also an educational experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=726.43">There's</a>  some things that I wanted you to know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=728.851">The</a>  things that you experienced, I gained a new perspective on that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=732.132">Even</a>  having Hannah here, I'm getting a new perspective. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=735.432">I</a>  wanted her to represent, and she's representing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=739.813">the</a>  community that she's a part of and that they're welcome to come in.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=744.195">It's</a>  important.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=744.835">Big</a>  time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=745.956">It's</a>  business.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=746.536">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=747.116">Well,</a>  I think it's like there's some sort of history playing out too a little bit here, like opening a shop in West Medford, you're a black business owner, this is like historically sort of a black neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=757.101">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=757.541">I'm</a>  learning that every time somebody comes in of color, I'm learning that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=761.583">Even</a>  Caucasian people would tell me as well, like pass the tracks over here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=767.126">There's</a>  still black families, wealthy black families, but it was predominantly black back then, I believe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=776.269">I</a>  thought I was the first white business in this neighborhood. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=778.49">I</a>  thought I was. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=780.431">But</a>  I still take that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=782.352">Now</a>  that it means even more, I didn't know the history of this neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=786.093">I</a>  learned that, well, I've been reading about West Medford history and there's like two women who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=792.716">or</a>  connected with this beauty school in Boston and then opened a beauty shop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=796.059">It</a>  sounds like first in their home and then opened a salon.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1260.107">This</a>  was too fast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1261.788">I</a>  think we should keep going.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1262.888">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1263.649">Unless</a>  there's nothing else to talk about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1265.169">That</a>  was pretty cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1265.749">See,</a>  I'm in the groove now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1268.22">But</a>  there's more things to come. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1270.843">I</a>  want us as a team to do things and throw things in the community to bring people out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1281.03">Ideas</a>  that we can bounce around, community things, events like kickball tournaments, corn hole tournaments, even like softball. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1290.177">We</a>  have so many things around us that we can utilize. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1294.919">stuff</a>  like that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1338.01">And</a>  as, you know, you mentioned inclusion a few times, and as a black business owner, is there anything that you have in terms of hopes for the city in general?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1350.34">Not</a>  specifically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1351.36">You</a>  know, I would, Medford, well the greater Boston as a whole, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1359.705">It's</a>  pretty diverse. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1363.04">Of</a>  course I would like to see more people who look like me have and own businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1367.701">The</a>  Square would definitely, could definitely use that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1370.422">There's</a>  some spaces available that, you know, if you have a dream or a goal, you can accomplish, you can get it done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1380.784">To</a>  opening a business, you can. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1382.025">There's</a>  a few places in this neighborhood, yeah, that we could, you know, I could use some new faces and stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1391.263">You</a>  mentioned the thing about money and understanding that it was going to take more money than you thought to open a business. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1397.407">Is</a>  there any other advice you'd have for folks trying to open a business?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1403.972">It's</a>  hard, but it's rewarding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1412.325">live</a>  it out and be able to just go through the motions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1417.468">And</a>  when people come to your business, that you're doing something good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1422.377">They</a>  leave and they come back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1423.498">I</a>  tell them all the time, a returning client is the best compliment you can get. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1431.122">Everybody,</a>  Instagram is sensationalized. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1433.584">People</a>  are like, oh, we're getting these many likes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1435.225">That's</a>  cool, but they're not in a chair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1437.286">You</a>  can't cut likes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1439.107">But</a>  the returning client is the most, is the best compliment you can get. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1444.29">It</a>  doesn't matter who likes it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1446.291">A</a>  celebrity can like it, but I tell them, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1450.547">The</a>  locals in your clientele are your celebrity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1452.969">They're</a>  the celebrity in your chair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1454.571">You</a>  gotta make them feel that way, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1459.476">There's</a>  a lot of things that you could use to, you know, synonymous to other things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1467.063">And</a>  it's like, I try to tell them I'm pretty... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1470.963">Coach,</a>  I never, the thing about coach was like, when people would say things, I was just like, yeah, you're just saying that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1476.628">Until</a>  you live it out and you understand exactly what they mean, you're like, wow, this is exactly what they meant by it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1483.855">When</a>  someone's saying things, it's like, okay, all right, buddy, but then this is what they meant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1487.899">Like,</a>  time is money thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1490.281">That's</a>  a real thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1493.023">And</a>  I tell them, efficiency is labor, and labor is margin, and that's time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1499.987">If</a>  you can do a quality cut, and not rushing them out, it's detailed, a haircut, give them 40 minutes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1508.311">If</a>  you can get them out in 40 minutes and still have a conversation, do some quality work, and then get your next appointment in on time, then essentially you're making some pretty good money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1518.256">Our</a>  haircuts average, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1521.04">about</a>  let's say $40. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1522.561">Now</a>  that's to say you're good with time and you're getting a client every hour, you're essentially making $40 an hour when on loan.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1530.524">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1533.025">I</a>  was joking when I got my hair cut by Hannah, I was telling her that I used to get my hair cut at Supercuts until it closed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1540.588">And</a>  I think she said, good thing it closed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1542.789">But</a>  I feel like that price isn't terrible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1545.11">It's</a>  a great price and it's for a much better experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1549.132">No</a>  shade to Supercuts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1550.212">No,</a>  at all, at all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1551.113">I</a>  mean, the prices in barbershops aren't set on the client or customer's expectation or satisfaction. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1559.102">There's</a>  a lot of factors for us in there, which is livelihood, material, supplies, tools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1569.457">The</a>  price of our tools has gone up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1571.258">Clippers</a>  cost over $100, trimmers cost over $100. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1573.399">You</a>  know, and you gotta get supplies to make sure that, you know, sanitation supplies, especially now with, you know, COVID and everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1583.086">And</a>  so you definitely gotta disinfect your tools, disinfect your chair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1586.948">and</a>  stuff like that, so those things cost money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1589.309">But</a>  people don't look at it like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1590.509">It's</a>  like, oh, you went up on price. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1592.61">That's</a>  cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1593.53">It's</a>  cool to go up on price, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1598.372">It</a>  tells you a lot of things, and it tells people a lot of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1603.573">If</a>  you're coming for the quality, then the price shouldn't matter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1606.354">If</a>  you're coming just because, all right, it's convenient, and you're comfortable with this price, and we go up, and you don't show up, it's cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1613.196">It's</a>  okay to fire clients. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1614.938">They'll</a>  fire you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1616.699">They'll</a>  go to the next barber who charges maybe $10, that's cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1620.38">Or</a>  $15, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1622.981">When</a>  you said that thing about feeling good about yourself and the way that you look, that's an investment in that, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1628.243">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1628.984">Ten</a>  more dollars.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1630.564">Absolutely,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1633.365">The</a>  industry is the industry. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1634.926">I</a>  like to say that we're probably the most appreciated and undervalued only because <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1643.503">The</a>  fact that people would try to lowball us on the price. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1649.287">Like,</a>  oh, you guys are charging this much? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1651.308">I'll</a>  go down the street and get it for cheaper. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1652.629">It's</a>  like, all right, my man, go ahead. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1654.01">You</a>  just created a space for somebody else to come in.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1657.131">Yeah,</a>  totally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1660.053">Cool.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1660.834">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1662.695">What</a>  else is on the docket? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1663.675">Let's</a>  go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1665.136">Let's</a>  go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1666.885">I</a>  like this thing, you know?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1668.366">Yeah,</a>  we've kind of been talking around it a little bit, but like, just sort of like your identity as a black man, like how's that come up for you in the work?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1681.185">Ask</a>  that one more time in a way that I can actually answer it better for you.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1686.327">I</a>  don't know, I think about a barber shop.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1689.549">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1690.189">And</a>  there's movies that have been made about the barber shop, the stereotype of a barber shop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1697.292">And</a>  so I guess I'm wondering if your identity plays a role at all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1702.534">You</a>  know, you're right, you're right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1707.636">So</a>  when you look at movies on, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1710.791">The</a>  screen, TV screen, and theaters, it's more so like barbershop movies is featuring predominantly African American barbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1720.096">And</a>  I have Caucasian clients and I like to ask them questions that, they're not uncomfortable, it's just that, you know, we're in the shop, we're gonna ask questions that, you know, and I always ask them, like, okay, I'm a black man, you're a Caucasian man, but there's also barbers that are Caucasian as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1738.543">Why</a>  do you feel more comfortable sitting in my chair? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1742.068">My</a>  guys would say, man, you guys just have a way with the clippers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1746.694">You</a>  guys are attention to detail. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1748.016">I'm</a>  not saying other barbers of other races aren't, nationalities aren't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1752.262">It's</a>  just something, it's almost like... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1754.849">And</a>  I was explaining to him, I was explaining to Jairo, people look at us like, and you see a black man in the streets, you know why he's, he's athletic, he runs fast, he can jump high. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1764.151">But</a>  as a black barber, he must know how to cut some hair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1766.872">I've</a>  seen, I was in a barber shop where I was probably the third chair, and before me, from the front of the door to me, there was two other barbers, and they were Caucasian barbers, but they can cut. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1778.215">They</a>  can actually cut hair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1780.435">And</a>  the black, a black person would come in and just walk right past him and come to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1784.776">Hey</a>  my man, how many you got? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1785.957">I'm</a>  booked for the day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1787.699">My</a>  guys over here can cut you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1789.441">You</a>  know how to cut black hair? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1791.323">Dude,</a>  they're barbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1793.546">They're</a>  barbers.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1797.129">Is</a>  that part of the training for all barbers? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1799.292">Cutting</a>  all types of hair?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1801.888">Well,</a>  that training you get in the real world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1804.25">In</a>  school, in the barber school, to be honest with you, they don't really teach you anything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1808.654">They</a>  teach you how to, you know, you pay a good amount of money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1812.117">It</a>  costs some good money to go to the barber school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1814.339">You</a>  do your hours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1815.14">Well,</a>  the state, you gotta do a thousand hours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1817.262">That's</a>  why there's barber schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1819.084">And</a>  then it's gonna cost you to go to school to get that, to do your hours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1824.163">and</a>  do an exam, and you still gotta take a state exam. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1826.446">You</a>  don't learn how to cut different types of hair in a barber school unless you're cutting each other, the students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1833.976">Even</a>  in that, students that are in barber school don't actually have the skills, they're learning the skills, they don't have them already. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1842.912">And</a>  you get that training in the real world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1846.097">You're</a>  getting thrown to the wolves, pretty much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1849.361">And</a>  then you got people like myself, or barbers like myself, with the purpose of this shop was to tig. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1857.913">So,</a>  like, two of the barbers, Hannah and Jaro, they're fresh out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1861.654">They're</a>  fresh out of school, but most barbershops and barbershop owners would want barbers with experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1867.956">Like,</a>  they want that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1870.197">However</a>  they are collecting Booth or Randall Commission, they want that money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1875.719">So</a>  then you're just a body in the shop, and I didn't want that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1879.26">Because</a>  I know how it felt when I finished school, and it was like, I almost stopped. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1884.981">I'm</a>  like, no, I'm not going to quit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1887.082">And</a>  I seen that, and then I'm like, nah, it's not happening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1889.866">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1890.487">Come</a>  be a part of this team, and then you're going to learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1892.911">And</a>  you're going to grow right away, instantaneously.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1896.315">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1896.936">And</a>  it sounds like when you have a barber who knows how to cut all different types of ferrets because they've taken the time to learn that in their job or somebody's helped.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1904.362">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1904.522">They've</a>  been in the industry for a while. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1906.104">They've</a>  probably worked at a shop or two or numerous shops or they've probably had their own. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1910.067">But</a>  the thing about that is they already have habits. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1913.87">You</a>  take somebody who doesn't have any habits and you show them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1918.64">things</a>  that actually work, and they're making money, putting money in their pocket, and they go home feeling good, they develop good habits. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1928.802">Barbers</a>  like myself, you can take me somewhere, but like myself, I can go anywhere and be good because I know the result of good habits. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1939.084">I</a>  know the result of that, so I'll never regress. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1942.824">So</a>  I instill that in them, like, listen, people are gonna come in, learn their names, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1948.053">make</a>  them feel comfortable, have conversation, converse in the chair, all that stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1952.815">Find</a>  a common interest. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1953.935">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1954.275">There's</a>  a lot of hats that you wear here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1956.396">A</a>  lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1957.516">Teaching.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1958.176">A</a>  lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1959.137">That's</a>  the best part about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1961.297">I'm</a>  learning as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1962.078">I'm</a>  actually learning as well to learn how to operate and run a business and help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1968.02">That's</a>  huge.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1968.92">That's</a>  awesome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1970.701">There's</a>  no HR. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1972.441">I'm</a>  HR. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1974.062">I'm</a>  the guy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1976.643">We</a>  have each other.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1977.583">From</a>  the way you talk about it, you've been smiling this whole time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1983.426">It</a>  sounds like you really enjoy it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1985.827">I</a>  don't wake up every morning just to come here because I have to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1988.008">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1989.008">I</a>  could be like, hey, you know what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1989.768">You</a>  guys can run it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1991.209">I</a>  could just watch the cameras all day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1992.529">No,</a>  I want to sit here and just <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1995.558">It's</a>  great, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2OwcAHAo85DxnljQe7Qws4?t=1997.079">Absolutely.</a> </p>
