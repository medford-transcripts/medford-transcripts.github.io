1
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:05,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:09,773
[SPEAKER_04]: In today's episode, I talk with the owner of a barber shop in West Medford.

3
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:15,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Interestingly enough, the first black female business in West Medford was a hairdressing salon.

4
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:34,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Fausenia Booker was trained at Elizabeth Oliver Newton's West Medford Basement Salon before Fausenia and her close friend, Evelyn Tyner, saved up enough money to build and open their own shop in West Medford Square in 1957, calling it Fausenia's Beauty Shop.

5
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:46,824
[SPEAKER_04]: After Fausenia's passing in 2006, a short film was made about her and the other influential women of her time titled, A Legacy of Women and Hairdressing in West Medford.

6
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:55,007
[SPEAKER_04]: This information was gathered from Place, Race, and Memory, the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project.

7
00:00:55,667 --> 00:01:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: This book contains lots of other history of the West Medford neighborhood, and I picked up a copy at the public library.

8
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a really great time making today's episode, and I hope you enjoy the interview as well.

9
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,662
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thanks so much for joining me today.

10
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:18,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if you could just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about yourself.

11
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:19,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.

12
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:21,010
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Donald Morton.

13
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:25,308
[SPEAKER_01]: people refer to me as he, him.

14
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:31,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, myself, I'm a 39 year old African American male, born in Boston.

15
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Somerville.

16
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:37,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a professional barber.

17
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:40,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a man of many trades as well.

18
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:42,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbering is my thing, that's my passion.

19
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:42,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

20
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're sitting here in your shop today so we might hear some of the noise of a barber shop in the background.

21
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

22
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:50,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Live and direct.

23
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, yeah.

24
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,924
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question that I ask everybody on the podcast is just what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

25
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I can easily answer that one.

26
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:03,948
[SPEAKER_01]: My spot is Semolina.

27
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:07,786
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they got a bomb bolognese.

28
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:09,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Their bolognese is amazing.

29
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:13,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can get a pretty good old-fashioned over there, and they give you the big cube of ice.

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that one cube is all I need.

32
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:15,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

33
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:20,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were doing takeaway cocktails during the pandemic.

34
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:21,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yes, yes.

35
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:26,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed them during the pandemic, but every opportunity I get to go in there, I'm in there.

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

38
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:33,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what led you to be a professional barber and open this shop.

39
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I love school, but I think it started in school, high school more so.

40
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:47,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed up every day, but I didn't really like having the authority figure telling me what to do.

41
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:48,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I still showed up because it was fun.

42
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:50,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked to learn.

43
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after I finished school, I got right into work.

44
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:59,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some good jobs, but it was the managerial part of it I didn't like.

45
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody telling me what to do and stuff like that.

46
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:24,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at Wits Inn with a job that I worked and there was a shift that I didn't particularly like which was a night shift and I was bored so I just started reading the book and I read now also was reading the magazine and I just in the back of the magazine is always a column of people that they're featuring and I seen a column on a barber who made about like 200 grand.

47
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbers don't make that.

48
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:31,112
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day I just called the barber school and it was on from there.

49
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:32,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew nothing about cutting hair.

50
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I never went to the barber shop because I had dreads.

51
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Long hair, I never utilized any services in the barber shop.

52
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,640
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went to school to learn it.

53
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I told myself, I knew a lot of people.

54
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:50,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I played sports from where I worked, and like the social aspect of that, I knew a lot of people.

55
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you know, people are gonna mess with me.

56
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:53,817
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't the case though, at first.

57
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do you like about owning a barbershop?

58
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,202
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you like about it?

59
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:01,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still learning.

60
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:09,270
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easier to build the barbershop than it is to actually manage and run the business because, you know, I put together

61
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:17,195
[SPEAKER_01]: put together a pretty good team, and then the hardest part is making sure that they can take care of their livelihood.

62
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,596
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hardest part.

63
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:25,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day, so when I'm not in the business, I'm working on the business for them, ultimately myself as well.

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so figuring out how to support your staff, that feels like a big responsibility for any business owner.

65
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:34,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't look at them as staff.

66
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell people, I'm not hiring.

67
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I was hiring, they'd be employees.

68
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,047
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not employees of mine.

69
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:41,988
[SPEAKER_01]: They're their own boss.

70
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,649
[SPEAKER_01]: They're independent contractors, self-employed.

71
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to refer to them.

72
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that would be their pronouns.

73
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:48,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how you do it?

74
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:50,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how it goes?

75
00:04:51,713 --> 00:05:12,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had a purpose for this, I actually had a goal, actually I didn't meet that goal at the time that I had set for it and I almost gave up from this purpose and just moved on to something else, but it was a few contributing factors that sparked.

76
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,859
[SPEAKER_01]: the fire to actually get it done.

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I didn't think I could, I knew I could do it, I just didn't know how, when it took.

78
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so what did you learn about that?

79
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:25,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn about the process?

80
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:25,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

81
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,114
[SPEAKER_01]: That money goes fast, right?

82
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:34,637
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a budget,

83
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,128
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with, that's not it.

84
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:40,389
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna need more on the back end.

85
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:45,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, it takes money to make money.

86
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,471
[SPEAKER_01]: That phrase is literal.

87
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:56,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything costs money, but you have to do it in order to move forward to opening your doors and keeping the business going, you know?

88
00:05:56,812 --> 00:06:02,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even in this process, now like the thousand dollar

89
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:09,733
[SPEAKER_01]: The thousands are like hundreds now because you're spending them so much.

90
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,376
[SPEAKER_01]: The hundreds become like 5, 10s and 20s.

91
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:20,991
[SPEAKER_01]: What was pocket change is now exactly this is how much this cost it's like wow Like literally this morning.

92
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:34,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got an estimate for a frame from the sidewalk for the spring and summertime Yeah, and it's a custom-made frame the estimate was about eight hundred and fifty dollars said for that thing I have to make it this I'm gonna make a decision on it, but

93
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:36,617
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those are the things.

94
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,178
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like those boards that you put right in the house.

95
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's a custom A-frame, you don't want to go cheap, it doesn't get blown away.

96
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're walking by, that's the first thing you see, it's going to catch your eye, you know?

97
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

98
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:51,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to be intrigued on why this is so beautiful and you're going to want to come in, stuff like that, you know?

99
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

100
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of that, can you talk about the name?

101
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,204
[SPEAKER_05]: How you came up with the name for this?

102
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:54,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had this name.

103
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this name a long time ago.

104
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty creative, I give that to myself.

105
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah got her name and stuff from just stuff like that.

106
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:06,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah's one of the barbers here.

107
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:18,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in, I bounced around a few shops when I first started and the game was very cutthroat and very ugly and I landed

108
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:25,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I landed at a barbershop that made me feel like I was part of something, I was part of a team.

109
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:29,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we relied on each other to grow and be progressive.

110
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:37,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never had some, the barber name that I go by, I've had for years is Barack Obama.

111
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:42,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time, that happened in like 2009 I believe when Barack Obama was

112
00:07:44,532 --> 00:08:08,693
[SPEAKER_01]: in politics, obviously he was a politician, I think he was, you know, he put his foot in the presidential race, it could be 2009, 2010, and I wanted to come up with a design for my logo, and I'm on Google, I'm on Google, I'm putting stuff together, and I was just searching presidential stuff, and so I guess the United States,

113
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:21,203
[SPEAKER_01]: military armed forces, I want to say, if I'm not saying it right, their logo is an anchor with, I think, a serpent, a robe.

114
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:25,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It just symbolizes all the, so that was my original design.

115
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:33,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the commander-in-chief, the president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.

116
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:39,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I came up with the name Frontliner Fresh, because my thing was the commander-in-chief of the Frontliner Fresh.

117
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of my friends asked me, what is your logo going to be?

118
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:48,084
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the mantra for the front line of Fresh?

119
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:51,987
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I never knew what really a mantra was to attach to anything.

120
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:53,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what?

121
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:55,669
[SPEAKER_01]: A tailored experience.

122
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, I was like, you know what?

123
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,791
[SPEAKER_01]: A tailored experience.

124
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:12,981
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to a tailor to get a suit, when you get your suit made, you're gonna get a tie, and that's how, you see the logo, if you look at the logo, it's a bow tie on one end, and it goes into the neck duster, which is the brush that we use to dust you off.

125
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:17,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we are the front line of Fresh, the front line of how you,

126
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:22,250
[SPEAKER_01]: How you look is how you feel and how you dress.

127
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're on the front lines of that.

128
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:24,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

129
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:27,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to ask you, what is your hope for your customers?

130
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:28,715
[SPEAKER_05]: How they feel when they come in here?

131
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,156
[SPEAKER_05]: How they feel when they leave?

132
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:30,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

133
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,659
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, it's about being comfortable.

134
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:38,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the experience you get in the chair, and then some barbershop dancers.

135
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:40,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you leave, you're like, you know what?

136
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,567
[SPEAKER_01]: You already feel like, yeah, I'm going to come back.

137
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,188
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we need it.

138
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:45,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

139
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:46,090
[SPEAKER_01]: We remember your name.

140
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,174
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember your haircut, and you walk by.

141
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,676
[SPEAKER_01]: In this neighborhood, people walk by a lot.

142
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:52,899
[SPEAKER_01]: They patron every business on this block.

143
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just say hi.

144
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's definitely a different feel.

145
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:59,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember coming in here versus going to a salon.

146
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I came in the beginning of December.

147
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,229
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were watching Home Alone.

148
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:03,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

149
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:05,331
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were just chatting.

150
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember having a really nice conversation with you guys.

151
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And you actually bigged this up.

152
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:10,235
[SPEAKER_01]: You bigged this up.

153
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:14,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You posted the first picture on Google.

154
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And that picture got a lot of traction.

155
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:17,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

156
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you bigged this up big time.

157
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you for that.

158
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:20,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

159
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:29,233
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other feel that I wanted for this shop was people to come in and see that, walk by or come in and see that we have diversity in the barbershop.

160
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:36,059
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that I wanted, that was one of the main reasons, purposes of the barbershop was to have diversity.

161
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Why was that important to you?

162
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to get a different feel because I wanted to be all-inclusive.

163
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:46,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the barbershop with all males and it's a male-dominated industry and I've always said,

164
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:53,315
[SPEAKER_01]: to myself that women can do this too.

165
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:57,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be intimidated, but you just have to put your foot in the dirt and just get after it.

166
00:10:57,761 --> 00:11:00,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew my vision for the shop was to have

167
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:05,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah is a woman, but she's a barber.

168
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:06,247
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not a woman barber.

169
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:08,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't call her, I don't say she's a female barber.

170
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:09,188
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a barber.

171
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's myself, African American male.

172
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,309
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a Caucasian woman.

173
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have another team member, Jairo.

174
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,171
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Hispanic descent.

175
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,071
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Dominican in art.

176
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,252
[SPEAKER_01]: He's another Caucasian male.

177
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:23,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like you come in, you're like, of course the United Nations a barber.

178
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:32,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's nice to be able to see yourself kind of like reflected in the people that work here and knowing that they're going to be cutting your hair, they understand something about you.

179
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:33,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

180
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:36,879
[SPEAKER_01]: That adds, like the conversation piece adds to the experience as well.

181
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,881
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, everybody has their own interests.

182
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:40,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

183
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:41,862
[SPEAKER_01]: What she does, you hop into that.

184
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,183
[SPEAKER_01]: What he does, his baseball sports is his thing.

185
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:44,784
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a father.

186
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:45,964
[SPEAKER_01]: She likes to ski.

187
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:47,865
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about that.

188
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,566
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, me, I'm just like, all right, I'm all in it.

189
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:50,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

190
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,007
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy over here likes to talk about his cars.

191
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:53,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.

192
00:11:53,488 --> 00:12:01,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we had a conversation about Catholic school and gay marriage when I was having my hair cut.

193
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:06,410
[SPEAKER_01]: You should feel comfortable having a conversation because it's also an educational experience.

194
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,071
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things that I wanted you to know.

195
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:11,992
[SPEAKER_01]: The things that you experienced, I gained a new perspective on that.

196
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Even having Hannah here, I'm getting a new perspective.

197
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:18,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted her to represent, and she's representing

198
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:22,934
[SPEAKER_01]: the community that she's a part of and that they're welcome to come in.

199
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:24,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important.

200
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:25,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time.

201
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:25,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

202
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:26,496
[SPEAKER_01]: It's business.

203
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:26,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

204
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:36,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's like there's some sort of history playing out too a little bit here, like opening a shop in West Medford, you're a black business owner, this is like historically sort of a black neighborhood.

205
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:37,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

206
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning that every time somebody comes in of color, I'm learning that.

207
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Caucasian people would tell me as well, like pass the tracks over here.

208
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:54,168
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still black families, wealthy black families, but it was predominantly black back then, I believe.

209
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was the first white business in this neighborhood.

210
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was.

211
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,431
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still take that.

212
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:06,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it means even more, I didn't know the history of this neighborhood.

213
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:11,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned that, well, I've been reading about West Medford history and there's like two women who

214
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:15,959
[SPEAKER_05]: or connected with this beauty school in Boston and then opened a beauty shop.

215
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,422
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like first in their home and then opened a salon.

216
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:21,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

217
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:30,851
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a new, there is a beauty salon, I want to say parallel to here, I want to say that side is still considered West Medford on Boston Ave.

218
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:38,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you pass the fuzz, there's a good friend of mine, she just opened a black, she's a black business owner as well.

219
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:40,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta give her a shameless plug, you know?

220
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, that's great.

221
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,146
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it is.

222
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:47,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this neighborhood, I never knew this neighborhood existed.

223
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would come down here and just ride right past it.

224
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:54,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing at all.

225
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:57,907
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're very welcoming.

226
00:13:58,027 --> 00:13:58,848
[SPEAKER_01]: There is my neighbor here.

227
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:00,769
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an Indian man.

228
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a buddy of mine on the corner who owns a tattoo shop.

229
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:08,956
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess you could say this barbershop here is going to be bringing the flavor to the square.

230
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

231
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else that you want folks in Medford to know about your business?

232
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:18,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's welcome.

233
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Men, women, children.

234
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:21,665
[SPEAKER_01]: We service everybody.

235
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,128
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come in, if you want to just come in and say what's up.

236
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:29,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a brief history of the neighborhood if you're a local.

237
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:33,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're not, we're still going to learn where you're from, get to know your name.

238
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,370
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, prioritize your fresh.

239
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:37,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect it as well.

240
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:43,536
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can come in here and you can sit down and watch some of the movies we have on the television and stuff like that.

241
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:46,459
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but, yeah.

242
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,582
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, I believe, this was a gem.

243
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:52,584
[SPEAKER_01]: This place was a gem.

244
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:56,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I never knew what to look for, but this was right under my nose.

245
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:57,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost let it go, but

246
00:14:58,634 --> 00:14:59,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I didn't.

247
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:08,343
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still a work in progress and that's all I strive for us is to be a work in progress.

248
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:10,385
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they're good, I'm fine.

249
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:16,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake up in the morning, I'm wanting to be here.

250
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:19,374
[SPEAKER_05]: A job doesn't feel like a job when that's the... Yeah, this doesn't feel like a job.

251
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:29,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that, no disrespect, like a regular job is because we don't clock in.

252
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,644
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't clock in, we walk in, we sit down, we talk to one another, we ask each other what's up.

253
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,506
[SPEAKER_01]: You walk by, we'll wave, you come in, you get your hair cut.

254
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:44,171
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a social common place.

255
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And you mentioned a background in sports, right?

256
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And I noticed some of your stuff on the wall.

257
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:51,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still learning as well.

258
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:56,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So the wall that I have back there is, I'm not a fan of those teams.

259
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:01,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just stadiums, ballparks, and arenas that I've been to.

260
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,475
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more.

261
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:08,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So everywhere I go, I start to collect either apparel, fan towels and stuff, and I just frame them.

262
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when people come in, they'll be like, oh, what's that for?

263
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:12,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that.

264
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:17,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to, I travel to neutral games around the country.

265
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:18,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to San Francisco, got that ball.

266
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:20,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you see here.

267
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,659
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a local sports fan.

268
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruins, Red Sox, Celtics, Patriots.

269
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,022
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see that stuff.

270
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to build my vinyl wall.

271
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:31,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one vinyl on the wall.

272
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:33,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to build it.

273
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,845
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over there.

274
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:39,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice vibe in here.

275
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:40,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you.

276
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:41,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.

277
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I went with my flow.

278
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:57,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school, which is the chairs, all the chairs are from, every chair has a story, but all the chairs are from the 1960s and before.

279
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:58,424
[SPEAKER_01]: 1960s, 1950s.

280
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the old school part of it.

281
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:06,326
[SPEAKER_01]: The industrial feel would be the stations and the conduit piping for the electricity.

282
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:09,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the traditional and new school would be us.

283
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,427
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor on the window.

284
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,308
[SPEAKER_01]: The music that plays in here, like do you see the lights?

285
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:15,729
[SPEAKER_01]: They call those the Instagram lights, but.

286
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

287
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,872
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it that, but we need that, you know?

288
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:32,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you come in, you're like, I guess people in this neighborhood who knew what this place was before it was a print shop, they come in and they're like, they just stand in the doorway like dumbfounded.

289
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:33,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

290
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,244
[SPEAKER_01]: This place used to be, no disrespect, a dump.

291
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, man, I must have did something really good.

292
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still learning.

293
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,706
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like lots of people think about when they get their hair cut, it's just a place to go to get their hair cut.

294
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:53,269
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds more like a social, you come here, you chat, you get to know each other.

295
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yeah.

296
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:58,513
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very good at remembering faces.

297
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:06,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you might need to hear your name once or twice, but then we'll remember when you stood outside, I'll be like, oh, she's back, she's coming to get her hair cut.

298
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know you were you, now I know who you are, so that's pretty cool.

299
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,002
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know who's sitting in the chair.

300
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,943
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know who's sitting in your chair, you never know who you're talking to, you never know.

301
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:22,224
[SPEAKER_01]: That person right there could change your life for the rest of your life.

302
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubbing elbows or shaking hands, you never know.

303
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,964
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beauty of it.

304
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:30,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good way to remember how to show up every day and treat people, for sure.

305
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:31,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

306
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a third of the team.

307
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:42,173
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Hannah the Barberess, we have Gyro Cuts.

308
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,797
[SPEAKER_01]: King Artie is not here yet, and I'm Barack Obama.

309
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:48,058
[SPEAKER_01]: People laugh when they hear that.

310
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:49,538
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but.

311
00:18:49,718 --> 00:18:50,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

312
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:55,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like you can book appointments through Instagram with the individual barbers.

313
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

314
00:18:56,101 --> 00:19:03,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I set up a platform for the team on Instagram, on Google, on Yelp, and Facebook.

315
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:06,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily for them, I removed myself from that platform.

316
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own individual, and I have my clientele.

317
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:11,527
[SPEAKER_01]: But for them, with a general public,

318
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:27,832
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public, when they want to book a haircut in the service, they can pick a barber of their choice, a barber that was recommended to them, a barber that they probably read reviews on on Google, and we also have, now I created

319
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:40,532
[SPEAKER_01]: QR codes that people can just seamlessly in contact list, they can just scan it and it'll take them right to the booking URL and then they can go from there as well.

320
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,456
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the information as long as you can process it and you can get it out there.

321
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:48,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And for folks who aren't familiar with the barbershop, what sort of services do you provide?

322
00:19:50,656 --> 00:20:13,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Haircuts, haircuts, full service haircuts and facial hair trim, grooming, eyebrows, shaping, trimming, got children, design work, maybe some, oh, traditional head shaves, traditional face shaves that come with a hot towel, cold towel, some like, you know, product, stuff like that.

323
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:14,843
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got going on?

324
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:19,425
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got beard wash, scalp wash, hair wash,

325
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:21,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, stuff like that, you know.

326
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:25,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe some design work, depending on who wants to get a little risky.

327
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that.

328
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,371
[SPEAKER_01]: And conversations, we provide that.

329
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:35,733
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

330
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:36,714
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually pretty cool.

331
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually looking forward to this with you.

332
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really cool to hear about it.

333
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of spots like this in Medford that people don't know too much about, so it's nice.

334
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

335
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can say you've actually been in here.

336
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:48,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

337
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:49,903
[SPEAKER_01]: You got serviced in here.

338
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a great haircut from Hannah, yeah.

339
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:51,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

340
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:52,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Shameless plug again.

341
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:54,645
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

342
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, awesome.

343
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:56,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

344
00:20:57,286 --> 00:20:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you so much.

345
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you want to make sure to mention?

346
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:01,768
[SPEAKER_01]: This was too fast.

347
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:02,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should keep going.

348
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:03,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

349
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there's nothing else to talk about.

350
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:05,709
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

351
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:06,630
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm in the groove now.

352
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,702
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more things to come.

353
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:18,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I want us as a team to do things and throw things in the community to bring people out.

354
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:30,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideas that we can bounce around, community things, events like kickball tournaments, corn hole tournaments, even like softball.

355
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:32,059
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so many things around us that we can utilize.

356
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,881
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.

357
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:44,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Medford Brewing is opening pretty soon right down the street and there's a couple like there's deep cuts across the street some new places that could be fun to like

358
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:46,906
[SPEAKER_01]: The brewery's gonna be very exciting.

359
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:50,649
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna bring an entire complexity of people.

360
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:59,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they were supposed to be next door to me, my neighbors, but from just the talking and stuff like that, it didn't fall through.

361
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,738
[SPEAKER_01]: But they still in West Medford, I'm looking forward to them.

362
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,359
[SPEAKER_01]: So close, yeah.

363
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,702
[SPEAKER_01]: What's better than going get a haircut on the weekend and going to the brewery right after that?

364
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:07,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

365
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:07,702
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

366
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:08,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

367
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:16,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be pretty cool, the traffic that this neighborhood's gonna get, the new faces, the diversity, the culture, stuff like that, yeah.

368
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:25,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And as, you know, you mentioned inclusion a few times, and as a black business owner, is there anything that you have in terms of hopes for the city in general?

369
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Not specifically.

370
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,105
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would, Medford, well the greater Boston as a whole,

371
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:40,627
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty diverse.

372
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I would like to see more people who look like me have and own businesses.

373
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,402
[SPEAKER_01]: The Square would definitely, could definitely use that.

374
00:22:50,422 --> 00:23:00,504
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some spaces available that, you know, if you have a dream or a goal, you can accomplish, you can get it done.

375
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:02,005
[SPEAKER_01]: To opening a business, you can.

376
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:10,347
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few places in this neighborhood, yeah, that we could, you know, I could use some new faces and stuff like that.

377
00:23:11,263 --> 00:23:17,387
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned the thing about money and understanding that it was going to take more money than you thought to open a business.

378
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:21,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any other advice you'd have for folks trying to open a business?

379
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:26,094
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard, but it's rewarding.

380
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:37,408
[SPEAKER_01]: live it out and be able to just go through the motions.

381
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:41,291
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people come to your business, that you're doing something good.

382
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:43,418
[SPEAKER_01]: They leave and they come back.

383
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:50,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them all the time, a returning client is the best compliment you can get.

384
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:53,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, Instagram is sensationalized.

385
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:55,205
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, oh, we're getting these many likes.

386
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,546
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, but they're not in a chair.

387
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:58,166
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't cut likes.

388
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:03,550
[SPEAKER_01]: But the returning client is the most, is the best compliment you can get.

389
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,191
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter who likes it.

390
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,773
[SPEAKER_01]: A celebrity can like it, but I tell them,

391
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,909
[SPEAKER_01]: The locals in your clientele are your celebrity.

392
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:14,551
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the celebrity in your chair.

393
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,794
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta make them feel that way, you know?

394
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:27,043
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that you could use to, you know, synonymous to other things.

395
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:29,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I try to tell them I'm pretty...

396
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:36,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Coach, I never, the thing about coach was like, when people would say things, I was just like, yeah, you're just saying that.

397
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:43,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you live it out and you understand exactly what they mean, you're like, wow, this is exactly what they meant by it.

398
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:47,819
[SPEAKER_01]: When someone's saying things, it's like, okay, all right, buddy, but then this is what they meant.

399
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:49,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, time is money thing.

400
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,102
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real thing.

401
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:57,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, efficiency is labor, and labor is margin, and that's time.

402
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:07,771
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do a quality cut, and not rushing them out, it's detailed, a haircut, give them 40 minutes.

403
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:18,196
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get them out in 40 minutes and still have a conversation, do some quality work, and then get your next appointment in on time, then essentially you're making some pretty good money.

404
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:19,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Our haircuts average,

405
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,341
[SPEAKER_01]: about let's say $40.

406
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:30,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's to say you're good with time and you're getting a client every hour, you're essentially making $40 an hour when on loan.

407
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:32,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:40,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I was joking when I got my hair cut by Hannah, I was telling her that I used to get my hair cut at Supercuts until it closed.

409
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:42,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think she said, good thing it closed.

410
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:45,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like that price isn't terrible.

411
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great price and it's for a much better experience.

412
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:49,932
[SPEAKER_05]: No shade to Supercuts.

413
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:51,093
[SPEAKER_01]: No, at all, at all.

414
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:58,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the prices in barbershops aren't set on the client or customer's expectation or satisfaction.

415
00:25:59,102 --> 00:26:05,669
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of factors for us in there, which is livelihood, material, supplies, tools.

416
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,658
[SPEAKER_01]: The price of our tools has gone up.

417
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:13,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Clippers cost over $100, trimmers cost over $100.

418
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:22,365
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you gotta get supplies to make sure that, you know, sanitation supplies, especially now with, you know, COVID and everything.

419
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:26,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you definitely gotta disinfect your tools, disinfect your chair.

420
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:28,849
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that, so those things cost money.

421
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:30,449
[SPEAKER_01]: But people don't look at it like that.

422
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:32,110
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, you went up on price.

423
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,110
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

424
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,792
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool to go up on price, too.

425
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:42,353
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you a lot of things, and it tells people a lot of things.

426
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:46,334
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming for the quality, then the price shouldn't matter.

427
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:53,016
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming just because, all right, it's convenient, and you're comfortable with this price, and we go up, and you don't show up, it's cool.

428
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,217
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay to fire clients.

429
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:55,538
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll fire you.

430
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,600
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll go to the next barber who charges maybe $10, that's cool.

431
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Or $15, that's fine.

432
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:08,103
[SPEAKER_05]: When you said that thing about feeling good about yourself and the way that you look, that's an investment in that, right?

433
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:08,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

434
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:09,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten more dollars.

435
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:13,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

436
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,486
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is the industry.

437
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:21,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say that we're probably the most appreciated and undervalued only because

438
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:29,227
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that people would try to lowball us on the price.

439
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:31,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, you guys are charging this much?

440
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:32,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go down the street and get it for cheaper.

441
00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:33,769
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, all right, my man, go ahead.

442
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,091
[SPEAKER_01]: You just created a space for somebody else to come in.

443
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:37,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.

444
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:40,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

445
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:41,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

446
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,655
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is on the docket?

447
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:44,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.

448
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:45,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.

449
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:48,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this thing, you know?

450
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:56,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've kind of been talking around it a little bit, but like, just sort of like your identity as a black man, like how's that come up for you in the work?

451
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:05,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask that one more time in a way that I can actually answer it better for you.

452
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:09,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I think about a barber shop.

453
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:09,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

454
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:16,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's movies that have been made about the barber shop, the stereotype of a barber shop.

455
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:22,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I guess I'm wondering if your identity plays a role at all.

456
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:27,496
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're right, you're right.

457
00:28:27,636 --> 00:28:29,037
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at movies on,

458
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:39,476
[SPEAKER_01]: The screen, TV screen, and theaters, it's more so like barbershop movies is featuring predominantly African American barbers.

459
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:56,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have Caucasian clients and I like to ask them questions that, they're not uncomfortable, it's just that, you know, we're in the shop, we're gonna ask questions that, you know, and I always ask them, like, okay, I'm a black man, you're a Caucasian man, but there's also barbers that are Caucasian as well.

460
00:28:58,543 --> 00:29:02,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you feel more comfortable sitting in my chair?

461
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:05,833
[SPEAKER_01]: My guys would say, man, you guys just have a way with the clippers.

462
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:07,996
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are attention to detail.

463
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:11,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying other barbers of other races aren't, nationalities aren't.

464
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:13,384
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something, it's almost like...

465
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:23,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was explaining to him, I was explaining to Jairo, people look at us like, and you see a black man in the streets, you know why he's, he's athletic, he runs fast, he can jump high.

466
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:26,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a black barber, he must know how to cut some hair.

467
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:38,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, I was in a barber shop where I was probably the third chair, and before me, from the front of the door to me, there was two other barbers, and they were Caucasian barbers, but they can cut.

468
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:40,075
[SPEAKER_01]: They can actually cut hair.

469
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:43,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And the black, a black person would come in and just walk right past him and come to me.

470
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:45,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey my man, how many you got?

471
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:47,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm booked for the day.

472
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,241
[SPEAKER_01]: My guys over here can cut you.

473
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:51,303
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how to cut black hair?

474
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, they're barbers.

475
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:55,508
[SPEAKER_01]: They're barbers.

476
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that part of the training for all barbers?

477
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Cutting all types of hair?

478
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:03,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that training you get in the real world.

479
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,034
[SPEAKER_01]: In school, in the barber school, to be honest with you, they don't really teach you anything.

480
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:12,077
[SPEAKER_01]: They teach you how to, you know, you pay a good amount of money.

481
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs some good money to go to the barber school.

482
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:14,900
[SPEAKER_01]: You do your hours.

483
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the state, you gotta do a thousand hours.

484
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:18,383
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there's barber schools.

485
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:23,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's gonna cost you to go to school to get that, to do your hours.

486
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:26,426
[SPEAKER_01]: and do an exam, and you still gotta take a state exam.

487
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:32,354
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't learn how to cut different types of hair in a barber school unless you're cutting each other, the students.

488
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:41,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in that, students that are in barber school don't actually have the skills, they're learning the skills, they don't have them already.

489
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:45,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get that training in the real world.

490
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:48,540
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting thrown to the wolves, pretty much.

491
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:56,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got people like myself, or barbers like myself, with the purpose of this shop was to tig.

492
00:30:57,913 --> 00:31:01,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, two of the barbers, Hannah and Jaro, they're fresh out.

493
00:31:01,654 --> 00:31:07,936
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fresh out of school, but most barbershops and barbershop owners would want barbers with experience.

494
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:09,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they want that.

495
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:15,378
[SPEAKER_01]: However they are collecting Booth or Randall Commission, they want that money.

496
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:19,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you're just a body in the shop, and I didn't want that.

497
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know how it felt when I finished school, and it was like, I almost stopped.

498
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, I'm not going to quit.

499
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And I seen that, and then I'm like, nah, it's not happening.

500
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:30,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

501
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:32,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Come be a part of this team, and then you're going to learn.

502
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:35,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to grow right away, instantaneously.

503
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:36,896
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

504
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:44,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds like when you have a barber who knows how to cut all different types of ferrets because they've taken the time to learn that in their job or somebody's helped.

505
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:44,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

506
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,064
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been in the industry for a while.

507
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,627
[SPEAKER_01]: They've probably worked at a shop or two or numerous shops or they've probably had their own.

508
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:53,070
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about that is they already have habits.

509
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,773
[SPEAKER_01]: You take somebody who doesn't have any habits and you show them.

510
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:06,801
[SPEAKER_01]: things that actually work, and they're making money, putting money in their pocket, and they go home feeling good, they develop good habits.

511
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:18,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbers like myself, you can take me somewhere, but like myself, I can go anywhere and be good because I know the result of good habits.

512
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the result of that, so I'll never regress.

513
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:26,905
[SPEAKER_01]: So I instill that in them, like, listen, people are gonna come in, learn their names,

514
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:32,655
[SPEAKER_01]: make them feel comfortable, have conversation, converse in the chair, all that stuff.

515
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:33,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a common interest.

516
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:34,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

517
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of hats that you wear here.

518
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:37,476
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot.

519
00:32:37,516 --> 00:32:37,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Teaching.

520
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:38,537
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.

521
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:40,157
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best part about it.

522
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:42,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning as well.

523
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:47,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually learning as well to learn how to operate and run a business and help.

524
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,860
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.

525
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

526
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:51,321
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no HR.

527
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:52,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm HR.

528
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:55,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the guy.

529
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,243
[SPEAKER_01]: We have each other.

530
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:03,346
[SPEAKER_05]: From the way you talk about it, you've been smiling this whole time.

531
00:33:03,426 --> 00:33:04,826
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like you really enjoy it.

532
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:07,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wake up every morning just to come here because I have to.

533
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:08,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

534
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:09,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be like, hey, you know what?

535
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:10,429
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can run it.

536
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:12,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just watch the cameras all day.

537
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:13,550
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I want to sit here and just

538
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:16,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great, yeah.

539
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

540
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

541
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:19,879
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta get you back in here.

542
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree.

543
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,001
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta get you back in here, get some semolina and we can sit down and have lunch or something, you know?

544
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

545
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:30,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, there's uh, Medford's planning like um,

546
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:32,944
[SPEAKER_05]: gay pride events this year.

547
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:36,086
[SPEAKER_05]: There's gonna be like a, hopefully like a parade and stuff.

548
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:39,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys could be, provide some haircuts.

549
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna come through this square?

550
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:44,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna be like, there's numerous squares in Medford.

551
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're still planning it.

552
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:54,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I think starting at the high school is the last plan that I heard and kind of going through, through like Winthrop Street.

553
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:56,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really sure, like into Medford Square.

554
00:33:57,445 --> 00:33:59,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's welcome in the shop.

555
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:10,908
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I wanted, diversity, whether it was race, gender, nationality, and however else you want to describe, everyone's welcome in the shop.

556

560
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,171
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're going to do it for real.

561
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have a live show out there or something.

562
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,452
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get some pictures in.

563
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:26,052
