00:00:42,788 --> 00:00:44,489
All right, thanks so much for joining me today.

10
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:49,932
If you don't mind just starting by introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:52,093
Glad to be here, Danielle.

12
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:53,633
My name is Patrick Clerkin.

13
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,935
My pronouns are he, him, and about myself.

14
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:09,761
I grew up on Boston's North Shore, lived in Medford for nine years now, was a mechanical engineer, have been a handyman for a bit, have traveled the country on a bunch of road trips,

15
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,040
Yeah, that's a couple things.

16
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:23,390
Yeah, and we did we did talk to each other two years ago when you were running for city council and you've just announced that you're going to run again or that you are running again.

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,955
And before we get into that, I just want to ask you arguably the most important question of today.

18
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:32,458
What is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

19
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,241
Gosh, OK, so.

20
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:50,932
It's tough to choose, but I would say that it's a tie between Bob's Italian food, which is right down the street from me, and there's a lamb tip sub, which is awesome.

21
00:01:51,513 --> 00:02:01,981
And then Rosso's, which is also fairly close to me, and they have a great vinegar, pepper, and fingerling potato pork chop, which I really enjoy.

22
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,155
We don't hear about Bob's too much, but Razzles for sure.

23
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,276
Great, well thank you.

24
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,001
So, like I said, you ran for city council two years ago.

25
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:22,507
You didn't win that time, so I'm kind of wondering, in the last two years,

26
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:33,502
What you've done in sort of that time in between maybe if you, you could remind us a little bit about your platform initially kind of what you're thinking this year is you're like kind of how you decided to run again.

27
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:35,244
Yeah, definitely.

28
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:35,685
So, um.

29
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:42,696
Okay, I'll start with the last time I ran, I really came out of the woodwork.

30
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:50,800
It was actually someone I had been doing handyman work for had said that he wished more people were running and I was civically inclined.

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,720
So I looked into it.

32
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:55,642
But I really jumped in like a week before the signature deadline.

33
00:02:55,662 --> 00:03:02,045
And so it was just a rapid fire immersion, learning everything that I could.

34
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:09,927
At that point, I'd been in Bedford for seven years, but you really start to learn a lot more a lot quicker once you jump into the political fray.

35
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:15,608
I did what I could that time, but ultimately, there was a lot of limitations.

36
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:24,990
Three-month time period, I was my own campaign manager, and I would say that my assessments of things and my

37
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:36,099
The way that I was speaking was less matured than it is now and also less polished in the sense of I was working on a

38
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:43,651
I was working in incubator at the time, I was trying to get an entrepreneurial idea started.

39
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:47,714
And so my way of talking was a little bit more kind of like technical with that.

40
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:54,579
And so I kind of came right into this, this public facing field and was maybe a little bit jilted and awkward with the way that I was talking.

41
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:03,265
So this time around, I really want to build off of the foundation from last time, but take some of the critiques and really, you know,

42
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:06,036
run a better campaign.

43
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:11,899
The second thing is I really want to focus on Medford in its entirety.

44
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:27,247
And by that I mean, you know, not just conservative or progressive or libertarian, not just this precinct or that precinct, all of the precincts, all of the people, and really just take inventory of all the resources that Medford has.

45
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:27,307
So

46
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:35,252
focusing on Medford in its entirety, and I would say also focusing on Medford locally, you know, like what's happening within the city.

47
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:50,064
There's clearly all kinds of things happening right now, you know, from a personal to local, state, national, global, but I really think that we have to, in this context, as a city councillor, I would need to focus on, you know, what's happening within the city.

48
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:52,025
So, you know,

49
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:56,087
The other part of your question was, what have I been doing since last time?

50
00:04:57,488 --> 00:05:06,372
After the tail end of the election, I was really like, okay, I want to do a postmortem on what it is that I did, what could I have done better, etc.

51
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:24,488
One of the big things that I learned from that campaign was, yes, there are all these city issues, what I'll be focusing on again, like, you know, the streets, high school, fire station, the city budget, development.

52
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:39,298
But one of the big things that wasn't really getting a lot of attention was the distribution of information, communications within the city, which I feel like is quite fractured and has resulted in people sort of

53
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:58,903
retreating to various uh you know facebook groups and reddit pages and newsletters and sometimes it can be kind of like an echo chamber you know so i had really been trying to from january of 2023 i'm sorry january 2024 through memorial day of 2024 to work on a um an answer to that you know to fill the

54
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,163
information void that I felt was in the city.

55
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:15,426
And I learned about how there previously had been a paper, but there hadn't been for, I don't know, maybe five years.

56
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:23,330
But getting a paper started would have been exorbitantly expensive, production run and getting the distribution out.

57
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,313
So what we settled on, it was me and a team of people that I was leading from who I had met.

58
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:45,303
during the election who cared about this issue, we decided to choose a platform, it was the Mighty Networks platform, and to try to build upon that basically a local social media site dedicated to Medford.

59
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:51,748
Not like a group on a Facebook page, but a Medford-wide group for Medford residents.

60
00:06:52,867 --> 00:07:05,676
And there's all kinds of issues that arise with that is like, how do you have it be both open and somewhat moderated, where like, there's there's ground rules for it, you know, it's not like anyone can just stomp through and start lobbing grenades.

61
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:18,166
But how do you have it be as open as possible, and we're creating sub sections on it that were dedicated to our specific topic areas like Medford dining, or recreation or

62
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:22,728
You name it, really.

63
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:37,694
There was a governance section as well, and this was really supposed to be a comprehensive hub, if you will, like a dashboard for existing Medford Media, and also adding on to that as well.

64
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:45,138
actually the plan was to have, you know, this very podcast be one of the things that would be linked to that hub.

65
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:55,503
It would it would be this podcast, it would be WMFO, the Tufts radio station, it would be Medford Community Media, anything related to the city.

66
00:07:55,543 --> 00:08:00,126
Now we have Gotta Know Medford, and there's a program Medford Happenings as well.

67
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:05,328
But yeah, that was what I had been doing related to Medford.

68
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,070
And then around March of

69
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:18,430
last year, I got, I started getting involved at national politics level with the Kennedy campaign, which is, you know, a controversial thing.

70
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,676
Some people like him, some people hate him, but my entry point into that, and I want to, you know, people have been asking me about this.

71
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:38,427
I want to state that my involvement with that was basically, I felt that at a federal level and at a global level, the United States

72
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:55,241
The pharmaceutical industry and the food industry, the agricultural industry and the chemical industry have become a powerful lobby and that we're sort of immersed in chemicals and it has affected our health.

73
00:08:55,921 --> 00:09:03,223
And so that's one of the things that I felt like was a high priority.

74
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:27,808
And I had previously, I know I've been going on at length here, but I had previously been working when I was an engineer as a chemical project manager at one point, where it was swapping out the chemicals in the mechanical systems from a chemical that was now considered a forever chemical and was very constrained to an alternative chemical.

75
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:48,583
And I think what people don't realize is these forever chemicals like asbestos, like lead, these things that are very durable in construction environments are also very durable in biological environments, whether that be the ecological environment or whether that be in the human body.

76
00:09:49,604 --> 00:10:10,702
And so similarly to that, what people don't realize is that the industrial food supply in our country, the preservatives that get put in the food that keep them shelf stable, or actually, you know, like prevent them from rotting, basically, are actually the same preservatives that are being fed into our body continuously that, you know, have an effect over time, an aggregate effect.

77
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:14,785
And so that was really how I started to get into that.

78
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:17,628
And like people, you know, I don't agree with everything, like,

79
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:20,529
I'm not trying to delve into national politics here.

80
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:25,091
I don't agree with everything that, you know, Kennedy has done or everything that he has said.

81
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,052
That was kind of my entry point.

82
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:45,860
And so I was involved from March through July with students for Kennedy, the goal of which was to get, you know, college students, particularly in Massachusetts, aware of his campaign because he was running as an independent candidate and to consider

83
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,946
you know, how on their campus they could organize awareness.

84
00:10:52,406 --> 00:11:01,156
So I was involved with that and once his campaign ended at the end of August, I was at both the RNC and the DNC, once his campaign ended at the end of

85
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:20,099
August, I started getting involved with this unity coalition concept, which was basically like, how do we get, there's clearly this major political divide, how do we get

86
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:27,404
the populists, like the Bernie supporters, the Trump supporters, the Kennedy supporters, that have a lot in common with each other.

87
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:30,825
They're reform-oriented people that see all these systemic problems.

88
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:37,068
How do you get them to see what they have in common with each other and work together, basically?

89
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:41,930
And that was a tall order, but that was what I was working on.

90
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:50,548
And then I sort of, you know, once the election happened, it was kind of like, okay, now I can re immerse myself and in Medford stuff.

91
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:54,190
And so I started showing the local meetings and stuff again.

92
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,392
But okay, that was a lot of busy, busy time for you.

93
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:03,797
So I want to start like, back up to what you were saying about the media and sort of creating like a way of

94
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,881
maybe like concentrating information for people about Medford.

95
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:10,383
What you described sounds to me a lot like Reddit.

96
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:14,567
Can you say, did it take form?

97
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:16,089
Is it something people can find?

98
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,735
How do you find it to be more accessible than other social media outlets?

99
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:51,618
um it was the website it's uh it was once again it's called the medford community network it's mcn02155.com it's still operational but it's incomplete so the original goal was to like basically find local representatives for each of these topic areas you know one of them was dei one of them was um uh as i mentioned a bunch of them before to find local sort of um

100
00:12:53,225 --> 00:13:20,409
leaders or people who were stores of tribal knowledge basically and get them to be the representative for that topic area and to to build out the page on the site and then to to you know invite others to uh to engage in those spaces basically so the goal was to not only have all these different spaces on the site but to also have a like a hub space that would be like the equivalent of a

101
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:32,193
A virtual cafeteria where, you know, you could go on to Medford community community networks and say, oh, I want to, I only care about the arts and culture and the city government.

102
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:33,393
I don't care about this other stuff.

103
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,414
So you could, you could do that.

104
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:37,415
And you could.

105
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:46,825
Like each of the sections would have its own calendar of events, and those calendars would migrate their events towards the main calendar.

106
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:51,870
So if you only cared about two pages, you'd only be getting the events of two of those pages on your main calendar.

107
00:13:52,851 --> 00:14:01,480
And you would also have the space where you could go and engage with other people in like a digital common

108
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:18,874
forum basically that would be you would allow cross-pollination of ideas and awareness but it was all right there it was all like the digital version of a of a shopping mall where it has all these storefronts in it and the goal was to not only have that be um

109
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:27,323
pulling together all these components digitally, which I feel like Reddit is more... First of all, one of the problems with Reddit is it's anonymous.

110
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:38,412
The anonymity factor really, I feel like, undermines, in a local context, that community building because it allows people to be...

111
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:52,319
some cases nasty to each other and in some cases to do things that they would otherwise not do to people if they had their name or their or their photo associated with their account.

112
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,462
So one of the things was to get people to

113
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:12,942
be open about, you know, their they didn't have to use a photo of themselves, but like, at least their name, you know, a real person, it would be focused on residents, because as far as I know, there's not really a constriction with the Reddit page as to like, you could be a non Medford resident, you can still be on it.

114
00:15:15,723 --> 00:15:25,347
And then just like, yes, we have this digital thing, but also encouraging people to go and interact with each other in the real world, basically, these events are these various things.

115
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,734
And that's what builds the civic, the social fabric.

116
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:30,715
Yeah.

117
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:45,463
And so I do think that's definitely a problem on a lot of our social, on a lot of our Facebook groups in Medford is that it's, you're right, people say things to each other on those groups that some of these people I've met in person and wouldn't talk to me like on the street.

118
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:53,287
But I think it's an interesting problem that we've been thinking a lot about is how

119
00:15:56,185 --> 00:16:01,367
how to make something that's accessible to all parts of the community, right?

120
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,508
Like elderly people, non-English speaking people, people that, like young people, right?

121
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:12,270
That is, that's also easy to interact with, right?

122
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:21,193
That, yeah, that also kind of like brings people together in a way that's not as, you know, lets people kind of stay in their corners, for a better phrase, right?

123
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:22,513
For all who worries.

124
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,614
So I'm also interested though in like,

125
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:27,390
I gotta ask you about the RFK stuff.

126
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:27,851
It feels like...

127
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:44,348
to try to be, to model yourself after, or to sort of like collect ideas from an independent, I think that RFK so far has done a lot of harm in terms of his like policies around like disease prevention.

128
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:51,052
And like, you know, we've seen like a drastic uptick in things like the measles, which is a very preventable disease, right?

129
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:57,776
And, you know, our very short-term history in Medfair, like we went through the COVID pandemic, right?

130
00:16:57,796 --> 00:16:58,057
And like,

131
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:02,200
And vaccines helped us get out of that, right?

132
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:09,427
And his controversial ideas around an autism registry and medicines for mental health.

133
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:17,354
Those are things that are happening on a national level that will impact Medford locally, if they haven't already, right?

134
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,837
And also, I guess I wonder how you kind of

135
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:53,098
think it's one thing to like if you have a somebody that somebody that you're modeling yourself after that is truly like independent and it hasn't been sort of like drawn to the to like this sort of ultra conservative side is what it feels like um how like how you're sort of thinking about that now yeah okay so there's a there's like a bunch of questions within that but i guess when it comes to how i would what i'm modeling myself after i don't really have a model like i'm i'm kind of um

136
00:17:54,079 --> 00:18:02,975
somewhat improvising in the sense of like, you know, I'm certainly not modeling myself after, after RFK, I'm modeling myself after

137
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,343
My politics, I'm more of an independent centrist.

138
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:12,825
And when I say that, I don't mean I don't have opinions on things.

139
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:16,107
I don't mean I'm a fence-sitter and I'm like, can't we all just get along, man?

140
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:22,111
What I mean is in the aggregate, my opinion on this issue might lean more progressive.

141
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,373
On this issue, it might lean more conservative.

142
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,114
On this one, it might lean more libertarian.

143
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:35,219
But, um, so, so, yeah, there's no real model model on and I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm improvising on a large way.

144
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:38,841
But when it comes to what you're saying about Kennedy.

145
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:50,710
Yeah, I, you know, I would say that my personal take on it with when it comes to like, vaccines is like, I think vaccines have have were like, 1 of the miracles of of modern science.

146
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:56,895
And I think that they helped to prevent a lot of the naturally occurring diseases like.

147
00:18:57,255 --> 00:19:11,357
you know, measles would be one of them and, you know, like typhoid, I'm not sure if these were vaccine diseases, but like typhoid and tuberculosis and malaria and like, you know, hepatitis and all these various things, you know.

148
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:26,420
I feel like it gets into more dangerous territory once you start getting into gain-of-function research because there's, that's where the, first of all, I feel like people assume that when you question sort of

149
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:47,949
some aspects of medical science that you're like anti-science and I think that is some people are but like I think that it's dismissive because there's really a lot of valid critiques of the pharmaceutical industry you know which is like they fund a lot of medical science and so it would be like saying

150
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:59,932
it would be wrong to critique military policy coming out of the Pentagon, because yes, the Pentagon, they're in theory the experts, but they get a lot wrong, too.

151
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:09,355
So I feel like, on the one hand, critiquing the pharmaceutical industry is different than critiquing the science.

152
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:20,424
And the other concern is like when I just what I just mentioned with gain of function research is like, and this is a rabbit hole, but there is a Pentagon slash.

153
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:32,912
defense agency partnership with pharmaceutical companies on bioweapons, and people don't really realize that.

154
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:36,554
They don't really realize the history of the bioweapons program in the U.S.

155
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:39,015
and global bioweapons programs.

156
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:40,536
They don't really understand

157
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:52,983
Going back to World War II, how the Japanese had Unit 731, which was a bioweapons facility, and the United States, after the end of World War II, inherited that.

158
00:20:54,244 --> 00:21:01,467
It's just like Joseph Mengele was sort of that experimenter at Auschwitz.

159
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,729
The Japanese also were experimenting.

160
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:09,652
And so that bioweapons program combined with American bioweapons programs and

161
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:15,594
I don't remember if it was like Fort Detricks or Fort Dix, but we had our own facility.

162
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:26,239
It ties into pharma, it ties into military, it ties into various aspects of US policy.

163
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:39,345
And I feel like that is worthy of critiquing because one of the concerns is that, where does medicine and health policy begin versus defense and military policy?

164
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:58,211
Yeah, no, I don't think it's unreasonable to critique any of those things, and I think that there's some pretty harmful things happening right now around that kind of, like I mentioned, autism registries threatening to take away people's mental health medication.

165
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:10,161
So yeah, no, I think those are, and so that sort of leads me into my last sort of question about what, you know, your kind of opening remarks about national versus local politics.

166
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:21,532
So like, in the last two years, our city councilors have had to have been asked and have created policy around their thoughts about like, you know, like the war in Gaza, about abortion rights, about

167
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:28,394
just like protecting certain rights that we have had as a country for a long time.

168
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:35,355
And so I think that, I guess, and I know that recently you've challenged our current president, Zach Bares, to a debate around this topic.

169
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:41,837
And I'm hearing you talk about how much national politics are informing how you think about these things.

170
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:44,997
And I think they have to sort of inform, they affect us every day, right?

171
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:47,838
So they have to sort of inform how we think about local politics.

172
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:49,078
So I guess I'm wondering,

173
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:56,492
how you would, how you can separate those things, or how you would imagine focusing only on local issues.

174
00:22:57,592 --> 00:23:07,637
Yeah, like I'm basically a federalist in the sense of like, I believe that there's the realm of the personal, the realm of the local, the state, the federal, the global.

175
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:10,698
And that doesn't mean that they don't lead into each other, of course.

176
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:16,601
But I think what people, you know, like some people have said to me, well, all politics is local.

177
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,521
Tip O'Neill said that.

178
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:17,962
And it's like,

179
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:34,936
I understand like what's meant by that like local politics is where the rubber hits the road, so to speak, but I also like that's a slogan and and so like there's some truth to it, but like saying all politics local is like saying all all.

180
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,902
all life is cellular, you know what I mean?

181
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:49,326
Like, it's like a human, the human organism is composed of cells, which make up tissues, which make up organs, which make up organ systems, which make up the organism.

182
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:55,549
And so clearly, not all the functions of the organism could happen at the cellular level, to draw an analogy.

183
00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:02,372
So like, what I'm what I'm trying to say is like, there's levels of complexity and levels of order, that

184
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,059
really can only be handled at higher levels.

185
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,521
And so it's not to say that like, clearly Medford doesn't exist in a vacuum.

186
00:24:10,922 --> 00:24:29,771
Like I've mentioned this before, it's like there are effects of higher level things that come down to the Medford, there's the animosities that exist among people in different groups, there's technologies, there's inflation, there's immigration, there's there's these things.

187
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:32,613
But I so you know, as they

188
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:59,559
affect the city like i i feel like you you can obviously comment i'm not sitting like no no we can't comment on um you know like that student granted some people say you shouldn't like because it was in somerville but it was right on our doorstep that student that was uh was abducted by ice uh i'm not saying that shouldn't be talked about that was right in in our area but what i'm saying is the example of like

189
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:09,954
you know, there was one meeting where it was calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and then calling for an end to the to the the American embargo of Cuba.

190
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:16,118
That to me is like going out of your way to find an issue to make it the city's issue.

191
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:18,820
And I just felt like that was like that.

192
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,102
That wasn't just like, let me say that this is going on.

193
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:29,887
And it's it's it's unjust that that was like that took like hours out of the meeting and it pushed the other things out of the way.

194
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:33,132
And at the end of it, it's like, we don't really.

195
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:38,562
It's not really something that the city council is capable of.

196
00:25:39,938 --> 00:26:00,419
getting to the bottom of or addressing in a meaningful way that's kind of but so i would i would argue though that did you did you go to that meeting where we they we heard people talk about their support of that motion yeah yeah and like i think that was really really meaningful for a lot of people to hear that their city had was thinking about this was supporting this and

197
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:07,539
I think that that's sort of how people become engaged with local politics, is that my city cares about me.

198
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,720
And even if they're not going to fix this problem, they know that it's something to address.

199
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:23,482
When we called for calling racism a public health emergency, when we talk about codifying abortion rights in our state, when we talk about sanctuary cities, those things affect Medford residents.

200
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:29,103
And it may not ultimately be the city council's decision to change those things, but

201
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:35,223
knowing that you have allies in the city I think is really, really important for a lot of constituents.

202
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:44,882
Yeah, I think that it's like for some of the issues that you mentioned, like if it was addressing prejudice within Medford, I think that would be one thing.

203
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:49,586
If it was addressing an abortion clinic within Medford, things like that.

204
00:26:49,887 --> 00:27:00,476
But talking about some of these general things, I think it overwhelms the city's capacity to address the things that are within its

205
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:13,563
But except that, so there may not be abortion clinics in Medford, but there are probably doctors that are performing abortions in some way, prescribing abortion medication, people that are getting abortions that live in Medford, people that are experiencing discrimination in Medford.

206
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:18,325
So like, I think it's a little short-sighted to say it's not happening as a city function necessarily.

207
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:22,107
Those things are happening, and those are affecting the lives of people in Medford.

208
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:32,210
So yes, and that's why I think that those should happen through things outside of the city council, like action networks and in various organized groups and things like that.

209
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,571
It's really, my point isn't that people shouldn't talk about these things or have opinions about them.

210
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:46,154
My point is ultimately, is city council the place to address these things in this way, basically?

211
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:50,015
And if we allow, and I feel like people,

212
00:27:51,650 --> 00:28:18,188
assume that i'm specifically targeting like progressive policies in this and in reality it's like i i would be the same with conservative or libertarian or whatever like it's really like once you open the door for this it really overwhelms the like there are core functions that the government is is supposed to uh deliver on and our capacity to deliver on those gets

213
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:28,429
marginalized and pushed to the perimeter when it becomes sort of an open forum to address any topic, basically.

214
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:35,572
I think that a lot of those motions by the City Council were brought to them by citizen groups like Safe Medford and groups like that.

215
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:41,015
And I do think in a city like Medford, a lot of power is consolidated in groups like City Council.

216
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:46,217
I had an issue with the plumbing in my house that was caused by trouble with the city's pipes, right?

217
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:51,159
The only way I could get them to get a reply from someone was to contact a city councilor, right?

218
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:54,700
I think people do rely on city council in that way.

219
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,544
And I guess I'm curious, what do you think was not attended to when city councilors were talking about these issues in their meetings?

220
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:08,105
I mean, on that specific meeting, I'm not sure.

221
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:33,135
recently um there was a charter uh there was a charter thing that got kind of pushed late so like my concern is and this is this other issue isn't entirely city council or any one uh entity or person's fault this has been a cumulative issue that what i was talking about before with the city communications i think that because the communications have um

222
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:35,659
degraded over time.

223
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:50,848
And by the way, I scoured the city website over the last two weeks and really went into every nook and cranny to find important plans and important maps and things that I felt like the public might have been missing.

224
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:59,573
Because I think that there's this notion that just because something gets put onto the municipal website that it gets beamed into everyone's brain, which clearly isn't true.

225
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:16,608
And so, yeah, the point of what I'm saying is, a lot of people feel that some of these plans and some of these proposals get dropped out of the void into their consciousness at the last minute, past the moment of public comment.

226
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:37,116
And so some people show up to these meetings to speak on these Medford issues and to hear on these Medford issues, and then they find out that, you know, that issue is being displaced to the end of the meeting so that people can talk about trying to solve the, you know, the Gaza crisis or the ending the embargo in Cuba.

227
00:30:37,896 --> 00:30:49,986
And then they go home eventually because they're like, you know what, I can't spend three hours here, four hours here, into the wee hours of the morning.

228
00:30:50,086 --> 00:30:52,268
I was hoping that I could get this addressed.

229
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:59,170
That's where I'm saying like, I really feel like people sense that it's like a lack of compassion in me.

230
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,932
It's not that I lack compassion on these issues, it's that I feel like some of these are just the wrong place.

231
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:10,473
Like the Gaza issue or the Cuban, and I don't mean to just harp on those two things, but those are the most obvious.

232
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:15,675
It's like the amount of complexity that it's like, you know,

233
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:40,919
it's it's like the the what the UN and some of these global governments haven't even been able to address these things and I feel like like you know the everyday person can get involved through like an action network or through organized means but I just think that it's really it's wading into very very deep waters that

234
00:31:42,264 --> 00:31:46,173
local government doesn't have the capacity to handle.

235
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:50,042
And I understand that people

236
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:57,930
It gives people comfort, but I think that can be dealt with by giving referrals to people to say, hey, you're being heard.

237
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:12,739
And just so you know, like this, this isn't the best place to solve this, but there, there are resources like there's this group, there's this action network, there's this support group, there's this meetup group, there's this, there's other avenues.

238
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:17,741
You can petition the, the, the other higher level governments.

239
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:19,623
There's other avenues to,

240
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:24,607
enact this, you know, I'm not implying like, hey, squash this.

241
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:26,169
Don't address it.

242
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,451
Forget about it.

243
00:32:28,732 --> 00:32:31,876
Yeah, it's like a particular thing that I'm basically taking.

244
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:32,978
Yeah, and I guess like,

245
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:49,351
Imagining if I am a voter coming to voice a concern or frustration, or in this case a real fear about the safety of my neighbors.

246
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:56,557
you know, your example about Gaza, like, Medford's not immune from, like, antisemitism and Islamophobia, right?

247
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:59,139
So, like, how is all this that's happening in the world affecting us?

248
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:03,402
And if I were to come to you as my city councillor to say, what can you do about this?

249
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:07,986
And you gave me a referral, like, I don't know, like, I don't know what that would feel like.

250
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:09,627
And maybe that's not what you're saying.

251
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:10,367
Yeah.

252
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:11,848
Yeah.

253
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:15,151
I mean, it's, it's, the answer is, like,

254
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:20,083
Medford can't solve those issues.

255
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:21,183
You know what I mean?

256
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:25,905
And maybe people just need to hear that outright is like, this is not going to be solved in Medford.

257
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:30,006
And it doesn't mean that it's not important.

258
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:33,748
It just means that there's, it's the wrong tool to use.

259
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:36,008
It's the wrong avenue to approach it.

260
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:39,910
And like, if we lose sight of like, if we try to make everything

261
00:33:41,617 --> 00:34:08,135
i mean maybe this is like you know i mentioned i've been a handyman maybe this is like a handyman way of looking at it but and i know that's not handyman work is not you know work in the public sector but pools are for specific purposes and if you like if you start using things forever like if you start using uh you know a hammer for every for every purpose or a screwdriver for every purpose like that's not what it's intended for and you're gonna get

262
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,171
you're going to not only get bad results, but you're going to destroy the tool.

263
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:21,535
You know, it's, that's sort of, yeah, it feels like a little bit of an exaggeration there, but if I use my sewer analogy, right, we had a problem with our sewer.

264
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:27,197
Nobody listened to us until we talked to city council, the city council person didn't come to my house to fix the sewer.

265
00:34:27,497 --> 00:34:29,217
They knew who to talk to, who to connect me with.

266
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:34,299
Like they use their power to help advocate for me, but the sewer is a local issue.

267
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:35,480
That's, that's my point.

268
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:40,880
They had a way to address that, because the issue that you addressed was a local issue.

269
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,720
Right.

270
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,585
Well, yeah, and I guess maybe it's a little more abstract, but the impact of a war in another country is a local issue, right?

271
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,947
The way that that's impacting people that live here, among other things, right?

272
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:56,128
But we can move on, I feel like.

273
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:57,909
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:34:57,949 --> 00:35:00,871
Ultimately, I think what should also be considered is,

275
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:16,765
How do we give people a sense of comfort, but without inflaming Islamophobia and antisemitism in a local context where it might have not existed at that point?

276
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:28,255
That's another concern is like in addressing some of these things in the way that we're addressing them, we're creating inflammation and counter inflammation and sort of in some sense, bringing the war

277
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:47,733
to Medford and we have to be careful about like and that's just one issue but like any any of these things is like it creates inflammation and counter inflammation that makes the performance of of other functions lessened or more difficult.

278
00:35:48,948 --> 00:36:09,062
Yeah, maybe I do think though that like when you know that makes I think when you're addressing an issue that has so much that is so sensitive, I think that that may be one outcome is that people are people that are reacting to that may not have reacted to it otherwise, but also you're reaching those people who are reacting to it and are feeling pain around it right and like and I think that there is a benefit to.

279
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,663
to interacting with these big issues.

280
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:14,665
I think if Medford said nothing, it would have felt a lot worse.

281
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:18,147
And I think that goes for a lot of things.

282
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:29,734
And I do appreciate that city councilors have to hear about a lot of stuff that personally they might not agree with, or decisions might be reached that they weren't necessarily the ones that they would choose.

283
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:34,577
And I think if you were elected to the city council, you'd probably be amongst people that had

284
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:40,790
maybe different opinions about things and I wonder how you might handle that.

285
00:36:42,397 --> 00:36:43,338
I'm fine with I'm fine.

286
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:54,026
Like I actually this is one of my big things is like I've been so first of all, I understand that people a lot of people want catharsis, you know, there's so much happening right now.

287
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,090
And there's so much that is unsettling and uncertain and disturbing.

288
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:04,475
And people people want an anchor point and they want a compass and they want like, you know, what the hell is happening?

289
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:06,136
Am I going to be okay?

290
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:07,477
Is the world going to be okay?

291
00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:09,039
Is that like, there's all these things, right?

292
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,235
And so naturally I understand people looking for comfort.

293
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:18,160
I don't mean to be dismissive of that by any means.

294
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:24,428
But I will say that I'm very comfortable around people of different persuasions and people of different beliefs.

295
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:33,524
I've been in in virtually every group, politically, demographically, whatever.

296
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,747
And I find that like, you meet wonderful people in all of them.

297
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:40,270
And then I find that you also meet assholes and all of them.

298
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:53,401
Like there's there's people who are like, I think that people shouldn't be afraid to be prideful of whatever, you know, that all that intersectionality, like whatever fragments of your identity, like, shine your it's your kaleidoscope, right?

299
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:54,422
You know, like,

300
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:56,999
be prideful, but don't be.

301
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,420
This is to all all groups.

302
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,021
Don't be chauvinistic or militant.

303
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:21,888
Because some like any group can have the capacity to become a, like a dark version of itself, basically, you meet you meet people in any group who are, as I just said, chauvinistic or militant, where they take it beyond a healthy pride, to the point of like,

304
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:30,334
Everyone else must see the world through my sliver, basically, and pushing everything to the margins.

305
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:33,337
And so I think that that needs to be kept in mind.

306
00:38:34,238 --> 00:38:35,760
The overall balance.

307
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:42,267
I think that Medford will do well when things are kept in balance and people don't have to be in fear.

308
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,503
But they also shouldn't feel that they can dominate others.

309
00:38:48,003 --> 00:38:56,128
I feel like I've seen examples of that from a lot of different corners, and so the fault doesn't lie exclusively on any one group.

310
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:59,570
But I'm hoping that we can transcend that.

311
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,308
Yeah, so I'm comfortable.

312
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:05,890
I very much am comfortable with different groups.

313
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:14,076
If I got invited or was, you know, as long as, you know, I'm not being chased away with a bat, I would feel comfortable going into any circle.

314
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:15,797
Yeah.

315
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:16,338
So, well, thank you.

316
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:17,578
I mean, this has been, like, really helpful.

317
00:39:17,598 --> 00:39:27,445
I appreciate you hanging with my pushback there, but is there anything else that you want us to know or, like, places that we can, like, get more information about you or engage with you in a different way?

318
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:52,532
My campaign website, CLERKIN, C-L-E-R-K-I-N, the number four, medford.com, and that has an Anadot donation page on the front, but also at the top has the different tabs where you can find a little bit more about me, a little bit more of what my vision is, and the issues.

319
00:39:53,332 --> 00:40:04,460
Starting out on the campaign, the issues are more crude in the sense of, as I learn more, I update my perspective and make them more nuanced.

320
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:10,164
So right now, it's a little bit like, hey, I'm out there learning on these issues, but you'll see that there.

321
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:14,132
Um, I have three social media accounts.

322
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:24,136
Um, one of them is on Instagram once again, at clerking for Medford on Facebook, clerking for Medford and on Reddit, I think it's just like CP clerking or something like that.

323
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:27,117
So that's primarily where you can find me.

324
00:40:27,197 --> 00:40:31,379
I'm going to be at Colleen's, um, every Wednesday from seven to eight.

325
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:33,860
I really, that's important to me that people have, uh,

326
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,781
An in-person opportunity to just to talk to me or to share their concerns.

327
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:44,603
So that's every Wednesday until election day I'll be available and That's that's pretty much it for now.

328
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:46,083
Otherwise, you'll you'll see me at events.

329
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:51,344
You'll see me around, you know I'll be I'll be glad to talk to any of you.

330
00:40:51,944 --> 00:40:53,525
Please feel free to come up and talk to me.

331
00:40:53,605 --> 00:41:02,867
I'm not You know, I'm not a like angry or avoidant person, so I see a lot of ice cream in your future, but

332
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:04,259
Oh, yeah, I know.

333
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,861
Well, that's another thing that I didn't mention before.

334
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,721
There's a sandwich.

335
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,023
I don't remember what it's called, though, at Collins.

336
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:15,568
I try to get it fairly frequently rather than having the ice cream every week.

337
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:17,369
But I love ice cream.

338
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:23,494
I just want to say, Danielle, thank you for having me on.

339
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:26,296
I really appreciate it because, you know,

340
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:38,248
I, no one agrees 100% with anyone, but like, I just appreciate you giving me the forum to clear the air and to for you to ask questions to give pushback and all that.

341
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,429
I just, I just appreciate it.

342
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:40,611
So thank you.

343
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:41,572
Oh, thank you.

344
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:41,972
Yeah.

345
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:42,292
Yeah.

346
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:43,354
Well, good luck.

347
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:44,615
Yeah.

348
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:44,996
Thank you.
