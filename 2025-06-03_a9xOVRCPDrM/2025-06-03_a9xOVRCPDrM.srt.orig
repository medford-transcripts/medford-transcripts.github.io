1
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:50,982
you

2
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:57,727
you

3
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Mic check one, two, check one, two.

4
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Microphone check two, check mic, mic one, two.

5
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:24,444
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good on my end.

6
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:40,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh yeah.

7
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:43,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you get them to, yeah, if they want to speak, you mean?

8
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:43,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

9
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:44,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

10
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've already made the council members co-hosts.

11
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:48,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're good there.

12
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:48,717
Great.

13
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:49,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know

14
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a meeting of the Public Works and Facilities Committee for June 3rd, 2025.

15
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,119
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the, I will restate that now that I'm on mic.

16
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,943
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Public Works and Facilities Committee for June 3rd, 2025.

17
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:07,825
[SPEAKER_03]: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.

18
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:08,886
[SPEAKER_03]: in City Hall.

19
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:16,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, I think I will go ahead and just start by having you call roll call.

20
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:16,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

21
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:19,114
[SPEAKER_06]: President Behrs.

22
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:20,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

23
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazaro?

24
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:24,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

25
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:25,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemming?

26
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see Councilor Lemming.

27
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

28
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:30,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Callahan?

29
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:30,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

30
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:39,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And today we are covering paper 24-034 from President Zach Behrs.

31
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a report request from the Facilities Manager.

32
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:51,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Public Works and Facilities Committee request a report from the Facilities Manager containing the following information.

33
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:55,894
[SPEAKER_03]: One, a complete inventory of city-owned properties and city-managed properties.

34
00:14:56,375 --> 00:15:00,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, cost to restore each property on the above inventory to a state of good repair.

35
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, cost to maintain each property in a state of good repair once restored.

36
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite the facilities manager to present and discuss the above report once completed.

37
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:18,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And we very much appreciate our facilities manager, Mr. Riggi, being here.

38
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:20,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Riggi, please take the floor.

39
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me, let's turn you on.

40
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:29,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, this thing is not, ah, there we go.

41
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:37,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done.

42
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:38,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me.

43
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:39,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleasure to be here.

44
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:40,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming.

45
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:48,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I could say that the facility since I've started this position have gotten much better.

46
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:55,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm proud of the work that we've been able to do for the city and continue to do for the city.

47
00:15:56,645 --> 00:16:01,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking forward to compiling this report that's requested by the city council.

48
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:17,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important to have a document that shows not only every building, but what the future of those buildings are in terms of what work may be needed in the buildings.

49
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:27,324
[SPEAKER_05]: and then what work to maintain the buildings and keep them going to what I call the best condition that we can leave a building in.

50
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:51,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I foresee though, I think to do the forecasting, I would probably have to hire a consultant to come in and inventory building systems and conditions of the building so we can try to get a real cost of what it would be to bring our buildings back to the condition that they were when they were built.

51
00:16:53,698 --> 00:17:00,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give a timeline and a cost estimate for what it would take to provide the, and you got a copy of this.

52
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a copy of that.

53
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:04,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I started working on it in the background already.

54
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,449
[SPEAKER_05]: A timeline, I'd like to think six months.

55
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:20,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Cost, it would be hard to speak on because I'd have to reach out to one of our house doctors so they can compile a team to come together.

56
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I know

57
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:28,179
[SPEAKER_05]: just to give you a ballpark to do some work for the bathrooms renovation.

58
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,783
[SPEAKER_05]: That was probably about $50,000 to pull together for the team just for the bathrooms here at City Hall.

59
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:39,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So to do a more extensive one, I don't want to really put a cost estimate.

60
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I could always come back to you with a cost estimate for that.

61
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:51,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want to pin myself down on something or I really need to know an exact cost before I can say that.

62
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:56,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, but you're talking about a cost estimate for the cost estimate, right?

63
00:17:56,516 --> 00:18:10,813
[SPEAKER_05]: A cost estimate to come up with, yes, what systems we would need, and then they would be able to provide cost estimates for what systems need to be replaced and give us a cost estimate on replacing those, yes.

64
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

65
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:23,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a sense for, I mean, is a better process that you provide us with an estimate of how much it will cost you to do this report?

66
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that you?

67
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, basically, most of the report is my time.

68
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Only item two would be an outside consultant.

69
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:41,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I can provide you a cost estimate for that and then get the funding for that and start and get underway with that.

70
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:42,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

71
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn to my fellow counselors and see if folks have questions.

72
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:51,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

73
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:54,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic doesn't say your name on here.

74
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:57,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

75
00:18:57,908 --> 00:18:59,530
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the... Thank you.

76
00:18:59,570 --> 00:18:59,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

77
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:03,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Riggi, thank you for being here today.

78
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:05,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my question.

79
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:05,715
[SPEAKER_04]: The catch-22 is

80
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:10,130
[SPEAKER_04]: how much are we gonna spend to see how much we have to spend?

81
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:19,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, obviously we need that to get done, but I think it'll be interesting to see how much before we move forward to do that.

82
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:27,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we all know that a lot of our buildings are in tough shape and they need some work.

83
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:32,290
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting to see what that cost analysis would look like.

84
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:39,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, if you're saying that it costs that much money just to look at bathrooms and we're looking at looking at

85
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:57,328
[SPEAKER_04]: fire stations, city hall, I'm assuming not the schools, but I know we talked, look already in the process right now with the Heckner Center that hopefully will be a part of that process and then many other buildings.

86
00:19:57,388 --> 00:20:04,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, I know that's a daunting task task for one man, so one person to try to do that.

87
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:10,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that just to give people an understanding in neighboring community,

88
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:17,421
[SPEAKER_04]: their team that we have here, facilities team over at Summerville.

89
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:34,671
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, I believe, two city facility managers plus assistant managers and supervisors, and then a team that work under them, which are mechanical teams, electricians, painters, plumbers, and carpenters.

90
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,031
[SPEAKER_04]: They even have a locksmith.

91
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:44,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is something that, you know, obviously this has been an historical weakness in Medford that we didn't have a team together.

92
00:20:45,025 --> 00:21:02,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this is a great start, but it'll be, for one council, be interesting to see what that analysis looks like to weigh it to, you know, whether we spend it actually doing it or we spend it actually looking to see how much it should take to get done.

93
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:02,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

94
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:07,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have questions from other councilors?

95
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:15,218
[SPEAKER_03]: can you let Zach in?

96
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,681
[SPEAKER_03]: President Behrs?

97
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:24,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair Callahan.

98
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:27,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Director Riggi.

99
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:41,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering, you know, I think something that would be useful as part of this is, you know, a spreadsheet that we can make available on the city website, just listing, you know, address,

100
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:54,420
[SPEAKER_07]: name, assessed value, and then any other kind of pertinent data for all of our city-owned buildings and as well as our city-owned properties in general.

101
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I think just having that inventory piece is really helpful.

102
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you have a version of that that you use in your day-to-day already.

103
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:18,580
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's, I think that's a key first step and, you know, being able to put in your assessment on the condition of those properties and buildings, I think is really valuable.

104
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:33,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can move to this kind of bigger question, you know, what, what is it going to take to restore or renovate or maintain or replace buildings given their condition and their, their life cycle?

105
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:41,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and I wonder, you know, I think, you know, going to the house doctors is certainly one option.

106
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:52,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're able to do, I'm sure the bathroom project was relatively detailed work because, you know, we're planning to actually specifically install and replace bathrooms in the building.

107
00:22:52,418 --> 00:23:00,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if, you know, a slightly more bird's eye view might be more affordable than that detailed work.

108
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:03,205
[SPEAKER_07]: But also I think it might be worth considering if,

109
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:31,024
[SPEAKER_07]: if we're seeing a very high estimate from the house doctors or something else, maybe going out to bid on something like this, or also maybe doing something similar to what DPW has done with the roads and sidewalk assessment and the water and sewer assessment, where we had that done and presented to us to inform the long-term financial plan of those capital assets.

110
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:44,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some thought that I'm also just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, you know, where you started when you came in versus what resources and materials you've been able to develop up to this point.

111
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:56,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe as well just talk a little bit more about what you would be looking for in an assessment like what we're talking about.

112
00:23:57,355 --> 00:24:04,079
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know those are pretty general questions, but I just think going through that in a little bit more detail would be helpful for everybody involved to hear.

113
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you in advance for humoring me on that.

114
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:09,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, no problem.

115
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:18,648
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I actually have a spreadsheet with every city-owned building on it, and that's what I'm using with square footage and assessed values.

116
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:24,431
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's actually something probably I can help adapt to get up on the city website.

117
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:28,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I can I interrupt you for one second?

118
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:32,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you at least provide some version of that just to the city counselors?

119
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:34,815
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be I can I can provide what I have.

120
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:35,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

121
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Send it over.

122
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:45,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think what I first started was starting going to every building on get my own assessment of the building.

123
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:46,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

124
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually did that before I even talked to people that worked in the buildings, I wanted to get my own take on what conditions the buildings look like before I could get.

125
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:05,072
[SPEAKER_05]: any jaded responses or be swayed in a certain way.

126
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:10,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So I knew what buildings looked like before I started working with people and actually started diving in.

127
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:15,305
[SPEAKER_05]: What I found was that the city buildings

128
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:22,972
[SPEAKER_05]: were overall not taken care of to what I would call my standard.

129
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:25,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have very high standards.

130
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:36,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And my feeling is that a building has to be functional for those not only coming into the building, but the people that use it every day for work.

131
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:41,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they don't meet that requirement, something's wrong with the building.

132
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:43,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, the fire stations.

133
00:25:44,515 --> 00:26:01,998
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got here and doing a tour with the counselors and going really through the detail and listening to the firefighters and getting more information about what they were living with, I think we've corrected a lot of those issues.

134
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:03,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We started with windows.

135
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:13,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Fixed the bathroom that had a major hole in it and engine for which should have never happened and getting those kinds of things done.

136
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I look at at every building and seeing the work here at City Hall.

137
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:28,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But even the police and DBW and library, they were brand new buildings that didn't have any kind of preventive maintenance programs.

138
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:37,078
[SPEAKER_05]: So to get preventive maintenance programs for the HVAC systems, the sprinklers weren't even being inspected in those buildings.

139
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:42,363
[SPEAKER_05]: To get those inspected, to ensure that the emergency generators are

140
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:45,734
[SPEAKER_05]: not only tested, but they're load tested once a year.

141
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:52,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know that if there's a blackout, the generator will come on and carry the load that they're designed for.

142
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:01,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's those kind of issues that I've encountered that I feel that we've corrected and we still have more to do.

143
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:11,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We have three different house doctors, so I wouldn't go out, I wouldn't reach out to just one, I would reach out to all three to get pricing to do this.

144
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:31,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it would probably be more of an overall look of, okay, look at our HVAC system, look at the lighting systems, look at the flooring, windows, tell me what you think needs to be addressed, when it needs to be addressed, and let's put some cost to that.

145
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:40,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't have to be the detail as we did at the bathrooms, but it would involve 18 buildings, so it would be an extensive list.

146
00:27:48,263 --> 00:28:02,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, I'm directory and one other question I had is just as relates to not just the buildings but the non building properties, you know, parks to the own lots that are unused.

147
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any sort of engagement around that.

148
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do if somebody draws me into it.

149
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:13,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, I don't.

150
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,189
[SPEAKER_05]: But so I try to not involve myself in that.

151
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:24,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But if somebody from the DPW comes and asks for help, actually, I was asked to

152
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:32,626
[SPEAKER_05]: about the new playground in McLean if I could help getting a gutter and a downspout put on a structure there.

153
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:37,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm brought into the process, I'll gladly help any city department.

154
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:39,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

155
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:50,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it might be worth us also maybe engaging some of our DPW folks and maybe even planning office folks just to make sure that those

156
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:53,737
[SPEAKER_07]: those capital assets are included too.

157
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:59,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it really, I think that the, I'm not necessarily saying you, but, you know, for the council to engage those folks.

158
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:14,964
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, now that we have the road and sidewalk assessment and we have water and sewer, and we have you on board with our buildings, I think we just need to make sure that that fourth piece of what we own doesn't get left out in the long run.

159
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:19,145
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, our parks and the non-building structures on them, as well as just

160
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:27,694
[SPEAKER_07]: a full full catalog of, um, city owned lots around around the city that maybe aren't even being used for really anything right now.

161
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:30,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Or can't be used for anything in the long run.

162
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:35,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you,

163
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:54,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we move on to public comment, I just wanna see what you think about a little bit of a timeline.

164
00:29:54,732 --> 00:30:04,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that if you can get us that database, just the spreadsheet, in a couple of weeks, is that reasonable?

165
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:05,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

166
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:05,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, beautiful.

167
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:14,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And then do you think you could get us an estimate by a month or two from now, like an estimate, sorry, an estimate of how much it will cost to get the cost estimate?

168
00:30:14,717 --> 00:30:16,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be able to do that would be beautiful, right?

169
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:21,080
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can get those things the next month or so, that'd be really helpful.

170
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:24,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think we can, um Maybe.

171
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:27,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, maybe what?

172
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:34,947
[SPEAKER_03]: What accounts are think about us revisiting based upon that estimate and making a decision as to whether we want to, um Request.

173
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:39,610
[SPEAKER_03]: That that full, um, estimate of

174
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:47,957
[SPEAKER_03]: seem reasonable that we revisit that in this committee?

175
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense to me.

176
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:58,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that'll be our plan.

177
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:06,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once you get us the estimate for the estimate, we can let you know whether, you know, what we think about moving forward with that.

178
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:09,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful, great.

179
00:31:09,928 --> 00:31:11,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I will open it up for public comment.

180
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:14,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's anyone, I do not see anyone in the chamber.

181
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:19,612
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anyone on Zoom who wants to make any commentary on this topic.

182
00:31:23,434 --> 00:31:26,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Kraus, we are asking you to unmute now.

183
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, go ahead.

184
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:30,718
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the floor.

185
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:33,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street, Medford.

186
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also on the board of the Francis Schweier Auditorium in Gene McJim.

187
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:43,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And I represent the friends on the capital improvements committee of the show, your commission.

188
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to counselor bears for initiating this and for the committee for taking this up tonight.

189
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:57,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree that this is importantly needed for the city facilities.

190
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:05,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Friends have been an advocate for the hiring of a facilities director for many, many years.

191
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:09,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were delighted when Paul Riggi was hired for this position.

192
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:12,873
[SPEAKER_01]: As you saw tonight, he is extremely capable.

193
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:23,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And his addition to the city administration has been fantastic for Chevalier in particular, but for all the city buildings.

194
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:51,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to, um, sort of put in a plug that Chevalier sort of be high on the list, uh, regarding this, this project, uh, this evaluation, the, um, uh, timeline that Paul put out was, was, uh, was nice to hear because I, I was figuring it was gonna take a couple of years to get this completed and, and obviously a lot of expense, but, um, the, um, needs for Chevalier are unique.

195
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in that,

196
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,955
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's one of the most active city buildings and also perhaps the only one that generates income for the city.

197
00:32:56,995 --> 00:33:04,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important that we keep it, um, in the state of, you know, good, good repair and competitive with other performing arts venues in the region.

198
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:10,649
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it probably gets more visitors, uh, than any city building other than the library and perhaps city hall.

199
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:13,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And the use has changed from when it was a high school auditorium.

200
00:33:14,232 --> 00:33:15,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and even when,

201
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:43,056
[SPEAKER_01]: uh the improvements were made in the 90s just for example like the the elevator that's there the one of the two elevators that goes to the balcony the one that goes to the balcony you know it was designed for patron use and now it's carrying um you know full kegs of beer and uh pallets of beverages up to the balcony the bar that's up there that didn't exist before it's being used daily to take people down to the recreation department and the youth center so

202
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:49,360
[SPEAKER_01]: It really needs to be evaluated in terms of its future capacity and use when it gets time to upgrade those.

203
00:33:50,741 --> 00:34:05,932
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an advantage with the Chevalier Commission and committee that I mentioned is that we have a capital improvement project list of about 25 projects with cost estimates and potential funding sources already in place.

204
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,855
[SPEAKER_01]: That was started by Victor Schrader when he was the economic development

205
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:12,977
[SPEAKER_01]: director so we have a lot of resources available.

206
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:24,165
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that I think could really help with terms of survival is going to be an expensive project but the Massachusetts cultural facilities fund has a specific category.

207
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,545
[SPEAKER_01]: that the city would be eligible to apply for.

208
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,046
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a systems replacement grant.

209
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of their feasibility and technical assistant grants.

210
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:33,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just read the description.

211
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:40,209
[SPEAKER_01]: This is designed for organizations without full time maintenance staff, which is what Chevalier is.

212
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:46,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a 20 year capital needs assessment of the building and its mechanical systems.

213
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:54,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could save a lot of city expense in terms of looking at the Chevalier building alone.

214
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:57,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hope we could explore that opportunity.

215
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:02,976
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the grant applications are due in January, and they would be awarded next May.

216
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:04,217
[SPEAKER_01]: So just put that on the.

217
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:08,556
[SPEAKER_01]: on the list of things to look for in terms of potential funding.

218
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:15,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last thought I had was, you know, Paul mentioned we want to get these buildings up to the condition they were when they were built.

219
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:21,306
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we also need to keep in mind best practices for today and the future.

220
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:26,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hope that this evaluation looks at ways to improve energy efficiency.

221
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Chevalier just replaced all its interior lighting with LED, which was huge.

222
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:34,754
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope they will look at the buildings in terms of further energy efficiency.

223
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:38,756
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, could solar panels be put in on the roof at Chevalier?

224
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:41,577
[SPEAKER_01]: It strikes me as it could be a potentially good candidate.

225
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:47,179
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully this evaluation of the building needs is not just a state of good repair.

226
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:53,961
[SPEAKER_01]: It also looks at making them as efficient as possible and that all the modern best practices are taken into account.

227
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,482
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again for bringing this forward.

228
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:59,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to it happening.

229
00:35:59,243 --> 00:35:59,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

230
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:01,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

231
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:04,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any comments on the comments?

232
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,521
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I enjoy working with Ken.

233
00:36:08,763 --> 00:36:11,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really am proud of the work that

234
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:13,587
[SPEAKER_05]: together we've done at the Chevalier.

235
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:19,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've checked out the new lights inside, but if you go see a show, it's very impressive.

236
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:20,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

237
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:21,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other public comment?

238
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:28,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we do have Matthew Lemming, Councillor Lemming, who is not on the committee, but maybe he is on the committee.

239
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:28,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

240
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to see you here, Councillor Lemming.

241
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:31,759
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having you on mute.

242
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm here for my

243
00:36:36,184 --> 00:36:37,485
[SPEAKER_08]: My own public comment now.

244
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:41,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, sir, that I was sorry for being late.

245
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I was caught up in traffic.

246
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:53,200
[SPEAKER_08]: So and apologies if some of these if this question was already addressed earlier, Mr. Wrighty's comments.

247
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,947
[SPEAKER_08]: But even though you don't have a cost estimate for repairing all of the city owned facilities, is there

248
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:05,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of a ballpark range that you have that we should be thinking about.

249
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:15,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I can ask you versions of this question before for other projects, but like, what order of magnitude should should the council.

250
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:21,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And the rest of the city be thinking about this and like, 1Million, 10Million, 100Million.

251
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:27,889
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably within one of those ranges.

252
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I do better probably telling you to maintain buildings.

253
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:42,393
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two trains of thoughts on maintaining buildings and that you can use your assessed value of building

254
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:59,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say anywhere between one and 3% of an assessed value of building should be your yearly maintenance budget for that building or other people say square footage assign a dollar amount per square foot and that becomes your maintenance.

255
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,601
[SPEAKER_05]: For replacements it's

256
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:15,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's also a figure that you would look at over time, because I know that the Chevalier has a brand new heating system, fairly new heating system.

257
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:26,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So you look at that, you would forecast for say 10 years, 15 years out, and you would hit certain milestones.

258
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And each year would become a,

259
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:37,792
[SPEAKER_05]: assigned value based on what was assessed as being due on that year.

260
00:38:38,673 --> 00:38:43,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may scare you if you look at a figure, say $50 million.

261
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:47,881
[SPEAKER_05]: But then if you're looking at over 10 years, it becomes $5 million.

262
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:51,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to look at it two different ways.

263
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:58,470
[SPEAKER_05]: You would look at it as the total value, which I really don't want to put anything to that right now.

264
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,699
[SPEAKER_05]: But you would also then look at how many years to do that.

265
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So it lessens the blow and you can actually prepare much better for it.

266
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:22,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And you would also see there could be a year, year seven of it, which may be a major year because you have four different building systems across the city coming up at the same exact time.

267
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes budgeting much easier for you also.

268
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:28,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we should be

269
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:29,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

270
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,406
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you go ahead, Councilor Laming.

271
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:44,931
[SPEAKER_08]: So we should be budgeting 3% of the assessed value of a given building towards maintenance or some other calculation.

272
00:39:45,972 --> 00:39:53,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Has the city historically done that or have we not?

273
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:57,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say most cities and towns

274
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:09,508
[SPEAKER_05]: do not do that because the cost, if you look at your 3% of your assessed value, the cost of it would be astronomical.

275
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:12,749
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why most people use dollar per square foot.

276
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a range usually from like $1.50 to $2.70.

277
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So you figure out a mid-range in there.

278
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:25,573
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much less, but still, I don't think a lot of people

279
00:40:26,513 --> 00:40:27,054
[SPEAKER_05]: plan that.

280
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:36,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really a sexy budget item when you think of maintenance and buildings.

281
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:42,228
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something that's always hard fought, but something that you have to fight for.

282
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:50,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, Medford has a city council and a mayor that understands the value of buildings and starting to turn that tide.

283
00:40:51,780 --> 00:41:16,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I think, I think a good way to phrase this in terms of the, uh, which is another one of those questions that I don't expect to have the answer to right now, but maybe it's one thing to think about and get back later is what if we had put up that sort of a maintenance budget, would it have been able to sort of save some of the buildings in Medford that aren't doing so well right now?

284
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:26,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you would not have so many priorities on a list in buildings.

285
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:37,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one thing about spending money on maintenance is that you can preserve systems and items in buildings for a longer period of time.

286
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:43,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the money was provided for the last 15, 20 years,

287
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,994
[SPEAKER_05]: right now we wouldn't feel like that everything was a priority that was coming my way.

288
00:41:51,035 --> 00:42:04,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and that's what hopefully by doing, asking for this maintenance plan, that's where you're doing for the future and leaving for the future, that it doesn't become these priorities in every building all over Medford.

289
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:13,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And can I clarify, it sounds like maybe it does help lower the overall cost.

290
00:42:14,203 --> 00:42:22,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, if you do maintenance on an HVAC system that has a 15-year life expectancy, you might be able to get that to 20 years.

291
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:35,702
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can ensure, you know, so things like that also increase life expectancies and it's easier than when you need to replace it because you've been taking care of it.

292
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:37,444
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not have to replace the whole thing.

293
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:39,586
[SPEAKER_05]: You may only have to replace certain components.

294
00:42:40,446 --> 00:42:40,627
Great.

295
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Councilor Lemming?

296
00:42:47,393 --> 00:42:48,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, nope.

297
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:49,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I think

298
00:42:50,665 --> 00:43:15,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think that to sort of like sell this to the public, it would help to say something, to say something like, oh, well, we, you know, wouldn't have had to close down the studio if that building had been better maintained, or we wouldn't have to spend this much money on our new HVAC systems if we just put this much money into it in previous years.

299
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:28,658
[SPEAKER_08]: just what I was kind of fishing for was individual stories where we could have done better as a justification for as a stronger justification for this plan when illustrating to the public in the future.

300
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:32,241
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that was unsatisfied.

301
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:35,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

302
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:56,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think that in the two weeks, you would be able to also just add a column that was like the, whichever estimate for maintenance you think would be preferable if you want to do the like 2% or some sort of per square footage maintenance estimate in that spreadsheet would be great.

303
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:58,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

304
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:00,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other comments from councilors?

305
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:05,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you so much for coming out.

306
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been really great to have you here.

307
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:11,985
[SPEAKER_03]: We look forward very much to the spreadsheet and then the estimate for the estimate.

308
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a motion on the floor?

309
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:18,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

310
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:20,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

311
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:22,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

312
00:44:23,634 --> 00:44:27,738
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a motion to keep in committee and adjourn from Councillor Behrs, seconded by Councillor Lemming.

313
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:30,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Clerk, when you're ready, if you would call the roll.

314
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:38,201
[SPEAKER_06]: President Behrs?

315
00:44:40,223 --> 00:44:40,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

316
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:42,124

317
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:42,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

318
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:44,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemming?

319
00:44:44,866 --> 00:44:45,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

320
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:46,547

321
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:48,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Callahan?

322
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:48,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

323
00:44:51,911 --> 00:44:53,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Five in favor, zero opposed.

324

[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes and we are adjourned.

325
00:44:56,215 --> 00:44:56,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
