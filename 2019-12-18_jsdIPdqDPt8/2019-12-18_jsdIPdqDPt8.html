    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=1308.35s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=1308.67s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2287.152s">It's</a>  a combination of Jingle Bells and Mozart.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2455.505s">We'd</a>  like to thank Mr. Zigney and the string ensemble for giving us joy tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2460.666s">We're</a>  so happy to have you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2462.146s">You're</a>  fabulous, and you just light up our lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2464.367s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2465.807s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2471.448s">I,</a>  too, just wanted to say wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2473.728s">Thank</a>  you for bringing the holiday cheer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2476.289s">And</a>  I love that version of Jingle Bells. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2479.089s">It</a>  was wonderful.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2481.33s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2481.51s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2483.126s">Mr.</a>  Zigny and the students, we thank you so much for coming and gracing our halls again this evening as you have for so many years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2490.512s">It</a>  sort of sets the tone for us and you know how much we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2494.875s">I</a>  have to tell you that I and some of my colleagues were able to make some of the other <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2502.541s">performances</a>  this holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2505.082s">And</a>  if I recall, that's not your first standing ovation for the orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2509.485s">The</a>  orchestra concert was so great that people were blown away in the audience and everybody stood at the end, which doesn't often happen at a student performance like this, but it really was a testament to the work and dedication, both of our students and to their fabulous teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2525.175s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2525.916s">Merry</a>  Christmas or happy holidays.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2537.157s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2538.358s">Thank</a>  you, everyone.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2539.899s">Thank</a>  you, parents, for bringing the students.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2544.182s">Meeting</a>  of the Medford School Committee will now come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2546.744s">The</a>  secretary will call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2552.911s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2554.211s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2555.451s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2556.531s">Present,</a>  seven present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2558.532s">Please</a>  rise and salute our flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2560.652s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2572.055s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2573.815s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2575.435s">Approval</a>  of the minutes of December 9, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2579.788s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2588.015s">On</a>  the report of committee on the rules, it said that in the notes it says that we do not think it necessary to reprint the handbooks every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2596.182s">I</a>  think they actually are reprinted every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2598.724s">It's</a>  just that they don't need to be reprinted mid-year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2600.826s">So</a>  if we could make that amendment.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2603.648s">Motion</a>  for approval as amended mr. Russo seconded by miss van to include all those in favor motion passes approval of bills transfer of funds No question second by mr. Russo roll call vote, please Yes <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2631.764s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2634.307s">Report</a>  of secretary? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2635.609s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2637.11s">Reports</a>  of committee, special education subcommittee, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2639.914s">DiBenedetto.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2640.654s">Looking</a>  for my report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2647.402s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2649.445s">It</a>  was right in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2652.135s">So</a>  we had our first meeting of the year for the special education subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2659.076s">We</a>  had many administrators present, Diane Caldwell, Joan Bowen, Toni Wray, Paulette VanDeKoop, my associates, Paul Rousseau, Jenny Graham, the school committee elect member, Jenny Graham, Neil Osborne, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2678.393s">Lazzaro,</a>  Lisa Kingsley from the Curtis Huff School, Melanie McLaughlin who will also take office soon as a school committee member, Tonya and Alex Lurie, Tonya Solomon. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2691.1s">So</a>  we had this meeting to go over what we accomplished last year and we had set forth two goals last year and we made tremendous amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2701.165s">And</a>  the first goal for the community was raising disability awareness training and <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2709.818s">And</a>  just helping our summer out of school time activities for our students with special needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2716.284s">Before</a>  school, after school, summer camp, vacation camps, and we did a lot of work, especially Diane Caldwell, on new handbooks, more parent friendly, <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2730.805s">and</a>  to make it friendly for families that have students with needs to come forward so we know ahead of time and can plan for those students' needs and be ready for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2743.254s">And</a>  we also try to get parents to enroll earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2747.938s">So</a>  we have staffing and <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2751.422s">we're</a>  set up appropriately for all of our students in the summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2755.966s">So,</a>  look forward to that in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2758.789s">Registration</a>  will be going out earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2762.873s">So,</a>  and together we wanted to raise awareness and especially like in curriculum and use examples of <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2773.263s">challenging</a>  situations that students could have more empathy and more inclusion of all students' needs in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2783.454s">And</a>  Shelly Gross ran some programming for our teachers and it was a great hit and more of that is going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2790.16s">So</a>  those goals are going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2792.122s">And</a>  we talked about what goals we'd set forth for the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2798.084s">And</a>  since I won't be chairing the committee, no decisions were made on those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2802.366s">And</a>  we felt like the new chairperson would bring those goals forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2808.529s">But</a>  we did identify some areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2811.331s">Looking</a>  at special education curriculum, what's being taught and how it's being taught was one idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2817.634s">And</a>  community hosting accessible recreation programs was another idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2829.022s">Increasing</a>  the programming at the Curtis Huff School was an idea, and focusing on students with disability in our upper grades, because sometimes we focus a lot on the <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2840.032s">lower</a>  grades in teaching students to self-advocate at those grade levels, and maybe a unified sports program similar to the one that they have in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2852.084s">And</a>  to get Medford more involved with the Challenger event that Malden is very involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2859.771s">I</a>  know that a lot of us went to Challenger Day, and I'd love to see a larger participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2865.621s">And</a>  some of these aren't year-long goals, but they're quick hits that we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2869.625s">And</a>  whoever runs this committee, I think hopefully some of my colleagues that have been serving on it will continue at least one. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2881.718s">So</a>  there's some history brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2884.0s">But</a>  it's been a great committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2887.215s">The</a>  keeping the goals to one or two, possibly three, is very important in my mind because you can see effective change. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2896.304s">You</a>  can really work on issues and dig in on them and make a difference in children's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2902.17s">If</a>  you have 20 goals, it's very hard to meet all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2905.994s">So</a>  that's our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2910.603s">It's</a>  been a great honor to be the chairperson of that committee, and I'm glad that the mayor established that and that we are serving our students in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2919.609s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2920.069s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2920.129s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2920.429s">Erin,</a>  I just would like to thank you for your work on that committee and for the great job you did.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2929.074s">I</a>  agree that limiting the goals was in fact an excellent plan and really gave focus to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2935.178s">And</a>  rest assured, we certainly will be <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2939.011s">making</a>  sure that the work continues and will be focused and will continue along the lines, the trajectory that you started us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2946.214s">Thank</a>  you, Erin.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2949.935s">And</a>  on behalf of the Special Ed Committee, we'd like to present these flowers to Erin DiBenedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2975.008s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2977.309s">Motion</a>  to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2978.19s">Is</a>  there a second on the floor by Mr. Ernst? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2980.17s">So</a>  all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2981.111s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2981.551s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2982.331s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2982.952s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2984.653s">Is</a>  there anyone wishing to speak on their community participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2988.794s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2989.555s">All</a>  those in favor, please stand and vote.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2993.777s">Mayor</a>  Burke, I would like to make a motion to suspend the order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2997.238s">I'd</a>  like to take superintendent's updates and comments at the end of our <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3001.307s">calendar,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3018.702s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3020.263s">This</a>  is a special opportunity for Medford to be able to recognize our state delegation members who are here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3029.786s">And</a>  so I would like to ask Senator Patricia Jalen, Representative Christine Barber, Representative Sean Garberly, and Representative Paul Donato to please come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3051.607s">On</a>  behalf of the work that you did, especially for Medford, but in support and all the work that you did contributing to the successful adoption of the Student Opportunity Act, Medford Public Schools would like to officially recognize all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3070.751s">And</a>  in recognition of what you've done, we have a souvenir that we're going to present to you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3084.615s">The</a>  first one is Representative Paul Donato, Champion of Education, Medford, thanks you, 2019.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3097.44s">And</a>  so Representative Donato, would you like to come forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3102.121s">We</a>  thank you for ringing the bell of education for our students.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3119.776s">Members</a>  of the House are going to be very, very, very upset about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3124.818s">This</a>  is the way I'm going to call them to order.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3138.796s">Medford</a>  Public Schools recognizes Senator Patricia Jalen for her support and work on the successful adoption of the Student Opportunity Act signed by the Medford School Committee.</p>

    <p>[Pat Jehlen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3160.559s">Well,</a>  I want to say that this really took a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3163.02s">We</a>  should have been doing this 17 years ago, and we've been trying since the report in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3165.94s">But</a>  what happened this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3183.182s">We</a>  thank you for thanking us. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3185.885s">But</a>  it happened because parents and students and teachers and administrators and school committee members all across the Commonwealth came together and didn't give us a lot of choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3199.051s">So</a>  I want to thank particularly Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, and their staffs for briefing us about the particular problems Bedford faced. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3210.962s">And</a>  it helped us advocate for you all, not just now, but in the future as we understand your particular challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3219.429s">And</a>  so I just want to send the thanks back to you all.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3232.419s">Representative</a>  Christine.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3867.786s">Could</a>  we please send letters of thanks to Noah and the other students as well as anybody else who took part? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3876.496s">The</a>  veterans on behalf from the school committee, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3880.78s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3887.08s">I</a>  too wanted to just echo what was said, that it was an excellent event and that I had the opportunity to go up and listen to one of the veterans sharing his real life experience story. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3900.045s">And</a>  the classroom that he was in had some students that were, that particular classroom had English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3906.827s">And</a>  so he made the modifications to kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3910.848s">And</a>  the teacher worked collaboratively with him to point out the key vocabulary terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3916.693s">And</a>  I just think it's great that all students get to benefit from this real life history alive, I would say, the Veterans Day event. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3925.661s">And</a>  so I'm so grateful for their service and thankful for the collaboration with the Veterans Office here and Mr. Durham as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3934.629s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3954.828s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3955.69s">I</a>  just wanted to provide an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3958.355s">As</a>  you recall, this body voted last June to pilot the provision 2 breakfast, which is free breakfast for all in all of our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3966.627s">in</a>  Medford and this report is the follow-up for the September, October, November counts for that program for the breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3977.099s">So</a>  we did have, working with food service, we did have a very aggressive campaign to encourage participation in families to have their children <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3986.39s">eat</a>  free breakfast at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3988.512s">We</a>  provided flyers for backpack messaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=3992.416s">We</a>  provided posters at the high school, which were of the home-cooked or scratch-cooked breakfasts that are offered here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4001.565s">And</a>  we also did clear-channel billboard messaging to encourage participation and get that message out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4007.974s">So</a>  the food service staff members were also very excited to offer free breakfast and worked diligently and eventually built up the menus to incorporate hot options each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4019.023s">So</a>  we have been able to provide that at each building level. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4023.807s">The</a>  meal count analysis that was provided shows a true increase in the overall participation in all the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4030.933s">We</a>  did have an exception at the Columbus School and that was related to <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4035.955s">a</a>  particular pilot that Dr. K was doing for her fifth grade program, and that was to allow them to come in the building a little bit earlier, eat their breakfast if they chose, and to help the other students adjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4052.42s">As</a>  you can see, those counts did affect that school, so we will have to revisit that with Dr. K and really determine what the best process is for <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4062.417s">maintaining</a>  those breakfast counts and getting those numbers back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4068.199s">Additionally,</a>  the meals per labor hour comparison indicates that there was not significant impact on the wages, adding this additional component for the breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4078.803s">Again,</a>  the breakfast has been served at each building, but we just didn't have the level of participation or the free breakfast option, so we didn't know how that was going to <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4091.068s">impact</a>  if we needed several more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4094.05s">there</a>  to serve and prepare the breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4097.352s">As</a>  we did the analysis, it did not significantly impact that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4102.756s">So</a>  we also wanted to indicate that we are still in negotiations with the Food Service Collective Bargaining Unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4110.36s">So</a>  that will impact wages going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4114.303s">But</a>  we are working with the Food Service Director and looking at really the positives of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4122.508s">We're</a>  hoping that the enthusiasm to continue to feed the students of Medford, that the school committee would approve a motion to continue this program throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4135.554s">And</a>  as we near the closeout, identify any coverage that might be needed to maintain this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4142.818s">But</a>  it is such a significant and important one. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4145.799s">We</a>  would like to make that recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4147.42s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4149.701s">On</a>  the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4151.022s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5423.975s">Mayor</a>  Burke, for so many things that you've done in the past four years, I think one of the things that sticks with me the most, and it's also a testament to the school committee, is I was at one of the Medford Conversations projects this year, and I was at the table with most of the high school students, and they were talking about how the place that they feel most welcome, how welcome they feel in the city, but the place they felt most welcome was in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5449.052s">And</a>  that really struck me for what a good job this city is doing in helping students really feel welcome and feel like they're part of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5457.96s">So</a>  thank you to all that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5459.781s">Thank</a>  you to Erin and to Michael for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5462.183s">It's</a>  really incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5463.824s">And</a>  we have citations for you as well, but I will let Leader Donato give those up.</p>

    <p>[6gZWVWRAa_8_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5470.119s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5470.56s">You</a>  know, as a state delegation, we are so lucky to have such incredible partners in municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5478.428s">And</a>  I really mean that for those who are sitting out there and who are coming in to serve and those who are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5485.576s">It</a>  really is great to have incredible partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5490.973s">As</a>  a former school committee member, I just want to say I know the amount of dedication it takes to serve on a school committee, especially when the income is very small and the commitment is massive. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5504.458s">And</a>  so those who are retiring from our school committee, I just want to thank you so much for the work that you have done to improve the quality of life for students in the Medford public schools and what <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5516.903s">and</a>  particularly the members who are leaving, what sticks out to me most is that you've always prioritized all students, but also the most vulnerable students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5528.133s">And</a>  to me, that is so important and the legacy that we'll live on. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5532.817s">So</a>  thank you both very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5539.25s">You</a>  know, as soon as Mayor Burke was sworn into office four years ago, you know, she called me right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5544.432s">And</a>  I know she called the other members of the delegation and she said, made it very clear how she wanted to work with each member of the delegation as well as members of city government to transform the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5558.046s">And</a>  a couple of things that stick out to me under her leadership is the kind of professionalism she brought in running city government that has led to so many successes, even during difficult times. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5576.919s">And</a>  I would also say it's not easy serving in any political office, but serving as mayor is also not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5585.337s">And</a>  you led the city with such success and so much grace that I think, even though it was only four years, it felt like a lot longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5599.029s">And</a>  I think the benefit that you have brought to the people of Medford and to the students of Medford will be felt for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5607.015s">So</a>  thank you, and thank you to our members.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5620.215s">As</a>  the leader of the delegation, it makes it a little more difficult because they have said many of the things that I would like to say about the members of the school committee and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5636.259s">We</a>  as a delegation, I can tell you Madam Mayor and members of the school committee, we as a delegation have always dedicated ourselves to education. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5647.077s">And</a>  I think it's mirrored on not only what we have done with the educational program that we've presented through our legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5655.863s">The</a>  breakfast before the bell is another milestone that we have and it's going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5662.367s">I</a>  can assure you that the Speaker of the House and the Senate President have as a priority education and we will continue to make it so that education is a priority in the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5676.112s">On</a>  a personal note, I met Michael many years ago and we became friends and became understanding as Democrats and we <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5692.275s">We</a>  both had a passion for food and basically Michael is a farmer for blueberries and gave me blueberries and I made a wonderful blueberry pie. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5704.282s">Am</a>  I right? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5704.922s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5705.543s">So</a>  Michael has dedicated himself to the people of the city of Medford and we wish him well and hope that he finds an opportunity to continue his service to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5722.902s">Aaron</a>  and I have a personal relationship on the basis of my cousin lived down the street and Evan was his caretaker and dedicated every day to make sure that he was safe, that he had food, that he was well taken care of and no matter what time of night, even if it was two o'clock in the morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5752.708s">And</a>  he called her, she would call me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5758.291s">Only</a>  once in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5759.691s">But</a>  Erin, you have made your mark in the city of Medford as one who has dedicated herself to education and special needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5769.476s">And</a>  I know, as has been said, you are going to continue working for the people of Medford in that capacity, whatever it may be, because that's your passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5782.182s">And</a>  that's your vocation, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5788.288s">Madam</a>  Mayor, 1996.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5976.47s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5977.231s">Mr.</a>  Russo, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5977.811s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5980.093s">I'd</a>  like to thank you for your leadership as our mayor and chair of this school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5985.396s">You've</a>  shown incredible poise, and I have learned so much from you in my first term, my first two years in office. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5995.303s">When</a>  I began my run for school committee, you announced me at my kickoff event, which touched me deeply, because we weren't really friends yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6004.546s">And</a>  your excitement at my first election is something I will cherish. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6012.051s">Your</a>  ability to chair this meeting when there are six or seven strong-minded people who would probably take this committee in a thousand directions at every moment is really impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6023.62s">And</a>  you keep us focused on what's best for our community, our students, our teachers, staff, and everybody else who's involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6034.363s">And</a>  that focus is a reminder that we're not here for our own agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6039.606s">We're</a>  here for the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6041.807s">And</a>  you set an amazing example. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6046.509s">And</a>  that example will live on for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6049.47s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6051.712s">I'd</a>  like to thank you for your years of service, but mostly for your friendship.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6057.334s">Thank</a>  you very much, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6058.375s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6067.957s">This</a>  is hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6070.279s">You</a>  know, we were at home and I was saying to my kids, what will I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6075.243s">Because</a>  we weren't thinking we would be saying something. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6080.255s">Teagan</a>  told me, well, you met her through the whole food security interest with the Greater Boston Food Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6088.465s">And</a>  that was the first time we actually had a conversation after the first election four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6093.252s">And</a>  we met with Carol Tynken from Greater Boston Food Bank and talked about making Metfed the first food secure <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6099.479s">City</a>  in the Commonwealth and that is still a goal that we're working at but it's with your help over the last few years that we have now a food pantry at the high school the summer eats program with the YMCA We've done pop-up mobile food markets. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6113.044s">We</a>  have Columbus groceries and soon there'll be a community food pantry That'll be very exciting that you were behind making that community food pantry happen and I guess what Paul was saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6129.496s">You</a>  always had the children, and even Reptonado, you always had the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6134.319s">You</a>  always thought of them first, and how can you make their life on a daily basis better? <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6138.121s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6139.481s">And</a>  the benefit was that because of food security, we got to be good friends, and I look forward to having more guidance and great conversations with you.</p>
