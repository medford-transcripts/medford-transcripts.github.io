1
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:11,706
There it goes.

2
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:24,027
Thank you.

3
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

4
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:48,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

5
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:14,481
Music Music Music

6
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:21,698
It's impressive.

7
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:01,858
Yeah.

8
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:15,551
Thank you.

9
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:23,486
Do you want to push me?

10
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,206
One time.

11
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:25,527
One, two, three.

12
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,032
Thank you.

13
00:37:50,384 --> 00:38:00,749
Every year we end with some form of Jingle Bells, because as everybody knows, Jingle Bells was written right behind us at Simpson's Head, right in the actual interior of this window.

14
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:06,871
So this time, we will do Jingle Bells again, but a little bit of a different arrangement than usual.

15
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:10,213
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a combination of Jingle Bells and Mozart.

16
00:40:55,505 --> 00:41:00,646
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd like to thank Mr. Zigney and the string ensemble for giving us joy tonight.

17
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,086
[SPEAKER_15]: We're so happy to have you here.

18
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:04,327
[SPEAKER_15]: You're fabulous, and you just light up our lives.

19
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:05,367
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

20
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:06,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

21
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I, too, just wanted to say wonderful job.

22
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for bringing the holiday cheer.

23
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:19,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love that version of Jingle Bells.

24
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:19,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It was wonderful.

25
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:21,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

26
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

27
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:29,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Zigny and the students, we thank you so much for coming and gracing our halls again this evening as you have for so many years past.

28
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:34,495
[SPEAKER_05]: It sort of sets the tone for us and you know how much we appreciate it.

29
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:39,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to tell you that I and some of my colleagues were able to make some of the other

30
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,642
[SPEAKER_05]: performances this holiday season.

31
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:48,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I recall, that's not your first standing ovation for the orchestra.

32
00:41:49,485 --> 00:42:04,835
[SPEAKER_05]: The orchestra concert was so great that people were blown away in the audience and everybody stood at the end, which doesn't often happen at a student performance like this, but it really was a testament to the work and dedication, both of our students and to their fabulous teacher.

33
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:05,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

34
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Merry Christmas or happy holidays.

35
00:42:17,157 --> 00:42:17,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

36
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:19,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, everyone.

37
00:42:19,899 --> 00:42:21,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, parents, for bringing the students.

38
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:26,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

39
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,064
[SPEAKER_15]: The secretary will call the roll.

40
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:33,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

41
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:35,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

42
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

43
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:38,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Present, seven present, none absent.

44
00:42:38,532 --> 00:42:39,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Please rise and salute our flag.

45
00:42:40,652 --> 00:42:52,035
[SPEAKER_15]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

46
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:52,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

47
00:42:53,815 --> 00:42:54,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

48
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:56,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Approval of the minutes of December 9, 2019.

49
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:00,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

50
00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:16,162
[SPEAKER_07]: On the report of committee on the rules, it said that in the notes it says that we do not think it necessary to reprint the handbooks every year.

51
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:18,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they actually are reprinted every year.

52
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that they don't need to be reprinted mid-year.

53
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:22,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could make that amendment.

54
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:35,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval as amended mr. Russo seconded by miss van to include all those in favor motion passes approval of bills transfer of funds No question second by mr. Russo roll call vote, please Yes

55
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:54,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

56
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:55,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Report of secretary?

57
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:55,789
[SPEAKER_15]: None.

58
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Reports of committee, special education subcommittee, Ms.

59
00:43:59,914 --> 00:44:00,634
[SPEAKER_15]: DiBenedetto.

60
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:06,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking for my report.

61
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:07,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

62
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:10,206
[SPEAKER_14]: It was right in front of me.

63
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:18,056
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had our first meeting of the year for the special education subcommittee meeting.

64
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:36,960
[SPEAKER_14]: We had many administrators present, Diane Caldwell, Joan Bowen, Tony Ray, Paulette VanDeKoop, my associates, Paul Rousseau, Jenny Graham, the school committee elect member, Jenny Graham, Neil Osborne, Emily.

65
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:50,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Lizaro, Lisa Kingsley from the Curtis Huff School, Melanie McLaughlin who will also take office soon as a school committee member, Tonya and Alex Lurie, Tonya Solomon.

66
00:44:51,100 --> 00:45:00,404
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had this meeting to go over what we accomplished last year and we had set forth two goals last year and we made tremendous amount of work.

67
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:07,488
[SPEAKER_14]: And the first goal for the community was raising disability awareness training and

68
00:45:09,818 --> 00:45:16,204
[SPEAKER_14]: And just helping our summer out of school time activities for our students with special needs.

69
00:45:16,284 --> 00:45:28,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Before school, after school, summer camp, vacation camps, and we did a lot of work, especially Diane Caldwell, on new handbooks, more parent friendly,

70
00:45:30,805 --> 00:45:42,574
[SPEAKER_14]: and to make it friendly for families that have students with needs to come forward so we know ahead of time and can plan for those students' needs and be ready for them.

71
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:47,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also try to get parents to enroll earlier.

72
00:45:47,938 --> 00:45:49,799
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have staffing and

73
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:55,846
[SPEAKER_14]: we're set up appropriately for all of our students in the summer program.

74
00:45:55,966 --> 00:45:58,429
[SPEAKER_14]: So, look forward to that in the spring.

75
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Registration will be going out earlier this year.

76
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:10,861
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and together we wanted to raise awareness and especially like in curriculum and use examples of

77
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:23,213
[SPEAKER_14]: challenging situations that students could have more empathy and more inclusion of all students' needs in the classroom.

78
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:29,860
[SPEAKER_14]: And Shelly Gross ran some programming for our teachers and it was a great hit and more of that is going to continue.

79
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,702
[SPEAKER_14]: So those goals are going to continue.

80
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:36,767
[SPEAKER_14]: And we talked about what goals we'd set forth for the next year.

81
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:42,266
[SPEAKER_14]: And since I won't be chairing the committee, no decisions were made on those goals.

82
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:48,489
[SPEAKER_14]: And we felt like the new chairperson would bring those goals forward.

83
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:50,690
[SPEAKER_14]: But we did identify some areas.

84
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:57,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking at special education curriculum, what's being taught and how it's being taught was one idea.

85
00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:07,079
[SPEAKER_14]: And community hosting accessible recreation programs was another idea.

86
00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:19,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Increasing the programming at the Curtis Huff School was an idea, and focusing on students with disability in our upper grades, because sometimes we focus a lot on the

87
00:47:20,032 --> 00:47:31,503
[SPEAKER_14]: lower grades in teaching students to self-advocate at those grade levels, and maybe a unified sports program similar to the one that they have in Malden.

88
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:39,711
[SPEAKER_14]: And to get Medford more involved with the Challenger event that Malden is very involved in.

89
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:45,036
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that a lot of us went to Challenger Day, and I'd love to see a larger participation.

90
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:49,065
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of these aren't year-long goals, but they're quick hits that we can do.

91
00:47:49,625 --> 00:48:00,737
[SPEAKER_14]: And whoever runs this committee, I think hopefully some of my colleagues that have been serving on it will continue at least one.

92
00:48:01,718 --> 00:48:03,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's some history brought forward.

93
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,222
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's been a great committee.

94
00:48:07,215 --> 00:48:15,804
[SPEAKER_14]: The keeping the goals to one or two, possibly three, is very important in my mind because you can see effective change.

95
00:48:16,304 --> 00:48:21,590
[SPEAKER_14]: You can really work on issues and dig in on them and make a difference in children's lives.

96
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,493
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have 20 goals, it's very hard to meet all of those things.

97
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:28,116
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's our committee.

98
00:48:30,603 --> 00:48:39,589
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a great honor to be the chairperson of that committee, and I'm glad that the mayor established that and that we are serving our students in that way.

99
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:40,029
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

100
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

101
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:40,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Van de Kloot.

102
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:48,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Erin, I just would like to thank you for your work on that committee and for the great job you did.

103
00:48:49,074 --> 00:48:54,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree that limiting the goals was in fact an excellent plan and really gave focus to the committee.

104
00:48:55,178 --> 00:48:57,540
[SPEAKER_05]: And rest assured, we certainly will be

105
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:06,054
[SPEAKER_05]: making sure that the work continues and will be focused and will continue along the lines, the trajectory that you started us on.

106
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:06,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Erin.

107
00:49:09,935 --> 00:49:14,477
[SPEAKER_15]: And on behalf of the Special Ed Committee, we'd like to present these flowers to Erin DiBenedetto.

108
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:37,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to accept this report?

109
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept.

110
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a second on the floor by Mr. Ernst?

111
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,091
[SPEAKER_15]: So all those in favor?

112
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:41,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

113
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:42,231
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

114
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:42,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

115
00:49:42,952 --> 00:49:43,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Community participation.

116
00:49:44,653 --> 00:49:48,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone wishing to speak on their community participation?

117
00:49:48,794 --> 00:49:49,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none.

118
00:49:49,555 --> 00:49:53,337
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor, please stand and vote.

119
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:56,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke, I would like to make a motion to suspend the order of business.

120
00:49:57,238 --> 00:50:00,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to take superintendent's updates and comments at the end of our

121
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:01,948
[SPEAKER_05]: calendar, please.

122
00:50:18,702 --> 00:50:19,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

123
00:50:20,263 --> 00:50:28,945
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a special opportunity for Medford to be able to recognize our state delegation members who are here this evening.

124
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:48,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would like to ask Senator Patricia Jalen, Representative Christine Barber, Representative Sean Garberly, and Representative Paul Donato to please come forward.

125
00:50:51,607 --> 00:51:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: On behalf of the work that you did, especially for Medford, but in support and all the work that you did contributing to the successful adoption of the Student Opportunity Act, Medford Public Schools would like to officially recognize all of you.

126
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:19,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And in recognition of what you've done, we have a souvenir that we're going to present to you.

127
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:29,337
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one is Representative Paul Donato, Champion of Education, Medford, thanks you, 2019.

128
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Representative Donato, would you like to come forward?

129
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:46,223
[SPEAKER_06]: We thank you for ringing the bell of education for our students.

130
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:04,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Members of the House are going to be very, very, very upset about this.

131
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:07,860
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the way I'm going to call them to order.

132
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:27,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Medford Public Schools recognizes Senator Patricia Jalen for her support and work on the successful adoption of the Student Opportunity Act signed by the Medford School Committee.

133
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I want to say that this really took a lot of years.

134
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,900
[SPEAKER_13]: We should have been doing this 17 years ago, and we've been trying since the report in 2015.

135
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,801
[SPEAKER_13]: But what happened this year?

136
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:05,064
[SPEAKER_13]: We thank you for thanking us.

137
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:17,657
[SPEAKER_13]: But it happened because parents and students and teachers and administrators and school committee members all across the Commonwealth came together and didn't give us a lot of choice.

138
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:30,901
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank particularly Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edward Vincent, and their staffs for briefing us about the particular problems Bedford faced.

139
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:38,828
[SPEAKER_13]: And it helped us advocate for you all, not just now, but in the future as we understand your particular challenges.

140
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:42,452
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just want to send the thanks back to you all.

141
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:50,970
Yes.

142
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:53,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Representative Christine.

143
00:54:12,538 --> 00:54:15,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, I want to echo Senator Jalen's sentiments.

144
00:54:17,481 --> 00:54:26,785
[SPEAKER_12]: This was truly teamwork that we did with all of you and I want to thank the members of the Medford School Committee, the mayor, of course the superintendent.

145
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:31,028
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are not shy about letting us know about Medford's needs and

146
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:43,319
[SPEAKER_12]: This bill, this law, will help us to support especially children with special education needs, English language learners, low-income students, and so many across the whole commonwealth.

147
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:54,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for your efforts, and this is really an honor, so I appreciate it.

148
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Representative Sean Garvely.

149
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:03,529
Thank you so much.

150
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to thank everyone who's here tonight.

151
00:55:22,716 --> 00:55:23,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank my colleagues.

152
00:55:24,058 --> 00:55:34,110
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been great to work with them to really pass this important bill that's a $1.5 billion investment in public schools across 351 cities and towns over the next seven years.

153
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I also want to thank the superintendent.

154
00:55:37,874 --> 00:55:42,037
[SPEAKER_08]: our incredible mayor, members of the school committee for being strong champions.

155
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:55,165
[SPEAKER_08]: A day did not go by when I did not get a text message or a phone call from one of the individuals here and Jenny Graham on supporting this bill and pushing to make sure it can be the strongest that it should be for Medford.

156
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to thank the parents of Medford, the advocates, the mayor, members of the school committee for

157
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:08,197
[SPEAKER_08]: really holding us accountable for making sure that we pass the strongest bill that's going to support students in Medford and across the Commonwealth.

158
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:09,118
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you so much.

159
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,519
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like to acknowledge the work of our state delegation and those beyond.

160
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:23,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we had meetings with Senator Lewis of Winchester, who chaired the committee.

161
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:32,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And Christine Patson, our associate superintendent, was getting us so much data so that we could argue our case and our points about the Medford system.

162
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:41,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And not only did this act pass, but they also had special monies put aside for this current year, because Medford was really getting hit hard.

163
00:56:41,344 --> 00:56:44,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So we advocated, they listened, and they fought for us.

164
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,748
[SPEAKER_15]: for all that you have done for the city of Medford.

165
00:56:46,868 --> 00:56:47,409
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

166
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:22,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You've always been there for us and one of the things is that so often we are just in sync with our thinking and it's absolutely a pleasure and I thought this is such a great time to recognize the work that you do not only for the Student Opportunities Act

167
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:24,216
[SPEAKER_05]: but every day.

168
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:42,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we're going to need your continued work and to advocate for us to make sure, you know, there's those dirty words, subject to appropriation, and we want to make sure that, in fact, where the places are, we can maximize the benefit for Medford.

169
00:57:42,783 --> 00:57:44,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very, very much.

170
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:48,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping that we could all do a picture with your bells in front here.

171
00:57:49,126 --> 00:57:52,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So take them out again, and let's ring the bell for education.

172
00:57:57,862 --> 00:57:59,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I can text it too.

173
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:00,504
Absolutely.

174
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:30,785
[SPEAKER_15]: You know how it goes, tall people in the back.

175
00:58:31,786 --> 00:58:35,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul, you're right up front.

176
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:36,772
All right, say money.

177
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:19,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are legit.

178
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:20,513
The bell is Peter's.

179
00:59:20,593 --> 00:59:22,694
I know, once I saw them.

180
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

181
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe we can do it post.

182
01:00:42,398 --> 01:00:42,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

183
01:00:42,778 --> 01:00:43,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Item three.

184
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:47,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Vote on Veterans Day.

185
01:00:47,922 --> 01:00:48,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Chiesa.

186
01:00:48,442 --> 01:00:58,289
Dr. Chiesa.

187
01:01:01,211 --> 01:01:02,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody.

188
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:08,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to update you on the commemoration of Veterans Day at the high school.

189
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:17,099
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked, the Humanities Department and the Office of Veteran Services worked together to once again sponsor the Veterans Day Speaker Program.

190
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:30,330
[SPEAKER_00]: This program is actually in its 19th year now and it provides a wonderful way for high school students, faculty, and veterans to discuss both combat and non-combat experiences.

191
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:36,676
[SPEAKER_00]: The program this year took place on November 6th and was co-coordinated by myself,

192
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:40,429
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the Director of Veterans Services, Mr. Michael Durham.

193
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:49,254
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 22 veterans from several different eras, and they provided an overview of their experiences with the students.

194
01:01:50,014 --> 01:01:57,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the veteran sessions were also recorded by Jonathan House, who is the military and veterans liaison for Congresswoman Catherine Clark.

195
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:02,662
[SPEAKER_00]: These sessions will be submitted to the Morse Library for the Veterans Oral History Project.

196
01:02:03,526 --> 01:02:15,375
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we had the Veterans Preservation Project, founded and facilitated by Noah Kretz, a graduate of Medford Vocational Technical High School, there to display his war memorabilia.

197
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:22,780
[SPEAKER_00]: The collection really was wonderful for the veterans to see, and we were very proud to have them there as well.

198
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:32,227
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wonderful day, filled with very engaging conversations, and feedback was extremely positive from faculty and students as well.

199
01:02:33,405 --> 01:02:33,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

200
01:02:34,006 --> 01:02:34,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

201
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:35,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

202
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:36,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Krutz.

203
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

204
01:02:37,611 --> 01:02:40,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you, Dr. Kieser, for your report.

205
01:02:40,516 --> 01:02:46,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to give a sincere thanks to you and Mike Durham and everybody that participated in the program.

206
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:53,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have an opportunity to go to one of the classrooms and listen in with one of the veterans that was talking to the students.

207
01:02:53,695 --> 01:03:03,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just really great that the students have so many great questions and it's just wonderful to hear them, you know, hearing about the real life service, the military service.

208
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I also got to stop by and visit my son's display.

209
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:11,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my son Noah and his, um, one of the other students, Ian Agudelo,

210
01:03:13,031 --> 01:03:21,619
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the display and it was just wonderful and it's just great to see, you know, Medford students volunteering their time to help the veterans.

211
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:28,405
[SPEAKER_01]: What I found out from my son was there were eight students, a combination of Medford High School and vocational students that

212
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:35,171
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteer on the Veterans Preservation Project and they're gaining more students like all the time.

213
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:37,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just incredible.

214
01:03:37,253 --> 01:03:43,778
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, it's a passion and they enjoy educating and, you know, teaching everybody in preserving history.

215
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:51,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, it's just one of my favorite exhibits to go to and thank you and thank to everybody who was involved in organizing it.

216
01:03:51,445 --> 01:03:53,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a lot of work to get everybody there and

217
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:55,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, it's a great program.

218
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:56,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

219
01:03:56,278 --> 01:03:56,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

220
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:03,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I just also want to say if I didn't make it clear, a huge thank you to the veterans too, who obvious, obviously a huge thank you to them came and donated their time.

221
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them work for the city.

222
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:12,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are graduates of Medford high school and that connection is really invaluable as they speak with the students.

223
01:04:13,002 --> 01:04:18,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, Mr. Kratz is Noah's, uh, uh, memorabilia project was amazing every year.

224
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:20,384
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something new and something that catches the eye.

225
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really adds a very,

226
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,065
[SPEAKER_00]: very nice touch to the day, so thank you.

227
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:36,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we please send letters of thanks to Noah and the other students as well as anybody else who took part?

228
01:04:36,496 --> 01:04:39,959
[SPEAKER_05]: The veterans on behalf from the school committee, please.

229
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

230
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:42,542
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

231
01:04:42,703 --> 01:04:43,784
[SPEAKER_15]: And Madam Superintendent.

232
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:59,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I too wanted to just echo what was said, that it was an excellent event and that I had the opportunity to go up and listen to one of the veterans sharing his real life experience story.

233
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:06,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And the classroom that he was in had some students that were, that particular classroom had English learners.

234
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he made the modifications to kind of

235
01:05:10,848 --> 01:05:15,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And the teacher worked collaboratively with him to point out the key vocabulary terms.

236
01:05:16,693 --> 01:05:25,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think it's great that all students get to benefit from this real life history alive, I would say, the Veterans Day event.

237
01:05:25,661 --> 01:05:34,149
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm so grateful for their service and thankful for the collaboration with the Veterans Office here and Mr. Durham as well.

238
01:05:34,629 --> 01:05:34,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

239
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:36,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

240
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:38,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to place this report on file?

241
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo?

242
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:41,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by Ms.

243
01:05:42,053 --> 01:05:42,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Benedetto.

244
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:43,695
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

245
01:05:44,575 --> 01:05:45,316
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

246
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:46,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

247
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:47,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

248
01:05:47,438 --> 01:05:48,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

249
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:50,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Report on universal breakfast.

250
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:50,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

251
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Patterson?

252
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:55,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

253
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:58,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to provide an update.

254
01:05:58,355 --> 01:06:05,969
[SPEAKER_11]: As you recall, this body voted last June to pilot the provision 2 breakfast, which is free breakfast for all in all of our buildings.

255
01:06:06,627 --> 01:06:16,539
[SPEAKER_11]: in Medford and this report is the follow-up for the September, October, November counts for that program for the breakfast.

256
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:25,830
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did have, working with food service, we did have a very aggressive campaign to encourage participation in families to have their children

257
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,092
[SPEAKER_11]: eat free breakfast at the schools.

258
01:06:28,512 --> 01:06:32,316
[SPEAKER_11]: We provided flyers for backpack messaging.

259
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:41,025
[SPEAKER_11]: We provided posters at the high school, which were of the home-cooked or scratch-cooked breakfasts that are offered here.

260
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:47,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also did clear-channel billboard messaging to encourage participation and get that message out.

261
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:58,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So the food service staff members were also very excited to offer free breakfast and worked diligently and eventually built up the menus to incorporate hot options each day.

262
01:06:59,023 --> 01:07:02,987
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have been able to provide that at each building level.

263
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:10,433
[SPEAKER_11]: The meal count analysis that was provided shows a true increase in the overall participation in all the buildings.

264
01:07:10,933 --> 01:07:15,097
[SPEAKER_11]: We did have an exception at the Columbus School and that was related to

265
01:07:15,955 --> 01:07:31,440
[SPEAKER_11]: a particular pilot that Dr. K was doing for her fifth grade program, and that was to allow them to come in the building a little bit earlier, eat their breakfast if they chose, and to help the other students adjust.

266
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:41,303
[SPEAKER_11]: As you can see, those counts did affect that school, so we will have to revisit that with Dr. K and really determine what the best process is for

267
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:47,239
[SPEAKER_11]: maintaining those breakfast counts and getting those numbers back up.

268
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:58,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, the meals per labor hour comparison indicates that there was not significant impact on the wages, adding this additional component for the breakfast program.

269
01:07:58,803 --> 01:08:10,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, the breakfast has been served at each building, but we just didn't have the level of participation or the free breakfast option, so we didn't know how that was going to

270
01:08:11,068 --> 01:08:13,444
[SPEAKER_11]: impact if we needed several more people.

271
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:16,472
[SPEAKER_11]: there to serve and prepare the breakfast.

272
01:08:17,352 --> 01:08:21,735
[SPEAKER_11]: As we did the analysis, it did not significantly impact that.

273
01:08:22,756 --> 01:08:29,820
[SPEAKER_11]: So we also wanted to indicate that we are still in negotiations with the Food Service Collective Bargaining Unit.

274
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,702
[SPEAKER_11]: So that will impact wages going forward.

275
01:08:34,303 --> 01:08:41,547
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are working with the Food Service Director and looking at really the positives of this program.

276
01:08:42,508 --> 01:08:54,874
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hoping that the enthusiasm to continue to feed the students of Medford, that the school committee would approve a motion to continue this program throughout the school year.

277
01:08:55,554 --> 01:09:02,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we near the closeout, identify any coverage that might be needed to maintain this program.

278
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:05,039
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is such a significant and important one.

279
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:07,400
[SPEAKER_11]: We would like to make that recommendation.

280
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

281
01:09:09,701 --> 01:09:10,841
[SPEAKER_15]: On the record.

282
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:11,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

283
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:12,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

284
01:09:13,086 --> 01:09:23,137
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I pushed strong and hard for this last year, and I really wanted breakfast before the bell, but I want to stop and appreciate all the work that you've done.

285
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:31,948
[SPEAKER_14]: on this program, it's tremendous to see the increase in high school students eating breakfast is huge.

286
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:33,869
[SPEAKER_14]: These numbers are wonderful.

287
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:46,934
[SPEAKER_14]: You have fed, we have as a community have fed many more children breakfast this year and it's because of the work of many in our district and it's greatly appreciated, 100%.

288
01:09:49,023 --> 01:10:08,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I still see a big difference of schools that have breakfast after the bell than before the bell, so I'm gonna ask you to look at that for next year, but I am wholeheartedly in agreement that we should continue this program, and any way we can feed children throughout our district, just keep bringing it in.

289
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:11,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep doing what you're doing, and thank you again.

290
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:14,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve.

291
01:10:14,553 --> 01:10:15,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Russo.

292
01:10:18,038 --> 01:10:18,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

293
01:10:19,118 --> 01:10:21,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to thank you for all the hard work.

294
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:25,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this was not just a little send an email off and call it a day.

295
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,781
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a ton of work for you and for the food service staff and for the principals.

296
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:31,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that that and the teachers.

297
01:10:31,682 --> 01:10:34,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, everybody really had to come together to make this work.

298
01:10:35,203 --> 01:10:42,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm looking forward to, you know, the year three or year two, I should say, when we can look at all these numbers and see them go up even more.

299
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:44,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I was especially

300
01:10:45,135 --> 01:10:47,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprised, actually, by the Andrews.

301
01:10:48,056 --> 01:10:56,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just wouldn't have been the school that I would have picked to expect to see such a massive increase, but that is very exciting.

302
01:10:56,881 --> 01:11:01,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to next year, and thank you for all your very hard work.

303
01:11:01,943 --> 01:11:04,024
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I can add on the heels of that,

304
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:11,533
[SPEAKER_11]: We have served over 6,000 more breakfasts in a three-month time frame from last year, so that's significant.

305
01:11:11,974 --> 01:11:23,683
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion on the floor to accept the recommendation to continue with Provision 2 free breakfast program for the school year 2019-20 with the understanding that a year-end report may require

306
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:26,890
[SPEAKER_15]: a transfer to cover any deficit in the food service fund.

307
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:30,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion was made by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

308
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, please.

309
01:11:33,296 --> 01:11:33,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

310
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:37,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

311
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:39,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

312
01:11:40,082 --> 01:11:40,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

313
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:42,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your support.

314
01:11:42,304 --> 01:11:42,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Negative.

315
01:11:42,584 --> 01:11:43,405
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

316
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:46,468
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to recognize that we have Isabella D'Souza with us.

317
01:11:46,508 --> 01:11:47,869
[SPEAKER_15]: She's the Medford high school rep.

318
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:48,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

319
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:53,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, new business.

320
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:58,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of retired Sergeant Cesar Della Torre.

321
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:05,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Sergeant Della Torre was the Medford police officer who directed the Medford Police Honor Guard unit at many city and veterans events.

322
01:12:06,503 --> 01:12:12,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Also under suspension, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Lina DiGiantomaso.

323
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:18,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. John Tomasa was a member of the Medford School Committee for many years and greatly contributed to the betterment of Medford Public Schools.

324
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,711
[SPEAKER_15]: She will be greatly missed.

325
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:24,793
[SPEAKER_15]: She also received the Lifetime Achievement Award by MASC, Mass Association of School Committees.

326
01:12:24,813 --> 01:12:26,454
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could all rise for a moment.

327
01:12:26,714 --> 01:12:26,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

328
01:12:26,874 --> 01:12:28,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Vander Kloot would like to say a few words.

329
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:33,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to comment because I was a colleague of Lena's for such a long time.

330
01:12:33,673 --> 01:12:36,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And Lena was a force to be reckoned with.

331
01:12:37,635 --> 01:12:47,040
[SPEAKER_05]: My most wonderful memory was when Lena, in her high heels, because Lena was always dressed to the T, and I climbed to every roof.

332
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:51,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is when the Osgoode was still standing, so we're talking many years ago.

333
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:54,964
[SPEAKER_05]: We climbed to the top of every roof and examined them ourselves.

334
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:56,545
[SPEAKER_05]: This was before.

335
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,245
[SPEAKER_05]: the schools were built.

336
01:12:58,565 --> 01:13:00,406
[SPEAKER_05]: This was way before that, as a matter of fact.

337
01:13:01,266 --> 01:13:05,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And Lena was going to never let anything stop her.

338
01:13:05,968 --> 01:13:12,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Lena would have been so happy in her own right because, you know, it's a Monday and Lena is being waked tonight.

339
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:13,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the wake earlier.

340
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:16,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And she used to love when the music played.

341
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:25,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And Lena was, we didn't always agree, but Lena was passionate about education.

342
01:13:26,029 --> 01:13:34,254
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we send our heartfelt condolences to her family and memories of the many years that she decked these halls.

343
01:13:34,754 --> 01:13:35,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.

344
01:13:36,335 --> 01:13:37,816
[SPEAKER_15]: All please rise for a moment of silence.

345
01:13:45,461 --> 01:13:46,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

346
01:13:47,262 --> 01:13:50,123
[SPEAKER_15]: And lastly, the superintendent's updates and comments.

347
01:13:50,284 --> 01:13:52,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Superintendent, let me turn you on here.

348
01:13:57,406 --> 01:13:59,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, you should be good.

349
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:02,490
[SPEAKER_15]: One sheet.

350
01:14:03,891 --> 01:14:04,952
[SPEAKER_15]: One sheet.

351
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:06,934
[SPEAKER_15]: A slow week in Medford.

352
01:14:06,954 --> 01:14:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So, good evening Mustang community.

353
01:14:11,797 --> 01:14:18,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight I do depart from my traditional superintendent's remarks and I have special remarks to make.

354
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:23,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight is a special night that is both a happy and a sad occasion.

355
01:14:24,007 --> 01:14:30,012
[SPEAKER_06]: The happy occasion is that it is the end of this school year and the beginning of our holiday season.

356
01:14:30,673 --> 01:14:47,147
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether you celebrate Christmas, winter solstice, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, on behalf of my family, the Medford Public Schools family, we would like to wish you all a lovely and safe holiday season filled with family, friends, and neighbors.

357
01:14:48,372 --> 01:15:02,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, on the other hand, it is also a sad occasion because today we have three members of our school committee that are transitioning and will no longer be with us for next year.

358
01:15:03,224 --> 01:15:16,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to formally thank Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke, chair of the school committee, Erin DiBenedetto, and Michael Ruggiero, school committee members, who have all proudly served the Medford Public Schools.

359
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:28,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke.

360
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:36,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few words to say, which is traditional.

361
01:15:38,865 --> 01:15:48,188
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always a bittersweet moment when we come to this place and we recognize the work of our fellow colleagues, but also know that change is happening.

362
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:56,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael, you and I stood out together this election day, all day, from the beginning of the day to the end of the day.

363
01:15:57,332 --> 01:16:01,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was no way that I was going to let you leave one minute before me and vice versa.

364
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:07,300
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had a wonderful time talking and chatting with each other and I thought, boy, what a benefit this was.

365
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:18,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And during that time, I really appreciated as I talked to you and heard what a passionate dad you are to your two wonderful sons and a husband to your lovely wife.

366
01:16:20,357 --> 01:16:22,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you brought a breath of fresh air to us.

367
01:16:23,301 --> 01:16:31,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not every day that we have a blueberry farmer amongst us, and that was something that I think was always interesting to your colleagues.

368
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,211
[SPEAKER_05]: We always want to know more.

369
01:16:32,632 --> 01:16:38,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And to that end, tonight I'm bringing you Mr. Ashley's blueberries, which happened to be on sale.

370
01:16:38,859 --> 01:16:42,343
[SPEAKER_05]: At the school committee conference, I kid you not, I couldn't believe it.

371
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:44,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a lovely, lovely book.

372
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:49,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am sure that you're going to enjoy reading it to your young sons.

373
01:16:50,632 --> 01:16:53,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And Michael, I think this is hardly the last that we're going to see you.

374
01:16:53,756 --> 01:16:55,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Your time here has been relatively brief.

375
01:16:56,619 --> 01:17:03,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that you've probably, I certainly was enriched by your presence and I hope that you've enjoyed your stay here.

376
01:17:04,305 --> 01:17:13,272
[SPEAKER_05]: And I suspect very, very much that we will hear more from you in the future and that you will continue your outspoken passion for education.

377
01:17:14,153 --> 01:17:26,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically, Michael, as you talked about reelection, you mentioned your concern about the obesity epidemic for children, and that, of course, brings into it also the concerns about exercise and recess.

378
01:17:26,857 --> 01:17:36,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as one of the members who is continuing on, I promise you that I will take up that mantle and continue it so that your work and thoughts in that direction will be continued.

379
01:17:37,381 --> 01:17:41,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael, thank you so much for your tenure, for being here, and for being one of my colleagues.

380
01:17:42,403 --> 01:17:42,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron.

381
01:17:44,777 --> 01:17:45,318
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not done.

382
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:53,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Erin, I can't believe that eight years have passed because it seems like just yesterday that you joined our committee.

383
01:17:54,007 --> 01:18:03,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm having a hard time with that processing that really you've been on the committee eight years, and I'm probably having an even harder time believing that you're leaving.

384
01:18:05,297 --> 01:18:06,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you, too, for your work.

385
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:16,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's not only just you, but also we got to meet and become friends with your wonderful husband, Joe.

386
01:18:16,846 --> 01:18:18,507
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard about Caitlin and Joey.

387
01:18:19,148 --> 01:18:24,192
[SPEAKER_05]: We lived just through one wedding and know that there's another wedding upcoming and house buying and whatever.

388
01:18:24,612 --> 01:18:29,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember them when they were so much younger, and you were, sorry, younger.

389
01:18:31,899 --> 01:18:44,257
[SPEAKER_05]: active parent, well I'm older so it's okay, active parent, a band parent, I remember all your work for the prom dress and mostly I think that your work for the Curtis Tufts

390
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:49,359
[SPEAKER_05]: keeping that school in vision, in mind, saying, how are we going to approve it?

391
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:51,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We need new shades, we need the floor.

392
01:18:51,660 --> 01:19:01,422
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just each meeting, we wondered what else you would come up with because you were intent of making sure that that work would be done, just as you were with the special education subcommittee.

393
01:19:02,442 --> 01:19:14,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Your tenacity, your thoughtfulness, we didn't always agree, but within that, we certainly had a level of respect with each other, and that's something that

394
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:15,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate.

395
01:19:16,386 --> 01:19:23,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Erin, I too believe, like Michael, that you will continue on and be very active in Medford.

396
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:34,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not quite sure exactly how that's going to turn out, which direction you're going to go in, but I know that it will be one that you will work very hard at as you find

397
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:43,246
[SPEAKER_05]: your passion and I also believe strongly that you are not over for education and that we will see you here in these halls again.

398
01:19:43,606 --> 01:19:48,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Erin, thank you for your dedication and your time and your commitment to the children of Medford.

399
01:20:01,334 --> 01:20:04,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to thank you for your friendship and your leadership.

400
01:20:05,397 --> 01:20:11,142
[SPEAKER_01]: What I learned working alongside both of you is your passion for high quality education.

401
01:20:11,713 --> 01:20:13,594
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure working with both of you.

402
01:20:14,494 --> 01:20:16,535
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been great friends, colleagues.

403
01:20:16,935 --> 01:20:20,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you both success and happiness in your future ventures.

404
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:25,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Burke, it's been a pleasure and privilege to have worked alongside you.

405
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen your passion and dedication to the city of Medford and the Medford Public Schools shine through.

406
01:20:31,382 --> 01:20:34,343
[SPEAKER_01]: As a mayor, there's been numerous achievements that you've fulfilled.

407
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:39,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all the remarkable accomplishments that you've done for the Memphis Public Schools and the city.

408
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:42,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your leadership and your friendship.

409
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:46,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you the best, great success, happiness in your future.

410
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:46,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.

411
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:48,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And both to everybody.

412
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:53,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see each other.

413
01:20:53,973 --> 01:20:54,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

414
01:20:54,033 --> 01:20:54,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Vandekoof.

415
01:20:55,274 --> 01:20:55,494
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

416
01:20:55,834 --> 01:20:59,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I now want to turn to Mayor Burke.

417
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:05,210
[SPEAKER_05]: who has been a fantastic mayor for the city of Medford.

418
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:15,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But more importantly for us, for this contingent, for these people sitting here, you have been a fantastic chair of the Medford School Committee, and we thank you so very much.

419
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:23,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not been the easiest of four years, but your accomplishments have been great, and you have ruled with steadfast

420
01:21:24,868 --> 01:21:29,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Eye on the prize, passion in the direction of what's best for the children.

421
01:21:30,053 --> 01:21:33,476
[SPEAKER_05]: The time, and I know that you've said it, but more was seeing you with the kids.

422
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:37,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how much you loved going to the schools and seeing and being with them.

423
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:45,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And believe me, you'll always be welcome in our halls because you have a natural ability with the kids.

424
01:21:45,947 --> 01:21:50,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just wonderful to see that piece of you, which I hadn't known before.

425
01:21:51,252 --> 01:22:08,708
[SPEAKER_05]: But your accomplishments, of course, are bigger, although we have to recognize that one of the key things of your administration is that we made a transfer from a very longstanding superintendent, Mr. Belson, and made a commitment to a search

426
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:20,014
[SPEAKER_05]: to be open, to be inclusive, and we, under your direction, we were able to identify and bring in Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

427
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:25,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly think that you should keep that as high on your accomplishment list.

428
01:22:25,558 --> 01:22:29,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to mention, by the way, I drove by the

429
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:45,776
[SPEAKER_05]: police building going up and I saw the light shining and of course I also have the luxury of driving past the library renovation which will also have your fingerprints on it.

430
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:47,678
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard.

431
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:55,223
[SPEAKER_05]: to say goodbye, but again we hope that you'll play a very active role in Medford in the future.

432
01:22:56,143 --> 01:23:06,929
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate so much that, I mean I can't say enough, but that sense of professionalism of keeping what is important for the Medford public schools.

433
01:23:07,309 --> 01:23:08,469
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we proceed?

434
01:23:08,829 --> 01:23:09,930
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we move on

435
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:15,799
[SPEAKER_05]: and through and make the best for our students.

436
01:23:16,299 --> 01:23:17,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your leadership.

437
01:23:17,682 --> 01:23:18,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your friendship.

438
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:20,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being you.

439
01:23:28,011 --> 01:23:42,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Medford Public Schools recognizes Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke for her contributions, service, and dedication to Medford Public Schools as the Chair of the Medford School Committee from 2016 through 2019.

440
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:54,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So we thank you and we present you with a glass apple that says Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke, Medford School Committee Chair, 2016 to 2019.

441
01:24:07,687 --> 01:24:08,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you everyone.

442
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:22,992
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been four long years, four great years, and I have been exposed to a lot of things during the course of my city council years and working for Mayor McGlynn as well, but never so much with the schools.

443
01:24:23,435 --> 01:24:25,696
[SPEAKER_15]: to the level of, obviously, that this has been.

444
01:24:26,136 --> 01:24:27,176
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just been an honor.

445
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:28,337
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a privilege.

446
01:24:28,637 --> 01:24:34,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And to get to know all the people in the school department, you're just fabulous.

447
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,700
[SPEAKER_15]: The kids, I absolutely adore every one of them.

448
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,741
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've really filled my heart.

449
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:44,482
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm forever grateful for this opportunity.

450
01:24:44,622 --> 01:24:45,482
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank you all.

451
01:24:46,103 --> 01:24:46,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

452
01:24:51,174 --> 01:24:51,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke.

453
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:57,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we have some other people in the house who also wanted to recognize the mayor.

454
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

455
01:24:58,221 --> 01:25:01,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want me to do the... Whichever way if you want to do those.

456
01:25:02,328 --> 01:25:03,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to forget at the last minute.

457
01:25:04,668 --> 01:25:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I would like to say Medford Public Schools recognizes Ms.

458
01:25:09,029 --> 01:25:17,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Erin DiBenedetto for her contribution, service, and dedication to Medford Public Schools as a Medford School Committee member from 2012 through 2019.

459
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:23,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And we present you with your crystal apple as well.

460
01:25:23,932 --> 01:25:25,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford School, Erin DiBenedetto.

461
01:25:25,532 --> 01:25:28,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Please come forward, Erin.

462
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:04,363
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say thank you to my family for giving up time with me to give me time to serve this community.

463
01:26:04,763 --> 01:26:09,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Service is a big part of our family life and I'm blessed to have served Method.

464
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:10,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

465
01:26:18,927 --> 01:26:31,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Last but definitely not least, Medford Public Schools recognizes Mr. Michael Ruggiero for his contribution, service, and dedication to the Medford Public Schools as a Medford School Committee member from 2017 through 2019.

466
01:26:31,575 --> 01:26:31,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

467
01:26:51,694 --> 01:26:55,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for the great honor to serve the city of Medford.

468
01:26:56,117 --> 01:27:05,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to thank both my kids and my wife, who often sometimes, you know, they have to sacrifice a little bit of their daddy so I can give up time.

469
01:27:05,363 --> 01:27:06,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been a great honor.

470
01:27:07,004 --> 01:27:09,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, Mayor Burke and Madam Superintendent.

471
01:27:09,586 --> 01:27:09,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

472
01:27:17,968 --> 01:27:24,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I was vice president of the photo club in high school.

473
01:27:24,732 --> 01:27:25,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew

474
01:27:45,003 --> 01:27:45,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

475
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:45,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

476
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:47,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we could ask.

477
01:27:48,392 --> 01:27:53,366
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys should come up.

478
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:21,638
[SPEAKER_13]: We see what beautiful gifts Medford gives on various anniversaries.

479
01:28:22,359 --> 01:28:24,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what it is, but we brought paper.

480
01:28:26,482 --> 01:28:30,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the city is doing better than the state.

481
01:28:32,086 --> 01:28:32,506
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

482
01:28:33,227 --> 01:28:38,791
[SPEAKER_13]: But we did bring, we brought paper for you all in case you need wallpaper.

483
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:43,755
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a citation, a resolution from the Senate which lists

484
01:28:44,626 --> 01:28:46,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Many, many things about Mayor Burke.

485
01:28:47,028 --> 01:28:52,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to just mention, it particularly mentions the groundbreaking for the new police station and the new library.

486
01:28:53,754 --> 01:29:03,382
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would say that one of your greatest gifts to Bedford was being part of selecting a new superintendent and a new chief of police.

487
01:29:03,522 --> 01:29:09,127
[SPEAKER_13]: That that legacy, more than physical monuments, will live on and continue to enrich

488
01:29:16,547 --> 01:29:38,584
[SPEAKER_13]: And while I'm at it, we have for Aaron to Benedetta, we have also a citation from the Senate and we particularly want to say one of my proudest parts of the new education law is that the special ed pack is going to give recommendations to the plans that are going to be implemented.

489
01:29:39,144 --> 01:29:45,029
[SPEAKER_13]: And you never know, you're not a parent of a special needs person right now, but I bet they'd be glad to see you.

490
01:29:54,070 --> 01:30:00,134
[SPEAKER_13]: uh... citation as people said don't expect we're going to do this in order uh... i want to think uh...

491
01:30:23,975 --> 01:30:48,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor Burke, for so many things that you've done in the past four years, I think one of the things that sticks with me the most, and it's also a testament to the school committee, is I was at one of the Medford Conversations projects this year, and I was at the table with most of the high school students, and they were talking about how the place that they feel most welcome, how welcome they feel in the city, but the place they felt most welcome was in school.

492
01:30:49,052 --> 01:30:57,839
[SPEAKER_12]: And that really struck me for what a good job this city is doing in helping students really feel welcome and feel like they're part of the city.

493
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you to all that you've done.

494
01:30:59,781 --> 01:31:02,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to Erin and to Michael for your service.

495
01:31:02,183 --> 01:31:03,084
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really incredible.

496
01:31:03,824 --> 01:31:07,968
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have citations for you as well, but I will let Leader Donato give those up.

497
01:31:10,119 --> 01:31:10,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

498
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:18,268
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, as a state delegation, we are so lucky to have such incredible partners in municipal government.

499
01:31:18,428 --> 01:31:23,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really mean that for those who are sitting out there and who are coming in to serve and those who are here.

500
01:31:25,576 --> 01:31:29,079
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is great to have incredible partners.

501
01:31:30,973 --> 01:31:43,878
[SPEAKER_08]: As a former school committee member, I just want to say I know the amount of dedication it takes to serve on a school committee, especially when the income is very small and the commitment is massive.

502
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:56,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And so those who are retiring from our school committee, I just want to thank you so much for the work that you have done to improve the quality of life for students in the Medford public schools and what

503
01:31:56,903 --> 01:32:07,472
[SPEAKER_08]: and particularly the members who are leaving, what sticks out to me most is that you've always prioritized all students, but also the most vulnerable students.

504
01:32:08,133 --> 01:32:11,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, that is so important and the legacy that we'll live on.

505
01:32:12,817 --> 01:32:13,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you both very much.

506
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:24,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, as soon as Mayor Burke was sworn into office four years ago, you know, she called me right away.

507
01:32:24,432 --> 01:32:37,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know she called the other members of the delegation and she said, made it very clear how she wanted to work with each member of the delegation as well as members of city government to transform the city of Medford.

508
01:32:38,046 --> 01:32:55,458
[SPEAKER_08]: And a couple of things that stick out to me under her leadership is the kind of professionalism she brought in running city government that has led to so many successes, even during difficult times.

509
01:32:56,919 --> 01:33:04,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would also say it's not easy serving in any political office, but serving as mayor is also not easy.

510
01:33:05,337 --> 01:33:18,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And you led the city with such success and so much grace that I think, even though it was only four years, it felt like a lot longer.

511
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:26,415
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the benefit that you have brought to the people of Medford and to the students of Medford will be felt for decades.

512
01:33:27,015 --> 01:33:28,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, and thank you to our members.

513
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:54,499
[SPEAKER_10]: As the leader of the delegation, it makes it a little more difficult because they have said many of the things that I would like to say about the members of the school committee and the mayor.

514
01:33:56,259 --> 01:34:06,122
[SPEAKER_10]: We as a delegation, I can tell you Madam Mayor and members of the school committee, we as a delegation have always dedicated ourselves to education.

515
01:34:07,077 --> 01:34:14,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's mirrored on not only what we have done with the educational program that we've presented through our legislation.

516
01:34:15,863 --> 01:34:22,347
[SPEAKER_10]: The breakfast before the bell is another milestone that we have and it's going to continue.

517
01:34:22,367 --> 01:34:34,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I can assure you that the Speaker of the House and the Senate President have as a priority education and we will continue to make it so that education is a priority in the legislature.

518
01:34:36,112 --> 01:34:50,461
[SPEAKER_10]: On a personal note, I met Michael many years ago and we became friends and became understanding as Democrats and we

519
01:34:52,275 --> 01:35:04,262
[SPEAKER_10]: We both had a passion for food and basically Michael is a farmer for blueberries and gave me blueberries and I made a wonderful blueberry pie.

520
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:04,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I right?

521
01:35:04,922 --> 01:35:05,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

522
01:35:05,543 --> 01:35:21,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So Michael has dedicated himself to the people of the city of Medford and we wish him well and hope that he finds an opportunity to continue his service to the people of Medford.

523
01:35:22,902 --> 01:35:51,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Aaron and I have a personal relationship on the basis of my cousin lived down the street and Evan was his caretaker and dedicated every day to make sure that he was safe, that he had food, that he was well taken care of and no matter what time of night, even if it was two o'clock in the morning,

524
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:54,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And he called her, she would call me.

525
01:35:58,291 --> 01:35:59,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Only once in a while.

526
01:35:59,691 --> 01:36:08,796
[SPEAKER_10]: But Erin, you have made your mark in the city of Medford as one who has dedicated herself to education and special needs.

527
01:36:09,476 --> 01:36:21,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know, as has been said, you are going to continue working for the people of Medford in that capacity, whatever it may be, because that's your passion.

528
01:36:22,182 --> 01:36:25,905
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's your vocation, so to speak.

529
01:36:28,288 --> 01:36:28,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, 1996.

530
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:34,614
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a very good year.

531
01:36:34,694 --> 01:36:35,074
[SPEAKER_15]: It was.

532
01:36:37,436 --> 01:36:40,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the honor and the pleasure of serving, we both

533
01:36:40,977 --> 01:36:46,179
[SPEAKER_10]: won election in 1995 and were sworn in together in 1996.

534
01:36:47,739 --> 01:37:04,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had that great opportunity to work with each other for those number of years as a city councilor and as a council president, we were able to accomplish many, many, many things for the people in the community.

535
01:37:07,605 --> 01:37:08,405
[SPEAKER_10]: On a personal note,

536
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:23,653
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor and I became very good friends and I can tell you that the mayor dedicated herself during the course when she was in charge of the budget.

537
01:37:24,793 --> 01:37:33,635
[SPEAKER_10]: She and the former mayor would come and would advocate for the funds that were necessary to keep the city moving forward.

538
01:37:36,195 --> 01:37:38,696
[SPEAKER_10]: She is a dedicated public servant.

539
01:37:40,246 --> 01:37:45,650
[SPEAKER_10]: whose first and foremost thought was for the people of the city of Medford.

540
01:37:47,332 --> 01:37:48,132
[SPEAKER_10]: She worked hard.

541
01:37:49,634 --> 01:37:50,774
[SPEAKER_10]: She worked diligent.

542
01:37:51,555 --> 01:38:00,262
[SPEAKER_10]: She worked day and night to see that the city's finances were in the best shape that the city has ever seen.

543
01:38:01,683 --> 01:38:04,405
[SPEAKER_10]: The legacy has been pointed out.

544
01:38:05,266 --> 01:38:08,589
[SPEAKER_10]: The legacy is going to be what she has done

545
01:38:09,983 --> 01:38:18,487
[SPEAKER_10]: for a new police station and a new library, but also a new police chief and a new superintendent.

546
01:38:19,407 --> 01:38:30,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the legacies, Madam Mayor, that you will sit down someday as people will then approach you in your private life for a short period of time.

547
01:38:31,312 --> 01:38:38,055
[SPEAKER_10]: In your private life, they will look at you and say, Madam Mayor, you made a mark in this community.

548
01:38:38,687 --> 01:38:49,647
[SPEAKER_10]: You can be proud of what you have done, proud of what you have accomplished, and proud of the people who surrounded you to make this Midford great.

549
01:38:50,008 --> 01:38:50,549
[SPEAKER_10]: God bless you.

550
01:39:03,328 --> 01:39:08,331
[SPEAKER_10]: These citations are more money than the Senate ones, because these are cardboard.

551
01:39:08,451 --> 01:39:09,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, sir.

552
01:39:09,271 --> 01:39:10,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

553
01:39:10,452 --> 01:39:10,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

554
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:37,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

555
01:39:37,231 --> 01:39:37,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo, sorry.

556
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:38,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

557
01:39:40,093 --> 01:39:43,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank you for your leadership as our mayor and chair of this school committee.

558
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:52,641
[SPEAKER_07]: You've shown incredible poise, and I have learned so much from you in my first term, my first two years in office.

559
01:39:55,303 --> 01:40:02,849
[SPEAKER_07]: When I began my run for school committee, you announced me at my kickoff event, which touched me deeply, because we weren't really friends yet.

560
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:09,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And your excitement at my first election is something I will cherish.

561
01:40:12,051 --> 01:40:22,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Your ability to chair this meeting when there are six or seven strong-minded people who would probably take this committee in a thousand directions at every moment is really impressive.

562
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:32,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And you keep us focused on what's best for our community, our students, our teachers, staff, and everybody else who's involved.

563
01:40:34,363 --> 01:40:39,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And that focus is a reminder that we're not here for our own agendas.

564
01:40:39,606 --> 01:40:41,306
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here for the people of Medford.

565
01:40:41,807 --> 01:40:45,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And you set an amazing example.

566
01:40:46,509 --> 01:40:49,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And that example will live on for a very long time.

567
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:50,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

568
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:55,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank you for your years of service, but mostly for your friendship.

569
01:40:57,334 --> 01:40:58,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Paul.

570
01:40:58,375 --> 01:40:58,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

571
01:41:07,957 --> 01:41:09,258
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hard.

572
01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:13,482
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were at home and I was saying to my kids, what will I say?

573
01:41:15,243 --> 01:41:17,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we weren't thinking we would be saying something.

574
01:41:20,255 --> 01:41:28,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Teagan told me, well, you met her through the whole food security interest with the Greater Boston Food Bank.

575
01:41:28,465 --> 01:41:32,791
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time we actually had a conversation after the first election four years ago.

576
01:41:33,252 --> 01:41:38,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And we met with Carol Tynken from Greater Boston Food Bank and talked about making Metfed the first food secure

577
01:41:39,479 --> 01:41:52,764
[SPEAKER_02]: City in the Commonwealth and that is still a goal that we're working at but it's with your help over the last few years that we have now a food pantry at the high school the summer eats program with the YMCA We've done pop-up mobile food markets.

578
01:41:53,044 --> 01:42:07,970
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Columbus groceries and soon there'll be a community food pantry That'll be very exciting that you were behind making that community food pantry happen and I guess what Paul was saying that

579
01:42:09,496 --> 01:42:13,638
[SPEAKER_02]: You always had the children, and even Reptonado, you always had the residents.

580
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: You always thought of them first, and how can you make their life on a daily basis better?

581
01:42:18,121 --> 01:42:19,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.

582
01:42:19,481 --> 01:42:28,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And the benefit was that because of food security, we got to be good friends, and I look forward to having more guidance and great conversations with you.

583
01:42:28,906 --> 01:42:29,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Mia.

584
01:42:29,687 --> 01:42:29,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mia.

585
01:42:30,387 --> 01:42:32,329
[SPEAKER_15]: So Mia and I have gotten to go in the van.

586
01:42:32,709 --> 01:42:33,469
[SPEAKER_15]: You know that van?

587
01:42:33,509 --> 01:42:35,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody knows her van.

588
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:37,613
[SPEAKER_15]: We've trekked into the Greater Boston Food Bank.

589
01:42:37,633 --> 01:42:41,235
[SPEAKER_15]: We've loaded truckloads of stuff into her van to bring back to Medford.

590
01:42:41,876 --> 01:42:44,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And really, food security is at the utmost.

591
01:42:44,678 --> 01:42:47,600
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very important to myself and especially to you.

592
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:50,082
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been a spirit in that area.

593
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:51,463

597
01:42:56,447 --> 01:43:03,210
[SPEAKER_15]: put everything to the side to just move forward and to do what's best for the children, which is all that matters at the end of any day.

598
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:06,491
[SPEAKER_15]: So you guys are amazing and keep on keeping on.
