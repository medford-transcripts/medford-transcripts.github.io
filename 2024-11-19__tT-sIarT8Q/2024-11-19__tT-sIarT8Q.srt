00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:47,256

203
00:11:47,276 --> 00:12:00,099

225
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,133
[SPEAKER_14]: We respectfully submitted Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

226
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:06,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

227
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record.

00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

229
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:09,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

[SPEAKER_08]: Nina Nazarian interim chief of staff representing Brianna Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

232
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:16,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome to your first meeting.

233
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:17,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

234
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the council taking up this matter this evening.

235
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:28,355
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, as you know, for four positions which we would like to include on the CAF, also known as the CAF.

236
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,438
[SPEAKER_08]: that the council approves.

237
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:39,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to take questions on any of them and speak to each of them to the extent that the council would like me to do so.

238
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

239
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have any questions for the chief of staff?

240
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:47,808
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

241
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:49,468
[SPEAKER_31]: Welcome to the meeting.

242
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,909
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for the work that you're doing.

243
00:14:50,929 --> 00:15:04,117
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to ask, I know that one thing that was committed to by the administration over the summer was coming to the council with CAF updates and reviews to make sure that it aligns with the current positions that actually exist in the city.

244
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:08,280
[SPEAKER_31]: So my two questions are, I think you just answered the first one, but I'll ask it again.

245
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,623
[SPEAKER_31]: These are positions that have existed for a significant period of time, but were never included in the CAF, is that correct?

246
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,164
[SPEAKER_08]: That is my understanding, yes.

247
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:24,421
[SPEAKER_31]: And are there additional positions that you expect to bring to the council in the future that have existed for a significant period but weren't in the CAF ordinance?

248
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:37,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears, I'm racking my brain right now going through the positions that we have posted, but I would have to review that question to be able to provide an accurate answer.

249
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:37,906
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

250
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:38,226
[SPEAKER_31]: Thanks.

251
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,067
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'd appreciate an email.

252
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:40,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly.

253
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:41,067
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

254
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:45,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight?

255
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Vice President, if you could put your mic on, please.

256
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:54,984
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, there you go.

257
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:58,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

258
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Are all these positions filled?

259
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:10,938
[SPEAKER_08]: At this time, the only position on this list that is filled, as far as I have understood, is the MCM production coordinator, the last position.

260
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:18,903
[SPEAKER_08]: We are presently working through filling at least two out of the three that are on this list, if not three out of three.

261
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:32,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be, obviously, just to follow up on that, it would be very important to be able to process these to allow the hiring process to occur, so there's no delay in the staffing for these departments.

262
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:39,855
[SPEAKER_21]: Have these positions been filled during the current administration and they've become vacant, or are these new positions that you're trying to create?

263
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:43,277
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding, and I cannot be...

264
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:59,413
[SPEAKER_08]: In fairness, I cannot say this with 100% certainty because I've only worked for the organization for the last year, but my understanding is that these positions have become vacant during this current administration and not prior to and not filled during, but I certainly defer to.

265
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:07,289
[SPEAKER_08]: the PDS director, Alicia Hunt, if she has any further information.

266
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:07,489
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

267
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:08,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

268
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:14,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I defer to the current PDS director, Alicia Hunt, if she has further information or any corrections to my understanding.

269
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:17,353
[SPEAKER_05]: If I might.

270
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:22,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening name and address of the record please, Alicia hunt director of planning development and sustainability for the city.

271
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:31,884
[SPEAKER_05]: The land use planner position is the one that has been filled by any street men, and she just left us in June, to take a consulting position.

272
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:40,168
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at the CAF system, we found that there were no planning positions listed in the CAF other than the director position.

273
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:50,533
[SPEAKER_05]: So while there were in previous budgets listed on budget sheets, the actual CAF spreadsheet did not list Annie's position or any other planners.

274
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:52,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is what this position is.

275
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The MCM station manager is the one

276
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,056
[SPEAKER_05]: where we just lost our station manager, obviously.

277
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:02,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was filled during the pandemic and is a recent vacancy.

278
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:13,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, I believe that the assistant purchasing agent, if I might, I believe was Fiona's position until she was promoted during the pandemic.

279
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:19,634
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on.

280
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:21,055
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

281
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:23,357
[SPEAKER_31]: Just how long was Annie Streetman in that position?

282
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:30,025
[SPEAKER_05]: at least two years, maybe three.

283
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:32,606
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, but prior to this administration.

284
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:33,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

285
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:33,666
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

286
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:45,770
[SPEAKER_21]: And lastly, the caps that are presented to us this evening.

287
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that the rate of pay that they would produce positions with previously paid?

288
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:54,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Or are there any adjustments that have been taking place with the offerings that have been made this evening?

289
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:04,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I can speak to the land use planner and confirm that that is within the range, that it is within the CAF that the prior position was paid.

290
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:20,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can also confirm that, and I actually have to look into the assistant purchasing agent, the MCM station manager and the MCM production coordinator.

291
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:21,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to misspeak.

292
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:37,361
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we don't know if the positions that you're bringing before us this evening are upgrading the salaries of the titles.

293
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:42,763
[SPEAKER_08]: If the council would be so agreeable, I can find that information this evening.

294
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:51,904
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're willing to hold this matter and return to it, I'd be glad to find that information and and provide you the accurate

295
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:56,558
[SPEAKER_14]: So, any further discussion?

296
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:58,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

297
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:04,543
[SPEAKER_18]: Have any of these positions been posted?

298
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:05,263
[SPEAKER_08]: They have.

299
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:06,844
[SPEAKER_18]: All positions?

300
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:14,009
[SPEAKER_08]: The assistant purchasing agent has been posted and is being, we are in the present process of attempting to fill that position.

301
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:20,113
[SPEAKER_08]: The MCM station manager is being finalized in the interview process right now.

302
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,632
[SPEAKER_05]: land use planner?

303
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:23,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's posted.

304
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to circulate it.

305
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:30,414
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a hot demand for planners right now to get applicants.

306
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:34,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's posted, but we're just in the very beginning trying to get the word out.

307
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:41,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And MCM production coordinator already filled existing positions.

308
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:47,918
[SPEAKER_18]: So is it the intent of the administration not to fill the position until the CAF is created?

309
00:20:49,421 --> 00:21:02,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly, that would it would be the goal would be to establish the calf this evening, and then fill the position so that there's no delay because with the hiring process as you can imagine and as I'm sure we've all been through in our, in our own lives.

310
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:26,539
[SPEAKER_08]: quickly and communicating in a way that provides a speedy and consistent process is critically important, especially in this time where it is very difficult to fill positions because of the number of positions open across the country and, you know, wanting to ensure that we are able to fill with the successful candidates and the wonderful interviews we've had.

311
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:27,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

312
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:32,564
[SPEAKER_18]: But we just, uh, I think it was your recommendation to lay it on the table for one week.

313
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:33,804
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not going to be approved tonight.

314
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:34,404
[SPEAKER_08]: No, sir.

315
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:47,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, my, my recommendation was to, if the council were to be so willing to allow me to find the information this evening and come back to the council this evening and, uh, present the information so that the action can be taken this evening.

316
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:48,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Come back to that.

317
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,487
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not the way I understood it.

318
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:51,947
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, that's up to the council.

319
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:53,227
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not the way I understood it.

320
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:54,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, my apologies.

321
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:56,508
[SPEAKER_18]: That's up to the council council.

322
00:21:57,935 --> 00:21:58,615
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

323
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,116
[SPEAKER_26]: Just had a quick question.

324
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,836
[SPEAKER_26]: So what's the range for CAF 3?

325
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you know the actual ranges?

326
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:07,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I can also collect that information and bring that to you as well.

327
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:08,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I can bring all of them.

328
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:13,141
[SPEAKER_26]: If you wouldn't mind, if you could get the ranges for each of these CAFs, we'd greatly appreciate it.

329
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:13,961
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd be happy to do so.

330
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:14,561
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

331
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:18,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further questions for the Chief of Staff?

332
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:21,504
[SPEAKER_14]: We have motion, Councilor Rao.

333
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:36,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I think following on Councilor Falco's point and understanding there is continued work in this, if perhaps the next time, you know, when these are presented again, the salary ranges could come with it so we can have more information.

334
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

335
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:37,849
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great feedback.

336
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

337
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be sure to include that information in future papers.

338
00:22:41,353 --> 00:22:41,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

339
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:49,932
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, just if I may, to my fellow Councilors, I think we're back to requesting to be turned on on the microphone.

340
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:54,555
[SPEAKER_31]: So when you press the button, you'll have to wait a minute for, I think it might be Cat turning them on right now, actually.

341
00:22:58,058 --> 00:22:58,899
[SPEAKER_31]: I was confused for a second.

342
00:22:59,279 --> 00:22:59,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

343
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:02,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have any further questions for the chief of staff?

344
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:04,263
[SPEAKER_31]: I second Councilor Knight's motion.

345
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,564

415
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:35,036
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be 705 707 Felsway West and then they'll be numbered by apartments is what I'm understanding so far.

416
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:41,057
[SPEAKER_21]: Is this district appropriately zoned for multifamily housing?

417
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:46,879
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we went through the variance process through the zoning board of appeals and that was approved.

418
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

419
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:53,676

424
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:13,288
[SPEAKER_31]: And I also just want to thank Danielle Evans.

425
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:21,936
[SPEAKER_31]: It's great to see that this funding is not sitting in the housing reserve, but is going to the essential need of approving more affordable housing in our community.

426
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:23,197
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

430
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:35,867
[SPEAKER_11]: And remind me, it's been a while since I've seen the plans for this, but it is three units within a multifamily, correct?

431
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:36,287
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not?

432
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:42,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so it's a separate structure within the attached breezeway to the existing two families.

433
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and this has been, as you said, this has been in the works for quite a while.

434
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:50,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my hair is getting whiter and whiter as I've gone through specific tests.

435
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:51,653
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been quite a while.

436

440
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:04,197
[SPEAKER_18]: You do great work, you and the community housing group.

441
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:12,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Susan, roughly, how many affordable units have been created through CPA funds to date?

442
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:18,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this will be the first one that I'm aware of these.

443
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:26,628
[SPEAKER_18]: So, these are the first three since we enacted CPA Many Preservation Act and these are the first three affordable units.

444
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:27,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

445
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:28,029
[SPEAKER_09]: That have come online.

446
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:30,430
[SPEAKER_09]: The funding, the first funding round for this.

447
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,410
[SPEAKER_18]: First, first funding.

448
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:37,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Um roughly and I don't want to put you on the spot but how many affordable

449
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,811
[SPEAKER_18]: in the city of Medford.

450
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:42,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have any idea?

451
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:44,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Through our organization or?

452
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:49,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Yours and if you happen to know the city numbers, that would be great.

453
00:29:49,176 --> 00:30:01,344
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of a tough question just for another project because there's private development and then we are, as far as I know, the only ones doing strictly affordable units.

454
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:03,265
[SPEAKER_09]: All the units here will be affordable.

455
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:03,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

456
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,011
[SPEAKER_18]: So, how many is your organization?

457
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:13,612
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we're we did two for Boston through a co-development with West Medford Baptist Church.

458
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:20,134
[SPEAKER_09]: We've purchased two condominium units and we have a two family and then these three units.

459
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,694
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could speak into the mic.

460
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:22,354
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

461
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:23,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

462
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:23,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

463
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:30,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we did two with the joint partnership with the West Medford Baptist Church and we have two

464
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:34,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

465
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:36,068
[SPEAKER_18]: And where are those located, Susan?

466
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:43,133
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the two family with the West Medford Baptist Church is on Boston Avenue.

467
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:47,897
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a condominium unit at 297 Main Street.

468
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:56,283
[SPEAKER_09]: We have another condominium at 305 Riverside Avenue and then the two family at 705 707 Felsway West.

469
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, and where was the previous one?

470
00:30:58,484 --> 00:30:59,225
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't get that.

471
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:01,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably to the 305 Riverside

472
00:31:04,927 --> 00:31:06,467
[SPEAKER_09]: and then these three units hopefully.

473
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:07,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

474
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:18,109
[SPEAKER_18]: And does your organization look at property location when we establish affordable housing in the community?

475
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:25,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we looking to make sure that every neighborhood gets affordable housing and they're not just centralized in certain areas?

476
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:27,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

477
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at our portfolio, we are spread across different neighborhoods in Medford.

478
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:33,872
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,

479
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:39,394
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a priority of us to be in different neighborhoods.

480
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:40,615
[SPEAKER_09]: They're smaller projects.

481
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:49,539
[SPEAKER_09]: We try to make them fit into the community and we want them to be part of the neighborhood for families and children and going to school.

482
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,541
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we feel that smaller projects are, you know, more beneficial to families.

483
00:31:56,725 --> 00:32:00,988
[SPEAKER_09]: especially with the children, being able to be part of the neighborhood and develop friendships.

484
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:06,572
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is a factor you look at locations to make sure they're dispersed throughout the community.

485
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:11,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And also geographic equity so that they're not all centered in one area.

486
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:12,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

487
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:13,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

488
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

489
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:14,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Appreciate your work.

490
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:17,320
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

491
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,401
[SPEAKER_26]: And thank you very much for all your hard work on this.

492
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:24,785
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you talk a little bit about the timing of this as far as when people would actually be living in these units?

493
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:42,395
[SPEAKER_09]: sure um so we'll start construction uh the maximum we're expecting is 12 months during that process we have to go through the state uh local action unit application and so we have to go through that process once we hopefully get the funding

494
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,737
[SPEAKER_09]: and then we will start the lottery process.

495
00:32:46,937 --> 00:33:00,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually we do it about six months out before completion and the reason for that is we don't want to lose people that maybe would qualify and then could drop out or so we try to do it as close as we can to the completion.

496
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:12,272
[SPEAKER_26]: So that'll be 12 months from hopefully yeah perfect and as far as the uh is there designated parking for this for these units or is it

497
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:17,063
[SPEAKER_09]: There is, there's on-site parking, there's street parking, they're right on 28th.

498
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:18,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

499
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:19,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

500
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:20,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you very much.

501
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:23,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the discussion.

502
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,666
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

503
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:28,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded.

504
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor, by Councilor Marks.

505
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

506
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:36,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Fares.

507
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:37,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

508
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:38,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Franco.

509
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:39,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

510
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Knight.

511
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

512
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:42,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks?

513
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:43,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

514
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:44,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell?

515
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:44,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

516
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:46,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

517
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:51,167
[SPEAKER_14]: President Rivera, please.

518
00:33:51,207 --> 00:34:03,670
[SPEAKER_14]: This is 21-525 offered by Councilor Morell, being so resolved that the City Council advance discussions on resolution 20-078, the proposed polystyrene ban first brought before the Council in February 2020.

519
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell?

520
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

521
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:21,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as it says, this came before the council, was voted into committee of the whole shortly before the pandemic, obviously because the restrictions of the pandemic and other things like the plastic bag ban being temporary lifted, this was kind of put on pause.

522
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:27,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, the detriment of polystyrene packaging does not stop for the pandemic.

523
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:31,114
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, because of increased takeout, this amount of

524
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:36,098
[SPEAKER_11]: waste has increased, so I know there's a number of students here that can speak on it.

525
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:44,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just asking for this to be advanced and moved to Committee of the Whole so that we can bring all parties interested to the table and have a great conversation around this and see how we could possibly move forward.

526
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:47,767
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd also want the students who came out to have a chance to speak when they can.

527
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:48,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

528
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:50,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody, let's speak.

529
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:56,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

530
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:57,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address on the record, please.

531
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Ellie Hunt, 41 Watson Street.

532
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:13,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I am here on behalf of the community and the CCSR, which is the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, Medford Public Schools organization, focused on student leadership and making the community a better place.

533
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,611
[SPEAKER_12]: We are sponsored by the Crystal Campbell Community Development Project and the Cummings Foundation.

534
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:25,633
[SPEAKER_12]: And with me are more students from the CCSR and other community members who are in support of the limiting use of polystyrene.

535
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:38,881
[SPEAKER_12]: So I came before the committee February 2020, which was about two years ago with this Medford High graduate Jules Franks, and we spoke on the detrimental environmental effects of polystyrene, also known as styrofoam.

536
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:42,964
[SPEAKER_12]: At that meeting, this effort was approved to move forward and referred to the Committee of the Whole.

537
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:47,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Due to the pandemic and the unfortunate timing, that committee was never held and this

538
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:51,434
[SPEAKER_12]: motion was never moved forward.

539
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:57,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm here today to bring forward and remind you all of our support on our petition.

540
00:35:57,398 --> 00:36:03,161
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 1,223 signatures supporting this.

541
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:05,543
[SPEAKER_12]: We hope to limit the use of styrofoam citywide.

542
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Doing so will benefit the environment and our community.

543
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:16,333
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the main prior concerns of this was the impact on the Medford public schools because of the styrofoam trays used at lunches.

544
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:23,295
[SPEAKER_12]: As of right now, all public schools, all Medford public schools except for Medford High are using reusable trays.

545
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:29,756
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is a city grant for a commercial dishwasher and reusable trays for the Medford High that the city has acquired.

546
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:33,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So that should no longer be a factor in this decision.

547
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:42,698
[SPEAKER_12]: We are here because we can't let this sit forever, and we would respectfully request that you hold a meeting to address this issue.

548
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:42,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

549
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

550
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have any questions?

551
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have any questions for the young lady?

552
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:50,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

553
00:36:50,783 --> 00:37:02,749
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you could also bring in the Chamber of Commerce in this, where they represent many businesses that use this product, if you want to link them in with your program, that'd be great also.

554
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:03,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

555
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:03,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay?

556
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:04,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

557
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

558
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:07,429
[SPEAKER_14]: So do we have a motion on the floor?

559
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,934
[SPEAKER_14]: We are on the motion by Councilor Morell to refer to Council Committee of the Whole, seconded by Councilor Falco.

560
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:21,077
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

561
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:23,559
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to, it's in committee.

562
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,820
[SPEAKER_11]: It's already in committee.

563
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a meeting on it and I'll do urgency.

564
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:32,725
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Falco.

565
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:33,893
[SPEAKER_14]: All in favor?

566
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:34,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

567
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

568
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Member Mox, you had something under suspension.

569
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:43,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Residents here that would like to speak under public participation.

570
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:45,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Under public participation.

571
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Would anyone like to speak under public participation?

572
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:53,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

573
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:56,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record and the topic you'll be speaking on.

574
00:37:57,885 --> 00:37:58,966
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Brianna Durham.

575
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:00,667
[SPEAKER_32]: I live at 105 Brookings Street.

576
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:06,925
[SPEAKER_32]: and I'm here to speak about the administrative leave of Michael Durham.

577
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:14,487
[SPEAKER_32]: Good evening, President Caraviello and members of the Medford City Council.

578
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:16,507
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Brianna Durham.

579
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:21,548
[SPEAKER_32]: My husband is Medford's Veterans Services Director, Michael Durham.

580
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:29,450
[SPEAKER_32]: I thank you for your attention and ask that you listen to me not as a wife, even though I am proud to be Mike's wife,

581
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:36,237
[SPEAKER_32]: But if you hear my words simply as a wife, it would demean my words and it would demean me.

582
00:38:36,257 --> 00:38:41,361
[SPEAKER_32]: It would be like patting me on the head and saying, thank you, little girl.

583
00:38:43,163 --> 00:38:52,230
[SPEAKER_32]: Instead, I ask that you listen to me as an independent woman, listen to me as a resident of Medford who wants you to know the truth.

584
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,093
[SPEAKER_32]: First, the wage issue.

585
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:08,400
[SPEAKER_32]: At Mike's budget hearing, every one of you were told by the former chief of staff the city paid the so-called chief people officer for work that was done by Mike during the fiscal year that ended in 2020, in July of 2020.

586
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,184
[SPEAKER_32]: This has never been corrected, and Mike has never been paid in full.

587
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:15,366
[SPEAKER_32]: But Mike never cared about the money.

588
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,868
[SPEAKER_32]: As usual, he only cares about what's right.

589
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:26,095
[SPEAKER_32]: What you don't know is that about one month ago, Michael made a public records request to the city asking for documents.

590
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:35,403
[SPEAKER_32]: In particular, a document from October, 2020 that we feel shows the city knew that the payments made to the chief people officer were fraudulent.

591
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:38,426
[SPEAKER_32]: The city has refused to reduce the record twice.

592
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:45,012
[SPEAKER_32]: And this has left Mike with no alternative, but to have his lawyer requested the court order the city to release the public record.

593
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:47,998
[SPEAKER_32]: as to veterans benefits.

594
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:56,826
[SPEAKER_32]: Every one of you know Mike has spoken out repeatedly about the administration's policies that will result in reducing veterans preference and civil service hiring.

595
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:03,552
[SPEAKER_32]: You may also know the mayor in a video that she released online called Mike a liar.

596
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:12,680
[SPEAKER_32]: Not one to be deterred, in early September Mike spoke out publicly at a veterans benefits rally against this discrimination.

597
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:20,446
[SPEAKER_32]: He was exercising the very right of free speech that he defended at the risk of his own life.

598
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:37,532
[SPEAKER_32]: What you may not know is that the chief people officer on behalf of the city of Medford is scheduled to speak at a state commission meeting on September 24th, 2021, when it continues its discussion of veterans benefits and civil service.

599
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:44,778
[SPEAKER_32]: For many weeks, Mike has been asking the chief people officer to share what he intends to say at the meeting.

600
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:49,681
[SPEAKER_32]: The chief people officer has never once had the courtesy to respond to Mike.

601
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:55,845
[SPEAKER_32]: Last Thursday afternoon, Mike saw the chief people officer on the second floor of city hall.

602
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:58,626
[SPEAKER_32]: It was right after Mike had finished some ticket hearings.

603
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:02,028
[SPEAKER_32]: Mike asked him to share what he intends to say at the meeting.

604
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:09,293
[SPEAKER_32]: The chief people officer refused to do so, saying he should ask the mayor and slammed the men's room door in his face.

605
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:18,111
[SPEAKER_32]: Mike did as he was directed and went right across the hall to the mayor's office and the outer office where the secretary sit.

606
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:25,296
[SPEAKER_32]: The mayor's door was open and the mayor was at her desk at the end of the office away from Mike.

607
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:31,539
[SPEAKER_32]: Mike asked her if she could share what the chief people officer was going to present at the civil service meeting.

608
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:40,045
[SPEAKER_32]: The mayor refused to speak to him saying that he was represented and slammed the door as she retreated into the chief of staff's office.

609
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:51,617
[SPEAKER_32]: Mike immediately filed a written report with the city solicitor describing how the refusal of the mayor and the chief people officer is negatively impacting his ability to do his job as veterans director.

610
00:41:52,017 --> 00:41:55,281
[SPEAKER_32]: This was his fourth hostile workplace complaint.

611
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:07,217
[SPEAKER_32]: On Friday morning at 8.30 a.m., Mike emailed this council once again, raising the matter of payments made by the city to a person who did not do the work.

612
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:12,303
[SPEAKER_32]: No one disputes that the work was done entirely by Mike.

613
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:23,808
[SPEAKER_32]: Four hours later, Mike was ordered to go up to the interim chief of staff's office and was placed on administrative leave and told that he had to have a fitness for duty examination.

614
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:30,677
[SPEAKER_32]: He was told that this was not a disciplinary matter, but he was being banned from all municipal buildings.

615
00:42:33,191 --> 00:42:49,605
[SPEAKER_32]: This was done even though Mike's behavior at the meeting was described as being the perfect gentleman, very professional and extremely polite by the two police officers that the mayor had called to city hall to walk Mike down to his office and out of the building.

616
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:56,651
[SPEAKER_32]: Both officers have also said to Mike's lawyer that there was no need for them to be there.

617
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:04,471
[SPEAKER_32]: There have been no incidents to warrant such actions on the mayor's part.

618
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,912
[SPEAKER_32]: In my opinion, this is not a personnel issue.

619
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:11,854
[SPEAKER_32]: It is retribution against Mike for reporting an injustice.

620
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:16,816
[SPEAKER_32]: And it is an attempt to silence Mike for being honest.

621
00:43:18,577 --> 00:43:28,801
[SPEAKER_32]: The mayor is using a vicious stereotype that veterans are imbalanced and violent to smear the reputation of a good man, a kind,

622
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:39,421
[SPEAKER_32]: and caring professional who has served his country, who serves the veterans and their families, and who serves this city.

623
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:53,786
[SPEAKER_32]: The collateral damage to the administration's vile and depraved action against Mike is that the veterans and their families will not be receiving the assistance that they need and deserve.

624
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:59,468
[SPEAKER_32]: There are some words that each of you need to be reminded of.

625
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:03,258
[SPEAKER_32]: They were said at Mike's budget hearing.

626
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,419
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Knight said, Mike is doing a great job.

627
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,720
[SPEAKER_32]: His department heads go, he is at the top of the list.

628
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:15,462
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Marks said, Mike has taken this position to a different level.

629
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:21,144
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Morell said, Mike has done a tremendous amount of work for a one person office.

630
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:29,627
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Scarpelli said, my question is, how do we make sure someone as valuable as Mike stays?

631
00:44:31,485 --> 00:44:33,266
[SPEAKER_32]: if only we could clone Mike.

632
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:38,990
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Falco said, Mike is doing a fabulous job.

633
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:47,735
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Bears said, Mike's budget doesn't reflect the millions of dollars that he has raised to help veterans.

634
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:51,298
[SPEAKER_32]: The amount that it has increased is truly impressive.

635
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:59,323
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor President Caraviello said, Mike is doing a great job for veterans and for the citizens of this city.

636
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:07,233
[SPEAKER_32]: even former chief of staff, David Rodriguez said, I've never seen someone step up like Mike.

637
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:15,138
[SPEAKER_32]: Because each of you said these words, you know that Mike did not abandon his job.

638
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:23,885
[SPEAKER_32]: He would be on the job this very minute, if not for politically motivated smear campaign, falsely dressed up as administrative leaf.

639
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:30,977
[SPEAKER_32]: Here are the next words that I respectfully ask this council to say in a formal vote.

640
00:45:32,778 --> 00:45:46,504
[SPEAKER_32]: Be it resolved that the mayor of the city of Medford immediately rescind her order of administrative leave from Michael Durham and return him to his position as veteran services director in the city of Medford without restriction.

641
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:47,765
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

642
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Edward Lendingham, 64 Forest Street, Method Mass.

643
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank this council for letting me speak tonight.

644
00:46:26,155 --> 00:46:27,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a U.S.

645
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:28,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Navy veteran.

646
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:39,004
[SPEAKER_02]: From the city of Medfords Department of Public Works for over 37 years of service.

647
00:46:39,893 --> 00:46:51,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I come here tonight to speak on the issues concerning veterans of this community, the veterans department at city hall and issues pertaining to our veterans service officer.

648
00:46:52,679 --> 00:47:03,465
[SPEAKER_02]: The administration has some concern and failures in terms of flag etiquette, procedures at public events and veterans memorials.

649
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:21,717
[SPEAKER_02]: They failed to apologize for any of these discrepancies and furthermore, continue to assault on veterans by undermining veterans benefits with a civil service veterans bypass request to the state.

650
00:47:22,697 --> 00:47:29,660
[SPEAKER_02]: They refuse to admit that they are legally screened out method residents who apply for city employment.

651
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:48,654
[SPEAKER_02]: or that selective service request would be bypassed, dozens of non-resident veterans creating a precedent for hiring policies to bypass veterans benefits forever.

652
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: The diversity director

653
00:47:52,392 --> 00:48:04,274
[SPEAKER_02]: who will be appearing to speak on veterans benefits to the State Civil Service Commission this month, refuses to let veterans know what this administration will state.

654
00:48:05,735 --> 00:48:13,616
[SPEAKER_02]: The veterans want to move, this administration wants to move diversity in another direction in this city.

655
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:17,657
[SPEAKER_02]: The alleged hostile work environment

656
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:24,748
[SPEAKER_02]: forced a female minority department head to leave her position.

657
00:48:25,508 --> 00:48:35,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It also put the director of our veterans department, who is a disabled army combat veteran, on paid administrative leave.

658
00:48:36,692 --> 00:48:46,795
[SPEAKER_02]: This action shuts down our veterans department that provides emergency support to veterans and widows in our community.

659
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:56,078
[SPEAKER_02]: The administration has discriminated based off sex, race, and veteran status over the last eight months.

660
00:48:57,118 --> 00:49:03,302
[SPEAKER_02]: What protective group is next to be discriminated against in the guise of diversity?

661
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:14,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this administration thinks by putting the veterans director on administrative leave can silence the veterans community?

662
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:15,789
[SPEAKER_02]: You are mistaken.

663
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:16,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

664
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

665
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street.

666
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:48,353
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much, President and council members for allowing me to speak.

667
00:49:48,674 --> 00:49:49,274
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

668
00:49:50,194 --> 00:49:53,696
[SPEAKER_24]: COPD, I have to take this down so I can speak.

669
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:57,638
[SPEAKER_24]: I was working with Michael Durham.

670
00:49:57,918 --> 00:50:05,102
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a longtime customer of mine, and I've known the whole family for a number of years.

671
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,186
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to call him a gentle giant.

672
00:50:10,186 --> 00:50:20,108
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm the wife, or ex-wife, of a 100% PTSD Vietnam veteran service-related disabled.

673
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:31,471
[SPEAKER_24]: We divorced in 94, and in 2005, I took him back so I could care for him and become his caretaker.

674
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:39,421
[SPEAKER_24]: In the past two years, he's had seven episodes that I have saved his life.

675
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:47,327
[SPEAKER_24]: And one was yesterday when I had to call 911 and have an ambulance come and rush him to the VA in West Roxbury.

676
00:50:48,853 --> 00:51:03,882
[SPEAKER_24]: I was working with Michael John to try and get my husband situated in a VA facility because I am not in a position to care for him anymore because I'm not a nurse and I don't have medical expertise.

677
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:09,667
[SPEAKER_24]: I saved him from a stroke two days after Christmas last year.

678
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:21,657
[SPEAKER_24]: And then after COPD, he got AFib, and now he had PTSD, now COPD, AFib, and now a pacemaker.

679
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:24,528
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's very difficult.

680
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:28,630
[SPEAKER_24]: And now you've removed the one person that could have helped me.

681
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,871
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a gentle giant.

682
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,071
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a very caring individual.

683
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,312
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just think it's a disservice.

684
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:46,196
[SPEAKER_24]: And I have to say, I and other people in this community are extremely fed up that it seems to be rules for thee, but not for ye.

685
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:51,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Because it seems like the mayor can go protest at a church

686
00:51:52,518 --> 00:51:56,063
[SPEAKER_24]: But the veterans officer can't protest in front of City Hall.

687
00:51:56,703 --> 00:51:59,306
[SPEAKER_24]: This is not our America.

688
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:02,290
[SPEAKER_24]: This is not our city of Medford.

689
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,613
[SPEAKER_24]: And we don't want to stand for this anymore.

690
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:05,214
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had it.

691
00:52:25,447 --> 00:52:25,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

692
00:52:25,907 --> 00:52:26,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

693
00:52:26,907 --> 00:52:28,968
[SPEAKER_20]: John Petrola, 61 Locust Street.

694
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:31,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Listen, I'm just here.

695
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:35,390
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I think everyone wants to know what's next.

696
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,551
[SPEAKER_20]: What are we going to do here?

697
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:39,292
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm not up here to defend Mike.

698
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:40,812
[SPEAKER_20]: He doesn't need me to defend him.

699
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:42,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone knows who he is.

700
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:47,234
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone knows what he's doing and what's next.

701
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:47,974
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

702
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:48,575
[SPEAKER_20]: What's next.

703
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:49,695
[SPEAKER_20]: What are we going to do about this?

704
00:53:00,718 --> 00:53:02,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion on this matter?

705
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:06,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

706
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:11,921
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

707
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:15,462
[SPEAKER_26]: I thank Mr. Irwin for coming down tonight.

708
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:20,103
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for coming down to speak to the council.

709
00:53:21,043 --> 00:53:24,964
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sure these last few days have not been easy on you, your husband or your family.

710
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:34,405
[SPEAKER_26]: The most progressive value in the foundation of actions and relationship is a truth.

711
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:41,469
[SPEAKER_26]: Without it, we can't possibly move forward to the goal of working together to build a new and vibrant method that we all desire.

712
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:47,812
[SPEAKER_26]: I've worked with veteran services Michael Durham closely during my time on the city council.

713
00:53:48,732 --> 00:53:54,295
[SPEAKER_26]: Mike has repeatedly served the many needs of our veterans with compassion and professionalism.

714
00:53:55,225 --> 00:53:55,965
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the truth.

715
00:53:56,966 --> 00:54:01,508
[SPEAKER_26]: I have witnessed the dedication that he brings to his position on a 24 seven basis.

716
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:03,309
[SPEAKER_26]: That is the truth.

717
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:09,151
[SPEAKER_26]: I've heard him as sure as, and I'm sure you have to, to be unafraid to speak.

718
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:13,453
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, when he sees an injustice, that is the truth too.

719
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,175
[SPEAKER_26]: I stand with my Durham who has stood up for so many.

720
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:23,778
[SPEAKER_26]: There's one more truth and that's that our city cannot afford to lose yet another one of its best public servants.

721
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:35,607
[SPEAKER_26]: We lost a great one just a couple of months ago with Aleesha Nunley Benjamin, a woman of color who left our city after alleged complaints of racism, sexism, and a hostile work environment.

722
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,188
[SPEAKER_26]: This must come to an end.

723
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:43,891
[SPEAKER_26]: Our employees must be valued, recognized, and respected for their hard work.

724
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:54,095
[SPEAKER_26]: Over the past few days, I've been stopped walking through Medford Square, I've been called on the phone, and I've heard numerous

725
00:54:55,366 --> 00:55:09,615
[SPEAKER_26]: numerous, all positive stories about Michael Durham and all of the hard work that he has put in, all of the veterans that he has helped, all of the, in some of them during the most trying of times.

726
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:20,342
[SPEAKER_26]: It might be paperwork, it might be, I talked to someone recently whose husband was a veteran and he had passed away and Michael helped with the burial and whatnot.

727
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:23,055
[SPEAKER_26]: Michael has always been there for the community.

728
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:26,016
[SPEAKER_26]: I did say during the budget hearing, he's fabulous.

729
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:30,957
[SPEAKER_26]: And he is, he's a nonstop constant worker that gets the job done.

730
00:55:31,758 --> 00:55:36,559
[SPEAKER_26]: And everyone I've talked to, everyone that I met along the way loves Michael.

731
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:40,380
[SPEAKER_26]: He's probably one of the finest people you ever want to meet.

732
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,520
[SPEAKER_26]: He's always giving back.

733
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:49,622
[SPEAKER_26]: He served his country, he served his community, and he's always been there for the veterans of our community and anyone else that needs help.

734
00:55:51,233 --> 00:55:54,534
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for coming down, and I support Michael Durham 100%.

735
00:55:54,574 --> 00:55:56,895
[SPEAKER_26]: He's one of the best we've got.

736
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,818
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

737
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:09,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

738
00:56:09,898 --> 00:56:12,659
[SPEAKER_21]: I, too, stand by the comments that I made at the budget hearings.

739
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,001
[SPEAKER_21]: Mike Durham, when it comes to department heads, is top of the list here in the city of Medford.

740
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:30,140
[SPEAKER_21]: But he's more than just a department head, you know, he's a person, he's a husband, he's a father, he's a veteran, he's someone that's served the public diligently for his whole professional career.

741
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:41,469
[SPEAKER_21]: And for this personnel matter to be played out publicly like it is, as really nothing more than what I can see as a tool for politics in the real smoke and mirrors game.

742
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,372
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's sad, Mr. President, and I'm afraid we're going to lose him.

743
00:56:45,993 --> 00:56:48,475
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm afraid we're going to lose him because we're not showing the respect that he deserves.

744
00:56:49,582 --> 00:56:50,482
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's the bottom line.

745
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody behind this rail does a lot of good.

746
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:55,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Every day.

747
00:56:56,485 --> 00:56:58,046
[SPEAKER_21]: Mike Durham does far more than we do.

748
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:05,389
[SPEAKER_21]: He's touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of people here in this community and beyond through his service and through his work on behalf of veterans.

749
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,531
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never seen such an outpour of support.

750
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:16,355
[SPEAKER_21]: for an individual department head going through such a situation in my 20-plus years in government.

751
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:19,656
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's a testament to the work that he does and the person that he is.

752
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,517
[SPEAKER_21]: And quite frankly, I stand with Mrs. Durham.

753
00:57:23,577 --> 00:57:24,797
[SPEAKER_21]: I think he should be reinstated.

754
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:28,659
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no reason why this is playing out the way it is.

755
00:57:29,499 --> 00:57:35,901
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't see any way that this is the appropriate course of action that's going on right now.

756
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:38,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Mike should be working, just like he has been.

757
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,180
[SPEAKER_21]: But Mike should be working just like he has been every single day.

758
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:55,142
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um, you know, I think that one of the things that people forget is that as a public servant, Mike goes to work every day to help people.

759
00:57:55,902 --> 00:57:58,543
[SPEAKER_21]: And now it's time for us to help him.

760
00:58:04,084 --> 00:58:10,265
[SPEAKER_21]: I certainly have no problem requesting that the administration reinstate Mike Durham to the position of director of veteran services post haste.

761
00:58:10,385 --> 00:58:11,905
[SPEAKER_21]: And I offer that in the form of a motion.

762
00:58:20,615 --> 00:58:20,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

763
00:58:21,495 --> 00:58:32,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I could say something, I'm the subcommittee chairman of the Veterans Commission, and I've worked with Mike from day one.

764
00:58:33,562 --> 00:58:35,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilor's Night is right.

765
00:58:35,163 --> 00:58:37,784
[SPEAKER_14]: The job of the government is to help people.

766
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:40,146
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mike's done nothing but help people.

767
00:58:40,506 --> 00:58:45,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Him and I have gone out during the holidays, delivering food to people's homes, doing other things.

768
00:58:47,905 --> 00:58:52,010
[SPEAKER_14]: The man's job is helping people, and that's what he does every day when he comes into this building.

769
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:57,016
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to see him back in here, continuing to help the people and the veterans of Medford.

770
00:58:58,277 --> 00:58:59,619
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion on the floor.

771
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:00,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

772
00:59:02,402 --> 00:59:02,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

773
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:05,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

774
00:59:05,523 --> 00:59:07,744
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank my colleagues for their comments.

775
00:59:08,885 --> 00:59:10,566
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank Mrs. Durham.

776
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:13,008
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that was extremely difficult.

777
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:17,890
[SPEAKER_18]: And from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for appearing before us tonight.

778
00:59:20,092 --> 00:59:20,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President,

779
00:59:22,353 --> 00:59:41,848
[SPEAKER_18]: When Mike Durham was asked to leave the building, his last request when he was being escorted out by two police officers was that, I have a veteran coming in next Tuesday that faces homelessness.

780
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:47,372
[SPEAKER_18]: And in addition to that, maybe suicidal.

781
00:59:48,897 --> 00:59:59,744
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to make sure, if I'm not in that office, that there's someone there that has the whereabouts and knowledge to address her concerns.

782
01:00:00,665 --> 01:00:10,272
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that speaks volumes, Mr. President, about his character and about a man who is committed to his job over anything else.

783
01:00:11,512 --> 01:00:15,095
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's what leads us to where we are right now.

784
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,451
[SPEAKER_18]: And I always like to simplify things, right?

785
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you hear a lot going, who said what?

786
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:22,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Who said this?

787
01:00:23,113 --> 01:00:24,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this politically motivated?

788
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:26,575
[SPEAKER_18]: So I like to simplify.

789
01:00:27,296 --> 01:00:42,645
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's my understanding we had, and it could be anyone, we had a city employee who was a whistleblower say, I believe there's some wrongdoing going on at City Hall.

790
01:00:44,362 --> 01:00:44,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

791
01:00:44,582 --> 01:00:45,062
[SPEAKER_18]: An employee.

792
01:00:45,402 --> 01:00:53,564
[SPEAKER_18]: If you had a private business and someone stepped forward, you'd shake their hand and congratulate them and say, thank you for bringing this to my attention.

793
01:00:56,684 --> 01:01:13,507
[SPEAKER_18]: And this particular employee, Mr. President, didn't just throw out accusations, but line them up with facts in which he sent to the administration and what she sent to this council time after time after time, Mr. President.

794
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:33,464
[SPEAKER_18]: And to date, to date, I won't speak for my colleagues, I have yet to receive any information that this council has requested on this specific allegation, Mr. President, or the allegation that was mentioned by the city employee.

795
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,945
[SPEAKER_18]: I've yet to receive one iota of information.

796
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:44,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe the city administration's still working on that, Mr. President, I don't know.

797
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:57,920
[SPEAKER_18]: But to me, you don't vilify an employee who's standing up and saying there's a wrongdoing, there's a potential wage theft, whatever you want to refer to it as.

798
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:04,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Immediately, the administration should have looked into it and came out with a finding.

799
01:02:06,502 --> 01:02:09,483
[SPEAKER_18]: And we wouldn't still be discussing this, Mr. President.

800
01:02:10,404 --> 01:02:14,305
[SPEAKER_18]: But instead, the administration sought

801
01:02:17,138 --> 01:02:23,021
[SPEAKER_18]: to take a whistleblower, and the federal government, like I said, they praise whistleblowers.

802
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:25,503
[SPEAKER_18]: They compensate whistleblowers.

803
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:36,949
[SPEAKER_18]: In the city of Medford, they give you the perp walk outside, and they ask you to go for a psychological exam if you're a whistleblower.

804
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:44,493
[SPEAKER_18]: That can't continue to happen in this community, because it's sent,

805
01:02:50,343 --> 01:03:05,295
[SPEAKER_18]: It's sending a lousy message, Mr. President, to other potential whistleblowers, other potential employees, other potential residents that want to come forward and say, you know what?

806
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:06,716
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's something happening here.

807
01:03:07,677 --> 01:03:08,237
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know what?

808
01:03:08,257 --> 01:03:14,202
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to say anything, because remember that poor Mike Durham, what they put him and his family through?

809
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:16,224
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to keep my mouth shut.

810
01:03:17,955 --> 01:03:20,477
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a lousy environment to work under.

811
01:03:23,298 --> 01:03:32,644
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would ask, Mr. President, and I agree with my colleague, that really, we need to find out what's going on regarding the allegations, Mr. President.

812
01:03:32,664 --> 01:03:34,125
[SPEAKER_18]: This is one of several.

813
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,986
[SPEAKER_18]: What's going on with the allegations?

814
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,587
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't received an update.

815
01:03:38,188 --> 01:03:44,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would also ask, Mr. President, as my council colleagues both asked, that might be reinstated as well.

816
01:03:53,055 --> 01:04:10,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as far as I'm concerned, if there's no employee action, which the letter I read stated that the city of Medford did not put Mike Durham on any type of corrective action, but they did tell Mike Durham, you're not allowed in any municipal buildings in the community.

817
01:04:10,966 --> 01:04:14,168
[SPEAKER_18]: They did tell him you can't talk to any city employees.

818
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:21,433
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know how you put someone that's not on corrective action and tell them they're not allowed in a city building.

819
01:04:22,627 --> 01:04:30,011
[SPEAKER_18]: and not allowed to go to a parent-teacher conference, which is a city building, Mr. President.

820
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,092
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how that happens.

821
01:04:33,553 --> 01:04:42,458
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, I'm not an attorney, but that doesn't sound right, where you exclude someone from a public building that's not on any type of corrective action, Mr. President.

822
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:43,778
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are my comments.

823
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:46,820
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope we can get past this, Mr. President.

824
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:51,943
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope we can retain a person of Mike's character, his integrity at City Hall,

825
01:04:53,218 --> 01:05:05,201
[SPEAKER_18]: because that's the type of integrity and character we need.

826
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:08,482
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we need, Mr. President.

827
01:05:09,762 --> 01:05:20,705
[SPEAKER_18]: And tonight, I don't wanna be the bearer of bad news, but when items don't come on the agenda, so we have an agenda every night, or every Tuesday, so we have an agenda.

828
01:05:21,593 --> 01:05:32,342
[SPEAKER_18]: And if an item comes on under suspension, which means it's not on the agenda, typically the council, like we're doing now, we could talk about it, but we're not supposed to take a formal vote.

829
01:05:33,323 --> 01:05:34,404
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's with any issue.

830
01:05:34,424 --> 01:05:35,925
[SPEAKER_18]: It has nothing to do with Mike's issue.

831
01:05:36,285 --> 01:05:39,468
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just open and transparent government.

832
01:05:39,788 --> 01:05:42,691
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can't work on things that aren't on the agenda.

833
01:05:43,071 --> 01:05:45,173
[SPEAKER_18]: And people say, well, gee, I didn't see that on the agenda.

834
01:05:45,393 --> 01:05:46,454
[SPEAKER_18]: How'd the council vote on that?

835
01:05:47,054 --> 01:05:49,777
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can offer that tonight and take the vote next week.

836
01:05:50,557 --> 01:05:53,278
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, you know, but that's, that's how this council operates.

837
01:05:53,898 --> 01:05:57,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and it's always been our, uh, operation policy and procedure.

838
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:09,083
[SPEAKER_18]: So I supported 110% of asking that, uh, we move it forward tonight and take the formal vote, which is required because it'll appear on the agenda next week for a formal vote.

839
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:15,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and that's what I would recommend my colleagues doing this, Mr. President.

840
01:06:15,526 --> 01:06:19,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, but I want to thank everyone for coming up tonight and supporting,

841
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:20,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike on this issue.

842
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:26,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

843
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:29,210
[SPEAKER_18]: I am.

844
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,370
[SPEAKER_18]: I am good, Mr. President.

845
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:30,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

846
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:32,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address, please.

847
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:34,111
[SPEAKER_24]: Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street.

848
01:06:35,111 --> 01:06:36,372
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to appreciate.

849
01:06:37,312 --> 01:06:38,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

850
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:39,692
[SPEAKER_24]: Council members.

851
01:06:39,993 --> 01:06:42,093
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate the rules.

852
01:06:42,613 --> 01:06:48,715
[SPEAKER_24]: What I don't appreciate is the fact that we heard a story that there's a veteran who's going to be homeless

853
01:06:50,387 --> 01:06:52,608
[SPEAKER_24]: and could probably commit suicide.

854
01:06:53,788 --> 01:06:56,409
[SPEAKER_24]: This ring represents 22 kill.

855
01:06:56,489 --> 01:07:04,171
[SPEAKER_24]: For those of you that don't know what it is, it's a ring because it's an organization, a 5013C that represents the 22,

856
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:10,189
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, I'm just very upset.

857
01:07:10,209 --> 01:07:12,429
[SPEAKER_24]: 22 veterans a day that commit suicide.

858
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:18,091
[SPEAKER_24]: And since the Afghanistan issue, it's now up to 26 a day.

859
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:27,274
[SPEAKER_24]: Every day that Michael Durham is not in his office, another veteran stands in this community to commit suicide.

860
01:07:27,834 --> 01:07:30,115
[SPEAKER_24]: I've seen the rules be broken before.

861
01:07:31,015 --> 01:07:44,699
[SPEAKER_24]: On behalf of everybody here who's clapping and wanting to support the veterans of this community, my ex-husband included, I ask you to please suspend the rules and vote tonight to put him back in immediately if it can be done.

862
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:51,982
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

863
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:59,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Just if I could, Mr. President, because when people come up to the council, they think the council has the final say.

864
01:07:59,571 --> 01:08:03,212
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want people, I'm all for open and transparency.

865
01:08:03,592 --> 01:08:06,553
[SPEAKER_18]: When the council votes, it's a recommendation.

866
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:10,514
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor does not have to follow this council's recommendation.

867
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:18,337
[SPEAKER_18]: So just so people know, even if there was an affirmative vote tonight, that doesn't mean Mike will be back tomorrow or the next day.

868
01:08:18,977 --> 01:08:21,278
[SPEAKER_18]: It's up to the city administration and the mayor.

869
01:08:21,618 --> 01:08:21,918
[SPEAKER_18]: So I-

870
01:08:24,405 --> 01:08:26,627
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I just want to be clear.

871
01:08:26,647 --> 01:08:33,792
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want people to leave thinking once we, I don't want people to leave thinking one thing once we take a vote.

872
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:36,514
[SPEAKER_18]: So I like to be open and honest and clear.

873
01:08:36,994 --> 01:08:49,203
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to lay that out there that that's, you know, and the one thing I didn't state in the speech when Mike mentioned about this particular veteran is that he requested not only him, but through his attorney,

874
01:08:50,582 --> 01:08:54,825
[SPEAKER_18]: that that office be staffed immediately in his absence.

875
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:58,467
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was a request of the attorney and also a request of Mike Durham.

876
01:08:58,787 --> 01:09:02,930
[SPEAKER_18]: So whether the city administration falls up on that or has someone there, I don't know.

877
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:13,356
[SPEAKER_18]: There's someone from the administration here tonight that may be able to respond to whether that office is staffed and is accepting concerns from residents.

878
01:09:13,836 --> 01:09:18,539
[SPEAKER_18]: But that may be a good question to ask at this point.

879
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:19,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Please.

880
01:09:22,604 --> 01:09:23,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

881
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:28,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, members of the council, unfortunately, I cannot discuss confidential.

882
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, can you just speak up a little bit?

883
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:31,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I can barely hear.

884
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:31,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

885
01:09:32,994 --> 01:09:36,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I cannot discuss personnel confidential matters.

886
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to ensure the council and the members of the community.

887
01:09:41,643 --> 01:09:43,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Mr. President.

888
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:44,931
[SPEAKER_14]: What information?

889
01:09:45,331 --> 01:09:51,338
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure what's confidential about whether a city office is manned or not.

890
01:09:51,818 --> 01:09:55,843
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know where confidentiality is that office going to be manned or not.

891
01:09:58,245 --> 01:09:59,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

892
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:03,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for redirecting the question.

893
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:07,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the confirmation of the question.

894
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:09,077
[SPEAKER_08]: We are actively working.

895
01:10:09,298 --> 01:10:12,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I have personally actively been working with Ms.

896
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:26,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Darlene White in the veteran's office to ensure that any veteran and every veteran who comes to City Hall for services or needs services in any other way that the city is informed is followed up with in a timely fashion.

897
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:28,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I have spoken with a veteran for the last two or-

898
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:37,324
[SPEAKER_21]: I do believe it's state law that veteran service officers have to be veterans.

899
01:10:38,765 --> 01:10:49,829
[SPEAKER_21]: So, unless the chief of staff is a veteran, the veteran service officer work should be performed by the veteran veteran service officer, a member of the veterans organization.

900
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:56,191
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if I'm correct, and you look at the state law, I believe the state law says that no one can serve as a VSO that's not a veteran.

901
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:58,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

902
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:05,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Through you to Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, I am not acting in the capacity of a veteran service officer.

903
01:11:05,484 --> 01:11:11,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually working with the Veterans Affairs to ensure that we have the work completed.

904
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:15,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I've scheduled a conference call tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.

905
01:11:15,653 --> 01:11:15,813
[SPEAKER_08]: to

906
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:20,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I have scheduled a conference call tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.

907
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:27,268
[SPEAKER_08]: to address questions and ensure that one particular veteran that I've been working with for the last two days, which Ms.

908
01:11:27,308 --> 01:11:38,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Darlene White has been assisting me in working with and ensuring that we get all the veterans benefits that that individual is, you know, certainly entitled to.

909
01:11:39,276 --> 01:11:40,617
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working through the process.

910
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:43,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I am in no way acting as a VSO officer.

911
01:11:43,339 --> 01:11:47,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I am working with the state and going through the proper channels to ensure our veterans are served.

912
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

913
01:11:53,201 --> 01:11:53,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

914
01:11:55,784 --> 01:11:56,524
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

915
01:11:56,564 --> 01:12:03,930
[SPEAKER_26]: So do you have a standing daily call with the state to go through any questions that veterans may have?

916
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:05,832
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, they shouldn't have to wait to get answers.

917
01:12:05,872 --> 01:12:08,193
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, is this a standing daily call that you have?

918
01:12:08,854 --> 01:12:16,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been in contact Monday and Tuesday at this point in time, and I have a scheduled call for tomorrow on the matter.

919
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:17,919
[SPEAKER_26]: What about Thursday and Friday?

920
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:21,101
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, veterans come in, they deserve to get answers in a timely fashion.

921
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:24,664
[SPEAKER_26]: If I knew anything about Michael, he was prompt about everything.

922
01:12:25,225 --> 01:12:28,167
[SPEAKER_26]: Everyone had their questions answered in a timely fashion.

923
01:12:28,187 --> 01:12:31,090
[SPEAKER_26]: There shouldn't be a delay with anything here.

924
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:36,014
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, there needs to be a process set up where people are getting answers and they're getting an ASAP.

925
01:12:36,034 --> 01:12:39,937
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, a lot of these are very sensitive situations that time can't wait.

926
01:12:40,377 --> 01:12:48,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you, Councilor Falco, and I assure you I'm doing everything in my power, I'm dropping other matters to ensure that veterans are number one priority.

927
01:12:49,644 --> 01:12:56,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will certainly ensure that every call that needs to be placed is placed to make that, to keep that promise.

928
01:12:57,009 --> 01:12:59,791
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just as of importance to me as it is to anyone.

929
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:03,594
[SPEAKER_08]: No veteran should go without service and without assistance from the community.

930
01:13:05,856 --> 01:13:06,256
[SPEAKER_26]: Exactly.

931
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:15,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

932
01:13:16,752 --> 01:13:17,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

933
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:23,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

934
01:13:23,553 --> 01:13:24,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

935
01:13:24,794 --> 01:13:27,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Edward Lunningham, 64 Forest Street, Medford.

936
01:13:28,754 --> 01:13:39,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Darlene does a terrific job and qualified, but Mike Durham has special qualifications that he's in that office.

937
01:13:40,057 --> 01:13:42,397
[SPEAKER_02]: He has to be there tomorrow morning.

938
01:13:44,173 --> 01:13:46,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cut it a zoom call.

939
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:52,217
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to have someone in that office tomorrow for veterans that are going to come in that office tomorrow.

940
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:54,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

941
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:01,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

942
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,962
[SPEAKER_20]: John Patrolla, 61 Locust Street.

943
01:14:04,203 --> 01:14:04,503
[SPEAKER_20]: You know,

944
01:14:05,762 --> 01:14:08,445
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been up here before, other issues.

945
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:13,970
[SPEAKER_20]: It's time to just suspend the rules, okay?

946
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:19,315
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the right thing, take a vote, and just go from there.

947
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:22,518
[SPEAKER_20]: But why are we gonna wait a week or a day or 24 hours?

948
01:14:27,387 --> 01:14:37,271
[SPEAKER_21]: because it's a violation of the open meeting law and also to find a vote will be a bad vote the council can get find the council has established rules the rules indicate that you know it just doesn't.

949
01:14:38,152 --> 01:14:40,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Open meeting was whatever it just doesn't make any sense.

950
01:14:41,233 --> 01:14:43,894
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean you got a portion of the law got to play the game by the rules.

951
01:14:43,994 --> 01:14:44,994
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand it just.

952
01:14:49,293 --> 01:14:56,199
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I don't know all the rules, obviously, but the right thing to do is to suspend the rules.

953
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:57,600
[SPEAKER_20]: The rules are suspended.

954
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,322
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't suspend the rules.

955
01:14:59,642 --> 01:15:00,903
[SPEAKER_21]: We're only the Medford City Council.

956
01:15:00,943 --> 01:15:01,644
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't suspend the state law.

957
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,205
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

958
01:15:03,486 --> 01:15:04,727
[SPEAKER_20]: You suspended the rules.

959
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:10,572
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a rule in place that says that you can't bring items under suspension because it's a violation of the open.

960
01:15:10,592 --> 01:15:14,895
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I thought you had a rule in place that we can't bring it up because it's not on the agenda.

961
01:15:15,035 --> 01:15:15,595
[SPEAKER_18]: You can bring it up.

962
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:17,696
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't bring it up.

963
01:15:17,736 --> 01:15:18,717
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we're talking about it.

964
01:15:18,837 --> 01:15:20,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

965
01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:22,739
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can't suspend the rules.

966
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,761
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

967
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:27,502
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't suspend the state law.

968
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,023
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't suspend the state law.

969
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:32,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

970
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:32,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

971
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:33,443
[SPEAKER_21]: That's correct.

972
01:15:33,483 --> 01:15:37,890
[SPEAKER_21]: And it will be on the agenda because we put it on there already tonight.

973
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:39,172
[SPEAKER_21]: One meeting, please.

974
01:15:39,853 --> 01:15:40,915
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could, Mr. President.

975
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:46,729
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what you see is a support of council here, right?

976
01:15:46,769 --> 01:15:47,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

977
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:47,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

978
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:48,730
[SPEAKER_18]: We're taking it out.

979
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:52,751
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to follow with the rules, regulations and state lawyers.

980
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:54,052
[SPEAKER_18]: So we want to follow it.

981
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:56,273
[SPEAKER_18]: We took it up tonight under suspension.

982
01:15:56,293 --> 01:15:58,214
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't on the agenda to discuss it.

983
01:15:58,394 --> 01:15:58,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

984
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:01,435
[SPEAKER_18]: I have no problem voting tonight to be honest with you.

985
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:03,456
[SPEAKER_18]: I have no problem voting tonight.

986
01:16:03,556 --> 01:16:11,080
[SPEAKER_18]: I've done it in the past, but what I'm telling you is if this council voted seven zero stood on our heads and spit nickels in the middle.

987
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:11,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

988
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:22,110
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not to say 7-0 will do that, that this is going to happen tomorrow, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and even next week after we vote.

989
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:26,715
[SPEAKER_18]: All we can do is make an advisory opinion of the mayor.

990
01:16:27,255 --> 01:16:28,196
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all we can do.

991
01:16:29,057 --> 01:16:31,138
[SPEAKER_18]: It has zero teeth to it.

992
01:16:31,578 --> 01:16:38,060
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't mind doing it, but I'm just saying, I don't want people to leave here thinking, ha, the council just voted, we're all set.

993
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:41,101
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not how it works under our government.

994
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:43,001
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to be clear with people.

995
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me.

996
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:58,091
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'd like to speak at the microphone, you're more than welcome to come up.

997
01:16:58,111 --> 01:17:02,473
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you know, the bottom line is we're just looking for a resolution here or whatever it is.

998
01:17:02,553 --> 01:17:05,254
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, so now we have to wait another week.

999
01:17:05,314 --> 01:17:06,695
[SPEAKER_20]: That's, that's the bottom line.

1000
01:17:06,735 --> 01:17:11,476
[SPEAKER_20]: The veterans don't get service and yeah, it's just, it just doesn't make sense.

1001
01:17:11,516 --> 01:17:11,957
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all.

1002
01:17:12,237 --> 01:17:13,397
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand the rules.

1003
01:17:13,957 --> 01:17:14,417
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the law.

1004
01:17:14,437 --> 01:17:15,678
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the rules, it's the law.

1005
01:17:25,651 --> 01:17:26,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1006
01:17:26,131 --> 01:17:27,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1007
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:30,492
[SPEAKER_30]: Darlene white 69.

1008
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:32,372
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a, we have someone up.

1009
01:17:33,133 --> 01:17:33,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me.

1010
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,053
[SPEAKER_14]: We have someone speaking please.

1011
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:38,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Courtesy to the person, the person at the mic.

1012
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:38,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1013
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:40,354
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1014
01:17:40,374 --> 01:17:40,854
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm sorry.

1015
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:44,075
[SPEAKER_30]: Darling white 69 tainted street in Medford.

1016
01:17:45,515 --> 01:17:50,756
[SPEAKER_30]: I am my senior clerk since yesterday.

1017
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:53,637
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't even know what to do in there anymore.

1018
01:17:54,835 --> 01:17:58,876
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not gonna go into the wage theft, because everybody knows what's going on there.

1019
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:06,838
[SPEAKER_30]: As far as the veterans is concerned, there are veterans that are expecting their checks in two weeks.

1020
01:18:09,219 --> 01:18:09,859
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't do it.

1021
01:18:10,879 --> 01:18:11,940
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have the software.

1022
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,061
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have an associate's degree.

1023
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:16,721
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have a license.

1024
01:18:17,521 --> 01:18:19,062
[SPEAKER_30]: I have nothing on my computer.

1025
01:18:20,022 --> 01:18:23,643
[SPEAKER_30]: So eventually, everybody is gonna be getting calls

1026
01:18:24,936 --> 01:18:29,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we please give the people at the podium some courtesy and not speak while they're speaking?

1027
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:30,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1028
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:32,722
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm sorry again, Deleon.

1029
01:18:33,383 --> 01:18:40,408
[SPEAKER_30]: I just don't know what's going to happen in two weeks when these veterans, 33 veterans in the city are waiting for their check.

1030
01:18:41,929 --> 01:18:47,013
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't issue the check and the check does not come from Boston.

1031
01:18:47,493 --> 01:18:49,615
[SPEAKER_30]: The check comes from the city of Medford.

1032
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:52,746
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know what anyone's gonna do.

1033
01:18:53,387 --> 01:18:59,413
[SPEAKER_30]: The best I can do is just forward all calls, all complaints somewhere else.

1034
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:03,177
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have any help.

1035
01:19:04,118 --> 01:19:06,220
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have the knowledge that Mike has.

1036
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:09,864
[SPEAKER_30]: So I don't know what's gonna happen in there.

1037
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:13,187
[SPEAKER_30]: That's it.

1038
01:19:21,127 --> 01:19:21,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1039
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:22,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1040
01:19:22,988 --> 01:19:24,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Sean Keegan, 60th Avenue Road.

1041
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:32,054
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys talk about these state laws, but all of a sudden, there's no veterans, disabled veterans, or nothing on the Medford police list.

1042
01:19:32,694 --> 01:19:40,159
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know what state laws we can't change for the vote, but you guys could change the laws to get veterans on the police list.

1043
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,441
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know who's in charge of completely changing that.

1044
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:44,482
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't hear what you're saying.

1045
01:19:45,022 --> 01:19:48,084
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford police list, there's no veterans or disabled veterans.

1046
01:19:50,205 --> 01:19:50,786
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not Wisconsin.

1047
01:19:50,806 --> 01:19:50,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1048
01:19:52,405 --> 01:19:56,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, but I heard you can't change state laws, but you guys could change the laws for that.

1049
01:19:56,807 --> 01:19:57,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand.

1050
01:19:57,247 --> 01:19:58,448
[SPEAKER_18]: We have nothing to do with that, sir.

1051
01:19:58,688 --> 01:19:59,508
[SPEAKER_13]: So who's in charge of that?

1052
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:00,729
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor, just so you know.

1053
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:04,970
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's great to come up, but you should really know that this is not the body that's done that.

1054
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:05,411
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the mayor.

1055
01:20:05,431 --> 01:20:05,851
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine.

1056
01:20:06,031 --> 01:20:09,032
[SPEAKER_13]: But I understand why the mayor's not here or she's not on the Zoom call.

1057
01:20:09,052 --> 01:20:09,913
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd have to ask the mayor.

1058
01:20:11,693 --> 01:20:13,714
[SPEAKER_18]: She can't be on the Zoom call or nothing?

1059
01:20:13,734 --> 01:20:22,058
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a big matter, so I don't understand why the mayor's not on the Zoom or TV or anywhere like that.

1060
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:27,192
[SPEAKER_13]: shot TTN6 at the end of the road method.

1061
01:20:28,832 --> 01:20:29,252
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

1062
01:20:32,473 --> 01:20:37,574
[SPEAKER_13]: So can we put that on the agenda for next Tuesday and then hopefully the mayor could be here and then we could talk about that?

1063
01:20:38,614 --> 01:20:41,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we're going to put this issue for next Tuesday, absolutely.

1064
01:20:41,034 --> 01:20:42,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you add the police veterans list stuff?

1065
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:45,435
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not our issue, sir.

1066
01:20:45,855 --> 01:20:46,755
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we're trying to tell you.

1067
01:20:47,555 --> 01:20:50,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so can the mayor come next week and then we can figure it out?

1068
01:20:50,036 --> 01:20:50,956
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd have to ask her, sir.

1069
01:20:51,515 --> 01:20:53,078
[SPEAKER_18]: We, we can't demand the mayor to be here.

1070
01:20:53,659 --> 01:20:55,623
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand.

1071
01:20:55,904 --> 01:20:57,006
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't demand she be here.

1072
01:20:57,928 --> 01:20:58,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes no sense.

1073
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:00,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1074
01:21:07,847 --> 01:21:09,588
[SPEAKER_24]: Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street.

1075
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:14,151
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, just because I'm not savvy about this.

1076
01:21:15,052 --> 01:21:25,478
[SPEAKER_24]: If the mayor wants to override all of you for the community, what would be the next course of action for us residents?

1077
01:21:30,501 --> 01:21:30,801
[SPEAKER_24]: Pardon?

1078
01:21:33,546 --> 01:21:36,507
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1079
01:21:37,588 --> 01:21:40,589
[SPEAKER_24]: People forget who pays people's salaries.

1080
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:50,152
[SPEAKER_24]: We, the tax payers, are telling this administration we want Michael Durham back and he deserves to be back.

1081
01:21:50,652 --> 01:21:52,973
[SPEAKER_24]: If the mayor overrides your decision,

1082
01:21:53,764 --> 01:21:54,906
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not our decision to make.

1083
01:21:55,827 --> 01:22:04,740
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand, but what I'm hearing, correct me if I'm wrong, is that you guys are all in favor of Michael.

1084
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,342
[SPEAKER_24]: You like bringing him back.

1085
01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:07,804
[SPEAKER_24]: You want to bring him back.

1086
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:09,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I think he's a great employee, but we're not

1087
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:12,709
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the point.

1088
01:22:12,869 --> 01:22:22,631
[SPEAKER_24]: So my question to you is, does everything stop at the mayor and this is like totalitarian and we have to accept it?

1089
01:22:22,931 --> 01:22:24,031
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I want to know.

1090
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:32,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Or do we have recourse if we, the residents of the community, disagree with the mayor's outcome and we demand

1091
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:36,364
[SPEAKER_24]: a hearing or we demand more?

1092
01:22:36,764 --> 01:22:37,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1093
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:37,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Lister?

1094
01:22:37,905 --> 01:22:38,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1095
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:40,528
[SPEAKER_21]: And the mayor is the appointing authority, right?

1096
01:22:40,568 --> 01:22:46,355
[SPEAKER_21]: So if the employees agree, he has... Okay, so what I'm hearing is this would have to go to court.

1097
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,957
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what it sounded like.

1098
01:22:49,858 --> 01:22:51,540
[SPEAKER_24]: Would it be an issue for a court?

1099
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1100
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:52,641
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1101
01:22:52,962 --> 01:22:53,342
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1102
01:22:53,382 --> 01:22:54,723
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I needed to know.

1103
01:22:54,743 --> 01:22:55,644
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1104
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:00,688
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Bears.

1105
01:23:01,368 --> 01:23:11,218
[SPEAKER_31]: Just on the word totalitarianism was used and I do want to remind everyone here that this is a democracy and the way that you would address this is through an election and we are currently in an election season.

1106
01:23:11,378 --> 01:23:12,720
[SPEAKER_31]: So I just want to put that out there.

1107
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:13,360
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1108
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:14,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1109
01:23:14,401 --> 01:23:14,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1110
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:23,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1111
01:23:23,905 --> 01:23:29,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Where was the mayor Saturday when they had the Krista Campbell motorcycle run?

1112
01:23:29,808 --> 01:23:32,270
[SPEAKER_19]: There were all veterans that were in the motorcycle run.

1113
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Where was the mayor?

1114
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:34,311
[SPEAKER_19]: She never showed up.

1115
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Where was she?

1116
01:23:37,192 --> 01:23:37,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1117
01:23:37,572 --> 01:23:47,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1118
01:23:48,422 --> 01:23:50,964
[SPEAKER_23]: Andrew Castagnetti, East Medford Mass.

1119
01:23:52,805 --> 01:23:55,146
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, consulary Councilors.

1120
01:23:57,447 --> 01:24:04,191
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't want to be political tonight, but as they say, if you don't get involved with politics, we'll get involved with you, I guess.

1121
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:10,455
[SPEAKER_23]: Our veterans should matter more than any other group in our nation.

1122
01:24:10,695 --> 01:24:16,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Because of our soldiers, we still have our republic and our First Amendment rights.

1123
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:19,461
[SPEAKER_23]: to speak our minds here tonight.

1124
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:33,124
[SPEAKER_23]: Imagine if you can, if you walked just a half mile in their boots to experience the hell they went through to keep our United States of America.

1125
01:24:34,624 --> 01:24:38,445
[SPEAKER_23]: When I went to Woodstock, they went into battle.

1126
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:46,786
[SPEAKER_23]: And if I may, I'd like to commend them big time and please do the right thing for duty and humanity.

1127
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:52,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1128
01:24:52,742 --> 01:25:01,406
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion on the floor by Vice President Knight that has been seconded by Councilor Falco and has been amended by Councilor Marks.

1129
01:25:03,186 --> 01:25:07,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, if you could read it back, please, before we take a vote.

1130
01:25:08,508 --> 01:25:14,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight, we had requested the administration reinstate Michael Durham post haste.

1131
01:25:16,107 --> 01:25:24,592
[SPEAKER_16]: and Councilor Marks asked for, he actually said that, wants to find out what's going on regarding the allegations.

1132
01:25:25,513 --> 01:25:29,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Council's received no update and asked that Mike Durham be reinstated.

1133
01:25:29,776 --> 01:25:33,218
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was seconded by Councilor Falco.

1134
01:25:33,438 --> 01:25:37,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1135
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,202
[SPEAKER_14]: If somebody wants to make that, they can make that.

1136
01:25:41,863 --> 01:25:43,384
[SPEAKER_18]: So Mr. President, if I could.

1137
01:25:45,540 --> 01:26:08,032
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, because, uh, from what I'm hearing tonight that, um, from the administration that it sounds like the office is not fully manned, uh, at this particular time, that sounds inadequate to me, Mr. President, and knowing the nature of that office and, uh, who they service in that office, um, I think it's only appropriate that, uh, we have an emergency meeting.

1138
01:26:08,893 --> 01:26:20,186
[SPEAKER_18]: to find out more about the function of that office, if it's going to be fully manned right now, Mr. President, and where our veterans are going to be serviced in the interim.

1139
01:26:21,067 --> 01:26:24,130
[SPEAKER_18]: Because this may carry out a lot longer than we anticipate.

1140
01:26:25,258 --> 01:26:28,479
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think at the very least, we have twofold.

1141
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:35,101
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to get Mike back, but we also want to make sure our veterans are being serviced, Mr. President, in an appropriate manner.

1142
01:26:35,141 --> 01:26:52,365
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would also ask that we have an emergency meeting with the administration to discuss the operations of that office, Mr. President, and that it would include the payroll, which our veterans rely on, as well as any other concerns, Mr. President, that veterans may have.

1143
01:26:54,425 --> 01:26:55,566
[SPEAKER_18]: and approach that office with.

1144
01:26:56,647 --> 01:26:57,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God.

1145
01:26:57,047 --> 01:26:59,008
[SPEAKER_14]: So the earliest we could do that would be on Thursday.

1146
01:27:03,971 --> 01:27:07,774
[SPEAKER_14]: The earliest we could do that under the open meeting will be Friday.

1147
01:27:08,254 --> 01:27:10,395
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll call for an emergency meeting on Friday.

1148
01:27:10,415 --> 01:27:13,577
[SPEAKER_14]: I will take care of that.

1149
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:18,460
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a Friday.

1150
01:27:19,361 --> 01:27:19,781
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President.

1151
01:27:21,364 --> 01:27:22,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1152
01:27:22,144 --> 01:27:22,905
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1153
01:27:22,925 --> 01:27:24,787
[SPEAKER_26]: If I may, uh, who do we want at that meeting?

1154
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:29,672
[SPEAKER_18]: The council and I would ask for the administration, but any, anyone else have suggestions?

1155
01:27:30,272 --> 01:27:30,933
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm open to it.

1156
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:34,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1157
01:27:34,836 --> 01:27:45,947
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, who we haven't at the meeting, the council, the city administration council, the mayor, maybe we'll want to bring in someone from the state, the veterans affairs office from the state.

1158
01:27:48,632 --> 01:27:52,914
[SPEAKER_18]: They may be able to answer questions that we may have as council and I alluded to.

1159
01:27:54,794 --> 01:27:57,716
[SPEAKER_18]: City solicitor city solicitor sure.

1160
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:09,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're making this one was amended and then it would make that as a formal amendment also also on that also on that.

1161
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,042
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's like if you get 3 back the amendments one more time we make sure we're clear.

1162
01:28:17,752 --> 01:28:22,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Mark's request that we find out what's going on regarding the allegations because there's been no update from the administration.

1163
01:28:24,058 --> 01:28:26,440
[SPEAKER_16]: And he further asked that Mike Durham be reinstated.

1164
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:39,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Second amendment is a call for an emergency meeting, I believe on Friday, with representatives of the administration, the Veterans Affairs Office of the state, and the city solicitor.

1165
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:42,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a point of information, Mr. President, if I could.

1166
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:49,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, council council max, uh, an emergency meeting has the same requirements as setting up a regular meeting.

1167
01:28:50,257 --> 01:28:50,998
[SPEAKER_14]: According to the clerk.

1168
01:28:51,038 --> 01:28:51,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it does.

1169
01:28:52,819 --> 01:28:58,945
[SPEAKER_18]: We need, we need, we need 48 hours for emergency meeting requires a 48 hour notice for an emergency.

1170
01:29:00,266 --> 01:29:03,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that I don't agree with just the messenger.

1171
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:05,170
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1172
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:10,275
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's a state requirement that we wait 48 hours when we're having an emergency.

1173
01:29:12,498 --> 01:29:15,339
[SPEAKER_21]: I have the Attorney General's open meeting log guide here.

1174
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:17,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have a different interpretation?

1175
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,882
[SPEAKER_21]: What are the requirements for posting notice of meetings?

1176
01:29:20,282 --> 01:29:24,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Except in cases of emergency, a public body must provide the public with 48 hours notice.

1177
01:29:26,417 --> 01:29:28,938
[SPEAKER_18]: That's, that's my exact thought.

1178
01:29:29,158 --> 01:29:33,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we can meet an emergency at any given time, Mr. President.

1179
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:38,682
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would ask if we can set up an emergency meeting, uh, you know, we'd like to have all the parties there.

1180
01:29:38,722 --> 01:29:40,602
[SPEAKER_18]: So tomorrow or Thursday.

1181
01:29:40,702 --> 01:29:41,363
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1182
01:29:41,503 --> 01:29:41,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

1183
01:29:49,828 --> 01:29:50,228
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1184
01:29:50,368 --> 01:29:53,629
[SPEAKER_26]: And if I may, can we also have Darlene come to the meeting as well?

1185
01:29:54,089 --> 01:29:55,629
[SPEAKER_26]: She knows what's going on in the office.

1186
01:29:55,649 --> 01:29:57,570
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's fitting that she's here.

1187
01:29:58,090 --> 01:29:59,450
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1188
01:30:00,411 --> 01:30:10,493
[SPEAKER_31]: I just, I'm wondering what the definite, you know, this legal definition of an emergency is, because I do not want our actions to be challenged going forward if this meeting doesn't have appropriate notice.

1189
01:30:11,222 --> 01:30:13,964
[SPEAKER_31]: I think what we all want here is a resolution to happen.

1190
01:30:14,644 --> 01:30:20,508
[SPEAKER_31]: If we don't notice the meeting and someone says that's not the right definition of emergency, then what we do may not have any effect.

1191
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:27,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I will reach out to the city solicitor first thing in the morning when she gets in and to get it, make sure that we are in compliance with everything.

1192
01:30:27,476 --> 01:30:27,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1193
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:38,881
[SPEAKER_18]: So just, just for the record, Mr. President, if we can state, uh, the emergency is, uh, that the fact that that office, in my opinion, uh, is not properly manned and creates an emergency.

1194
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:49,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondly, that we know from the director himself, that there was someone coming in this week that had some potential potential issues, um, that could rise to an emergency level.

1195
01:30:50,046 --> 01:30:55,008
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's just one of probably many, many that we're, we, that we don't know of Mr. President.

1196
01:30:55,028 --> 01:30:56,169
[SPEAKER_18]: So in my opinion,

1197
01:30:56,749 --> 01:30:59,491
[SPEAKER_18]: That definitely is an emergency.

1198
01:30:59,591 --> 01:31:07,197
[SPEAKER_14]: I will reach out to the solicitor at nine o'clock tomorrow morning and get an opinion, and I will get it right back to everybody on the council.

1199
01:31:07,437 --> 01:31:08,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1200
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:09,638
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as she gets it to me.

1201
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:10,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1202
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:22,808
[SPEAKER_14]: So, on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Marks on twice or three times.

1203
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:25,745

01:31:25,885 --> 01:31:25,965

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1207
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:56,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1208
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the information ready for the council with regard to matter 21548.

1209
01:31:58,981 --> 01:32:00,522
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got to take it off the table.

1210
01:32:21,652 --> 01:32:25,796
[SPEAKER_31]: I would move to take it off the table once public participation is concluded.

1211
01:32:25,816 --> 01:32:32,642
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Councilor Bears to take 2-1-548 off the table, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1212
01:32:32,862 --> 01:32:33,563
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1213
01:32:34,003 --> 01:32:34,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1214
01:32:34,464 --> 01:32:34,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1215
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:35,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1216

[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-548.

1217
01:32:36,646 --> 01:32:41,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your opportunity to come.

1218
01:32:42,031 --> 01:32:45,614
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to talk, just wait one second, let them get out of the room so we can talk.

1219
01:33:02,284 --> 01:33:02,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1220
01:33:02,584 --> 01:33:02,944
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1221
01:33:03,164 --> 01:33:04,205
[SPEAKER_08]: No, thank you very much.

1222
01:33:04,265 --> 01:33:07,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank the council for the opportunity to come back to discuss this matter.

1223
01:33:09,127 --> 01:33:18,211
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the first questions vice president night that you had asked was whether or not these positions were currently in the calf, um, in their current calves that they are being presented as.

1224
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:19,532
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer to that is yes.

1225
01:33:20,913 --> 01:33:25,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, so, um, yes, we're looking at assistant purchasing agent CAF 11,

1226
01:33:26,118 --> 01:33:26,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

1227
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:33,383
[SPEAKER_21]: And that compensation rate is the existing compensation rate for the incumbent in the position of the incumbent that was in the position before it became vacant?

1228
01:33:33,543 --> 01:33:34,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. Vice President.

1229
01:33:34,584 --> 01:33:36,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, and that goes the same for the land use planner?

1230
01:33:37,146 --> 01:33:37,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

1231
01:33:37,686 --> 01:33:41,469
[SPEAKER_21]: The MCM station manager and the MCM production coordinator?

1232
01:33:41,489 --> 01:33:41,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

1233
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:42,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1234
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:42,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1235
01:33:44,091 --> 01:33:50,596
[SPEAKER_08]: The other question that was asked from Councilor Falco was the ranges of these positions.

1236
01:33:51,997 --> 01:33:56,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I can provide them either a weekly salary or an annualized salary, which do you prefer?

1237
01:33:59,559 --> 01:34:00,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1238
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:06,682
[SPEAKER_08]: The assistant purchasing agent, CAF 11, is a range between $63,544 annualized to $75,680 annualized.

1239
01:34:06,722 --> 01:34:08,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm rounding up here on the dollar.

1240
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:25,302
[SPEAKER_08]: The Land Use Planner, CAF 12, annualized is a range between $68,254 to $79,766.

1241
01:34:25,342 --> 01:34:26,582
[SPEAKER_08]: MCM Station Manager, CAF 13, annualized $73,430 to $87,444.

1242
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:59,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, MCM production coordinator, CAF3, annualized $47,698 to $52,356.

1243
01:35:00,498 --> 01:35:19,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And confirming that I will follow up on the question by Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell, in particular, with regard to other positions that we have currently posted, Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell, to ensure that we have the ranges on future agendas.

1244
01:35:20,777 --> 01:35:24,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1245
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:25,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone satisfied with their questions?

1246
01:35:27,601 --> 01:35:32,724
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Knight, are there any employees being compensated outside of their CAF?

1247
01:35:34,885 --> 01:35:36,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I am unable to answer that question at this time.

1248
01:35:36,927 --> 01:35:40,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I would need to review the information that I'm reviewing for Councilor Bears to answer that question.

1249
01:35:40,769 --> 01:35:41,449
[SPEAKER_31]: Appreciate it.

1250
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,251
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion to approve, Mr. President.

1251
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:45,152
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1252
01:35:45,212 --> 01:35:45,832
[SPEAKER_31]: Any further discussion?

1253
01:35:46,683 --> 01:35:50,506
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion to approve by Councilor Bears, second.

1254
01:35:51,827 --> 01:35:53,128
[SPEAKER_14]: To take the first reading, that's correct.

1255
01:35:54,088 --> 01:35:59,772
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morocco, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1256
01:36:01,313 --> 01:36:06,657
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Falco.

1257
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:08,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Is this what's currently reflected in the budget?

1258
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:09,419
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, these numbers

1259
01:36:15,115 --> 01:36:17,456
[SPEAKER_08]: These numbers would be currently reflected in the budget, yes.

1260
01:36:17,536 --> 01:36:27,520
[SPEAKER_26]: If I look at the budget tonight when I go home, I'll be able to see that the assistant, the actually MCM station manager, that number should fall somewhere in that range.

1261
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:36,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not sure you're going to actually see them because they may be consolidated with other department salaries, but they would be within the number that's presented.

1262
01:36:37,004 --> 01:36:40,505
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's only one employee in the department, which I do not believe is the case for any of these,

1263
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:49,605
[SPEAKER_08]: We can certainly find that information and pull up that information through the auditing office, but I don't know if you're going to see it line by line in the budget.

1264
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:52,807
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to make sure it's reflected properly in the budget.

1265
01:36:52,927 --> 01:36:53,727
[SPEAKER_26]: It is.

1266
01:36:53,747 --> 01:36:53,847
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1267
01:36:53,867 --> 01:36:54,548
[SPEAKER_26]: So you're saying it is?

1268
01:36:54,748 --> 01:36:55,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1269
01:36:55,288 --> 01:36:55,588
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1270
01:36:56,949 --> 01:36:57,349
Thank you.

1271
01:36:57,429 --> 01:36:58,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1272
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:00,111
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion on the floor.

1273
01:37:00,631 --> 01:37:02,452
[SPEAKER_14]: The Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morell.

1274
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:03,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion?

1275
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:09,957
[SPEAKER_14]: So for this to take its first reading, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1276
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:11,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears?

1277
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:11,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1278
01:37:12,641 --> 01:37:13,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco?

1279
01:37:13,361 --> 01:37:13,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1280
01:37:14,422 --> 01:37:15,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Knight?

1281
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:15,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1282
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:16,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks?

1283
01:37:16,803 --> 01:37:17,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1284
01:37:17,744 --> 01:37:18,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell?

1285
01:37:18,444 --> 01:37:18,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1286
01:37:19,164 --> 01:37:20,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

1287
01:37:20,405 --> 01:37:21,105
[SPEAKER_16]: President Caraviello?

1288
01:37:21,386 --> 01:37:21,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1289
01:37:21,846 --> 01:37:22,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Six in the affirmative.

1290
01:37:22,986 --> 01:37:23,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1291
01:37:24,147 --> 01:37:25,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for coming up.

1292
01:37:28,049 --> 01:37:29,710
[SPEAKER_14]: While we're on suspension, Councilor Falco.

1293
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:30,310
[SPEAKER_26]: Can we take 21543? 21543.

1294
01:37:39,233 --> 01:37:42,355
[SPEAKER_26]: It's on page seven.

1295
01:37:42,375 --> 01:38:02,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Well on suspension, 21543 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the traffic engineer recommend safety improvements to the intersection of Carding, West and North Street in the interest of public safety.

1296
01:38:03,566 --> 01:38:04,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1297
01:38:08,835 --> 01:38:09,556
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1298
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:12,759
[SPEAKER_26]: I've had a number of neighbors contact me about this issue.

1299
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:18,045
[SPEAKER_26]: They might actually be online tonight, and we have a resident here as well that would like to speak on this.

1300
01:38:18,905 --> 01:38:25,692
[SPEAKER_26]: And in that intersection of Cotting, West, North, and Auburn, there are a number of issues going on there with

1301
01:38:26,373 --> 01:38:32,719
[SPEAKER_26]: people coming down Cotting Street the wrong way, speeding, the lack of crosswalks in the area.

1302
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:33,861
[SPEAKER_26]: So there are a number of issues.

1303
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:38,826
[SPEAKER_26]: I've also received it and I believe everybody on this council has received an email as well that I'll read.

1304
01:38:40,614 --> 01:38:43,716
[SPEAKER_26]: just now so everybody can hear about the issues.

1305
01:38:44,716 --> 01:38:46,677
[SPEAKER_26]: This here is from people that live in the neighborhood.

1306
01:38:46,797 --> 01:38:57,082
[SPEAKER_26]: So dear city council members, I am writing with the support of 28 neighbors to respectfully ask that the resolution 21-543 that Councilor Falco added to the agenda tonight.

1307
01:38:57,602 --> 01:39:04,569
[SPEAKER_26]: regarding a traffic study at the intersection of Auburn, West, North, and Cotting Streets be approved and moved forward rapidly.

1308
01:39:05,169 --> 01:39:11,696
[SPEAKER_26]: Ideally also for the bridge just up the street where Mystic Valley Parkway crosses the river and intersects with Auburn.

1309
01:39:12,336 --> 01:39:22,245
[SPEAKER_26]: Because of the way Cotting, North, West, and Auburn intersect, it is often impossible for drivers coming up one street to have a clear view of the oncoming cars from other directions.

1310
01:39:22,926 --> 01:39:32,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Most cars do not come to a full stop at the stop signs, but even if one does, one's view is frequently blocked by either a parked car or just the angle at which the roads intersect.

1311
01:39:34,505 --> 01:39:37,330
[SPEAKER_26]: An example is turning left onto North Street from Cotting.

1312
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:44,513
[SPEAKER_26]: It is not a simple four-way stop with two perpendicular streets and requires additional support to be made safe.

1313
01:39:45,053 --> 01:39:53,358
[SPEAKER_26]: No speed bumps are in place to force people to slow down or discourage driving up one-way streets the wrong way.

1314
01:39:54,198 --> 01:40:01,562
[SPEAKER_26]: There are not sufficient curb cuts for strollers and wheelchairs, and most importantly, there is no kind of crosswalk in any direction.

1315
01:40:02,522 --> 01:40:07,665
[SPEAKER_26]: Cars frequently drive up both Cotting and West the wrong way, despite the signage.

1316
01:40:08,365 --> 01:40:12,828
[SPEAKER_26]: This person refers to when her husband in her

1317
01:40:14,165 --> 01:40:32,664
[SPEAKER_26]: and politely stopped, asked drivers to turn around, that this is dangerous for many of the kids that ride bikes and scooters in the neighborhood, that they're going down the wrong way, they get yelled obscenities, and there's a lot of unfortunate back and forth between the neighbors or the people that are just driving down the wrong way.

1318
01:40:34,162 --> 01:40:38,245
[SPEAKER_26]: Parents with kids often discuss how dangerous the street is when we meet at Cummings Park.

1319
01:40:39,105 --> 01:40:44,268
[SPEAKER_26]: Crossing these streets with my two children in a stroller feels incredibly dangerous.

1320
01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:51,973
[SPEAKER_26]: One has to be hypervigilant, constantly looking in multiple directions to make sure a car can see us and won't zoom across and hit us.

1321
01:40:52,573 --> 01:40:55,974
[SPEAKER_26]: The bridge where Mystic Valley Parkway crosses the Mystic River is equally concerning.

1322
01:40:56,534 --> 01:41:01,375
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently, there is debris from a recent accident scattered across the pedestrians' sidewalk.

1323
01:41:01,776 --> 01:41:05,036
[SPEAKER_26]: And once again, the guide rail has been severely damaged in a crash.

1324
01:41:05,657 --> 01:41:10,078
[SPEAKER_26]: It seems like these crashes occur every few weeks, making

1325
01:41:10,598 --> 01:41:15,459
[SPEAKER_26]: making me wonder what factors are making that turn especially dangerous.

1326
01:41:15,859 --> 01:41:18,720
[SPEAKER_26]: Lighting, speed, something else, and how can they be addressed?

1327
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:29,823
[SPEAKER_26]: Aside from the risks to pedestrians and drivers, these crashes must be costing the city significantly in repairs every time the guide rail gets fixed and a crew must come out to ideally clean up.

1328
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:36,262
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm including here multiple concerned neighbors who live in the area and cross these intersections frequently.

1329
01:41:36,742 --> 01:41:39,943
[SPEAKER_26]: As we are hopeful, a comprehensive plan can be taken up.

1330
01:41:40,644 --> 01:41:42,705
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your help and attention to this matter.

1331
01:41:43,105 --> 01:41:49,227
[SPEAKER_26]: Gratefully, Sophie Ricks, and she lives on Cotting Street, so she's experiencing this on a daily basis.

1332
01:41:49,807 --> 01:41:53,849
[SPEAKER_26]: And then there's also a list of 25 neighbors on the surrounding streets, Cotting,

1333
01:41:55,009 --> 01:41:59,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Auburn, Northwest, Winter Street, Martin Street.

1334
01:41:59,392 --> 01:42:02,614
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's a lot of neighbors here that are concerned about this.

1335
01:42:02,654 --> 01:42:09,519
[SPEAKER_26]: This has become a very dangerous area to get around as a pedestrian, as a cyclist, and as a motorist.

1336
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:18,005
[SPEAKER_26]: So what I'm recommending is that we, I believe it worked last time and I think it can work again, and that is actually an onsite committee, the whole meeting.

1337
01:42:18,908 --> 01:42:20,710
[SPEAKER_26]: We did that back last year.

1338
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:21,991
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it was very successful.

1339
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:24,613
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, as Councilors, we actually all went to the site.

1340
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:27,095
[SPEAKER_26]: We were there with the traffic engineer.

1341
01:42:27,595 --> 01:42:29,717
[SPEAKER_26]: We talked about the various issues with the neighbors.

1342
01:42:30,598 --> 01:42:31,799
[SPEAKER_26]: They're there every day.

1343
01:42:32,039 --> 01:42:37,624
[SPEAKER_26]: They experience this every day, and these are major quality of life issues that need to be addressed.

1344
01:42:38,284 --> 01:42:42,388
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would ask, Mr. President, if you could set up a committee of the whole sooner than later.

1345
01:42:44,059 --> 01:42:44,619
[SPEAKER_14]: On-site?

1346
01:42:45,059 --> 01:42:45,479
[SPEAKER_26]: On-site.

1347
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,120
[SPEAKER_26]: On-site committee of the whole meeting.

1348
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Saturday morning, just like we did in the past?

1349
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:49,961
[SPEAKER_26]: That works for me.

1350
01:42:50,301 --> 01:42:57,243
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that, I feel like when we did that last time, we really addressed, we addressed a multitude of issues in the neighborhood that we went to.

1351
01:42:57,263 --> 01:43:01,484
[SPEAKER_26]: I feel like, you know, we worked together really well on that with the traffic engineer.

1352
01:43:01,844 --> 01:43:03,544
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think we can do the same thing down here.

1353
01:43:03,704 --> 01:43:04,845
[SPEAKER_26]: Get everybody on the same page.

1354
01:43:04,885 --> 01:43:10,966
[SPEAKER_26]: If we could have it at the intersection of Auburn, North Cotting and West, that would be ideal.

1355
01:43:10,986 --> 01:43:13,327
[SPEAKER_26]: There's many, there are many issues that need to be addressed.

1356
01:43:14,009 --> 01:43:17,990
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, I would ask that we have, if you could please schedule that community hall meeting.

1357
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:20,110
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know there was a neighbor that would like to speak as well.

1358
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:22,270
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd love to, we'd love to hear from you.

1359
01:43:22,891 --> 01:43:23,131
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1360
01:43:23,211 --> 01:43:25,171
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm Mariana Ducey, 2 North Street.

1361
01:43:25,891 --> 01:43:28,452
[SPEAKER_25]: I live right at this intersection.

1362
01:43:28,772 --> 01:43:30,512
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been there for 64 years.

1363
01:43:30,552 --> 01:43:31,432
[SPEAKER_25]: So I've seen it all.

1364
01:43:32,412 --> 01:43:37,713
[SPEAKER_25]: I would suggest if you're going to have a meeting of the whole meeting in that vicinity, you don't do it on Saturday.

1365
01:43:37,793 --> 01:43:42,114
[SPEAKER_25]: You do it on Monday to Friday, because that's when a lot of the traffic comes through there.

1366
01:43:43,348 --> 01:43:52,133
[SPEAKER_25]: The reason the traffic comes through there at this speed and so forth is because West Street and North Street are parallel to Route 16.

1367
01:43:53,353 --> 01:43:59,296
[SPEAKER_25]: So if Route 16 is backed up, people with their GPSs take a detour.

1368
01:43:59,557 --> 01:44:01,278
[SPEAKER_25]: They come off of Route 16.

1369
01:44:03,436 --> 01:44:04,757
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, 93 is behind you.

1370
01:44:04,777 --> 01:44:19,785
[SPEAKER_25]: So they're coming off of Route 16, they take a left on Winter Street, a right on West Street, and they go zooming up all the way to the end of West Street, all the way to the end of North Street, to Broadway and Somerville, and they get back on Route 16 in Somerville.

1371
01:44:20,245 --> 01:44:25,068
[SPEAKER_25]: So they avoid about a mile and a half of Route 16 at a very congested time.

1372
01:44:26,269 --> 01:44:31,252
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, it's funny that this, I'm here tonight because I only learned last night

1373
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:37,229
[SPEAKER_25]: very late that this was on the agenda for today, because I was in the process of writing a letter myself.

1374
01:44:39,811 --> 01:44:51,700
[SPEAKER_25]: About two years ago, I asked Councilor Scarpelli if he could put flashing stop signs on all four of these corners to try to slow the traffic down.

1375
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,582
[SPEAKER_25]: They ran out of money, so he gave me two.

1376
01:44:53,602 --> 01:45:01,508
[SPEAKER_25]: He put one at the end of West Street and one at the end of Auburn Street, where it intersects with North Street.

1377
01:45:02,695 --> 01:45:05,217
[SPEAKER_25]: We really need them on the other corners also.

1378
01:45:06,178 --> 01:45:08,760
[SPEAKER_25]: The flashing stop signs have slowed the traffic.

1379
01:45:09,281 --> 01:45:15,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Some people come to a full stop, but some slow, but the slow is good because they're not speeding all the way through.

1380
01:45:17,048 --> 01:45:32,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, the other thing I think we need, as you've mentioned, is the crosswalks, the painted crosswalks that connect the handicap ramps there at all these corners, but they're not connected with a crosswalk.

1381
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:41,240
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that would be good, especially in the winter, because what happens with the snowplow drivers, they bank the snow on the corners in the handicapped walks.

1382
01:45:42,021 --> 01:45:44,162
[SPEAKER_25]: In my case, I have to shovel mine out.

1383
01:45:44,922 --> 01:45:47,784
[SPEAKER_25]: because they can't see where the handicapped spot is.

1384
01:45:49,225 --> 01:45:53,869
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, we've got a lot of cars that new residents have been in.

1385
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:59,193
[SPEAKER_25]: They're parking on some of the handicapped sidewalks because they blocked the handicapped.

1386
01:45:59,553 --> 01:46:01,235
[SPEAKER_25]: I had one parking there for two weeks.

1387
01:46:01,715 --> 01:46:04,998
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to put a sign on the window to let them know that this is a handicapped spot.

1388
01:46:05,078 --> 01:46:05,999
[SPEAKER_25]: Please move your car.

1389
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:07,059
[SPEAKER_25]: They finally did.

1390
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:17,223
[SPEAKER_25]: But I don't know about speed bumps because this is a very busy area because a lot of cars go to Whole Foods.

1391
01:46:18,143 --> 01:46:20,684
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of cars come off, as I said, Route 16.

1392
01:46:21,504 --> 01:46:27,005
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of people use the North Street Bridge, both delivery trucks and so forth.

1393
01:46:27,025 --> 01:46:28,366
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's a very busy area.

1394
01:46:28,786 --> 01:46:33,087
[SPEAKER_25]: But what I've done is I've done a map of what I was going to present tonight.

1395
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:35,468
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, it's part of one of my

1396
01:46:36,852 --> 01:46:45,760
[SPEAKER_25]: letter that I haven't finished writing yet, but I've put where I think that the flashing stop signs are, where I think the crosswalk should be.

1397
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:53,126
[SPEAKER_25]: The North Street, the West Street and the Cotting Street are one way and the other two streets are two way.

1398
01:46:55,973 --> 01:47:04,219
[SPEAKER_25]: As far as the visual part of it, if you're coming up Cline Street, you can see the cars to the West Street because there's Leahy Square there.

1399
01:47:04,279 --> 01:47:08,061
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a triangular square with a monument there.

1400
01:47:08,462 --> 01:47:12,404
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's not like your visibility is blocked and you can't see who's coming up there.

1401
01:47:12,744 --> 01:47:14,586
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know if a speed bump would be there.

1402
01:47:15,606 --> 01:47:21,811
[SPEAKER_25]: But generally what happens is if somebody's coming off of Route 16 or coming down North Street and they wanna continue,

1403
01:47:22,351 --> 01:47:26,753
[SPEAKER_25]: and they start down either west or cotton, and then they realize it's one way.

1404
01:47:27,173 --> 01:47:31,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Instead of stopping and turn around, they speed to the end to try to get off the road quickly.

1405
01:47:32,055 --> 01:47:39,459
[SPEAKER_25]: As I've seen, talked to people down at the other end, where they intersect with Winthrop Street, and they say, these cars come speeding down here.

1406
01:47:39,879 --> 01:47:43,481
[SPEAKER_25]: I said, yeah, because they figure out it's the wrong way and they just want to get off it quickly.

1407
01:47:46,244 --> 01:47:47,026
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, this is funny.

1408
01:47:47,386 --> 01:47:50,711
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got a new neighbor that moved into 1 North Street three months ago.

1409
01:47:51,112 --> 01:47:52,414
[SPEAKER_25]: He happens to work for the city.

1410
01:47:53,622 --> 01:47:57,123
[SPEAKER_25]: He works in the park departments, and they were just renovating Carding Street Park.

1411
01:47:57,683 --> 01:48:13,388
[SPEAKER_25]: So he probably has talked to some of these residents because he came back and told me, he said, I'm going to speak to my supervisor, he says, about all that we've seen here, the lack of crosswalks and the cars speeding by and so forth.

1412
01:48:13,428 --> 01:48:15,029
[SPEAKER_25]: So maybe some of this

1413
01:48:16,251 --> 01:48:30,029
[SPEAKER_25]: that you've heard from the residents is because he's been working in the Cotting Street Park, and if some of these residents have been there and commensurate with him because he's a city employee thinking maybe that he could help with the situation, maybe this is why this issue has come to bear right now.

1414
01:48:32,387 --> 01:48:35,429
[SPEAKER_25]: But anyway, I have a map.

1415
01:48:35,689 --> 01:48:37,850
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're interested in the map, you can have the map.

1416
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:49,577
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would suggest that if you're going to have any site inspection, not a Saturday, because it's not as busy on a Saturday, but it's much, much busier on a Monday to Friday.

1417
01:48:50,077 --> 01:48:58,282
[SPEAKER_26]: We usually do Saturday, because that's when most of the neighbors usually can come to something like that, and everybody can give their input.

1418
01:48:59,273 --> 01:49:01,335
[SPEAKER_25]: That's usually why we do this Saturday morning.

1419
01:49:01,355 --> 01:49:10,845
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, it's the traffic stats around when when the rush hour traffic stats around 715 in the morning is when I start seeing the traffic going whizzing by my house.

1420
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:13,594
[SPEAKER_25]: There it is.

1421
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:14,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1422
01:49:14,995 --> 01:49:16,257
[SPEAKER_21]: What information vice president night?

1423
01:49:16,757 --> 01:49:18,780
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't want to get run over while we're out there either.

1424
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:28,692
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I've lived there 64 years and another thing, uh, even though these cars go by, there hasn't been an accident there.

1425
01:49:29,613 --> 01:49:32,116
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I mean, people might be afraid that there's going to be an accident.

1426
01:49:34,132 --> 01:49:42,841
[SPEAKER_25]: It's probably been 35 years since I've seen an accident there, and that was somebody who came down over the North Street Bridge and lost their brakes and went right into a tree.

1427
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:48,746
[SPEAKER_25]: So as far as a crash or anybody getting injured, there hasn't been any.

1428
01:49:48,987 --> 01:49:50,708
[SPEAKER_25]: Close calls maybe, but no injuries.

1429
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:52,930
[SPEAKER_25]: So there it is.

1430
01:49:53,151 --> 01:49:53,451
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1431
01:49:53,551 --> 01:49:54,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Any other questions?

1432
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:58,414
[SPEAKER_25]: And I mean, I'd be available when you come for your site visit.

1433
01:49:58,434 --> 01:50:00,817
[SPEAKER_25]: I can point out all the issues.

1434
01:50:01,238 --> 01:50:03,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, the clerk didn't get your name and address.

1435
01:50:03,801 --> 01:50:06,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street.

1436
01:50:06,344 --> 01:50:08,226
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's on the paper here that I'm going to give you.

1437
01:50:08,606 --> 01:50:08,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1438
01:50:09,327 --> 01:50:09,668
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1439
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:12,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mary.

1440
01:50:13,652 --> 01:50:15,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco.

1441
01:50:16,904 --> 01:50:19,526
[SPEAKER_14]: That we have a committee of the whole meeting on a Saturday morning.

1442
01:50:20,227 --> 01:50:25,771
[SPEAKER_14]: I will reach out to the traffic engineer tomorrow when I'm doing the other thing.

1443
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:39,404
[SPEAKER_31]: I certainly support Council Faco's motion, and I just want to make the point that I think this intersection, A, it's still set up for two-way traffic.

1444
01:50:39,825 --> 01:50:42,106
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a, you know, West Street used to be a two-way street.

1445
01:50:42,266 --> 01:50:44,107
[SPEAKER_31]: It's still organized in that way.

1446
01:50:44,567 --> 01:50:49,610
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just think it's a great example of where you have very wide roads and very

1447
01:50:51,099 --> 01:50:53,240
[SPEAKER_31]: poorly designed approaches on each street.

1448
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,121
[SPEAKER_31]: I think you could create a lot of public space there.

1449
01:50:55,161 --> 01:50:56,721
[SPEAKER_31]: You could have benches, you could have grass.

1450
01:50:56,781 --> 01:51:00,323
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a ton of space at that intersection that doesn't need to be used by cars.

1451
01:51:00,403 --> 01:51:01,983
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that would make it a lot safer.

1452
01:51:03,024 --> 01:51:03,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1453
01:51:04,585 --> 01:51:05,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1454
01:51:06,865 --> 01:51:17,670
[SPEAKER_26]: Interesting area because there is actually like a small island between those two streets that you really, there's a cut through that can't really be used anymore.

1455
01:51:19,610 --> 01:51:38,250
[SPEAKER_25]: exactly so there's an opportunity to do a lot there mr president packing on one side correct so you really can't create too many i don't know too many shrubbery or grassy areas there so um

1456
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:47,915
[SPEAKER_25]: But you are right, there's an island there, which is, your visibility is clear because you can see traffic coming up West Street.

1457
01:51:48,395 --> 01:52:00,962
[SPEAKER_25]: And as far as the big wide intersection, when people come up Carding Street to maybe make a left turn onto North Street, it's a big, the intersection is big, so you can take a wide swing.

1458
01:52:01,082 --> 01:52:03,584
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's not like you're gonna hit somebody.

1459
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:07,306
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think the painted crosswalks

1460
01:52:07,951 --> 01:52:11,173
[SPEAKER_25]: might alert people that there's a stall here, you know?

1461
01:52:12,194 --> 01:52:18,418
[SPEAKER_25]: So I even said if they could give me a bucket of paint and a paintbrush and a stencil, I'd do it myself, you know?

1462
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:20,699
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see if we can get the city to do it first.

1463
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,921
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1464
01:52:23,061 --> 01:52:26,183
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, if I may, is there anyone on the call?

1465
01:52:26,203 --> 01:52:28,385
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you see if there's anyone on the call that may want to speak on this?

1466
01:52:28,445 --> 01:52:30,926
[SPEAKER_26]: I know there were some people, I think, that were going to log in.

1467
01:52:36,691 --> 01:52:37,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, do you see anyone's hand up?

1468
01:52:43,793 --> 01:52:52,075
[SPEAKER_14]: I see two hands, I just gotta find the hands.

1469
01:52:57,376 --> 01:53:03,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, do you see the hands?

1470
01:53:12,132 --> 01:53:14,574
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I think Joe Sullivan is as one of the hands.

1471
01:53:17,216 --> 01:53:18,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I can hear me.

1472
01:53:18,797 --> 01:53:24,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's like let me find you with Jennifer where I okay with this we have so few Jennifer.

1473
01:53:24,302 --> 01:53:28,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you I'm just saying thank you to all of you for taking this seriously.

1474
01:53:28,605 --> 01:53:38,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate Mary sorry I didn't get a chance to let you know directly about this because I didn't run into on the street, but I'm glad you're there.

1475
01:53:39,082 --> 01:53:43,544
[SPEAKER_03]: representing us as well and I will look forward to being there on the Saturday morning whenever it happens.

1476
01:53:45,205 --> 01:53:47,105
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could we get your name and address of the record please.

1477
01:53:47,665 --> 01:53:49,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're at 78 Conning Street.

1478
01:53:50,607 --> 01:53:51,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1479
01:53:52,187 --> 01:53:53,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1480
01:53:55,549 --> 01:53:57,329
[SPEAKER_14]: And do we have any of the hands up.

1481
01:53:57,349 --> 01:54:04,612
[SPEAKER_14]: And the worst man okay.

1482
01:54:04,632 --> 01:54:08,314
[SPEAKER_14]: And address of the race.

1483
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:11,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Miranda Briceño to Taylor Street.

1484
01:54:12,851 --> 01:54:19,392
[SPEAKER_28]: I live near the intersection as well and just wanted to reiterate the safety concerns, especially in my professional opinion as a planner.

1485
01:54:20,772 --> 01:54:35,554
[SPEAKER_28]: I can tell that this intersection could definitely use some traffic calming and traffic calming that could be installed and done temporarily and quickly with paint overnight in the interim to address safety concerns.

1486
01:54:35,914 --> 01:54:36,254
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1487
01:54:37,595 --> 01:54:38,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1488
01:54:38,975 --> 01:54:39,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Rebecca.

1489
01:54:39,913 --> 01:54:41,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Have your hand up.

1490
01:54:42,037 --> 01:54:42,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Rebecca?

1491
01:54:45,322 --> 01:54:45,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Rebecca?

1492
01:54:47,706 --> 01:54:48,748
[SPEAKER_14]: One second, let's get you unmuted.

1493
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:51,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Rebecca, name and address of the record, please.

1494
01:54:54,109 --> 01:54:54,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1495
01:54:54,449 --> 01:54:57,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Rebecca Davidson, 63 West Street.

1496
01:54:58,652 --> 01:55:04,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I live very close to the intersection and just want to reiterate some of the safety concerns that have been raised.

1497
01:55:05,457 --> 01:55:14,343
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a challenge because on that Auburn Street, if you were to continue down, there's no sidewalk on one side.

1498
01:55:14,503 --> 01:55:22,829
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's super important to have a safe way to cross the street so that you can continue to use the sidewalk safely on the other side.

1499
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:35,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate, as Sophie said, taking this concern seriously and look forward to be a part of any future discussions around this intersection.

1500
01:55:35,457 --> 01:55:35,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1501
01:55:35,858 --> 01:55:37,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1502
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:39,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody else want to speak on this?

1503
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:41,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

1504
01:55:44,163 --> 01:55:52,228
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for putting this on the agenda, and I want to thank the neighbors for participating tonight.

1505
01:55:53,429 --> 01:55:59,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Mary Ann, every time I see you, you're always there advocating on behalf of the residents of this community.

1506
01:56:00,313 --> 01:56:08,397
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, it's not just for speeding, the Green Line extension, 5G, plane noise.

1507
01:56:09,238 --> 01:56:12,840
[SPEAKER_18]: You've been a great advocate for this community, and I want to thank you for taking the time

1508
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:13,861
[SPEAKER_18]: coming up.

1509
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:25,848
[SPEAKER_18]: One speaker, Mr. President, Sophie, just mentioned, and I agree a thousand percent, to take some temporary quick steps in order to alleviate some of the concerns.

1510
01:56:26,369 --> 01:56:36,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Because all too often when we request a traffic report or study, to be quite honest with you, they take forever, and then once you get them, they're never acted upon.

1511
01:56:37,316 --> 01:57:02,849
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think at least for now, to let the residents know that we're moving on something like we did up in North Method on Fulton Spring Road, Mr. President, I think basic things like were mentioned, the paintings and low-lying fruit on putting some stop signs, additional stop signs, as Mary Ann mentioned, and things that can be accomplished relatively quickly, I think would go a long way.

1512
01:57:02,929 --> 01:57:04,810
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm hoping when we meet on site,

1513
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:09,233
[SPEAKER_18]: that the city move forward immediately on some of these temporary measures.

1514
01:57:09,613 --> 01:57:10,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1515
01:57:12,055 --> 01:57:14,276
[SPEAKER_14]: So, any further discussion?

1516
01:57:14,396 --> 01:57:20,641
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Morell.

1517
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:21,701
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favour?

1518
01:57:22,342 --> 01:57:22,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1519
01:57:22,802 --> 01:57:24,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1520
01:57:24,103 --> 01:57:28,947
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, just before we continue, if the clerk could just note on the record,

1521
01:57:30,024 --> 01:57:32,805
[SPEAKER_31]: there's like a 60 minute sound that's been going off all night.

1522
01:57:32,845 --> 01:57:36,485
[SPEAKER_31]: It's like a clock ticking time bomb.

1523
01:57:37,085 --> 01:57:41,126
[SPEAKER_31]: If we could, yeah, I'm like starting to lose my mind a little bit.

1524
01:57:41,186 --> 01:57:44,027
[SPEAKER_31]: So, um, if we could just see if we could get that address.

1525
01:57:44,567 --> 01:57:47,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked him about an hour and a half ago what that noise was.

1526
01:57:48,648 --> 01:57:51,088
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, yeah, I feel like I'm watching the intro to 60 minutes.

1527
01:57:51,328 --> 01:57:54,089
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1528
01:57:54,149 --> 01:57:59,010
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's go back to the beginning motions, orders, or resolutions.

1529
01:58:04,888 --> 01:58:05,469
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1530
01:58:05,509 --> 01:58:06,411
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

1531
01:58:09,697 --> 01:58:11,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe get a little WD-40 or something.

1532
01:58:11,681 --> 01:58:13,124
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1533
01:58:13,605 --> 01:58:15,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Motions, draws, and resolutions.

1534
01:58:16,564 --> 01:58:28,432
[SPEAKER_14]: 21-497 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Jeannie and Lenny Gliona on their momentous celebration of their 50th wedding anniversary.

1535
01:58:28,832 --> 01:58:29,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

1536
01:58:29,813 --> 01:58:31,314
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1537
01:58:31,414 --> 01:58:36,757
[SPEAKER_21]: My dear friend Lenny Gliona and my dear friend Jeannie Gliona just celebrated 50 years of wedded bliss.

1538
01:58:37,338 --> 01:58:43,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Many of us know Lenny from being around the hockey rinks and the political circles here in the city of Medford, and many of us know Jeannie.

1539
01:58:44,422 --> 01:58:46,824
[SPEAKER_21]: for her work in the Metro Public Schools for over 30 years.

1540
01:58:46,844 --> 01:58:50,806
[SPEAKER_21]: 30 years in the public schools and 50 years married to Lenny.

1541
01:58:51,327 --> 01:58:52,207
[SPEAKER_21]: The woman's a saint.

1542
01:58:53,628 --> 01:59:00,393
[SPEAKER_21]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I do wish them the best of luck, and I hope that they have another 50 years of happy, healthy, wedded bliss.

1543
01:59:00,673 --> 01:59:01,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1544
01:59:01,394 --> 01:59:01,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Morell.

1545
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:05,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1546
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:11,124
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to echo Vice President Knight and just extend my congratulations to Len and Jeannie.

1547
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:20,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I also thank Jeannie for lending Len to Medford Politics so often, which may actually contribute to their success, how much time he spends out of the house helping us all out.

1548
01:59:20,409 --> 01:59:23,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So extending the congratulations and wishing them many more.

1549
01:59:29,114 --> 01:59:29,674
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President.

1550
01:59:30,935 --> 01:59:31,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Palacio.

1551
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:36,874
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much and I thank Council Knight for offering this resolution tonight.

1552
01:59:36,914 --> 01:59:41,378
[SPEAKER_26]: We'd like to congratulate the Leonis as well on their 50th anniversary.

1553
01:59:41,398 --> 01:59:43,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Happy anniversary and best wishes.

1554
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:43,960
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1555
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:44,280
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1556
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:44,920
[SPEAKER_31]: What's the best?

1557
01:59:45,081 --> 01:59:46,342
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to say the same thing.

1558
01:59:46,382 --> 01:59:52,426
[SPEAKER_31]: Congratulations to Jeannie and Len on their anniversary and congratulations to Councilor Knight for scooping Councilor Morell on this.

1559
01:59:52,987 --> 01:59:53,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1560
01:59:55,062 --> 01:59:59,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, so on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Morell, all those in favor?

1561
02:00:00,324 --> 02:00:01,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1562
02:00:01,204 --> 02:00:03,945
[SPEAKER_14]: 21500 for Vice President Knight.

1563
02:00:04,885 --> 02:00:12,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Being so resolved that the Medford City Council extend a happy 85th birthday to Jack McDevitt, Vice President Knight.

1564
02:00:12,707 --> 02:00:14,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1565
02:00:14,328 --> 02:00:22,810
[SPEAKER_21]: For those of us who went to Medford High back in pre-2010 years, we would know Jack McDevitt as a law teacher.

1566
02:00:23,498 --> 02:00:29,104
[SPEAKER_21]: And he was one of the most influential teachers that I had in my career as a student in the Medford Public Schools.

1567
02:00:29,304 --> 02:00:32,548
[SPEAKER_21]: And recently, Jack celebrated his 85th birthday.

1568
02:00:32,948 --> 02:00:35,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. McDevitt is a proud graduate of St.

1569
02:00:35,992 --> 02:00:36,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Clements High School.

1570
02:00:37,173 --> 02:00:42,519
[SPEAKER_21]: And upon his service in the United States military, he went to Boston College.

1571
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:50,224
[SPEAKER_21]: where every first period law class he got to tell us about how Boston College was the greatest university in the history of man.

1572
02:00:50,605 --> 02:00:55,548
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the city clerk agrees with us there.

1573
02:00:55,909 --> 02:01:00,532
[SPEAKER_21]: I just always asked him if it was because he couldn't get into Merrimack, but he never thought that was very funny.

1574
02:01:01,822 --> 02:01:04,162
[SPEAKER_21]: But with that being said, Mr. President, Jack's a great guy.

1575
02:01:04,182 --> 02:01:12,224
[SPEAKER_21]: He's someone that had touched the lives and the hearts of many high school students across his time and tenure as a teacher at Medford Public Schools for over 40 years.

1576
02:01:12,244 --> 02:01:16,444
[SPEAKER_21]: He's someone that certainly impacted my life, and I wish him a happy 85th birthday.

1577
02:01:16,825 --> 02:01:20,205
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm glad to see him enjoying his retirement and getting many, many years out of it.

1578
02:01:20,665 --> 02:01:20,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1579
02:01:21,165 --> 02:01:21,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

1580
02:01:22,566 --> 02:01:23,266
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1581
02:01:23,286 --> 02:01:25,806
[SPEAKER_26]: I also want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this resolution forward.

1582
02:01:25,946 --> 02:01:27,606
[SPEAKER_26]: It brings back a lot of memories.

1583
02:01:27,666 --> 02:01:31,107
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. McDevitt, I had him for a long while when I was at Medford High School many years ago.

1584
02:01:31,977 --> 02:01:39,105
[SPEAKER_26]: And I still fondly remember him saying every Friday, root for the Mustangs, root for the Eagles, and root for the Patriots in that order.

1585
02:01:40,687 --> 02:01:43,710
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just want to wish him a very happy birthday and wish him well.

1586
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:44,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1587
02:01:45,312 --> 02:01:49,596
[SPEAKER_14]: And personally, I would say I'm a student of Jack McDevitt.

1588
02:01:50,077 --> 02:01:51,778
[SPEAKER_14]: At 67 years old, I see him all the time.

1589
02:01:51,819 --> 02:01:52,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I still call him Mr. McDevitt.

1590
02:01:54,135 --> 02:01:56,219
[SPEAKER_14]: So happy birthday, Mr. McDevitt.

1591
02:01:57,802 --> 02:02:01,028
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1592
02:02:01,448 --> 02:02:02,110
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1593
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:02,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1594
02:02:02,851 --> 02:02:03,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1595
02:02:05,524 --> 02:02:14,210
[SPEAKER_14]: 21501 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that Medford City Council sent its deepest and sacred condolences to the family of Daniel Bates on his recent passing.

1596
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:15,151
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Knight.

1597
02:02:15,611 --> 02:02:22,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Mr. President, Mr. Bates passed away recently after a long battle with illness.

1598
02:02:22,596 --> 02:02:25,978
[SPEAKER_21]: We all know the Bates family here in the city of Medford, Dapa, Michelle.

1599
02:02:26,658 --> 02:02:33,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Sean and Mikey have been fixtures in the hockey rinks and Little League fields across this community for a number of years.

1600
02:02:34,164 --> 02:02:39,387
[SPEAKER_21]: A very large family, the Bateses, the Howes, the Rileys, all very dedicated.

1601
02:02:39,407 --> 02:02:45,271
[SPEAKER_21]: The Medfordians with the blue and white running through their veins, but no more so than Big Dan.

1602
02:02:45,452 --> 02:02:46,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, he will be sadly missed.

1603
02:02:46,893 --> 02:02:48,734
[SPEAKER_21]: He was a dear friend, a consummate family man.

1604
02:02:49,298 --> 02:02:56,807
[SPEAKER_21]: And when he wasn't working, you could find him cutting his kids around the hockey rinks or sitting in the outfield watching the league games.

1605
02:02:56,887 --> 02:03:01,272
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the greatest human beings I've had the pleasure to meet and call a friend and I'm sad to see him go.

1606
02:03:01,332 --> 02:03:05,196
[SPEAKER_21]: So my condolences to the family and I ask my council colleagues to join me in extending these wishes.

1607
02:03:08,517 --> 02:03:09,638
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1608
02:03:09,658 --> 02:03:11,581
[SPEAKER_26]: I also want to thank Councilman Mack for bringing this forward too.

1609
02:03:11,821 --> 02:03:18,689
[SPEAKER_26]: The Bates family has been very instrumental through the years in our community in their various volunteer efforts.

1610
02:03:19,009 --> 02:03:22,934
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just wanted to offer my condolences to the family.

1611
02:03:23,094 --> 02:03:25,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1612
02:03:25,357 --> 02:03:26,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilman Mack.

1613
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:30,282
[SPEAKER_18]: President, I think Council and Vice President Knight hit the nail on the head.

1614
02:03:30,963 --> 02:03:38,608
[SPEAKER_18]: A true family man, a great guy, take the shirt off his back, you know, if someone needed it, and raised a heck of a family.

1615
02:03:38,668 --> 02:03:44,732
[SPEAKER_18]: And as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, he was probably one of the most active fathers that I've ever seen.

1616
02:03:45,152 --> 02:03:56,400
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, in addition to all his other roles, he was at every sporting event possible, rooting his children on, as well as the Method athletes, and he will be sorely missed.

1617
02:03:57,285 --> 02:04:07,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you and personally myself to go to those of the base family of a longtime friends of mine and again all those days of the rink we see each other.

1618
02:04:07,293 --> 02:04:09,875
[SPEAKER_14]: The ball just to his family.

1619
02:04:10,695 --> 02:04:12,977
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a we have a couple of other ones so we can do them all at once.

1620
02:04:15,259 --> 02:04:21,864
[SPEAKER_14]: 2, 1, 5, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 1, 9, offered by president care of yellow and not Council Falco.

1621
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:31,008
[SPEAKER_14]: The result of the city council Senate people to say condolences, the family of former Medford fire chief Larry Sands on his recent passage, Council Falco.

1622
02:04:31,108 --> 02:04:38,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President, thoughts and prayers to former fire chief Larry Sands on his recent passing.

1623
02:04:39,155 --> 02:04:42,979
[SPEAKER_26]: He's a member of the US Marine Corps, Korean War veteran, Vietnam veteran.

1624
02:04:44,741 --> 02:04:52,087
[SPEAKER_26]: He was appointed to the Medford Fire Department in 1965, became chief in 1984, and was a long-time parishioner at St.

1625
02:04:52,107 --> 02:04:55,630
[SPEAKER_26]: Francis, Mississippi Parish, and volunteered many hours there.

1626
02:04:56,231 --> 02:04:59,694
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just wanted to offer my condolences to the family.

1627
02:04:59,714 --> 02:05:00,815
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1628
02:05:01,475 --> 02:05:01,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1629
02:05:01,896 --> 02:05:07,601
[SPEAKER_14]: And for my honor, condolences to Larry's family.

1630
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:12,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to know him over the years and on his recent passing.

1631
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:14,261
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have another one.

1632
02:05:14,281 --> 02:05:15,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I could on that?

1633
02:05:15,523 --> 02:05:17,585
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Councilman Moxley, I couldn't see you over there.

1634
02:05:17,645 --> 02:05:18,186
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all right.

1635
02:05:19,347 --> 02:05:26,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I want to thank both you and Councilor Falco for putting this on, but Larry was a true professional in this community.

1636
02:05:26,836 --> 02:05:31,781
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you can usually gauge a person by how much his colleagues loved him.

1637
02:05:32,602 --> 02:05:46,997
[SPEAKER_18]: And even though he was chief, and that's a difficult job, and you make decisions that may not be favorable to everyone, he was always well-respected, well-admired, Mr. President, and he ran a fire department that was second to none.

1638
02:05:47,658 --> 02:05:53,424
[SPEAKER_18]: And I always remember that about Chief Sands, and he will be solely missed, Mr. President.

1639
02:05:55,918 --> 02:06:05,626
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, 2-1-5-2-2, offered by Vice President Knight, being so resolved, the Medford City Council extended deep and sincere condolences to the family of Stella McPolland on her recent passing.

1640
02:06:05,926 --> 02:06:06,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Knight.

1641
02:06:06,907 --> 02:06:08,428
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1642
02:06:08,789 --> 02:06:17,856
[SPEAKER_21]: South Medford lost one of the greats, Stella McPolland, mother to my dear friend Joe McPolland, also known as Norton, in the South Medford area.

1643
02:06:18,056 --> 02:06:22,380
[SPEAKER_21]: We all see Norton working down at Delarusso's funeral home as one of the ushers there.

1644
02:06:22,925 --> 02:06:23,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a great guy.

1645
02:06:23,746 --> 02:06:29,729
[SPEAKER_21]: He works with Freddie during the day and also for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at night in the Department of Revenue.

1646
02:06:30,029 --> 02:06:37,093
[SPEAKER_21]: And Stella is part of that Stearns Ave crew of Insabi's that live down on Stearns Ave.

1647
02:06:37,193 --> 02:06:42,395
[SPEAKER_21]: And she recently passed away after a long struggle, and she will be sorely missed.

1648
02:06:42,415 --> 02:06:43,296
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a beautiful woman.

1649
02:06:43,336 --> 02:06:45,897
[SPEAKER_21]: She raised a great family and we're sad to see her go.

1650
02:06:46,017 --> 02:06:49,279
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues in supporting the resolution.

1651
02:06:53,838 --> 02:06:56,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Council Vice President Knight for putting this on.

1652
02:06:56,699 --> 02:07:02,062
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't find out until after the fact, Mr. President, but I grew up on Stearns Ave.

1653
02:07:02,702 --> 02:07:07,985
[SPEAKER_18]: And let me tell you, growing up there was such a tremendous place to live.

1654
02:07:08,785 --> 02:07:10,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone knew everyone, Mr. President.

1655
02:07:11,187 --> 02:07:12,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone was over everyone's home.

1656
02:07:13,308 --> 02:07:16,689
[SPEAKER_18]: You were treated like family from every home on the street.

1657
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:19,611
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you weren't doing the right thing, as you probably remember,

1658
02:07:20,451 --> 02:07:31,738
[SPEAKER_18]: Steller or Mrs. Insaldi or Mrs. Freitas or you name it, the D'Onofrios, they were out there and they'd let you know, the Amaris, they'd let you know what you were doing and what you were doing was wrong.

1659
02:07:32,178 --> 02:07:34,599
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was just a great place to grow up, Mr. President.

1660
02:07:34,659 --> 02:07:40,963
[SPEAKER_18]: And Steller was a sweetheart of a woman and she was a protector of the neighborhood.

1661
02:07:41,523 --> 02:07:44,685
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, she will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1662
02:07:45,205 --> 02:07:45,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1663
02:07:46,686 --> 02:07:48,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we have one more.

1664
02:07:49,283 --> 02:07:57,969
[SPEAKER_14]: 21524 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that Medford City Council and Senator Stephenson say condolences to the family of John Jackie Moulton Jr.

1665
02:07:58,389 --> 02:07:59,410
[SPEAKER_14]: on his recent passing.

1666
02:08:00,691 --> 02:08:01,611
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Knight.

1667
02:08:01,651 --> 02:08:03,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1668
02:08:03,252 --> 02:08:09,917
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems like it's been a tough summer for South Medford because Jack Moulton was also a South Medford legend.

1669
02:08:10,997 --> 02:08:12,558
[SPEAKER_21]: He's been taken from us too soon.

1670
02:08:12,578 --> 02:08:19,542
[SPEAKER_21]: He's the husband of one of our elections officers, Mrs. Moulton, father to John and Kim, two of my close friends.

1671
02:08:21,203 --> 02:08:25,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Passed away after a long public struggle with illness, Mr. President, and I was sad to see him go.

1672
02:08:26,206 --> 02:08:31,028
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd just like to extend condolences to the family in this time of need and ask my council colleagues to support the result.

1673
02:08:32,449 --> 02:08:32,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1674
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:37,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, if we could rise for a moment of silence for all these fine people who have passed away.

1675
02:08:59,362 --> 02:09:13,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, 21502 offered by Vice President Knight, be it so resolved that an installation of a blinking stoplight be implemented at the intersection of Central Avenue and Park Street.

1676
02:09:14,029 --> 02:09:14,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Knight.

1677
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:16,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1678
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:23,033
[SPEAKER_21]: I find this to be a rather self-explanatory resolution, very similar to the concerns that we have on West Street and Cotting Street and North Street.

1679
02:09:23,593 --> 02:09:26,475
[SPEAKER_21]: We also share the concerns here at Central Avenue and Park Street.

1680
02:09:27,295 --> 02:09:36,808
[SPEAKER_21]: As we're all aware, those are two very long straight roadways that intersect with one another, and over years in time, they've turned into somewhat of a small raceway.

1681
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:43,017
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a need for some traffic calming measures and some mitigation there, and I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

1682
02:09:43,452 --> 02:09:43,852
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1683
02:09:44,072 --> 02:09:44,673
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco.

1684
02:09:44,813 --> 02:09:45,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1685
02:09:45,573 --> 02:09:48,434
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd also like to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this resolution forward.

1686
02:09:49,675 --> 02:09:51,456
[SPEAKER_26]: Pedestrian safety is always key.

1687
02:09:52,276 --> 02:10:01,340
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a highly populated area with a lot of kids that walk to and from school to the Roberts Elementary School and to the Andrews and McGlynn schools.

1688
02:10:01,881 --> 02:10:09,624
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think this is definitely in favor of this and I'd like to move forward on this as soon as possible.

1689
02:10:09,664 --> 02:10:10,665
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would second the motion.

1690
02:10:11,025 --> 02:10:11,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1691
02:10:12,387 --> 02:10:12,967
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Betz.

1692
02:10:13,007 --> 02:10:13,848
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1693
02:10:14,549 --> 02:10:17,312
[SPEAKER_31]: If my colleagues don't mind, I was just down in this area over the weekend.

1694
02:10:18,053 --> 02:10:28,405
[SPEAKER_31]: If I could add an amendment also that a traffic calming or a speed bump be installed around the address of 94 Otis Street for similar reasons.

1695
02:10:28,425 --> 02:10:30,307
[SPEAKER_14]: 94 Otis?

1696
02:10:30,327 --> 02:10:30,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1697
02:10:32,545 --> 02:10:38,210
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Beaz.

1698
02:10:39,111 --> 02:10:39,832
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1699
02:10:40,172 --> 02:10:41,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1700
02:10:41,093 --> 02:10:46,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1701
02:10:46,478 --> 02:10:53,905
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-5-1-6, offered by President Caraviello and Vice President Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council command and congratulate Amici's Pizza.

1702
02:10:54,836 --> 02:10:58,379
[SPEAKER_14]: On the 30th anniversary of business in Medford, Vice President Knight.

1703
02:10:58,959 --> 02:11:00,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1704
02:11:00,921 --> 02:11:04,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations to Dominic and Mario on 30 years of successful business.

1705
02:11:04,644 --> 02:11:11,068
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like it was just yesterday when I was a 12-year-old kid walking into Amici's when they first opened, getting a slice of pizza.

1706
02:11:12,069 --> 02:11:16,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Since that time, every Friday night for the last 30 years, I've gone there.

1707
02:11:17,431 --> 02:11:19,092
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been an institution in my family.

1708
02:11:19,332 --> 02:11:25,254
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't tell you, you know, Amici's is just the place we go every Friday night for pizza, Friday night's pizza night.

1709
02:11:26,394 --> 02:11:31,256
[SPEAKER_21]: My little brother spent countless, countless hours in Amici's, 10 years my younger.

1710
02:11:32,296 --> 02:11:37,998
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's just so funny now when I go in there, Mr. President, with my children and Ryan and Brendan run behind the counter.

1711
02:11:38,555 --> 02:11:43,899
[SPEAKER_21]: And Mario's given him quarters to put in the machine just like he was when I was a kid, I think it's just the coolest thing.

1712
02:11:44,799 --> 02:11:53,045
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, I'm very thankful to have been able to develop such a 30 year friendship with Mario and Dominic down at amici's but also.

1713
02:11:53,740 --> 02:12:02,224
[SPEAKER_21]: very thankful that they put out such a great product for such a long time that they've made West Medford Square a destination location for the best pizza in Medford.

1714
02:12:02,744 --> 02:12:06,046
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's according to Boston Pizza Wars, not according to Adam Knight.

1715
02:12:07,126 --> 02:12:14,570
[SPEAKER_21]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I just want to congratulate Dominic and Mario and the rest of the family on such a successful 30 years in business.

1716
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:18,351
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd like to give them a citation at some point, if possible.

1717
02:12:18,651 --> 02:12:19,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1718
02:12:19,472 --> 02:12:21,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you know, I echo Councilor Knight's

1719
02:12:22,824 --> 02:12:24,547
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I live in that neighborhood.

1720
02:12:25,128 --> 02:12:32,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I get pizza there all the time, and now I get my granddaughter hangs around there with all her little young friends getting pizza.

1721
02:12:32,762 --> 02:12:33,804
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, you know,

1722
02:12:34,632 --> 02:12:41,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna thank them for 30 years of business in one spot, and they've done a great job there.

1723
02:12:41,634 --> 02:12:42,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1724
02:12:42,615 --> 02:12:44,635
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.

1725
02:12:44,715 --> 02:12:46,896
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanna also congratulate them.

1726
02:12:47,276 --> 02:12:58,820
[SPEAKER_31]: I went to elementary school in the area, so I have similar age memories of Amici's, and I just wanna say there's nothing more sincere than the look in Councilor Knight's eyes when he talks about pizza at Amici's, and it makes me happy.

1727
02:12:58,840 --> 02:12:59,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizza in general.

1728
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:03,421
[SPEAKER_31]: So I wholeheartedly support this.

1729
02:13:04,717 --> 02:13:06,942
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so, Councilor Marks.

1730
02:13:09,267 --> 02:13:10,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet we should get one now.

1731
02:13:12,514 --> 02:13:13,436
[SPEAKER_18]: That's great.

1732
02:13:13,677 --> 02:13:14,338
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll agree on that.

1733
02:13:15,137 --> 02:13:21,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I think the reason why is, you know, when you talk about Dom and Mario, they're a staple in West Medford Square.

1734
02:13:21,081 --> 02:13:24,843
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think you can mention West Medford Square without saying Amicis.

1735
02:13:25,463 --> 02:13:31,347
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, they provide an excellent product to the residents of this community, and the residents support Amicis because of that.

1736
02:13:32,047 --> 02:13:33,448
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're two good guys.

1737
02:13:33,548 --> 02:13:35,409
[SPEAKER_18]: They're homegrown guys.

1738
02:13:36,650 --> 02:13:39,592
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wish them well, and I wish them another 30 years, Mr. President.

1739
02:13:39,988 --> 02:13:42,070
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're also advocates for everybody in the square also.

1740
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:43,931
[SPEAKER_14]: They really are.

1741
02:13:43,971 --> 02:13:46,513
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a problem, they're the first ones to come forward.

1742
02:13:48,495 --> 02:13:50,296
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Adam and I have gotten enough phone calls from them.

1743
02:13:50,316 --> 02:13:58,422
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1744
02:13:58,723 --> 02:13:59,423
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1745
02:13:59,443 --> 02:14:00,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1746
02:14:00,584 --> 02:14:01,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1747
02:14:03,762 --> 02:14:05,502
[SPEAKER_14]: 2, 1, 5, 1, 7, off of my present care bill.

1748
02:14:05,522 --> 02:14:16,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it be it so be a result of the city council commend and congratulate captain John Conway and Lieutenant Mark Rudolph on their retirement after years of dedicated service to the method police departments.

1749
02:14:19,545 --> 02:14:22,685
[SPEAKER_14]: John and Mark both longtime policeman.

1750
02:14:22,705 --> 02:14:27,326
[SPEAKER_14]: They said both of them have served up close to 30 years of service to our community.

1751
02:14:28,106 --> 02:14:30,687
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of retirements in the Police Department this year.

1752
02:14:32,122 --> 02:14:38,944
[SPEAKER_14]: So and hard to replace men like that who pretty much dedicated their lives to public safety.

1753
02:14:38,984 --> 02:14:46,506
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations to them on their retirement and hope that we see them around in the future.

1754
02:14:51,772 --> 02:14:53,493
[SPEAKER_21]: concur with everything you've said.

1755
02:14:53,553 --> 02:15:02,639
[SPEAKER_21]: I think when you look at these two individuals, I read in the paper, I think it was over 70 years of law enforcement experience here in the city of Medford.

1756
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:04,981
[SPEAKER_21]: I wish them both the best.

1757
02:15:05,521 --> 02:15:10,405
[SPEAKER_21]: We got very familiar with Lieutenant Rudolph during the budget process when he came up here to speak about the police dispatches.

1758
02:15:10,925 --> 02:15:20,371
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've been very familiar with Captain Conway because he lives down the street from me and he has the most meticulous yard and the coolest looking fence out in front of his house that you'll ever see.

1759
02:15:21,352 --> 02:15:25,096
[SPEAKER_21]: quite quite quite a outdoorsman, Mr. President, when it comes to maintaining his property.

1760
02:15:25,537 --> 02:15:30,442
[SPEAKER_21]: So I look forward to seeing him out there more often when he has more time on his hands now that he's a retiree.

1761
02:15:30,582 --> 02:15:32,404
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, I second your motion.

1762
02:15:33,105 --> 02:15:33,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1763
02:15:33,485 --> 02:15:33,926
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's tough.

1764
02:15:33,946 --> 02:15:36,749
[SPEAKER_14]: You go by there, you see all these all these young men and women there.

1765
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:39,772
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all, you know, in their early 20s.

1766
02:15:39,792 --> 02:15:42,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1767
02:15:46,011 --> 02:15:48,813
[SPEAKER_26]: and Conway for the many years of service to our community.

1768
02:15:49,473 --> 02:15:52,295
[SPEAKER_26]: When you think about it, 70 years combined, that's a lot of time.

1769
02:15:52,315 --> 02:15:57,517
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just want to thank them for their continuous commitment to our community and wish them well in their retirement.

1770
02:15:57,677 --> 02:15:58,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1771
02:15:58,518 --> 02:15:59,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1772
02:15:59,879 --> 02:16:02,360
[SPEAKER_18]: I better put a pillow so you can see me.

1773
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:02,560
[SPEAKER_18]: It's me.

1774
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:24,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I want to thank yourself, and I think it was just you, actually, that put this on.

1775
02:16:25,557 --> 02:16:30,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Lieutenant Rudolph and Captain Conway were truly professionals in this city.

1776
02:16:31,922 --> 02:16:34,984
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never heard anyone utter a bad word about either gentleman.

1777
02:16:35,625 --> 02:16:43,030
[SPEAKER_18]: They served with distinction for many, many years, an unblemished record, as was stated, over 70 years.

1778
02:16:43,491 --> 02:16:44,892
[SPEAKER_18]: And to have an unblemished record

1779
02:16:45,972 --> 02:16:48,053
[SPEAKER_18]: in such a position of importance.

1780
02:16:48,833 --> 02:16:52,234
[SPEAKER_18]: And in this community, I think, says a lot about the two gentlemen.

1781
02:16:52,814 --> 02:16:54,354
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wish them well in their retirement.

1782
02:16:54,374 --> 02:17:04,877
[SPEAKER_18]: And hopefully, Mr. President, from what I'm hearing, retirees will be allowed at some point to come back and do some light detail and so forth around the community.

1783
02:17:04,917 --> 02:17:07,578
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would hope to see them back again, Mr. President.

1784
02:17:08,358 --> 02:17:10,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope we get that paper for us fairly soon.

1785
02:17:11,982 --> 02:17:20,491
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion seconded by Council box all those in favor aye motion passes to one 5, 2, 0, 4, 5, person care will be resolved.

1786
02:17:21,151 --> 02:17:32,603
[SPEAKER_14]: The city Council have the recreation Park Department of the company to build the budget courts at one 21 Riverside Avenue return make them official size and put the proper service that belongs a budget cuts.

1787
02:17:34,943 --> 02:17:37,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Chris Dunavant here.

1788
02:17:38,264 --> 02:17:41,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the week, he had a little boccia tournament down there.

1789
02:17:41,425 --> 02:17:46,406
[SPEAKER_14]: But I remember going down there for the opening of it, and there was sand there.

1790
02:17:46,466 --> 02:17:49,246
[SPEAKER_14]: And not that I'm a big boccia player, but I've been down the ball club.

1791
02:17:49,286 --> 02:17:50,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen other boccia courts.

1792
02:17:50,467 --> 02:17:55,468
[SPEAKER_14]: And it needs to have, like, clay or some kind of stone that's on there and not sand.

1793
02:17:55,548 --> 02:18:01,549
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I questioned the people that day who did it, they said they build boccia courts all the time, and they knew what they were doing.

1794
02:18:01,569 --> 02:18:02,790
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess I don't know.

1795
02:18:04,653 --> 02:18:09,254
[SPEAKER_14]: If they could get back there, put that stone dust down there to make them real bocce courts.

1796
02:18:09,594 --> 02:18:10,434
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't know what they need.

1797
02:18:10,474 --> 02:18:16,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Have them go down to the bowl club and see how theirs look.

1798
02:18:16,696 --> 02:18:19,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Those guys play there almost all year round.

1799
02:18:19,517 --> 02:18:26,218
[SPEAKER_14]: So whoever's in charge of that, please have them go down there and fix that to make them official bocce courts.

1800
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:31,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1801
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:32,200
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1802
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:36,441
[SPEAKER_14]: 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, offered by Councilor Morell.

1803
02:18:36,481 --> 02:18:48,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is the... Councilor Morell, what am I?

1804
02:18:48,507 --> 02:18:48,487
2, 1, 5, 3, 7?

1805
02:18:49,167 --> 02:18:51,868
[SPEAKER_14]: 2, 1... Oh, yes.

1806
02:18:52,068 --> 02:18:51,868
5, 3... 3, 7.

1807
02:18:52,428 --> 02:18:53,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah.

1808
02:18:53,609 --> 02:18:55,670
[SPEAKER_14]: We did have Representative Gobley here earlier.

1809
02:18:56,030 --> 02:18:58,351
[SPEAKER_14]: If I had known he was here for that, I didn't see that on there.

1810
02:18:58,771 --> 02:18:58,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1811
02:19:03,428 --> 02:19:09,033
[SPEAKER_26]: had another commitment so you couldn't wait through the evening so I believe you want to come back at another time.

1812
02:19:09,573 --> 02:19:13,637
[SPEAKER_14]: So to one.

1813
02:19:15,098 --> 02:19:15,559
[SPEAKER_14]: To one 5.

1814
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:29,351
[SPEAKER_14]: 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 3, 7, we're going to combine and whereas the West of the community commuter rail station is currently inaccessible to residents using wheelchairs walkers strollers and other mobility devices and whereas the West of the community rail station.

1815
02:19:29,858 --> 02:19:50,019
[SPEAKER_14]: is identified as a tier one station in need of an upgrade according to the mbta system wide says to be a part it's a result that the Medford City Council said the letter of support of the commission for person with disability request to governor Baker for allocation of funding to upgrade the West metric community West River commuter rail station.

1816
02:19:50,619 --> 02:19:51,060
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're up.

1817
02:19:51,668 --> 02:19:52,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1818
02:19:52,469 --> 02:20:02,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this resolution really covers it, and I also want to make sure the residents have a chance to speak, but Tom with the Commission for Persons with Disabilities reached out to me.

1819
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:03,221
[SPEAKER_11]: They have sent a letter.

1820
02:20:03,621 --> 02:20:07,726
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor has sent a letter in support of this and really just trying to bring forth the United Front.

1821
02:20:08,186 --> 02:20:14,047
[SPEAKER_11]: So that Governor Baker releases the funding to make this improvement that is much needed with an Accra station.

1822
02:20:14,588 --> 02:20:23,650
[SPEAKER_11]: The trains are incredibly challenging to use with anyone with a mobility issue and completely inaccessible to many, many people because of this.

1823
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:30,411
[SPEAKER_11]: As I understand, it's been on a tier one priority since 2019, still has not been funded, work has not been planned or started.

1824
02:20:30,971 --> 02:20:33,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just something that we need to continue to push on to get this funding.

1825
02:20:33,692 --> 02:20:37,753
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let Councilor Falco if he has anything to add and just make sure we hear from the residents.

1826
02:20:39,414 --> 02:20:41,075
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1827
02:20:41,095 --> 02:20:41,955
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1828
02:20:42,115 --> 02:20:44,596
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm in full agreement with Councilor Morell.

1829
02:20:45,017 --> 02:20:46,637
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a project that's long overdue.

1830
02:20:46,817 --> 02:20:48,118
[SPEAKER_26]: It should have been done years ago.

1831
02:20:48,258 --> 02:20:50,179
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a station that needs to be made accessible.

1832
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:53,741
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'd like to see this done as soon as possible.

1833
02:20:53,881 --> 02:21:04,687
[SPEAKER_26]: I know I've talked to Representative Garibaldi recently, and he took me through some of the funding details, but I think it would be great to get him here to a meeting at some point.

1834
02:21:04,747 --> 02:21:06,768
[SPEAKER_26]: Or maybe if you could send us some sort of

1835
02:21:07,568 --> 02:21:15,969
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it would be beneficial to have a written response, just giving us an update of where the project is, I think would be beneficial or possibly committee the whole if you see that that's that's necessary as well.

1836
02:21:16,430 --> 02:21:20,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Six years ago, I had I had a similar motion on the paper on the on the floor.

1837
02:21:20,070 --> 02:21:27,991
[SPEAKER_14]: We we had a meeting down there with the T representative Gobbledy, Senator Jalen uh and uh I think I figured it was mythic

1838
02:21:38,537 --> 02:21:58,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Because of the station, and it's sort of like a grandfather thing there, once they broke the threshold of improvements, they would have to pretty much shut the whole station down and revamp it to a much lower level, and they claimed they had no funding to do that, and that was about six years ago.

1839
02:21:59,090 --> 02:22:04,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, it is something, and they promised to look at what came back, but I thank you for bringing this up again.

1840
02:22:05,495 --> 02:22:05,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Totsamaks.

1841
02:22:07,874 --> 02:22:08,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1842
02:22:08,755 --> 02:22:12,799
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank Councilor Morell and Councilor Falco for putting this on the agenda.

1843
02:22:12,819 --> 02:22:18,385
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I can remember this when I first got on the council back in 2001.

1844
02:22:19,566 --> 02:22:23,750
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how far it stretches back just with me and the request because that's been

1845
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,053
[SPEAKER_18]: inaccessible for at least 20 years that I'm aware of.

1846
02:22:29,893 --> 02:22:35,378
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've had, as you stated, officials down there, state delegation, you name it.

1847
02:22:35,418 --> 02:22:39,061
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had everyone down there, Mr. President, but very little action.

1848
02:22:39,762 --> 02:22:45,567
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of years ago, there was some aesthetics done to the station itself, but

1849
02:22:46,187 --> 02:22:48,349
[SPEAKER_18]: very minor improvements were made.

1850
02:22:48,989 --> 02:22:52,512
[SPEAKER_18]: That is a heavily traveled, I mean they come from all over.

1851
02:22:53,152 --> 02:22:54,753
[SPEAKER_18]: Just ask the residents of West Medford.

1852
02:22:55,034 --> 02:22:57,215
[SPEAKER_18]: They come from all over to use the commuter rail.

1853
02:22:57,956 --> 02:23:06,162
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's unacceptable, to be quite frank with you, to have a rail, as Councilor Morell mentioned, that not everyone can use.

1854
02:23:07,002 --> 02:23:08,143
[SPEAKER_18]: especially in this day and age.

1855
02:23:08,764 --> 02:23:18,952
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm hoping that through our diligence and our persistency, like we did with Salt Street and the intersection of Salt and Main, we finally got the state to act.

1856
02:23:19,272 --> 02:23:22,014
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm hoping that happens with this issue, Mr. President.

1857
02:23:22,355 --> 02:23:24,016
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to thank my colleagues for bringing it up.

1858
02:23:26,418 --> 02:23:27,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to speak on this?

1859
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:28,740
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

1860
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:29,881
[SPEAKER_29]: Name and address of the record, please.

1861
02:23:30,541 --> 02:23:33,083
[SPEAKER_29]: Tom Himmel, I live at 16 Maynard.

1862
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:37,101
[SPEAKER_29]: 16 Maynard Street.

1863
02:23:38,261 --> 02:23:42,663
[SPEAKER_29]: I serve on the City's Commission for Persons with Disabilities.

1864
02:23:44,204 --> 02:23:47,366
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you to Councilor Morell for putting this motion on.

1865
02:23:48,266 --> 02:23:58,151
[SPEAKER_29]: Our commission met with the Statewide Accessibility Department of the MBTA earlier this year, and we learned some of the history that you shared.

1866
02:23:58,191 --> 02:24:00,312
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for sharing more of it.

1867
02:24:00,872 --> 02:24:01,552
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm new to

1868
02:24:03,598 --> 02:24:04,738
[SPEAKER_29]: working on this project.

1869
02:24:05,118 --> 02:24:10,600
[SPEAKER_29]: I did, I have been working with the mayor and with Representative Garbelli.

1870
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:21,502
[SPEAKER_29]: He mentioned to me earlier today that to try to help move us up, we can get, try to get some funding for the design of the station.

1871
02:24:21,642 --> 02:24:28,683
[SPEAKER_29]: That's something that the MBTA would be receptive to in terms of moving us up on the pecking order.

1872
02:24:29,463 --> 02:24:31,944
[SPEAKER_29]: He has included $4 million in the bond bill.

1873
02:24:32,893 --> 02:24:46,517
[SPEAKER_29]: for that and it has mentioned with the infrastructure that bill that's pending in Congress that that's kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity to get the funding that's been the issue in getting it funded.

1874
02:24:47,217 --> 02:24:52,559
[SPEAKER_29]: They do want to make it fully, they want to fully renovate it to make it fully accessible.

1875
02:24:53,239 --> 02:24:55,040
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm told that's like 20, $25 million.

1876
02:24:55,160 --> 02:25:01,882
[SPEAKER_29]: I did get news today from the statewide accessibility department that

1877
02:25:03,118 --> 02:25:15,022
[SPEAKER_29]: We have been recommended to be included in making that the station accessible, sorry, be included in the budget when that funding comes along.

1878
02:25:15,342 --> 02:25:21,204
[SPEAKER_29]: And Representative Garbelli has said he would fight for that in the spring to make that happen.

1879
02:25:21,944 --> 02:25:23,325
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think I need to go into why.

1880
02:25:23,345 --> 02:25:28,186
[SPEAKER_29]: You guys have already talked about why it is important to renovate the station.

1881
02:25:28,206 --> 02:25:29,307
[SPEAKER_29]: It is long overdue.

1882
02:25:31,350 --> 02:25:42,532
[SPEAKER_29]: and looking forward to your support to join the mayor and our commission in writing a letter to the governor to hopefully include the funding.

1883
02:25:43,432 --> 02:25:43,732
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1884
02:25:44,072 --> 02:25:44,532
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, sir.

1885
02:25:45,973 --> 02:25:46,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion?

1886
02:25:46,613 --> 02:25:47,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bass.

1887
02:25:51,213 --> 02:25:52,994
[SPEAKER_31]: I just want to thank, thank you, Tom.

1888
02:25:53,014 --> 02:25:55,234
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you to the commission for your advocacy on this.

1889
02:25:55,334 --> 02:25:57,034
[SPEAKER_31]: And it is really an essential project.

1890
02:25:57,115 --> 02:25:59,795
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm hoping finally,

1891
02:26:01,008 --> 02:26:05,311
[SPEAKER_31]: It seems like maybe all the ducks are in a row to get this done, and hopefully it can start soon.

1892
02:26:05,672 --> 02:26:06,032
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1893
02:26:08,294 --> 02:26:08,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1894
02:26:08,714 --> 02:26:09,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1895
02:26:10,415 --> 02:26:11,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1896
02:26:11,916 --> 02:26:16,800
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, but I just can't speak, I don't think, in front of it.

1897
02:26:17,721 --> 02:26:19,382
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Marcia Kearson.

1898
02:26:19,442 --> 02:26:21,464
[SPEAKER_22]: I live at 11 Upton Terrace.

1899
02:26:22,204 --> 02:26:29,530
[SPEAKER_22]: I was recently appointed to the Medford Commission for Persons with Disabilities.

1900
02:26:30,329 --> 02:26:32,990
[SPEAKER_22]: and I'm honored to be a member.

1901
02:26:35,110 --> 02:26:36,431
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to be personal.

1902
02:26:36,711 --> 02:26:39,611
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel like I know some of you pretty well.

1903
02:26:39,831 --> 02:26:40,872
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been here before.

1904
02:26:40,892 --> 02:26:43,152
[SPEAKER_22]: I was born in 1941.

1905
02:26:43,312 --> 02:26:58,536
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember when one of my early memories, my two uncles who served in the armed forces came home and how the family felt.

1906
02:26:59,294 --> 02:27:01,315
[SPEAKER_22]: that they came home safe and well.

1907
02:27:02,435 --> 02:27:14,781
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have a lot of empathy for families and for our veterans who cannot use the facilities that are open to the public.

1908
02:27:15,961 --> 02:27:21,144
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would like to point out that many of them have mobility issues.

1909
02:27:22,198 --> 02:27:33,347
[SPEAKER_22]: And some of the mobility issues, like many of us, do not exactly meet how the ADA might be interpreted.

1910
02:27:34,008 --> 02:27:43,816
[SPEAKER_22]: But I will say it's a very broadly written law that includes people who cannot function normally, basically.

1911
02:27:44,777 --> 02:27:46,378
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's many, many people.

1912
02:27:49,786 --> 02:27:56,432
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, when I was growing up, my mother's father, my grandfather happened to be blind.

1913
02:27:57,432 --> 02:28:01,956
[SPEAKER_22]: And I remember that he needed help to go from place to place.

1914
02:28:03,277 --> 02:28:13,465
[SPEAKER_22]: He was not able to do at that point in his life, although he had been an immigrant and a vibrant person, I'm sure when he was younger, he

1915
02:28:17,629 --> 02:28:20,131
[SPEAKER_22]: was no longer able to be independent.

1916
02:28:21,472 --> 02:28:23,173
[SPEAKER_22]: He did receive the help he needed.

1917
02:28:24,674 --> 02:28:30,618
[SPEAKER_22]: Later on in my life, to me, being blind was somewhat normalized because of my grandfather.

1918
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:37,563
[SPEAKER_22]: I met a very interesting man who happened to also be blind, and we ended up getting married.

1919
02:28:39,284 --> 02:28:43,707
[SPEAKER_22]: And part of it was he had a service dog.

1920
02:28:45,121 --> 02:28:48,464
[SPEAKER_22]: And we lived near Central Square in Cambridge.

1921
02:28:49,646 --> 02:28:55,171
[SPEAKER_22]: He was safe going into the subway with a service dog.

1922
02:28:56,772 --> 02:29:07,923
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that was very important to his safety, navigating both the traffic and what

1923
02:29:10,037 --> 02:29:17,683
[SPEAKER_22]: If it had been a platform like the Medford commuter rail, it would have been impossible for him.

1924
02:29:18,223 --> 02:29:30,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Later on, he decided not to use the service dog and it was kind of created a concern about that kind of navigation because of his vision issues.

1925
02:29:32,408 --> 02:29:42,838
[SPEAKER_22]: Part of the point that we're trying to make is that this affects a lot of different people in a lot of different degrees of challenge.

1926
02:29:44,039 --> 02:29:55,510
[SPEAKER_22]: And so some of the people that we've connected with have complained about curb cuts because they have a child in the carriage and they can't

1927
02:29:55,991 --> 02:29:56,972
[SPEAKER_22]: navigate that.

1928
02:29:57,712 --> 02:30:09,259
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember personally taking my young son in an umbrella stroller down I don't know how many stairs to use the subway in Central Square.

1929
02:30:09,279 --> 02:30:19,104
[SPEAKER_22]: And I also remember that there was an elevator, I should think it would go in quotes, was at the other end of the platform.

1930
02:30:20,325 --> 02:30:22,946
[SPEAKER_22]: And it almost never worked.

1931
02:30:23,507 --> 02:30:25,588
[SPEAKER_22]: So I stopped even trying to use it.

1932
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:32,802
[SPEAKER_22]: because it was a long walk to the elevator and back with the umbrella stroller and the toddler.

1933
02:30:35,342 --> 02:30:47,545
[SPEAKER_22]: And so some of the issues you've heard tonight and will probably hear again have an impact on just everybody in the population at different points in their life.

1934
02:30:49,165 --> 02:30:55,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Now I am aging and I have pretty significant arthritis and

1935
02:30:57,215 --> 02:31:04,882
[SPEAKER_22]: Recently, I fractured my wrist, which when you're my age has a cyclical kind of effect.

1936
02:31:06,703 --> 02:31:08,805
[SPEAKER_22]: It affects all your functions.

1937
02:31:09,425 --> 02:31:14,930
[SPEAKER_22]: So my mobility is even less than it was the last time I was here.

1938
02:31:16,491 --> 02:31:24,037
[SPEAKER_22]: And I now have a ramp to my house so I can get in and out easily.

1939
02:31:26,674 --> 02:31:46,060
[SPEAKER_22]: which just points out a difference in my functioning for those of you who were here several years ago, then and now, my mobility's decreased, my ability to stand for long periods of time has decreased significantly.

1940
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:51,322
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not asking for sympathy, I'm trying to explain to you why

1941
02:31:51,862 --> 02:32:12,053
[SPEAKER_22]: This is such a crucial part of our community to serve many, many people that you would not think of necessarily as being disabled, or even our Councilor who has a problem that's temporary.

1942
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:14,461
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you go?

1943
02:32:14,721 --> 02:32:15,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably not.

1944
02:32:16,282 --> 02:32:17,483
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's my point.

1945
02:32:18,003 --> 02:32:21,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Besides the wonderful points that Tom Hamel made.

1946
02:32:21,566 --> 02:32:23,007
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your patience.

1947
02:32:23,708 --> 02:32:27,771
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you all for your service during a challenging time.

1948
02:32:29,293 --> 02:32:29,693
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1949
02:32:30,013 --> 02:32:31,875
[SPEAKER_31]: And Marsha, congratulations on your appointment.

1950
02:32:33,496 --> 02:32:34,637
[SPEAKER_25]: I made it.

1951
02:32:34,737 --> 02:32:36,238
[SPEAKER_31]: It was a celebration.

1952
02:32:36,679 --> 02:32:37,079
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1953
02:32:39,201 --> 02:32:39,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

1954
02:32:42,895 --> 02:32:54,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Although Marsha's mobility may have decreased slightly, your wit, your ability to relay your point has not at all.

1955
02:32:55,101 --> 02:33:04,005
[SPEAKER_18]: And you were instrumental with the surgical center and the neighbors up there to make sure we got the best possible solution.

1956
02:33:04,685 --> 02:33:06,406
[SPEAKER_18]: And I remember your speeches.

1957
02:33:07,066 --> 02:33:09,087
[SPEAKER_18]: They were winded, but they were excellent.

1958
02:33:10,127 --> 02:33:11,348
[SPEAKER_18]: They were excellent.

1959
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:14,096
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to thank you for coming up tonight.

1960
02:33:14,117 --> 02:33:14,638
[SPEAKER_18]: We really do.

1961
02:33:22,815 --> 02:33:23,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1962
02:33:23,976 --> 02:33:24,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1963
02:33:24,636 --> 02:33:35,561
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to add, I want to thank Tom and Marsha for coming out and just the entire commission for the work they do, because these are issues that if they don't affect you, it's so easy to not see because you're not experiencing them.

1964
02:33:36,082 --> 02:33:38,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And working on these issues and raising these issues is so important.

1965
02:33:38,603 --> 02:33:48,508
[SPEAKER_11]: And what President Caraviello said stuck out to me talking about what the MBTA had said previously about shutting down and making the whole station inaccessible.

1966
02:33:49,308 --> 02:33:54,329
[SPEAKER_11]: for the work that needs to be done, but for as long as the station's been around, it's been completely shut down.

1967
02:33:54,689 --> 02:33:57,709
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been completely inaccessible to a large group of people.

1968
02:33:58,130 --> 02:34:03,430
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really hope that now is the time we can actually get something done and make this an accessible station for everyone.

1969
02:34:04,171 --> 02:34:04,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1970
02:34:06,991 --> 02:34:11,592
[SPEAKER_14]: If those are those who remember, it was the, it was the Westminster station that ended up getting all the money.

1971
02:34:12,972 --> 02:34:16,633
[SPEAKER_14]: The station got completely redone, made it all handicap accessible and everything.

1972
02:34:16,653 --> 02:34:18,253
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got, we got nothing out of that.

1973
02:34:19,293 --> 02:34:25,099
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1974
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:26,660
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1975
02:34:27,461 --> 02:34:28,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1976
02:34:28,482 --> 02:34:39,173
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-5-2-3, offered by Vice President Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council wish John and Linda Pittorino a very happy 50th wedding anniversary.

1977
02:34:40,002 --> 02:34:41,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Mister President, thank you very much.

1978
02:34:42,283 --> 02:34:45,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Linda Pittorino is one of the unsung heroes of City Hall.

1979
02:34:46,885 --> 02:34:56,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Works down in the Metro Consumer Commission, helping out consumers file complaints against unscrupulous scammers and the like, Mr. President.

1980
02:34:57,208 --> 02:35:01,370
[SPEAKER_21]: But with that being said, just recently, Linda and John celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.

1981
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:04,992
[SPEAKER_21]: Over the years, I've gotten to know both John and Linda very well.

1982
02:35:05,653 --> 02:35:06,533
[SPEAKER_21]: They're a great couple.

1983
02:35:06,613 --> 02:35:07,854
[SPEAKER_21]: They're two little lovebirds.

1984
02:35:07,874 --> 02:35:08,615
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't miss them.

1985
02:35:08,675 --> 02:35:12,397
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll see them at the Little League Field watching little Johnny play t-ball.

1986
02:35:12,497 --> 02:35:16,901
[SPEAKER_21]: And I had the pleasure of playing against their grandson this year a couple of times.

1987
02:35:17,001 --> 02:35:21,324
[SPEAKER_21]: And to see them there cheering on their grandson is really something else, Mr. President.

1988
02:35:21,424 --> 02:35:23,905
[SPEAKER_21]: I've really come full circle for them, and I wish them all the best.

1989
02:35:23,965 --> 02:35:30,210
[SPEAKER_21]: But Linda and John are two great people, and they found each other 50 years of wedded bliss, and I wish them 50 more.

1990
02:35:32,673 --> 02:35:43,882
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I could put it, I've known Linda and John since elementary school, back to the old Lincoln Junior High, when we turned over to Kennedy, I mean, the Lincoln High, Lincoln School.

1991
02:35:45,303 --> 02:35:48,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they started dating like in junior high school.

1992
02:35:48,866 --> 02:35:52,528
[SPEAKER_14]: So they've been sweethearts for many, many years.

1993
02:35:52,608 --> 02:35:58,233
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I've known them both, going back to elementary school, they're two wonderful people.

1994
02:35:58,713 --> 02:35:59,914
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm glad to call them my friends.

1995
02:36:02,132 --> 02:36:04,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck to them on their 50th anniversary.

1996
02:36:06,173 --> 02:36:09,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Now on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1997
02:36:09,454 --> 02:36:10,155
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1998
02:36:11,115 --> 02:36:11,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1999
02:36:12,015 --> 02:36:12,095
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1, 5-2-6.

2000
02:36:18,909 --> 02:36:33,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Morell, be it so resolved that the City Council request that the DCI move forward with much-needed safety improvements, including crosswalks, improved signage on the Mystic Valley Parkway, High Street, near the mixer lane, with all due urgency.

2001
02:36:33,858 --> 02:36:34,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

2002
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:35,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2003
02:36:35,739 --> 02:36:40,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Councilor Marks introduced something, a similar paper probably over a year ago at this point.

2004
02:36:40,842 --> 02:36:53,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I know sometimes it feels like we're banging our head against the wall asking for DCR to do anything on the many streets they operate in our city, but I'm responding to requests from a number of residents that have concerns about safety in this area, a need for

2005
02:36:54,287 --> 02:37:00,431
[SPEAKER_11]: crosswalks around the Rotary at High Street and Mystic Valley Parkway, similar to what exists in Arlington, which I believe is what Councilor Marks requested.

2006
02:37:01,192 --> 02:37:05,494
[SPEAKER_11]: There is now a beautiful, you know, master parkway plan from DCR.

2007
02:37:05,514 --> 02:37:09,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, if there is one thing we know in Medford, we have no shortage of plans.

2008
02:37:09,077 --> 02:37:10,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the action that we really struggle with.

2009
02:37:11,498 --> 02:37:20,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I've spoken with Representative Garbali about, he did put in a request for DCR to put in something in the interim, whether it's crosswalks or anything.

2010
02:37:20,165 --> 02:37:26,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I think as people are home more, they're noticing how much people are speeding, they're noticing their neighbors as they try to cross the street.

2011
02:37:26,409 --> 02:37:27,270
[SPEAKER_11]: They simply cannot.

2012
02:37:27,330 --> 02:37:29,792
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just asking that we put out, you know,

2013
02:37:30,292 --> 02:37:44,601
[SPEAKER_11]: another request to DCR to take some action on this, you know, action before they even start working on the master plan, because we know how long those can take, how long I think it can take to actually get funding, but there's a need for immediate safety improvements right now for residents.

2014
02:37:44,661 --> 02:37:46,642
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I'm looking for here.

2015
02:37:48,303 --> 02:37:54,887
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could ask it to amend something that going home today, I drove by the Craddock Bridge

2016
02:37:55,725 --> 02:38:04,050
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if anybody noticed, but there was two large trees going directly across by the bridge.

2017
02:38:04,130 --> 02:38:08,853
[SPEAKER_14]: So if a boat wants to get by there, it is totally impassable.

2018
02:38:08,873 --> 02:38:11,215
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could, if I could ask you if you put that on there.

2019
02:38:11,495 --> 02:38:21,161
[SPEAKER_14]: So the DCI goes down there and gets out of it because that's a total public safety hazard, especially when you get all the kayaks or anything, but that right now it's totally impassable.

2020
02:38:22,102 --> 02:38:22,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

2021
02:38:23,399 --> 02:38:42,211
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, if you're amenable to it, Councilor Morell, I'd also like to just add Mystic River Road to that, basically the same thing that connects with that Rotary A. It's one of the roads that intersects with that Rotary, but there have been issues with that whole stretch all the way up to Duggar Park.

2022
02:38:44,012 --> 02:38:49,976
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Morell for offering this

2023
02:38:51,310 --> 02:39:16,790
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I've been critical over the last number of years regarding the inaction by DCR, the fact that we have so many state roads in this community, roads in which taxpayers reside on, pay the same tax that any other resident pays, but doesn't get the city services because they're on, quote, a DCR state road, Mr. President.

2024
02:39:17,307 --> 02:39:23,815
[SPEAKER_18]: And as far as I'm concerned, that's unacceptable and very difficult conversation to have with a resident.

2025
02:39:24,496 --> 02:39:36,329
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe as a community, and this is no reflection on anyone in particular, but we fall short of the mark regarding holding DCR and the state accountable for anything.

2026
02:39:37,170 --> 02:39:45,115
[SPEAKER_18]: And in my opinion, we should be having these meetings, not just with the administration, but with DCI.

2027
02:39:45,415 --> 02:40:01,585
[SPEAKER_18]: We should have a standard meeting that we have, because there's enough on our agenda that deals with, I can give a laundry list of items that I'm still waiting responses on, never heard back, that we should have a standing meeting with DCI.

2028
02:40:02,505 --> 02:40:13,315
[SPEAKER_18]: and maybe under your leadership, Mr. President, and it doesn't need to include the administration, it could be us with DCR, but I think it's vital, Mr. President, in order to address our constituents.

2029
02:40:14,156 --> 02:40:20,342
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's one thing to bring it up before the council, but then as Councilor Morell mentioned, the second step is action, right?

2030
02:40:21,163 --> 02:40:22,545
[SPEAKER_18]: lip service and then action.

2031
02:40:22,885 --> 02:40:25,428
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, so I'm always waiting for the action part of it.

2032
02:40:26,069 --> 02:40:28,551
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, it's, it's a few and far between.

2033
02:40:28,571 --> 02:40:41,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I know many of the agencies are shorthanded, uh, and I understand that, but, um, the, there has to be better dialogue and communication, uh, so we can represent our constituency.

2034
02:40:42,631 --> 02:40:47,832
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I would ask that at some point, Mr. President, I will talk to the representatives about doing that.

2035
02:40:47,872 --> 02:41:00,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe if we can brainstorm it, you know, even if we had it once every, you know, quarterly, you know, you know, quarterly, every every 3 months to just sit down and go over what's outstanding, because that doesn't happen.

2036
02:41:01,116 --> 02:41:02,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm so unresponsive.

2037
02:41:02,776 --> 02:41:02,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2038
02:41:02,996 --> 02:41:08,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still waiting on other stuff from a year and a half ago that residents keep on emailing me saying what's going on.

2039
02:41:08,741 --> 02:41:17,968
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, it's just, it's unfortunate because you know, it gives, it gives government, state, city, just gives it a bad name, Mr. President.

2040
02:41:18,028 --> 02:41:19,910
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we're all here to get results.

2041
02:41:20,751 --> 02:41:23,233
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate the fact that this was put on tonight.

2042
02:41:23,253 --> 02:41:25,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2043
02:41:27,936 --> 02:41:34,819
[SPEAKER_31]: I think, sure, we can go through the representatives, but I think it would be great to have someone from their transportation division working directly with us.

2044
02:41:35,419 --> 02:41:37,320
[SPEAKER_31]: I am a resident of a DCR street.

2045
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:46,724
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, we've got a few branches that are dead overhanging, you know, all of our cars and our home, and you call and you don't get a response on that one-on-one basis.

2046
02:41:46,884 --> 02:41:47,804
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't get a response.

2047
02:41:48,945 --> 02:41:50,945
[SPEAKER_31]: And if I'm not getting a response, nobody's getting a response.

2048
02:41:50,965 --> 02:41:53,106
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think that's a great idea.

2049
02:41:53,126 --> 02:41:57,188
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so on the motion by Councilor Morell,

2050
02:41:58,314 --> 02:42:02,357
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by myself and Council of bears.

2051
02:42:04,078 --> 02:42:10,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Say second by second by Council night, I mean that also is a is amended by Council marks.

2052
02:42:12,944 --> 02:42:13,645
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor.

2053
02:42:14,545 --> 02:42:20,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes on to one 5 to 7, 5, 2, 8, 5, 5, 2, 9, by Council Scott belly.

2054
02:42:21,310 --> 02:42:23,071
[SPEAKER_14]: He's asked that those be tables.

2055
02:42:25,327 --> 02:42:45,740
[SPEAKER_14]: to 1, 5, 3, 0, offered by Council of Mayors, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request that the City Administration urgently prioritize the placement of rectangular rapid flashing beacons for pedestrian safety at the crosswalks across Wintham Street and at the intersections of West Street and Summer Street.

2056
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:51,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that the City Administration report back to the Council on additional

2057
02:42:52,465 --> 02:42:55,886
[SPEAKER_14]: pedestrian and bike safety measures that can be implemented on Winter Street.

2058
02:42:55,926 --> 02:42:56,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

2059
02:42:58,006 --> 02:42:58,787
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2060
02:42:58,807 --> 02:43:00,167
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm tempted to say here we are again.

2061
02:43:00,187 --> 02:43:04,468
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, but you know, these are, these are constant issues in our community.

2062
02:43:04,508 --> 02:43:11,230
[SPEAKER_31]: We have roadways and sidewalk areas that are really unsafe for a lot of different modes of travel, including people in cars.

2063
02:43:11,550 --> 02:43:16,451
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, I was in this area a couple of weeks ago and a resident told me,

2064
02:43:17,011 --> 02:43:32,183
[SPEAKER_31]: that their child, and they've put a letter out, this is information that I think they might be sending to us as well at some point, was in the crosswalk, was hit by a vehicle, flipped up into the air, and luckily landed on their hip and not their head.

2065
02:43:33,510 --> 02:43:37,614
[SPEAKER_31]: And this is the third incident in the area in recent times.

2066
02:43:38,695 --> 02:43:47,442
[SPEAKER_31]: Another one is the reason that there's now the bollards and the repainted crosswalk, which we also approved, I requested, down by the ball fields.

2067
02:43:47,843 --> 02:43:49,644
[SPEAKER_31]: But it's an incredibly dangerous stretch of road.

2068
02:43:49,704 --> 02:43:52,307
[SPEAKER_31]: I personally have been in an accident on that stretch of road.

2069
02:43:52,347 --> 02:43:53,468
[SPEAKER_31]: Luckily, it was car to car.

2070
02:43:55,289 --> 02:44:02,373
[SPEAKER_31]: But, you know, the residents really that Summer Street and Winter Street and Winthrop Street intersection is a really tough spot.

2071
02:44:02,833 --> 02:44:04,634
[SPEAKER_31]: People make two lines on Summer Street.

2072
02:44:04,654 --> 02:44:06,014
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't see if you're turning left.

2073
02:44:06,055 --> 02:44:07,175
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't see if you're turning right.

2074
02:44:07,555 --> 02:44:08,756
[SPEAKER_31]: People are trying to beat traffic.

2075
02:44:08,796 --> 02:44:12,838
[SPEAKER_31]: They speed out and then they're right in the middle of a crosswalk and there's somebody there.

2076
02:44:13,528 --> 02:44:15,770
[SPEAKER_31]: It's the same street that Benford High School is on.

2077
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:18,132
[SPEAKER_31]: There's an MBTA bus route on that street.

2078
02:44:18,572 --> 02:44:23,476
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't have bike lanes, but it's obviously Winthrop Street's a very important thoroughfare in our community.

2079
02:44:24,216 --> 02:44:37,226
[SPEAKER_31]: So these are some short-term, I've already spoken with Director Blake about this, Transportation Director Todd Blake, but I wanted to put it on the agenda just so that we voiced our support that we have some of these kind of more short-term

2080
02:44:38,447 --> 02:44:42,331
[SPEAKER_31]: mitigation measures, which are the flashing beacons, which we can do for an affordable cost.

2081
02:44:42,992 --> 02:44:58,786
[SPEAKER_31]: And then I think really a long-term look at the Winthrop Street corridor around painting, markings, stop signs, and the like, because, you know, once here, again, there was a similar mitigation with the raised crosswalk across from the Wesley Church up by Orchard.

2082
02:45:00,247 --> 02:45:02,849
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe we need to start looking at that all the way down Winthrop Street.

2083
02:45:04,798 --> 02:45:06,740
[SPEAKER_31]: just because it's a serious problem.

2084
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:10,083
[SPEAKER_31]: And I was just really glad to hear that this young person was fine.

2085
02:45:10,503 --> 02:45:11,424
[SPEAKER_31]: She was up walking.

2086
02:45:11,524 --> 02:45:12,565
[SPEAKER_31]: She was like, I'm okay.

2087
02:45:13,005 --> 02:45:15,107
[SPEAKER_31]: But it was a recovery period.

2088
02:45:15,167 --> 02:45:16,949
[SPEAKER_31]: And luckily it was not a worse injury.

2089
02:45:17,449 --> 02:45:17,810
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2090
02:45:18,450 --> 02:45:22,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2091
02:45:22,574 --> 02:45:25,897
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to add, I know that woman spoke to her.

2092
02:45:27,578 --> 02:45:29,340
[SPEAKER_25]: What happens in this area,

2093
02:45:30,083 --> 02:45:40,666
[SPEAKER_25]: If there's a ball game going on at the ballpark at the corner of Winthrop and Route 16, cars line up all along Winthrop Street to make it narrow there.

2094
02:45:41,486 --> 02:45:43,087
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's part of the problem.

2095
02:45:43,527 --> 02:45:49,329
[SPEAKER_25]: The other problem is that they opened up a bagel place on the corner of West Street and Winthrop Street.

2096
02:45:50,009 --> 02:45:52,150
[SPEAKER_25]: And it will right now open on the weekends.

2097
02:45:52,710 --> 02:45:59,172
[SPEAKER_25]: So when the bagel place is open, there's cars parked on both sides of West Street to go to the bagel place.

2098
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:08,604
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, some of the residents at the end of West Street told me that the cars even blocked the residents' driveways, they can't get out of their driveways because they're going into the bagel shop.

2099
02:46:09,424 --> 02:46:15,928
[SPEAKER_25]: So, yes, the flashing signs may help, the crosswalks may help, but the activity both at the ballpark

2100
02:46:16,668 --> 02:46:20,010
[SPEAKER_25]: And the bagel shop is contributing to some of the congestion there.

2101
02:46:20,711 --> 02:46:28,296
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I mean, it doesn't contribute to the fact that cars speed up that street, but still, that's some factors that have to be considered.

2102
02:46:29,096 --> 02:46:32,879
[SPEAKER_25]: Just because I happen to be here and I'm in that neighborhood, I know what's going on there.

2103
02:46:32,899 --> 02:46:34,840
[SPEAKER_25]: I just thought I'd add that.

2104
02:46:36,341 --> 02:46:36,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2105
02:46:38,203 --> 02:46:38,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Member Morell.

2106
02:46:40,662 --> 02:46:41,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2107
02:46:41,323 --> 02:46:43,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Bears for bringing this forward.

2108
02:46:43,046 --> 02:46:55,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I was curious if we could have a minute just to get an update on the sharrows that, so they're supposed to be the updated bike infrastructure when Winthrop Street is repaved whenever that happens, but there is the portion that was repaved, but they did not add the sharrows.

2109
02:46:56,186 --> 02:47:01,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I know showers aren't perfect but I think it does contribute to people just understanding that this is a multimodal road.

2110
02:47:02,007 --> 02:47:04,008
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't just a road you fly down.

2111
02:47:04,028 --> 02:47:06,588
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what people walk, bike, they're trying to cross on.

2112
02:47:06,628 --> 02:47:11,729
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could just get an update on that because I believe something strange happened, why the paint wasn't put down.

2113
02:47:11,749 --> 02:47:12,889
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could get an update there.

2114
02:47:15,610 --> 02:47:15,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2115
02:47:18,010 --> 02:47:18,451
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the biggest?

2116
02:47:19,291 --> 02:47:20,131
[SPEAKER_31]: Ferro's issue.

2117
02:47:21,511 --> 02:47:25,292
[SPEAKER_31]: I was recently held to task by what I will call bike Twitter.

2118
02:47:26,038 --> 02:47:31,101
[SPEAKER_31]: about that Sharrows are sometimes even cause more trouble than they're worth.

2119
02:47:31,742 --> 02:47:40,967
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not saying I'm against them, but I think maybe in addition to what you said, we should get the bicycle commissions.

2120
02:47:41,107 --> 02:47:42,268
[SPEAKER_31]: What are their recommendations?

2121
02:47:44,990 --> 02:47:49,953
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, as a cyclist, I would say that it's perhaps divided how people feel about Sharrows.

2122
02:47:49,993 --> 02:47:51,314
[SPEAKER_31]: You're a biker, so I defer to you.

2123
02:47:52,472 --> 02:48:03,464
[SPEAKER_14]: What's happened now, since they closed South Street, the traffic is now going down George, and it's going down that area where you're talking about, because they say, because you can't cut across anymore.

2124
02:48:03,944 --> 02:48:06,447
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we fix one problem, we cause another.

2125
02:48:06,467 --> 02:48:13,735
[SPEAKER_31]: One more thing on this, I think, you know, at the end of the day,

2126
02:48:14,578 --> 02:48:17,760
[SPEAKER_31]: The issue isn't necessarily the congestion or the rerouting.

2127
02:48:18,241 --> 02:48:20,843
[SPEAKER_31]: It's the speed at which the cars are able to travel on the streets.

2128
02:48:21,463 --> 02:48:23,865
[SPEAKER_31]: And, you know, we have our 25 citywide.

2129
02:48:24,325 --> 02:48:30,349
[SPEAKER_31]: I think Winthrop might be 30 in that area, but, you know, we've got wide roads.

2130
02:48:30,390 --> 02:48:35,093
[SPEAKER_31]: We've got, Winthrop's an exception, but, you know, for example, West Street, it's an incredibly wide road.

2131
02:48:35,923 --> 02:48:40,226
[SPEAKER_31]: And people just are encouraged to drive quickly down those very wide roads.

2132
02:48:40,286 --> 02:48:59,221
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think looking at, obviously, the short-term solutions around paint and all of that, but looking long-term, if we are going to be doing some significant revamping, hopefully, of roads and sidewalks going forward, since we now know we have a multi-, near $100 million backlog of work, we really need to look at the width of our roads.

2133
02:49:00,442 --> 02:49:00,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2134
02:49:01,102 --> 02:49:02,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President, did you want to speak?

2135
02:49:05,054 --> 02:49:06,239
[SPEAKER_14]: rapid flashing beacons.

2136
02:49:07,183 --> 02:49:08,970
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Bears.

2137
02:49:15,294 --> 02:49:26,364
[SPEAKER_18]: for putting this on, but the rapid flashing beacon lights that were put at the corner of Riverside and Bradbury, they were installed probably two months ago, no longer functioning.

2138
02:49:26,744 --> 02:49:29,687
[SPEAKER_18]: They're solar lights and they're not working.

2139
02:49:29,707 --> 02:49:35,112
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would just ask if, if Councilor Bears wouldn't mind amending this, if the city could check into that, Mr. President.

2140
02:49:35,472 --> 02:49:40,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing that you're going to amend it, I got one more for you to amend it, that the brand new one that they just put up, uh,

2141
02:49:41,448 --> 02:49:45,232
[SPEAKER_14]: on the corner of Mystic and High are going all the time.

2142
02:49:45,272 --> 02:49:45,892
[SPEAKER_14]: They never shut off.

2143
02:49:49,716 --> 02:49:50,817
[SPEAKER_31]: I've seemed to be working great.

2144
02:49:52,698 --> 02:49:58,504
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor High and Mystic.

2145
02:49:59,104 --> 02:50:07,812
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Bears, as amended by Councilor Marks and President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2146
02:50:09,682 --> 02:50:10,322
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2147
02:50:10,522 --> 02:50:12,283
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, motion passes.

2148
02:50:12,923 --> 02:50:17,224
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could pause for a five minute recess.

2149
02:50:18,625 --> 02:50:20,445
[SPEAKER_14]: See, we've been here for the past three hours.

2150
02:50:20,945 --> 02:50:22,426
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we can get through this in five minutes.

2151
02:50:24,206 --> 02:50:25,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to take a five minute recess.

2152
02:50:27,227 --> 02:50:28,828
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, yes, yeah.

2153
02:50:29,228 --> 02:50:30,408
[SPEAKER_14]: All in favor, motion passes.

2154
02:50:30,788 --> 02:50:31,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Five minute recess.

2155
02:50:32,289 --> 02:50:33,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Layton, all those in favor?

2156
02:50:34,349 --> 02:50:35,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2157
02:50:36,330 --> 02:50:36,630
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2158
02:50:38,638 --> 02:50:40,579
[SPEAKER_14]: 21531 offered by Councilor Bears.

2159
02:50:42,599 --> 02:50:52,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Transportation Director work with the MassDOT to address serious issues of speeding on Highland Avenue in the interest of public safety.

2160
02:50:52,763 --> 02:50:53,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

2161
02:50:53,883 --> 02:50:54,823
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2162
02:50:55,243 --> 02:50:56,184
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll make this one quick.

2163
02:50:56,644 --> 02:51:00,745
[SPEAKER_31]: Highland Avenue in Medford is a MassDOT managed road.

2164
02:51:01,385 --> 02:51:05,807
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a lot of speeding going on on that road, even though the speed limit is

2165
02:51:07,313 --> 02:51:08,413
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe 30 miles an hour.

2166
02:51:08,433 --> 02:51:13,954
[SPEAKER_31]: So, if the transportation director could meet with MassDOT to see if there are mitigation measures.

2167
02:51:14,635 --> 02:51:15,795
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a long straight road.

2168
02:51:16,195 --> 02:51:19,195
[SPEAKER_31]: There's a lot of school buses and kids who are in that area.

2169
02:51:19,395 --> 02:51:19,736
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2170
02:51:20,376 --> 02:51:23,456
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the motion by Councilor Bears.

2171
02:51:24,377 --> 02:51:24,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

2172
02:51:25,077 --> 02:51:29,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, just if we can also add, if Councilor Bears wouldn't mind, the painting of crosswalks.

2173
02:51:31,438 --> 02:51:35,039
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been unsuccessful for the last probably year and a half trying to get crosswalks painted.

2174
02:51:39,062 --> 02:51:46,089
[SPEAKER_14]: on highland that he is okay so on the motion by Council is second by vice president night as amended by Council marks all those in favor.

2175
02:51:46,990 --> 02:51:47,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2176
02:51:47,830 --> 02:51:53,916
[SPEAKER_14]: 2, 1, 5, 3, to offer by Council is the result of the city Council.

2177
02:51:54,997 --> 02:51:57,880
[SPEAKER_14]: That the same as administration report back to the council.

2178
02:51:58,343 --> 02:52:13,195
[SPEAKER_14]: on the city's advocacy's efforts to ensure that the Silver Line extension proposed for north of Boston includes stops in Medford, including Wellington Station, and the potential for a route that includes Route 16 and Mystic Avenue.

2179
02:52:13,235 --> 02:52:13,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

2180
02:52:13,716 --> 02:52:15,577
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2181
02:52:16,555 --> 02:52:26,828
[SPEAKER_31]: for I believe at least since January, the state and the MBTA have been undergoing a process to map out the new route for Silver Line 3 extension.

2182
02:52:27,169 --> 02:52:32,255
[SPEAKER_31]: If people don't know, the Silver Line is the bus rapid transit service of the MBTA.

2183
02:52:33,557 --> 02:52:43,447
[SPEAKER_31]: Currently, I believe the route that they are favoring would take Silver Line Extension and run it almost to Medford and run down 99 in Everett down to Sullivan Square.

2184
02:52:43,467 --> 02:52:53,437
[SPEAKER_31]: I think a preferred route for Medford certainly would be to come over to Wellington Station, and there are options for a route that would even go all the way down the Mystic Valley Parkway.

2185
02:52:53,877 --> 02:53:13,361
[SPEAKER_31]: to Mystic Avenue and then down Mystic Avenue to Sullivan Station, which I think would be a huge benefit to our community, adding bus rapid transit service in one of the fastest growing areas in the city and an area that is currently, I would say, underserved by the MBTA, as much of our community is.

2186
02:53:13,421 --> 02:53:23,083
[SPEAKER_31]: I've also received some communications from residents that they feel like this could help augment the MBTA's continued refusal not to restore the express buses from Medford Square.

2187
02:53:24,383 --> 02:53:34,307
[SPEAKER_31]: And I also know that we've had David Walker here for many hours at this point, if he would like to speak after the Councilors are done with discussion.

2188
02:53:34,487 --> 02:53:34,827
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2189
02:53:36,708 --> 02:53:40,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Mr. President.

2190
02:53:40,249 --> 02:53:41,550
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be my concern.

2191
02:53:42,984 --> 02:53:50,406
[SPEAKER_21]: to pay Paul and we're going to say give us the Silver Line but we don't want a one seat, one ride express buses and that's a concern for me.

2192
02:53:51,526 --> 02:54:08,309
[SPEAKER_21]: I think anybody in this community that wants to take public transit would much rather get on the bus in Medford and take a express bus right down to Haymarket than to get on the Silver Line and take that Sullivan Station or Wellington Station and then get on a train and then take the train to Haymarket.

2193
02:54:09,410 --> 02:54:10,770
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just my opinion being a

2194
02:54:11,275 --> 02:54:12,976
[SPEAKER_21]: the former commuter into Boston.

2195
02:54:13,756 --> 02:54:16,338
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't necessarily always the prettiest ride when you took the train.

2196
02:54:16,358 --> 02:54:22,061
[SPEAKER_21]: That one seat, one ride was very much more enticing than to have to do the switch.

2197
02:54:22,781 --> 02:54:36,929
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why, you know, Express Bus Commuter Rail always seem to be great options for us here in the community and it hate to implement this this silver line project that would eliminate the one seat, one ride options that we

2198
02:54:40,590 --> 02:54:44,872
[SPEAKER_21]: hamper our ability to restore them back to the level that they were at previously.

2199
02:54:45,873 --> 02:54:58,960
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm certainly aware that we do need to have many more transit options here in the city of Medford for our community based upon our close proximity to the city, the congestion that we have here in the community as well.

2200
02:55:00,141 --> 02:55:05,143
[SPEAKER_21]: certainly would warrant additional resources from the MBTA in terms of service provision.

2201
02:55:05,384 --> 02:55:08,666
[SPEAKER_21]: The question is, are we robbing Peter to pay Paul to get it?

2202
02:55:08,706 --> 02:55:13,949
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we're getting the green line and as the green lines coming to fruition, we're seeing our express buses get eliminated.

2203
02:55:14,409 --> 02:55:23,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, if we petition for the silver line and we get the silver line, what is going to be that opposite and exact reaction to that action?

2204
02:55:23,994 --> 02:55:26,556
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess that's the question because it's all driven by ridership.

2205
02:55:28,254 --> 02:55:32,338
[SPEAKER_31]: And to Councilor Knight's point, I'm certainly in favor of a both and approach.

2206
02:55:32,398 --> 02:55:41,805
[SPEAKER_31]: I think given the outlay that this city is paying every year to the MBTA, even if we had fully restored express buses, we're still not getting what we pay for.

2207
02:55:42,606 --> 02:55:49,211
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think, you know, with the express buses and then this, this would, if this route were to be coming to existence, I would be fine

2208
02:55:50,543 --> 02:55:53,645
[SPEAKER_31]: with them even just extending it to Wellington Station, I think that would be a start.

2209
02:55:53,785 --> 02:56:06,491
[SPEAKER_31]: I think the longer route all the way across the city would be really something that's missing, which is a cross city connection from Wellington Station to South Medford to Mystic Avenue, which is something that we don't have right now.

2210
02:56:07,391 --> 02:56:08,192
[SPEAKER_31]: But I agree with you.

2211
02:56:08,252 --> 02:56:12,514
[SPEAKER_31]: I certainly think it should not come at the expense of restoring the express buses.

2212
02:56:19,450 --> 02:56:19,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2213
02:56:19,851 --> 02:56:23,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I've been following this silver line.

2214
02:56:23,894 --> 02:56:25,896
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been around for a couple of years now.

2215
02:56:25,916 --> 02:56:27,077
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been discussing it.

2216
02:56:27,857 --> 02:56:35,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, the larger concern I have now was a recent report that I read talking about a 700 million shortfall.

2217
02:56:35,964 --> 02:56:37,065
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe the number was over

2218
02:56:37,565 --> 02:56:39,246
[SPEAKER_18]: three-year period, three or four-year period.

2219
02:56:39,266 --> 02:56:41,627
[SPEAKER_18]: You might be mistaken on the years.

2220
02:56:42,487 --> 02:56:54,053
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think as a community, we have to be proactive rather than to react once these cuts come down from the T, which you better believe is going to happen.

2221
02:56:54,673 --> 02:57:05,138
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think some of the issues we have to look at, like I believe we were promised that they were going to restore the 325 at 326 and some of the other lines that were cut.

2222
02:57:06,079 --> 02:57:10,781
[SPEAKER_18]: But now with these additional cuts, I think we have to meet on this.

2223
02:57:11,421 --> 02:57:16,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I really do, to discuss any information that T can give us.

2224
02:57:17,384 --> 02:57:20,186
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's few and far between, let me tell you.

2225
02:57:20,586 --> 02:57:22,787
[SPEAKER_18]: The MBTA does not share anything with you.

2226
02:57:23,848 --> 02:57:31,753
[SPEAKER_18]: and you only find out when all of a sudden the bus is no longer in service or whatever the transportation mode may be.

2227
02:57:32,254 --> 02:57:36,697
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate Councilor Bears offering this.

2228
02:57:37,037 --> 02:57:40,840
[SPEAKER_18]: I think anything that we can do, you know, we have to take a look at it.

2229
02:57:41,401 --> 02:57:49,647
[SPEAKER_18]: And if it's one or the other, then we have to take even a closer look, but I wouldn't throw anything away, any increased access I think we have to look at.

2230
02:57:52,203 --> 02:57:52,864
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2231
02:57:52,904 --> 02:57:56,027
[SPEAKER_26]: I also want to thank Councilor Piz for bringing this forward.

2232
02:57:56,127 --> 02:58:00,811
[SPEAKER_26]: I do like the idea of being able to connect Wellington to South Medford.

2233
02:58:00,971 --> 02:58:07,337
[SPEAKER_26]: I would definitely be in favor of that, but I also am concerned with the express routes as well.

2234
02:58:07,377 --> 02:58:10,480
[SPEAKER_26]: As someone who has taken the 325 and the 326 for a good 15 years, it's

2235
02:58:15,061 --> 02:58:16,782
[SPEAKER_26]: it's had an impact not having it around.

2236
02:58:17,362 --> 02:58:23,106
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm receiving calls and actually have an agenda item a little bit later, specifically about those bus routes.

2237
02:58:23,726 --> 02:58:27,128
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm getting calls from various people that I've taken the bus with.

2238
02:58:27,188 --> 02:58:28,769
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sure Council Member March, you probably have too.

2239
02:58:28,809 --> 02:58:30,130
[SPEAKER_26]: I know you're a commuter as well.

2240
02:58:30,790 --> 02:58:39,436
[SPEAKER_26]: And these are concerned, people are concerned about these existing routes, or I should say at one point were existing routes and are no longer available.

2241
02:58:40,336 --> 02:58:43,278
[SPEAKER_26]: You can even look at the 710 that runs up into the heights.

2242
02:58:43,894 --> 02:58:45,234
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's an issue as well.

2243
02:58:45,314 --> 02:58:54,077
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I mean, Silverline, I'm fine with, but I do get concerned that they're taking away routes that were definitely used.

2244
02:58:54,157 --> 02:58:57,038
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, I wouldn't want to give up one for another.

2245
02:58:57,058 --> 02:58:57,758
[SPEAKER_26]: I want both.

2246
02:58:58,899 --> 02:59:07,421
[SPEAKER_26]: And, you know, both Silver and the existing routes that are no longer, or have been temporarily taken away, I guess, or suspended.

2247
02:59:08,142 --> 02:59:09,222
[SPEAKER_26]: But I thank you for bringing this forward.

2248
02:59:13,574 --> 02:59:16,235
[SPEAKER_31]: I definitely appreciate that concern.

2249
02:59:16,255 --> 02:59:20,917
[SPEAKER_31]: I think to be direct, this is a process that's ongoing.

2250
02:59:21,197 --> 02:59:22,958
[SPEAKER_31]: They're gonna do a Silver Line extension.

2251
02:59:23,598 --> 02:59:26,400
[SPEAKER_31]: There are some options that include Medford and some options that don't.

2252
02:59:26,780 --> 02:59:35,384
[SPEAKER_31]: It seems to me that the decision-making process on that is not at least directly tied to the decision-making process on restoring the old lines.

2253
02:59:35,764 --> 02:59:39,305
[SPEAKER_31]: And to Councilor Marks' point, I do think we should meet on the T funding issue.

2254
02:59:40,106 --> 02:59:42,167
[SPEAKER_31]: I did talk to Representative Garbley about this a bit.

2255
02:59:43,176 --> 02:59:47,620
[SPEAKER_31]: the legislature is really gonna need to take action to come up with a long-term solution there.

2256
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:56,647
[SPEAKER_31]: Clearly ridership and office use in the downtown core, which is the main revenue generator for the T for fares, is going to be disrupted potentially forever.

2257
02:59:56,667 --> 03:00:01,892
[SPEAKER_31]: I think given the situation, there's gonna need to be a long-term fix there.

2258
03:00:02,572 --> 03:00:06,556
[SPEAKER_31]: I certainly hope it doesn't come at the expense of local communities and local contributions.

2259
03:00:07,597 --> 03:00:08,938
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think we should advocate and say,

2260
03:00:09,541 --> 03:00:15,825
[SPEAKER_31]: We support you addressing this shortfall, not cutting service further, because that's just going to create the downward spiral, right?

2261
03:00:15,925 --> 03:00:19,046
[SPEAKER_31]: That's, that's the issue we have now is services down.

2262
03:00:19,126 --> 03:00:20,087
[SPEAKER_31]: So let's cut service.

2263
03:00:20,147 --> 03:00:22,889
[SPEAKER_31]: And then service is going to go down more because the service isn't there.

2264
03:00:23,449 --> 03:00:26,270
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, it's a public good needs to be funded by the public.

2265
03:00:26,631 --> 03:00:31,593
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, and I think that the state house certainly has more than enough options to figure out a way to address that.

2266
03:00:31,613 --> 03:00:34,315
[SPEAKER_31]: And I hope that we can meet and say, do your job.

2267
03:00:34,575 --> 03:00:34,875
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2268
03:00:37,217 --> 03:00:37,737
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion.

2269
03:00:39,057 --> 03:00:39,918
[SPEAKER_14]: by Councilor Bears.

2270
03:00:39,938 --> 03:00:41,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry, did you want to speak of this, sir?

2271
03:00:41,639 --> 03:00:41,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

2272
03:00:43,881 --> 03:00:58,873
[SPEAKER_27]: A couple of public meetings that the MBTA held on this matter, and I noticed that the MBTA's presenters showed a map of the study area and then a list of municipalities that were included.

2273
03:00:59,553 --> 03:01:07,339
[SPEAKER_27]: And even though that map included parts of Medford, the area where Wellington Station is, the list of municipalities that were included did not include Medford.

2274
03:01:07,857 --> 03:01:10,339
[SPEAKER_27]: and I asked the MBTA why they didn't have a good answer.

2275
03:01:10,619 --> 03:01:21,807
[SPEAKER_27]: So my fear is that the city might be excluded from this process for whatever reason because the MBTA didn't include, didn't invite, didn't allow the city to come in and give our perspective.

2276
03:01:22,467 --> 03:01:25,850
[SPEAKER_27]: So I hope that the city council will urge the administration to

2277
03:01:26,590 --> 03:01:30,371
[SPEAKER_27]: to forcefully make the case for extending Silver Line service into Medford.

2278
03:01:30,651 --> 03:01:50,058
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd also like to point out that the Silver Line is important not just for connecting Wellington or Route 16, but it continues on through Chelsea over to the airport and to the Seaport District of Boston, both of which are areas that are extremely difficult to reach by public transportation from Medford, even when the Green Line is completed and our express buses are restored.

2279
03:01:50,118 --> 03:01:55,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Those two areas are critical job centers and destinations for people in Medford and also origins

2280
03:01:56,320 --> 03:02:02,606
[SPEAKER_27]: for people who might come to Medford to patronize our businesses that are very difficult to reach by public transportation.

2281
03:02:02,626 --> 03:02:08,072
[SPEAKER_27]: So, it's another reason that I hope that we'll push forward on getting silver line service into Metro.

2282
03:02:08,833 --> 03:02:09,673
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much for coming up.

2283
03:02:09,693 --> 03:02:09,934
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2284
03:02:10,034 --> 03:02:11,675
[SPEAKER_31]: And and that is that is why I'm here.

2285
03:02:11,715 --> 03:02:16,080
[SPEAKER_31]: It's what is the city administration done to advocate for us here?

2286
03:02:21,250 --> 03:02:25,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Councilor Bears for putting this on, and my fellow councilors for their thoughtful comments on this.

2287
03:02:25,474 --> 03:02:32,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank Dave for bringing that forward, because I think we've seen what happens when Medford doesn't have a seat at the table in these state-level decision-making.

2288
03:02:32,400 --> 03:02:39,666
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really, you know, whatever comes out of it, I really hope that the administration will respond and make sure that Medford is in the room when these decisions are being made.

2289
03:02:40,246 --> 03:02:40,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2290
03:02:42,788 --> 03:02:45,710
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2291
03:02:46,811 --> 03:02:47,312
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2292
03:02:48,747 --> 03:02:49,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2293
03:02:49,587 --> 03:02:52,309
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-533, offered by Councilor Bears.

2294
03:02:52,909 --> 03:03:12,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration send out a message requesting that input from residents on the citywide comprehensive plan process through water and sewer excise tax and property tax and other mail regularly sent to city residents.

2295
03:03:12,600 --> 03:03:13,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

2296
03:03:15,459 --> 03:03:16,960
[SPEAKER_31]: This one's pretty self-explanatory.

2297
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,322
[SPEAKER_31]: There is an ongoing comprehensive plan process.

2298
03:03:19,862 --> 03:03:28,328
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we need to make sure that the city is doing all efforts possible to reach as many residents as possible so that we have input on that comprehensive plan.

2299
03:03:28,689 --> 03:03:35,313
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think including an item about that in the mail that's regularly sent out to city residents would be one way to do that.

2300
03:03:35,634 --> 03:03:35,994
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2301
03:03:36,054 --> 03:03:36,354
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2302
03:03:37,295 --> 03:03:39,717
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Behr, seconded by?

2303
03:03:39,737 --> 03:03:41,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

2304
03:03:41,818 --> 03:03:42,399
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2305
03:03:43,287 --> 03:03:45,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes, 2-1-534 offered by Council, I'm sorry?

2306
03:03:45,948 --> 03:03:50,189
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-534 by Councilor Bears has been withdrawn.

2307
03:03:50,349 --> 03:03:52,710
[SPEAKER_14]: And 2-1-535 has also been withdrawn by Councilor Bears.

2308
03:04:05,037 --> 03:04:07,719
[SPEAKER_14]: 21536, offered by Councilor Falco.

2309
03:04:08,199 --> 03:04:26,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the city solicitor report back to the council as to the number of claims that have been made against the city or any of its employees in any court or administrative agency, including but not limited to the MCAD, Civil Service Commission, JLMC, since January 1st, 2021.

2310
03:04:26,834 --> 03:04:30,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Requests should not include any workers' compensation matters.

2311
03:04:31,197 --> 03:04:32,499
[SPEAKER_14]: In order to protect the privacy

2312
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:42,102
[SPEAKER_14]: The response should include only forum where the matter is pending, a number of claims pending in that forum, and date when the claim was filed.

2313
03:04:42,442 --> 03:04:43,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

2314
03:04:43,343 --> 03:04:44,443
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2315
03:04:44,663 --> 03:04:46,723
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just trying to get some information.

2316
03:04:46,743 --> 03:04:48,484
[SPEAKER_26]: It's simply stated all right here.

2317
03:04:48,524 --> 03:04:49,104
[SPEAKER_26]: I move approval.

2318
03:04:49,124 --> 03:04:49,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2319
03:04:50,244 --> 03:04:52,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Now on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by.

2320
03:04:54,132 --> 03:04:55,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Second by Councilor Marks.

2321
03:04:55,133 --> 03:04:55,773
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2322
03:04:55,793 --> 03:04:56,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2323
03:04:56,693 --> 03:04:57,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2324
03:04:57,574 --> 03:04:58,214
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-5-3-8.

2325
03:04:58,294 --> 03:05:00,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Opposed by Councilor Falco.

2326
03:05:01,316 --> 03:05:07,119
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the MBTA provide an up- Mr. President, this was actually merged with Councilor Morell's early motion.

2327
03:05:07,139 --> 03:05:08,100
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're gonna withdraw that one.

2328
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:09,659
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, he did.

2329
03:05:09,679 --> 03:05:09,959
[SPEAKER_26]: You did.

2330
03:05:10,039 --> 03:05:10,399
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry.

2331
03:05:10,539 --> 03:05:11,620
[SPEAKER_26]: I apologize.

2332
03:05:11,660 --> 03:05:12,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

2333
03:05:12,100 --> 03:05:20,082
[SPEAKER_14]: 21538 offered by council will be resolved with the MBTA provide an update with regards to the 325, 326 and 710 bus routes.

2334
03:05:20,122 --> 03:05:20,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

2335
03:05:20,682 --> 03:05:21,483
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2336
03:05:21,603 --> 03:05:27,745
[SPEAKER_26]: I have received numerous calls from residents regarding the 325, 326 and 710 bus routes.

2337
03:05:28,585 --> 03:05:37,147
[SPEAKER_26]: They have been temporarily suspended by the MBTA, but I know that many people are starting or at least trying to plan to go back to work at some point.

2338
03:05:39,641 --> 03:05:52,606
[SPEAKER_26]: they've gotten, they were used to the convenience of taking the 325 and the 326 where Councilor Knight had mentioned earlier, take it right into Haymarket Station from West Bedford and from North Bedford and Salem Street area.

2339
03:05:53,226 --> 03:05:54,847
[SPEAKER_26]: And they were super convenient.

2340
03:05:55,607 --> 03:05:57,268
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks could tell you that firsthand.

2341
03:05:57,468 --> 03:06:00,949
[SPEAKER_26]: Clerk Hurtubise could tell you firsthand as he used to take that and Councilor Knight as well.

2342
03:06:02,069 --> 03:06:06,571
[SPEAKER_26]: These bus routes are needed by the community.

2343
03:06:07,758 --> 03:06:08,680
[SPEAKER_26]: They're in demand.

2344
03:06:08,981 --> 03:06:12,270
[SPEAKER_26]: They were actually, pre-COVID, they were packed.

2345
03:06:13,785 --> 03:06:15,906
[SPEAKER_26]: people are starting to go back and planning to go back.

2346
03:06:15,966 --> 03:06:20,068
[SPEAKER_26]: And we need to know what the MBTA is planning for these bus routes.

2347
03:06:20,168 --> 03:06:26,512
[SPEAKER_26]: So it asks that we get some sort of response from our state representatives, state representative Donato.

2348
03:06:26,572 --> 03:06:27,632
[SPEAKER_26]: I know he's been working on this.

2349
03:06:27,652 --> 03:06:38,318
[SPEAKER_26]: I've talked to him about it and you know, it actually would be beneficial if we could have a committee in the whole meeting with our state delegation and with representatives from the MBTA.

2350
03:06:39,338 --> 03:06:41,059
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to know what the plan is going forward.

2351
03:06:42,275 --> 03:06:46,779
[SPEAKER_26]: And these bus routes are key to many people in this community.

2352
03:06:47,059 --> 03:06:54,165
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd ask that you please schedule a community hall meeting with our state delegation and our representative from the MBTA.

2353
03:06:56,247 --> 03:06:57,387
[SPEAKER_26]: I know we had a meeting before.

2354
03:06:57,427 --> 03:06:59,349
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you remember who we invited to that meeting?

2355
03:07:00,370 --> 03:07:02,732
[SPEAKER_26]: This has gone back a good couple of years.

2356
03:07:04,767 --> 03:07:05,307
[SPEAKER_16]: I will reach out.

2357
03:07:05,327 --> 03:07:07,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I can reach out to Dave Carney, who's the head of bus operations.

2358
03:07:08,028 --> 03:07:09,629
[SPEAKER_16]: We can go from there.

2359
03:07:10,049 --> 03:07:10,329
[SPEAKER_26]: Perfect.

2360
03:07:10,389 --> 03:07:11,690
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, if we could start there, that'd be great.

2361
03:07:11,710 --> 03:07:14,051
[SPEAKER_26]: But this is a meeting that needs to happen.

2362
03:07:14,071 --> 03:07:24,935
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'd ask Council President, if you could please schedule that with the assistance of Clerk Hurtubise to get someone from the MBTA to join us in that meeting to let us know what the future is of these bus routes.

2363
03:07:25,615 --> 03:07:27,616
[SPEAKER_14]: And 710 is very important to the people of the Heights.

2364
03:07:27,916 --> 03:07:28,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

2365
03:07:28,296 --> 03:07:30,237
[SPEAKER_14]: It's their only motor to get to the square.

2366
03:07:33,013 --> 03:07:37,555
[SPEAKER_14]: the shopping centers and into the, to the one of the stations.

2367
03:07:37,575 --> 03:07:39,576
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a, that's another key one.

2368
03:07:39,636 --> 03:07:49,521
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that a ridership may not be the, be the, at the height that it used to be, but still an important route because it, it makes people get locked in there.

2369
03:07:49,701 --> 03:07:55,384
[SPEAKER_26]: So North Manfred is, is, is an area of the city that really is not served well by the MBTA.

2370
03:07:55,504 --> 03:07:58,565
[SPEAKER_26]: There's the 710 is the only bus that comes through there.

2371
03:07:59,065 --> 03:08:01,487
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not having it does have an impact on many people.

2372
03:08:02,687 --> 03:08:04,207
[SPEAKER_26]: specifically our senior citizens.

2373
03:08:04,307 --> 03:08:08,549
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen people waiting for that bus numerous times in the past, and now they don't have an option.

2374
03:08:08,629 --> 03:08:10,029
[SPEAKER_26]: So we need to get answers on that.

2375
03:08:10,829 --> 03:08:12,310
[SPEAKER_26]: And I appreciate you setting up a meeting.

2376
03:08:12,330 --> 03:08:12,670
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2377
03:08:13,510 --> 03:08:15,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, if I could.

2378
03:08:15,511 --> 03:08:22,953
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up, and we've all talked ad nauseum about this.

2379
03:08:23,733 --> 03:08:27,914
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, to me, how do we get this resolved?

2380
03:08:29,727 --> 03:08:30,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Money talks, right?

2381
03:08:30,867 --> 03:08:31,748
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we get this resolved?

2382
03:08:32,248 --> 03:08:32,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Money talks.

2383
03:08:33,548 --> 03:08:43,332
[SPEAKER_18]: So why don't we talk about our assessment, our assessment to the MWRA, not the MWRA, MBTA.

2384
03:08:43,372 --> 03:08:44,252
[SPEAKER_18]: That's another story.

2385
03:08:44,352 --> 03:08:45,212
[SPEAKER_18]: That's another story.

2386
03:08:45,793 --> 03:08:54,096
[SPEAKER_18]: The MBTA, our assessment, our yearly assessment, why don't we withhold the portion based on the service reduction?

2387
03:08:55,256 --> 03:08:55,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we do that?

2388
03:08:55,876 --> 03:08:58,097
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they'd take it out of our check right away.

2389
03:08:59,480 --> 03:08:59,940
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2390
03:08:59,980 --> 03:09:00,701
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we do that?

2391
03:09:00,781 --> 03:09:14,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we do that as a community, say, this is what we're paying every year for, service Wellington, these buses, this transportation, whatever it might be, and say, this was a cut, it was a 10% cut.

2392
03:09:14,637 --> 03:09:16,659
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not going to give you the $3 million every year.

2393
03:09:16,679 --> 03:09:17,480
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to give you $2.7.

2394
03:09:19,560 --> 03:09:23,721
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just throwing ideas out there because it seems like we go nowhere with this.

2395
03:09:24,461 --> 03:09:29,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly, they have us over a barrel and they just decide unilaterally what they want to do to us.

2396
03:09:30,002 --> 03:09:45,386
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'd like to ask the city solicitor, in the form of a motion, if we as a community can withhold assessments from the Cherry Sheet, from the city Cherry Sheet.

2397
03:09:47,152 --> 03:09:49,193
[SPEAKER_18]: So can we withhold assessments?

2398
03:09:55,595 --> 03:09:55,835
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

2399
03:09:56,055 --> 03:09:59,776
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, if that's the best Councilor Marks and Councilor Parker amenable.

2400
03:10:00,316 --> 03:10:06,698
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd also like to ask if we can challenge our assessment in court, or if there's some sort of process to challenge it.

2401
03:10:06,758 --> 03:10:08,839
[SPEAKER_31]: Cause I do think the point is.

2402
03:10:10,092 --> 03:10:18,916
[SPEAKER_31]: they will, if we were to try to withhold it, they would just, you know, they take it out of what they give us in chapter 70 and all of that before we could even withhold it.

2403
03:10:19,056 --> 03:10:22,078
[SPEAKER_31]: So the check is actually not even written by us.

2404
03:10:22,138 --> 03:10:26,780
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just subtracted out of what they send us in state aid, I believe is how the process works.

2405
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:34,104
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm wondering if there may be an alternative to that, but I agree with you in principle, if our services are going down, why is our assessment remaining the same?

2406
03:10:35,746 --> 03:10:38,668
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I've been trying not to belabor this, and I know it's late.

2407
03:10:39,028 --> 03:10:55,040
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been trying to assess the MBTA that has millions, hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-exempt property in this community, and I've been trying to get them to pay a fair share, Mr. President, which has fallen on deaf ears for many years.

2408
03:10:55,540 --> 03:10:58,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Someday when I'm governor, maybe it's gonna happen, Mr. President.

2409
03:10:59,663 --> 03:11:03,466
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so on the motion by Councilor Falco,

2410
03:11:05,155 --> 03:11:09,217
[SPEAKER_14]: seconded by Councilor Bez, as amended by Councilor Marks.

2411
03:11:10,658 --> 03:11:11,518
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2412
03:11:11,538 --> 03:11:12,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2413
03:11:12,559 --> 03:11:13,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2414
03:11:13,579 --> 03:11:24,444
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-5-3-9, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford Police Department increase patrols at the Riverside Plaza on Riverside Avenue in the interest of public safety.

2415
03:11:24,785 --> 03:11:25,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

2416
03:11:25,765 --> 03:11:26,505
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2417
03:11:26,525 --> 03:11:33,829
[SPEAKER_26]: I've received numerous calls from residents regarding Riverside Plaza down in Medford Square and Riverside Ave behind us.

2418
03:11:34,628 --> 03:11:47,219
[SPEAKER_26]: And, you know, when we rebuilt that plaza, it was rebuilt as a plaza or not as a park and it gave the police department I think different jurisdiction over the property.

2419
03:11:47,239 --> 03:11:50,903
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm hearing now that there's been

2420
03:11:51,673 --> 03:11:55,355
[SPEAKER_26]: drug use, people have found medications on the ground and whatnot.

2421
03:11:55,855 --> 03:12:01,818
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we could please have the Bedford Police Department step up patrols in that area in the interest of public safety.

2422
03:12:01,858 --> 03:12:05,900
[SPEAKER_26]: I know there's a lot of people down there that like to utilize that park and we need to make sure it's safe for our residents.

2423
03:12:06,420 --> 03:12:06,740
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2424
03:12:06,960 --> 03:12:07,500
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President.

2425
03:12:07,841 --> 03:12:08,801
[SPEAKER_31]: Council Member Baez.

2426
03:12:08,841 --> 03:12:10,122
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2427
03:12:10,442 --> 03:12:13,643
[SPEAKER_31]: I would just request that we move to send this to the public safety subcommittee.

2428
03:12:13,883 --> 03:12:18,866
[SPEAKER_31]: I've gotten some messages from folks that they'd like to have kind of a more comprehensive discussion about the area.

2429
03:12:20,026 --> 03:12:22,168
[SPEAKER_31]: And I also noticed that there was a hand raised on Zoom.

2430
03:12:22,188 --> 03:12:27,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you willing to subcommittee on public safety?

2431
03:12:27,852 --> 03:12:31,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2432
03:12:31,314 --> 03:12:34,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so on... If I may, Mr. President.

2433
03:12:35,577 --> 03:12:36,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

2434
03:12:36,437 --> 03:12:43,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it would also be important where, you know, the disease of addiction has plagued our community now for the better part of a decade.

2435
03:12:44,062 --> 03:12:44,863
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not something that...

2436
03:12:45,942 --> 03:12:49,203
[SPEAKER_21]: anybody's immune from it's not something that we haven't been afraid to talk about.

2437
03:12:49,843 --> 03:13:01,787
[SPEAKER_21]: It's something that we put on the forefront, and we have an office of prevention we have pennies office up there that's doing a great job and you know if we have a situation where someone's battling addiction is in need of help.

2438
03:13:02,228 --> 03:13:03,088
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that, you know,

2439
03:13:04,120 --> 03:13:08,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Turning it into a police issue is one thing, but we have resources that are available as well.

2440
03:13:08,681 --> 03:13:13,263
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think this is something that should necessarily be turned into a police issue to quality of life issue.

2441
03:13:13,743 --> 03:13:17,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct definitely quality of life issue but I don't think it needs to be a police issue per se.

2442
03:13:17,844 --> 03:13:23,706
[SPEAKER_21]: If someone is in the community struggling and needs help and we have the resources available I think that they should also be brought to the table.

2443
03:13:24,046 --> 03:13:26,707
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, I just asked that our Office of Prevention.

2444
03:13:27,407 --> 03:13:35,552
[SPEAKER_21]: maybe Officer Lockowitz be included in the discussions moving forward because they do a great job up there and they've helped a lot of people.

2445
03:13:36,033 --> 03:13:37,173
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's what we're all here to do, right?

2446
03:13:37,193 --> 03:13:38,174
[SPEAKER_21]: We're here to help people.

2447
03:13:38,234 --> 03:13:47,320
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, I think that that's probably a good recommendation, Mr. President, to have friends from the prevention office be a part of this discussion.

2448
03:13:49,341 --> 03:13:50,982
[SPEAKER_14]: And Council Member Baez?

2449
03:13:51,402 --> 03:13:54,524
[SPEAKER_31]: I did see someone raise their hand on Zoom for public participation.

2450
03:13:56,356 --> 03:14:04,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Falco, if we can amend that to also include the Sloan Garden in front of Century Bank.

2451
03:14:06,283 --> 03:14:12,286
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems to be the police there every week also has made, that's getting to be quite a contentious spot also.

2452
03:14:12,307 --> 03:14:12,747
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2453
03:14:12,767 --> 03:14:16,409
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm welcome to all the amendments from Councilor Bears and Councilor Knight.

2454
03:14:16,930 --> 03:14:21,252
[SPEAKER_26]: They're good amendments and I definitely think Lori should be invited to the meeting.

2455
03:14:21,793 --> 03:14:24,735
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to address everything and it'd be good to have

2456
03:14:25,643 --> 03:14:31,805
[SPEAKER_26]: It'd be beneficial for everyone involved just to have a good discussion about how we can make these areas safer.

2457
03:14:32,045 --> 03:14:32,365
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2458
03:14:32,585 --> 03:14:38,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2459
03:14:38,286 --> 03:14:39,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Mike's not doing outreach.

2460
03:14:39,887 --> 03:14:42,647
[SPEAKER_21]: Start doing outreach in that area because we know it's a problem area.

2461
03:14:43,047 --> 03:14:44,368
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't need to come to one of the meetings.

2462
03:14:44,388 --> 03:14:46,948
[SPEAKER_21]: They're going to hear the same thing we've told them time and time again, right?

2463
03:14:46,988 --> 03:14:52,830
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I think ultimately, you know, we need to ask them to go out to these hotspot areas and start performing outreach work.

2464
03:14:54,322 --> 03:14:55,884
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Falco.

2465
03:14:57,005 --> 03:14:59,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's got a hand raised here?

2466
03:15:01,149 --> 03:15:01,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

2467
03:15:01,509 --> 03:15:02,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Miranda.

2468
03:15:02,350 --> 03:15:03,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

2469
03:15:04,312 --> 03:15:06,254
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Miranda Berseno, Taylor Street.

2470
03:15:07,495 --> 03:15:13,340
[SPEAKER_28]: And I just wanted to express opposition that more police patrol in the park area would be in the interest of community safety.

2471
03:15:13,941 --> 03:15:19,066
[SPEAKER_28]: Community safety means everyone and that everyone feels safe in the community.

2472
03:15:20,232 --> 03:15:25,514
[SPEAKER_28]: not just those who would like to see their property values maintained and keep people who they deem unworthy out of their neighborhood.

2473
03:15:26,075 --> 03:15:27,155
[SPEAKER_28]: Police don't keep us safe.

2474
03:15:27,375 --> 03:15:30,556
[SPEAKER_28]: In fact, police departments are rooted in white supremacy and anti-Blackness.

2475
03:15:30,816 --> 03:15:42,661
[SPEAKER_28]: They have foundations in the history in slave patrols and modern-day police forces have directed oppression and violence at Black people to enforce Jim Crow, wage the war on drugs, crack down on protest, criminalize homelessness, and more.

2476
03:15:43,201 --> 03:15:44,842
[SPEAKER_28]: Police do not prevent crime from happening.

2477
03:15:45,705 --> 03:15:47,686
[SPEAKER_28]: they respond after something has already happened.

2478
03:15:48,107 --> 03:16:00,575
[SPEAKER_28]: If the council's concern is to truly invest in community safety, there is a multitude of empirical evidence that suggests funding education and other social services like drug addiction rehab and safe consumption sites are what keeps communities safe.

2479
03:16:01,096 --> 03:16:13,885
[SPEAKER_28]: So I urge the council to vote no on more patrols and instead look for opportunities to allocate more funding to Medford public schools, affordable housing, respond to the climate crisis, address racial injustice, drug addiction in our city, and more.

2480
03:16:14,205 --> 03:16:14,445
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2481
03:16:15,510 --> 03:16:15,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, ma'am.

2482
03:16:16,811 --> 03:16:27,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Bears, the move to public safety, and as amended by President Caravelle.

2483
03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:29,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have a second on the motion?

2484
03:16:29,621 --> 03:16:29,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

2485
03:16:30,501 --> 03:16:32,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Vice President Nights.

2486
03:16:33,243 --> 03:16:34,064
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2487
03:16:34,624 --> 03:16:35,345
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2488
03:16:38,908 --> 03:16:40,088
[SPEAKER_18]: All call the vote, Mr. President.

2489
03:16:43,147 --> 03:16:43,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sir.

2490
03:16:44,789 --> 03:16:53,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Marks has requested a roll call vote.

2491
03:16:53,376 --> 03:17:04,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you just repeat what the motion and amendments are?

2492
03:17:07,469 --> 03:17:19,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll move it to public safety for further discussion, and I amended it to include the Rose-Sloan-Guidon quintessential bank.

2493
03:17:19,891 --> 03:17:20,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And vice president.

2494
03:17:21,012 --> 03:17:21,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2495
03:17:21,212 --> 03:17:25,972
[SPEAKER_16]: So as amended by myself and Councilor Knight.

2496
03:17:37,435 --> 03:17:37,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears?

2497
03:17:38,235 --> 03:17:38,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2498
03:17:39,476 --> 03:17:39,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco?

2499
03:17:40,117 --> 03:17:40,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2500
03:17:41,097 --> 03:17:41,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Knight?

2501
03:17:41,878 --> 03:17:42,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2502
03:17:42,798 --> 03:17:43,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks?

2503
03:17:43,419 --> 03:17:43,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2504
03:17:44,339 --> 03:17:44,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell?

2505
03:17:45,080 --> 03:17:45,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2506
03:17:45,840 --> 03:17:46,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

2507
03:17:46,941 --> 03:17:47,581
[SPEAKER_16]: President Kiriboye?

2508
03:17:47,741 --> 03:17:47,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2509
03:17:47,982 --> 03:17:49,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Six in affirmative, motion passes.

2510
03:17:49,342 --> 03:18:02,611
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-5-4-0, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Republic Parking provide the Medford City Council with a monthly revenue metrics from January to August 2021.

2511
03:18:02,991 --> 03:18:03,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco?

2512
03:18:05,569 --> 03:18:06,430
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2513
03:18:06,750 --> 03:18:17,119
[SPEAKER_26]: This is just a simple request just to receive information from Republic Parking with just revenue metrics from January through August of this year.

2514
03:18:17,159 --> 03:18:25,266
[SPEAKER_26]: We're getting ready to transition over, so I just want to see how we're doing from a revenue perspective year-to-date through August 2021.

2515
03:18:25,306 --> 03:18:25,986
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2516
03:18:29,127 --> 03:18:35,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so on the motion, Mr. President, if I could, I thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

2517
03:18:36,556 --> 03:18:48,391
[SPEAKER_18]: I raised this issue during the budget, Mr. President, when we spoke about the taking of the parking program in-house.

2518
03:18:49,522 --> 03:19:03,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And I won't go through my entire statement, Mr. President, but I have some grave concerns that we're about a little over three months away from taking this program in-house, and I have yet to hear

2519
03:19:04,361 --> 03:19:06,863
[SPEAKER_18]: how we are going to operate, Mr. President.

2520
03:19:07,543 --> 03:19:29,755
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a budget that I believe was allocated of $250,000, which is not enough money to establish a full-fledged parking program that consists of META people, that consists of people that work in the office, that consists of people that empty the machines out, that fix the machines.

2521
03:19:31,416 --> 03:19:36,059
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and I'm not sure how this is going to happen, to be quite honest with you.

2522
03:19:36,519 --> 03:19:41,462
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, you know, people have big expectations come January 1.

2523
03:19:42,582 --> 03:19:46,104
[SPEAKER_18]: And honestly, can any of us say what this program is going to look like January 1?

2524
03:19:46,225 --> 03:19:49,967
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to be able to meet the current obligations?

2525
03:19:50,872 --> 03:20:02,315
[SPEAKER_18]: So the current streets that are resident permit parking, the hundreds of them around the community that people have grown accustomed to, to having enforcement on, will that happen January 1st?

2526
03:20:02,655 --> 03:20:04,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Will it be a smooth transition?

2527
03:20:04,595 --> 03:20:05,215
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2528
03:20:05,715 --> 03:20:08,736
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can't tell people that it's going to be a smooth transition.

2529
03:20:09,076 --> 03:20:13,157
[SPEAKER_18]: My personal opinion right now, it's not going to be a very smooth transition.

2530
03:20:13,457 --> 03:20:17,398
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have appropriate funding to run a full-fledged

2531
03:20:17,698 --> 03:20:19,119
[SPEAKER_18]: parking program in the community.

2532
03:20:19,459 --> 03:20:23,102
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think a lot of the enforcement's going to suffer, Mr. President.

2533
03:20:23,622 --> 03:20:25,663
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want people to be aware of that.

2534
03:20:25,743 --> 03:20:40,813
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, I've been on the record, even during budget a couple of months back, saying that I don't believe with the current funding and the current process set up, can anyone tell me what the process is?

2535
03:20:42,595 --> 03:20:44,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the office gonna be?

2536
03:20:44,435 --> 03:20:45,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's gonna be doing the hearings?

2537
03:20:45,916 --> 03:20:49,196
[SPEAKER_18]: How many people they're gonna hire?

2538
03:20:49,516 --> 03:20:53,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we gonna include other streets in the resident permit parking?

2539
03:20:53,437 --> 03:20:55,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we gonna do citywide resident permit parking?

2540
03:20:55,997 --> 03:21:02,078
[SPEAKER_18]: These were all recommendations made by the committee that the mayor put forward, and they did yeoman's work.

2541
03:21:02,198 --> 03:21:07,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying they did yeoman's work, but now the next phase was, how do you carry it out?

2542
03:21:08,920 --> 03:21:09,820
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not there yet, 90 days.

2543
03:21:12,156 --> 03:21:13,797
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, is there a committee working on it now?

2544
03:21:13,837 --> 03:21:15,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Is anyone aware?

2545
03:21:16,457 --> 03:21:22,359
[SPEAKER_18]: So really, I mean, these conversations need to be had because, you know, people are going to start pointing the finger.

2546
03:21:22,919 --> 03:21:31,422
[SPEAKER_18]: And let me tell you, the finger is not going to be pointed at this Medford City Council because we've been raising the red flag for the last couple of months saying, I don't know how this program is going to work.

2547
03:21:32,473 --> 03:21:43,041
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't had any involvement in the establishment of this program other than hearing from the administration that they're taking it in-house, which I support 110% taking in-house.

2548
03:21:43,501 --> 03:21:47,764
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to know the bolts, the nuts and bolts of how it's going to run.

2549
03:21:48,264 --> 03:21:49,145
[SPEAKER_18]: How are we going to fund it?

2550
03:21:49,605 --> 03:21:51,107
[SPEAKER_18]: What do we anticipate the cost?

2551
03:21:51,367 --> 03:22:01,254
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief of staff, when he was here, Dave Rodriguez, when I asked him if they're going to run the program with 250,000, said that was just really a small starting point.

2552
03:22:02,852 --> 03:22:06,873
[SPEAKER_18]: So are we taking a year to get the whole program up and running?

2553
03:22:07,653 --> 03:22:11,553
[SPEAKER_18]: I think residents have the right to know that, and especially enforcement in this community.

2554
03:22:11,854 --> 03:22:18,055
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we moved to creating an outside company to come in because there was a lack of enforcement.

2555
03:22:18,355 --> 03:22:24,136
[SPEAKER_18]: And I remember the days where people would park in the square for 15 hours and go into town.

2556
03:22:24,876 --> 03:22:28,096
[SPEAKER_18]: And the business owners would say, I can't get anyone to come in my business.

2557
03:22:28,116 --> 03:22:28,856
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no parking.

2558
03:22:29,837 --> 03:22:30,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

2559
03:22:30,057 --> 03:22:31,937
[SPEAKER_18]: You remember that, Councilor, President Kavya?

2560
03:22:33,561 --> 03:22:36,982
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, so these are the issues I think I don't want to revisit them again.

2561
03:22:37,643 --> 03:22:40,023
[SPEAKER_18]: And it feels like we're going down that same path.

2562
03:22:40,103 --> 03:22:44,765
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm really concerned and I appreciate Councilor Falco offering this tonight.

2563
03:22:45,145 --> 03:22:48,226
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a little unrelated, but it's a real concern.

2564
03:22:48,286 --> 03:22:50,447
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be a concern of everyone in this community.

2565
03:22:50,987 --> 03:23:00,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you notice traffic enforcement is at a minimum right now, then you barely see them out enforcing any parking anymore.

2566
03:23:01,311 --> 03:23:03,172
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll see one person here or there.

2567
03:23:04,901 --> 03:23:05,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll stop him.

2568
03:23:05,361 --> 03:23:11,144
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Marks because I share those same concerns.

2569
03:23:11,184 --> 03:23:17,567
[SPEAKER_26]: Here we are, it's September, this is going to transition over in January, and there are some major concerns.

2570
03:23:17,707 --> 03:23:21,089
[SPEAKER_26]: This isn't, you don't just flip a switch and it goes over.

2571
03:23:21,669 --> 03:23:31,594
[SPEAKER_26]: There's all kinds of, you know, implications with regard to software, policies, procedures, who's going to run it, who's going to manage it, what's happening with the cash, what are the policies behind that?

2572
03:23:31,634 --> 03:23:34,116
[SPEAKER_26]: There are all kinds of issues with this.

2573
03:23:34,974 --> 03:23:42,356
[SPEAKER_26]: And if it doesn't transition correctly, there are going to be some pretty significant ramifications with regard to revenue.

2574
03:23:42,496 --> 03:23:52,078
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, if the city's counting on revenue to maintain revenue, and this doesn't go off without a hitch, that's going to be a problem.

2575
03:23:52,538 --> 03:23:56,339
[SPEAKER_26]: So I share those same concerns, and I thank you for bringing that forward to Council Marks.

2576
03:23:59,100 --> 03:24:00,160
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2577
03:24:03,305 --> 03:24:07,668
[SPEAKER_21]: The packing program first rolled out some 10 years ago.

2578
03:24:08,629 --> 03:24:19,737
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the biggest criticisms that we received as a community was what's wrong with you rolling out this program in the middle of the winter.

2579
03:24:20,337 --> 03:24:20,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

2580
03:24:21,318 --> 03:24:26,682
[SPEAKER_21]: And now here we are rolling out the program again, 10 years later in a January, the month of January.

2581
03:24:27,642 --> 03:24:30,104
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to learn from our mistakes at some point, Mr. President.

2582
03:24:30,740 --> 03:24:33,521
[SPEAKER_14]: I if you recall, that was my comment to the chief of staff.

2583
03:24:34,321 --> 03:24:37,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Learn from the mistake we made the first time rolling it out in the middle of the winter.

2584
03:24:37,542 --> 03:24:38,842
[SPEAKER_14]: People figure it out.

2585
03:24:38,862 --> 03:24:43,123
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to look like a gone show right now.

2586
03:24:43,203 --> 03:24:44,484
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to look like a gone show.

2587
03:24:45,624 --> 03:24:49,865
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have the capability at this point in time with the funding that was in my budget.

2588
03:24:50,665 --> 03:24:52,886
[SPEAKER_21]: So what close to half a million bucks, I believe.

2589
03:24:52,906 --> 03:24:55,866
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was 250, but I made you off.

2590
03:24:56,347 --> 03:24:56,747
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a 350.

2591
03:24:59,601 --> 03:25:01,161
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't much more than that.

2592
03:25:01,181 --> 03:25:02,282
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not going to cut the mustard.

2593
03:25:02,342 --> 03:25:03,402
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not going to cut the mustard.

2594
03:25:04,862 --> 03:25:07,083
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's your personnel cost.

2595
03:25:07,123 --> 03:25:09,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Good luck getting a director for that salary, Joe.

2596
03:25:09,304 --> 03:25:21,867
[SPEAKER_21]: And the idea is that this is going to be a self-sustaining department that's going to have a revolving fund, where the revenue that they bring in is going to make it so self-sustaining that we're not going to have to ask the taxpayers to chip in.

2597
03:25:22,507 --> 03:25:24,168
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think that's going to be the case at all.

2598
03:25:24,708 --> 03:25:28,489
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that we're going to end up seeing numbers that are worse than the numbers that we see right now with Republicans.

2599
03:25:29,330 --> 03:25:32,753
[SPEAKER_21]: just because Republic has the expertise and knowing how to do it.

2600
03:25:32,773 --> 03:25:35,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, we're starting off like the bad news bears.

2601
03:25:37,459 --> 03:25:37,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Move approval.

2602
03:25:38,720 --> 03:25:43,345
[SPEAKER_14]: I want a motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by... Second.

2603
03:25:45,027 --> 03:25:46,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

2604
03:25:46,349 --> 03:25:46,970
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2605
03:25:48,185 --> 03:25:59,607
[SPEAKER_14]: I motion passes to one 5, 4, 1, offer by Council Falco be resolved that the city engineer investigate flooding issues in front of one usher road report the findings of the city Council.

2606
03:26:00,280 --> 03:26:01,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

2607
03:26:01,240 --> 03:26:01,600
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2608
03:26:01,801 --> 03:26:02,801
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2609
03:26:03,121 --> 03:26:15,025
[SPEAKER_26]: I was walking through the neighborhood of Usher Road and Pleistead Road last week, and I was talking to one of the residents and they were telling me about the issues that they're having with significant flooding.

2610
03:26:16,066 --> 03:26:22,868
[SPEAKER_26]: The water comes down Usher Road during a rainstorm, and it almost floods instantaneously.

2611
03:26:23,589 --> 03:26:25,549
[SPEAKER_26]: And it needs to be addressed.

2612
03:26:25,569 --> 03:26:26,430
[SPEAKER_26]: He showed me pictures.

2613
03:26:26,450 --> 03:26:29,711
[SPEAKER_26]: We're talking flooding that's probably like two feet high.

2614
03:26:30,557 --> 03:26:32,577
[SPEAKER_26]: and it goes all the way out into Playstead Road.

2615
03:26:33,318 --> 03:26:43,700
[SPEAKER_26]: I would ask, because I have another resolution following this one that's similar, but I would ask that we have a community hall meeting with the chief engineer to see what we're doing to address these issues.

2616
03:26:47,020 --> 03:26:56,182
[SPEAKER_26]: This gentleman told me he has to go out when he knows it's going to rain, he has to go out, all the neighbors call each other, he has to go out and make sure that those shores are clean of any type of debris.

2617
03:26:57,587 --> 03:26:59,929
[SPEAKER_26]: Because if they're not, it's major flooding.

2618
03:27:00,369 --> 03:27:02,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Even if they are clean, it's major flooding.

2619
03:27:03,711 --> 03:27:06,533
[SPEAKER_26]: So this needs to be addressed.

2620
03:27:06,613 --> 03:27:07,994
[SPEAKER_26]: It's becoming an increasing problem.

2621
03:27:08,780 --> 03:27:10,601
[SPEAKER_26]: And it's a real quality of life issue.

2622
03:27:11,082 --> 03:27:12,163
[SPEAKER_26]: He's telling me that the water.

2623
03:27:12,563 --> 03:27:20,749
[SPEAKER_26]: He showed me pictures actually I can forward them to everybody, but it's probably like two feet, three feet tall in high in some areas.

2624
03:27:21,269 --> 03:27:23,250
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a major concern it needs to be addressed.

2625
03:27:23,731 --> 03:27:27,674
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it can be the whole meeting because I know there's various flooding issues around our city.

2626
03:27:28,874 --> 03:27:31,757
[SPEAKER_26]: This resolution in West Bedford there's one in North the next resolution.

2627
03:27:32,646 --> 03:27:41,429
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to get on top of this and see if this is an issue where maybe at one point in time, you know, the system could keep up with the water flow.

2628
03:27:41,869 --> 03:27:42,409
[SPEAKER_26]: It can't now.

2629
03:27:43,289 --> 03:27:51,032
[SPEAKER_26]: This particular street has two sewers on each side of the street, and it's not keeping up with the water flow.

2630
03:27:51,072 --> 03:27:51,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Catch faces.

2631
03:27:51,692 --> 03:27:53,513
[SPEAKER_26]: Catch faces, I'm sorry, excuse me, catch faces.

2632
03:27:54,153 --> 03:27:55,633
[SPEAKER_26]: And so this needs to be addressed.

2633
03:27:56,113 --> 03:28:01,195
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think we should have a committee of the whole meeting to meet with, to make it a chief engineer,

2634
03:28:01,615 --> 03:28:05,378
[SPEAKER_26]: just to go over these issues and any other flooding issues that people may have.

2635
03:28:05,418 --> 03:28:07,980
[SPEAKER_26]: I know I've received calls from South Bedford a few weeks ago.

2636
03:28:08,781 --> 03:28:11,864
[SPEAKER_26]: This next resolution is about North Bedford, but this one here is in West Bedford.

2637
03:28:12,324 --> 03:28:20,451
[SPEAKER_26]: Usher and Playstead Road, major problem, major flooding, and even when it's not that bad of a rainstorm, so.

2638
03:28:21,832 --> 03:28:22,312
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Morocco?

2639
03:28:22,332 --> 03:28:22,713
[SPEAKER_26]: Approval.

2640
03:28:24,414 --> 03:28:25,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2641
03:28:25,555 --> 03:28:26,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Councilor Fragedel.

2642
03:28:27,733 --> 03:28:28,533
[SPEAKER_11]: bringing us forward.

2643
03:28:28,934 --> 03:28:47,582
[SPEAKER_11]: This is I fully agree with the idea of this going to a committee the whole because I think we've all heard from residents who have lived in their homes for decades and they're experiencing flooding instances that they've never seen before and really bizarre scenarios that with extreme climate events are only going to increase so it's something that we need to get out ahead of even though we're already a little bit behind but

2644
03:28:48,002 --> 03:28:48,962
[SPEAKER_11]: something we actually needed.

2645
03:28:49,643 --> 03:28:52,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the engineering department is working on it, but so that we're all fully in the loop.

2646
03:28:53,104 --> 03:28:56,625
[SPEAKER_11]: So how we can report back to residents and make sure that we're really focused on this issue.

2647
03:28:56,645 --> 03:28:58,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you for bringing this forward.

2648
03:28:58,165 --> 03:29:00,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2649
03:29:00,886 --> 03:29:06,988
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could add on the corner of Badger and Winthrop, the gentleman who moved there was promised two years ago.

2650
03:29:07,848 --> 03:29:11,089
[SPEAKER_14]: that they would put a second sewer in to help out every time it rains.

2651
03:29:11,629 --> 03:29:14,830
[SPEAKER_14]: This garage gets three inches of water, just fills up.

2652
03:29:15,591 --> 03:29:18,692
[SPEAKER_18]: And the top of Governor's Ave, the last street on the top of Governor's Ave.

2653
03:29:18,732 --> 03:29:19,572
[SPEAKER_18]: We can go down the line.

2654
03:29:19,592 --> 03:29:20,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Which street is that, Mr. President?

2655
03:29:20,692 --> 03:29:22,893
[SPEAKER_18]: The top of Governor's Ave to the left, the last street.

2656
03:29:23,153 --> 03:29:26,234
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a dead end.

2657
03:29:26,274 --> 03:29:28,235
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a, let me tell you.

2658
03:29:28,255 --> 03:29:30,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you've got the one that's on the new intersection.

2659
03:29:32,607 --> 03:29:37,008
[SPEAKER_18]: sure would be sure.

2660
03:29:37,028 --> 03:29:40,788
[SPEAKER_14]: We still have the one that with a new with the section with the way it gets flooded every time.

2661
03:29:41,729 --> 03:29:43,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was right.

2662
03:29:43,549 --> 03:29:46,309
[SPEAKER_14]: We could, we could sit here and make a list forever.

2663
03:29:46,970 --> 03:29:47,970
[SPEAKER_14]: All the flooding that goes on.

2664
03:29:49,370 --> 03:29:51,750
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can add charm on Mr. President.

2665
03:29:52,430 --> 03:29:59,012
[SPEAKER_18]: That resident has approached the administration and Tim McGiven has been out there and it's a nightmare on that road.

2666
03:29:59,572 --> 03:30:00,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2667
03:30:00,232 --> 03:30:00,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Council BS.

2668
03:30:01,443 --> 03:30:02,744
[SPEAKER_26]: These issues need to be addressed.

2669
03:30:02,764 --> 03:30:22,335
[SPEAKER_26]: It'd be nice to have a community hall meeting where we could actually point out these particular areas and at least give the engineer somewhere to look and come up with a plan or try to determine what the issue is moving forward so people are not having flooded basements just with the, you know, when it's, sometimes the rain's not even bad and they're getting flooding out.

2670
03:30:22,936 --> 03:30:28,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Nevermind the calls we've gone over the last few days of the house of people that are waiting for their checks for the houses that have already been flooded.

2671
03:30:29,339 --> 03:30:29,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

2672
03:30:32,365 --> 03:30:38,509
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Councilor Falco, do you want to move it to Committee Hall or do you want to move for approval on this?

2673
03:30:38,689 --> 03:30:40,050
[SPEAKER_26]: Both.

2674
03:30:40,170 --> 03:30:46,294
[SPEAKER_26]: Approval in Committee Hall, because I'd like the engineer to get started on it, but I think we should have a meeting as well.

2675
03:30:48,530 --> 03:30:58,712
[SPEAKER_21]: I think one of the things that we need to look at that we haven't looked at in recent years that we did look at previously was the water table.

2676
03:31:00,233 --> 03:31:09,355
[SPEAKER_21]: The level of the water in the lakes, using the locks to control the water table so that we have the ability to sustain significant rain.

2677
03:31:10,775 --> 03:31:19,339
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think it's one of the detriments to losing, you know, such a high level of institutional knowledge over such a short period of time.

2678
03:31:19,379 --> 03:31:24,421
[SPEAKER_21]: As we've seen, you know, a lot of people, a lot of turnover, we lose that institutional knowledge.

2679
03:31:24,481 --> 03:31:35,246
[SPEAKER_21]: And then when we start relying on, you know, planning agencies and outside entities to come in and do the planning for this community without that institutional knowledge, it creates a situation for us.

2680
03:31:35,287 --> 03:31:38,148
[SPEAKER_21]: So when we look at the project on High Street, for example,

2681
03:31:38,648 --> 03:31:43,189
[SPEAKER_21]: where the resident was told that the catch basin was going to get tied in for 15 years.

2682
03:31:43,729 --> 03:31:45,229
[SPEAKER_21]: The catch basin never gets tied in.

2683
03:31:45,369 --> 03:31:56,431
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they do this project and the resident gets six feet of rainwater in their basement because the lack of institutional knowledge, lack of follow-up and institutional knowledge.

2684
03:31:56,491 --> 03:32:02,133
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's important, Mr. President, that we, you know, the employees that we value that have this institutional knowledge, we need to keep around.

2685
03:32:02,693 --> 03:32:03,553
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's very important.

2686
03:32:04,713 --> 03:32:09,577
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the things that I really think we do need to look at is the water table and the level that we keep the lakes at.

2687
03:32:10,178 --> 03:32:17,303
[SPEAKER_21]: It's always been historically something that, you know, I remember as a kid did always lower the level of the lakes in the rainy season and always let it come back up in the summer.

2688
03:32:17,663 --> 03:32:19,165
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's something that needs to be looked at.

2689
03:32:21,246 --> 03:32:21,967
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President.

2690
03:32:22,782 --> 03:32:23,242
[SPEAKER_21]: That's Falco.

2691
03:32:23,302 --> 03:32:28,665
[SPEAKER_26]: If I may, can we also add, in addition to the engineer, can we also have a DPW there as well?

2692
03:32:28,825 --> 03:32:33,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe Steve Tanaglia, he seems to have a good, talking about institutional knowledge.

2693
03:32:33,087 --> 03:32:38,490
[SPEAKER_26]: I know he has a very good background as to where things usually flood and don't flood.

2694
03:32:38,510 --> 03:32:41,432
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think he'd be able to add a lot of value in that conversation.

2695
03:32:41,832 --> 03:32:51,937
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by President Caraviello and Councilor Marksley, we add Badger and Chalmont,

2696
03:32:52,544 --> 03:32:58,608
[SPEAKER_14]: and to refer this to a committee at the whole with the DPW and the engineering departments.

2697
03:32:58,628 --> 03:33:01,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I get it all?

2698
03:33:01,870 --> 03:33:02,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

2699
03:33:02,891 --> 03:33:03,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by?

2700
03:33:03,431 --> 03:33:04,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

2701
03:33:04,792 --> 03:33:05,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

2702
03:33:05,873 --> 03:33:06,574
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2703
03:33:06,594 --> 03:33:07,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2704
03:33:08,255 --> 03:33:08,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2705
03:33:08,355 --> 03:33:09,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2706
03:33:09,075 --> 03:33:10,216
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-5-4-2.

2707
03:33:10,236 --> 03:33:20,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the City Engineer investigate the flooding issues in front of 61 Cedar Road North and report the findings to the City Council.

2708
03:33:22,634 --> 03:33:23,575
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2709
03:33:24,036 --> 03:33:27,380
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a similar situation up on Cedar Road recently.

2710
03:33:28,602 --> 03:33:39,696
[SPEAKER_26]: They had probably about two weeks ago, three weeks ago, a bad rainstorm and the water, the way that they were situated, they have two roads that, well actually the road just kind of

2711
03:33:40,579 --> 03:33:44,021
[SPEAKER_26]: dips at that one point, and there was significant flooding.

2712
03:33:44,582 --> 03:33:52,307
[SPEAKER_26]: A number of the neighbors had probably a good two, three feet of water in their basements, and some of it actually went out into the backyard as well.

2713
03:33:52,967 --> 03:33:56,810
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is a similar situation where this needs to be addressed.

2714
03:33:56,910 --> 03:34:01,253
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to, if we can add this probably to, if we can add this address to the committee, the whole list.

2715
03:34:02,526 --> 03:34:04,007
[SPEAKER_26]: That would be perfect.

2716
03:34:05,328 --> 03:34:08,289
[SPEAKER_26]: City engineer can look into that as well.

2717
03:34:08,369 --> 03:34:23,536
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think in this situation, this particular situation, this is an area where at one point the road stopped years ago and then they added on, so I don't think the infrastructure can really handle the newer part of the street.

2718
03:34:24,730 --> 03:34:26,190
[SPEAKER_26]: and Jim will be able to answer that best.

2719
03:34:26,231 --> 03:34:32,312
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we could add this to the list of streets for the community hall meeting and move approval.

2720
03:34:32,533 --> 03:34:32,833
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2721
03:34:33,893 --> 03:34:34,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2722
03:34:34,233 --> 03:34:36,994
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Knight.

2723
03:34:37,294 --> 03:34:38,014
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2724
03:34:39,055 --> 03:34:39,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2725
03:34:39,635 --> 03:34:40,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2726
03:34:40,655 --> 03:34:42,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

2727
03:34:44,673 --> 03:34:46,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion by Councilor Bailão, seconded by Councilor Morell.

2728
03:34:46,817 --> 03:34:47,418
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2729
03:34:47,898 --> 03:34:47,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2730
03:34:48,179 --> 03:34:48,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2731
03:34:48,980 --> 03:34:52,166
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1-5-5-0, offered by Councilor Marksley.

2732
03:34:52,206 --> 03:34:57,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Resolved that the Medford Police Officers, Guy Leone and Sergeant David Bono be recognized.

2733
03:34:58,658 --> 03:35:01,801
[SPEAKER_14]: on their 36 years of dedicated service to the residents of Medford.

2734
03:35:02,141 --> 03:35:09,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Both officers have served with distinction and honor and went above and beyond the call of duty for many years of service.

2735
03:35:09,788 --> 03:35:10,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

2736
03:35:10,909 --> 03:35:11,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2737
03:35:12,090 --> 03:35:13,031
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's amazing.

2738
03:35:13,051 --> 03:35:15,653
[SPEAKER_18]: We had two other officers that are retiring.

2739
03:35:15,713 --> 03:35:23,380
[SPEAKER_18]: And over the last year, we've had talk about institutional knowledge being lost in this community, Mr. President.

2740
03:35:23,740 --> 03:35:25,442
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had a number of good officers

2741
03:35:26,062 --> 03:35:28,044
[SPEAKER_18]: that are retiring, Mr. President.

2742
03:35:28,545 --> 03:35:30,166
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's sad, but I'm happy for them.

2743
03:35:31,007 --> 03:35:40,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Guy Leone, if anyone knew Guy Leone, Guy Leone is one of the nicest, nicest guys you want to meet.

2744
03:35:42,258 --> 03:35:43,920
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, he did his job for 36 years.

2745
03:35:47,346 --> 03:35:49,887
[SPEAKER_18]: always a patrol officer in the car.

2746
03:35:50,367 --> 03:35:52,128
[SPEAKER_18]: You very seldom see that.

2747
03:35:52,148 --> 03:35:54,589
[SPEAKER_18]: 36 years, Mr. President.

2748
03:35:55,149 --> 03:35:56,670
[SPEAKER_18]: And he liked his job.

2749
03:35:56,930 --> 03:35:58,430
[SPEAKER_18]: He liked being on the street.

2750
03:35:58,730 --> 03:36:00,171
[SPEAKER_18]: He liked the interaction.

2751
03:36:00,591 --> 03:36:01,931
[SPEAKER_18]: He liked helping residents.

2752
03:36:02,432 --> 03:36:03,692
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was the type of guy.

2753
03:36:04,733 --> 03:36:07,514
[SPEAKER_18]: He would prefer hunting someone down before giving a ticket.

2754
03:36:07,954 --> 03:36:09,334
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that's who he was.

2755
03:36:09,894 --> 03:36:11,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And he looked out for people.

2756
03:36:12,395 --> 03:36:16,297
[SPEAKER_18]: He looked out for his fellow neighbors and Method residents.

2757
03:36:17,077 --> 03:36:19,638
[SPEAKER_18]: And just an all-around good guy.

2758
03:36:20,058 --> 03:36:22,018
[SPEAKER_18]: He's going to be missed sorely, Mr. President.

2759
03:36:22,418 --> 03:36:30,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, I hope he comes back when they eventually offer retirees to do some work on the side, Mr. President.

2760
03:36:31,420 --> 03:36:33,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, actually, it's not on the side any longer.

2761
03:36:33,100 --> 03:36:37,001
[SPEAKER_18]: It's some work, Mr. President, during their retiring years.

2762
03:36:38,122 --> 03:36:39,162
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to wish him well.

2763
03:36:39,522 --> 03:36:41,202
[SPEAKER_18]: He's going out September 30th.

2764
03:36:42,182 --> 03:36:44,523
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to wish him well, Mr. President.

2765
03:36:45,223 --> 03:36:46,744
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope to see him around the community.

2766
03:36:47,085 --> 03:36:47,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2767
03:36:47,605 --> 03:36:48,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2768
03:36:49,186 --> 03:36:50,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Mr. President, I'm sorry, there's two names on there.

2769
03:36:51,028 --> 03:36:51,968
[SPEAKER_18]: Two names, Officer Bono.

2770
03:36:52,489 --> 03:36:52,929
[SPEAKER_18]: That's one.

2771
03:36:52,969 --> 03:36:58,413
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if anyone wants to talk on him, but Sergeant David Bono, Mr. President.

2772
03:36:59,194 --> 03:36:59,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Another one.

2773
03:36:59,674 --> 03:37:01,976
[SPEAKER_18]: They both came in roughly the same time.

2774
03:37:02,336 --> 03:37:04,918
[SPEAKER_18]: They both have 36 years of service.

2775
03:37:05,699 --> 03:37:09,121
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't be around in January, and that's why I'm offering it tonight.

2776
03:37:09,381 --> 03:37:10,742
[SPEAKER_18]: He's retiring January 8th.

2777
03:37:11,763 --> 03:37:19,351
[SPEAKER_18]: And anyone knows Sergeant Bono, he's been involved in the patrolman's union for years.

2778
03:37:19,391 --> 03:37:25,778
[SPEAKER_18]: He's been involved in the superior officer union for years, a great officer.

2779
03:37:26,178 --> 03:37:31,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone, both these officers, Guy Leone and Dave Bono, unblemished records.

2780
03:37:32,765 --> 03:37:36,889
[SPEAKER_18]: 36 years, both each 36 years, and unblemished records.

2781
03:37:38,150 --> 03:37:42,894
[SPEAKER_18]: They've had a number of accomplishments throughout their career.

2782
03:37:43,835 --> 03:37:48,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Sergeant Bono and Guy Leone, I call them frickin' frack.

2783
03:37:48,860 --> 03:37:50,121
[SPEAKER_18]: You see one, you see the other.

2784
03:37:50,742 --> 03:37:51,302
[SPEAKER_18]: It's amazing.

2785
03:37:51,582 --> 03:37:53,884
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how they got their schedules to be like that.

2786
03:37:54,484 --> 03:37:56,346
[SPEAKER_18]: You saw one, you saw the other.

2787
03:37:56,866 --> 03:37:59,568
[SPEAKER_18]: And just two excellent officers.

2788
03:37:59,928 --> 03:38:04,012
[SPEAKER_18]: I've always felt safe with them on the street, Mr. President, and having them out there.

2789
03:38:04,572 --> 03:38:13,379
[SPEAKER_18]: And Sergeant Bono, with his oversight and being a supervising officer, has always done a tremendous job.

2790
03:38:13,979 --> 03:38:16,963
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, they both will be sorely missed.

2791
03:38:17,724 --> 03:38:32,122
[SPEAKER_18]: I would ask that they receive council accommodations, Mr. President, for each having 36 years of committed and dedicated service to the residents and property of the city of Medford.

2792
03:38:32,342 --> 03:38:32,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2793
03:38:35,014 --> 03:38:35,734
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2794
03:38:36,474 --> 03:38:48,498
[SPEAKER_26]: I also wanted to echo the sentiments of Councilor Marks and thank Officer Leone and Sergeant Bodo for the continuous commitment to the community and thank them for their many years of service and wish them well in their retirement.

2795
03:38:48,859 --> 03:38:49,139
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2796
03:38:49,579 --> 03:38:49,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2797
03:38:50,159 --> 03:38:54,800
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight, all those in favor?

2798
03:38:55,361 --> 03:38:55,481

2804

[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully the last meeting with Mark will be on the 29th.

2805
