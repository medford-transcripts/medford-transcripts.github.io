1
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,055
Yeah.

2
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:53,901
I had to have Paul have the cleaners, because they spent literally four hours in there cleaning the gas.

3
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:57,203
Justin, can you hear me?

4
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:00,406
Yes.

5
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,607
Yeah, I can hear you.

6
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:03,688
All right, great.

7
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,511
All right, how does this thing work?

8
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:08,492
You ready?

9
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:10,574
Yeah, I'm just trying to.

10
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:11,114
Yeah, how does.

11
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:15,598
So you would just in a. Oh, yeah, Mike is six, right?

12
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:25,259
All right, cool.

13
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,380
Just keep our mics on for this.

14
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,582
All right, Jim, you ready?

15
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:40,448
There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council of Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

16
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:43,430
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

17
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:50,521
Councilor Azarro.

18
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,163
Councilor Azarro is absent.

19
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,785
Councilor Scapelli.

20
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,686
Councilor Scapelli is absent.

21
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:01,947
Councilor Singh.

22
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:02,947
Present.

23
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:05,668
And Chairman Lemming.

24
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:06,729
Present.

25
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:09,430
Three present, two absent.

26
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,270
We have a quorum.

27
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,111
Committee.

28
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:12,921
It's called order.

29
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:19,023
Only thing that we're going to be discussing today is the draft of the Medford City Council newsletter.

30
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:20,303
Councillor Sang.

31
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:22,363
Thank you.

32
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:23,964
Thanks for putting this together.

33
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:34,486
My main note is just to add one more item to general business about the trash.

34
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:36,167
Yeah.

35
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:36,847
Can you hear me now?

36
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:41,543
Yeah, just repeat what you just said, sorry.

37
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:50,049
Yeah, so my main thing is just, my main suggestion is just to add one more point to the general business section.

38
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:58,456
I can paste in draft language in the chat, but basically just about the trash resolution that we passed as a council.

39
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:02,939
Right.

40
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:07,355
Yeah, let me let me paste that into the chat and read it out for you guys.

41
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:11,718
I just need to make sure I have the correct date for it.

42
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:12,959
Okay.

43
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:23,857
At the November 18th meeting, the City Council passed a resolution.

44
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:25,940
Oh, I forgot to take out the word detailed.

45
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:33,932
Passed a resolution responding to the administration's plan to shift to bi-weekly trash collection as part of the Zero Waste Initiative.

46
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:43,480
Noting significant resident concerns that unanswered questions about the fees of or we can also just have for that language a little bit, but noting significant resident concerns.

47
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:50,287
The council formally requested clear public communication, comprehensive reports on operational.

48
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:55,489
public health and equity implications, and a public forum to gather community input.

49
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:10,416
The resolution also urged the administration to evaluate alternative waste reduction strategies, outline a mitigation plan for potential negative effects, including rodent issues, and explain how services will be sustained once the $200,000 grant expires.

50
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,477
And we can just edit it down a little bit.

51
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:14,457
I know that's a little long.

52
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:16,018
Yeah.

53
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:17,959
Okay.

54
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:32,711
Yeah I mean I think we can cut like and answer questions about feasibility and impacts of the proposal.

55
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,612
I know administration has been working on that.

56
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:52,286
Okay.

57
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:53,588
What about.

58
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,512
I'm going to shift to my weekly trash collection.

59
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,094
OK, that's still still a bit of a lengthy.

60
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:40,797
Meeting but.

61
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:51,029
It's not as lengthy as some of the other some of the other things on there, so I think it's acceptable.

62
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:04,764
So the, what I just proposed and what I just tried to edit it down to was the November 18th meeting, the city council passed a resolution responding to the administration's plan to shift to biweekly trash collection.

63
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:13,527
The council formally requested clear public communication, comprehensive reports on operational public health and equity implementations in a public forum to gather community input.

64
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:21,549
The resolution also urged the administration to evaluate alternative waste reduction strategy and explain how services will be sustained once the $200,000 grant expires.

65
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:31,924
And feel free, Councilor Callahan or Councilor Sang to just speak up since it's only the three of us.

66
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,466
Yeah, I think it looks fine too.

67
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:37,089
Okay, cool.

68
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:37,589
Thank you.

69
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:46,918
And I'll also note that I didn't, this was originally drafted by Council Vice President Collins and I didn't

70
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:54,842
I realized that when I was adding items to it, that occurred since she passed me this draft.

71
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:59,403
I didn't go through all of the regular meetings, commemorations and acknowledgements.

72
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:14,089
So I would request when we do pass this, that you just give me a, like, let me just include whatever other commemorations and acknowledgements we had since that I may have failed to put into this current draft.

73
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:16,550
That sounds great by me.

74
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:18,233
Okay.

75
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:28,897
Beyond that, does anybody else have any, do either of y'all have any other concerns, comments, questions, edits?

76
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,440
Should we put in a point about the committee, the whole that we had yesterday?

77
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,581
I don't think I saw that on here.

78
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:41,462
Yeah.

79
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,061
I'll just write something.

80
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:22,572
It was the Roberts School, right?

81
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:22,974
Glenn.

82
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:23,717
Yeah.

83
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:24,058
Glenn.

84
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:59,940
Okay, I don't love this language, but if anybody has any other suggestions.

85
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:11,209
At the December 9th Committee of the Whole, the Council heard a presentation on a plan to put solar panels on the McGlynn in preparation for potentially approving a 20-year contract with, what was it called?

86
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:14,151
Okay.

87
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:18,335
Yeah.

88
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:31,486
At the December 9th Committee of the Whole, the council heard a presentation on a plan to put solar panels on the McGlynn School in preparation for potentially approving a 20-year contract with Select Solar.

89
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:36,190
Does anybody else have any suggestions for?

90
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:44,317
Yeah, I would just add in the power purchase agreement to purchase electricities produced by said installation.

91
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:48,280
Wait, sorry.

92
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,982
Can you repeat that just word for word?

93
00:26:52,550 --> 00:27:00,314
I'm just taking it directly from the text that we got.

94
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,696
Let me just paste it in the chat.

95
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,419
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,820
So I would just add in the power purchase agreement.

97
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:19,426
And if there's a good way to

98
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:25,607
combine this information from the slides.

99
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:23,165
December 9th committee, the whole council heard a presentation on a plan to authorize the city to enter into a 20 year lease agreement to allow for installation of solar photo.

100
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:39,314
They lick PV on the McGlynn school roof, as well as a power purchase agreement to purchase electricity produced by said installation, uh, installation of solar photo.

101
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:41,355
I think you could probably just say solar panels.

102
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:42,276
Yeah.

103
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:51,501
I added some information in the chat that might be helpful for residents.

104
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:56,947
There might be a way to synthesize it shorter.

105
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:05,777
Just the last three messages I sent, I think those would answer some questions that residents might have.

106
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:07,995
about this.

107
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:10,076
I'm seeing your notes.

108
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:14,577
I feel like that gets a little bit too into the weeds for a newsletter.

109
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:17,437
I could link to the documents.

110
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,078
Yeah, if you could link to the documents.

111
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:26,980
Yeah, some of this also assumes that we will agree to the contract extension.

112
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,640
And it says installation will start fall 2026.

113
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:32,281
I mean, yeah.

114
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:34,041
I was thinking you added the word would.

115
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,642
I mean, it's all hypothetical.

116
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:42,275
But yeah, I mean, I wasn't saying that you should copy and paste.

117
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:44,096
I think we would have to say would.

118
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:47,420
But yeah, if you could just link it, I think that'd be helpful.

119
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,843
Yeah, I haven't had time to, yep.

120
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:59,172
Yeah, and maybe if you could just add in that, like, we did requests more information ahead of the, like, yeah.

121
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:13,193
And that's for next week's December 16th meeting?

122
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:13,974
Yes.

123
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:18,655
Okay.

124
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:20,315
How about this?

125
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:22,536
That works.

126
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:25,157
Okay.

127
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:25,557
Cool.

128
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:27,858
Okay.

129
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:31,199
Anybody else have any other suggestions for this?

130
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,741
Do we have any motions on the floor?

131
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:45,863
Motion to approve with the, allowing you to add any of the commemorations.

132
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:47,803
Do we have a second?

133

Second.
