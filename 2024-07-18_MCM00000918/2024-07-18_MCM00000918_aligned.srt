1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:06,676
I'm going to get started because I actually think this will be a relatively brief meeting and I know there are a couple of people who weren't able to join us.

2
00:00:06,736 --> 00:00:09,859
I'm going to go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:13,622
I'm going to read the meeting notice for official purposes here.

00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:45,923
Okay.

63
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:47,344
Hi, Emily.

64
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:48,725
I'm marking you here.

65
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,129
Thank you.

66
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:59,897
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 present, 5 absent.

67
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:02,038
We'll call the meeting to order.

68
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:13,667
The first item on the agenda is our consent agenda, which for this meeting only includes the approval of the minutes from our 6-12 full committee meeting.

69
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,849
Is there a motion to approve the minutes?

70
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:20,497
Motion to approve?

71
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:23,900
Motion to approve by Aaron Olopade.

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,720
Seconded.

73
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,803
Seconded by Mayor Longo Kern.

74
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,104
Hello?

75
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:33,326
Okay, we have to do a roll call because we're on Zoom.

76
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,328
So, Jenny Graham, yes.

77
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:37,769
Mayor Longo Kern?

78
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:38,289

79
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,071
Dr. Edward Vincent?

80
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:42,972
Yes.

81
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:44,433
Jeff Cushing?

82
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:49,317
My apologies, yes.

83
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:51,108
No problem.

84
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:53,849
Dr. Galluzzi, absent.

85
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,929
Marta Cabral?

86
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:55,849
Yes.

87
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,170
Libby Brown?

88
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,930
Yes.

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,350
Marissa Desmond?

90
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,411
Absent.

91
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:03,871
Maria Dorsey?

92
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:04,711
Yes.

93
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:06,632
Brian Hilliard?

94
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,374
Oh, we can't hear you, Brian, but I heard a yes.

95
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:16,174
Is that thumbs up?

96
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:19,545
Okay, Tracy Keene?

97
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:20,346
Yes.

98
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,107
Emily Lazaro?

99
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:23,328
Yes.

100
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,750
Nicole Morrell, absent.

101
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,893
Aaron Lopate?

102
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:29,833
Yes.

103
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:32,035
And Luke Prisner, absent.

104
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:38,860
So 11 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, five absent.

105
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,782
Motion, minutes are approved.

106
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:49,020
Okay, I actually think this meeting is gonna be very short and thank you for hopping on and making sure that we have a quorum.

107
00:04:50,241 --> 00:05:03,869
But I am really delighted to report that all of our feasibility, all of our eligibility phase deliverables, I'm getting ahead of myself, are complete and submitted.

108
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,370
So that's like a big deal.

109
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,232
So just a quick rundown for all of you.

110
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:10,613
The feasibility study,

111
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:17,118
funding earmark is something that the council had to take up and vote on.

112
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:33,109
They did that at the 625 meeting and they voted to earmark or allocate $3 million for a feasibility study that has been moved into a special account that will sort of sit and wait for us to be ready to

113
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:41,338
spend that money by a vote of 6 affirmative, 0 negative, 1 absent.

114
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:44,602
And that information has been transmitted over to MSBA.

115
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:45,163
We did that.

116
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:49,748
They actually had to approve the language up front.

117
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:51,971
They were watching closely.

118
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:53,212
They watched the meetings get posted.

119
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:58,595
And they were very eager to hear our results.

120
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,456
And so they know that that has been approved.

121
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:06,457
So that's a really big deal and very exciting.

122
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:16,979
The very next day, I finally hit submit on our chapter 74 form, which includes the expanded programs that we're looking to study in our feasibility study.

123
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,521
So thanks to Dr. Cushing and Chad Fallon in particular who helped

124
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:51,313
flesh out that document both from a current capacity of programs, future capacity to demonstrate where the wait list was at, to demonstrate that expansion was viable, as well as the work that they did in the lead up to all of that to bring forward to the school committee a proposal that would have us study five new programs as part of this feasibility study from a space perspective.

125
00:06:52,793 --> 00:07:01,217
So all of that, and you all approved the submission of that form a couple of meetings ago, but all of that went in on the 26th of June.

126
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:09,962
The educational profile went in on 7-1 in the morning because I wanted to read it again with fresh eyes.

127
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:20,347
It is a 20-something page document that includes a lot of hard work from all of you and the administration in particular who worked hard

128
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:38,426
to answer a lot of questions about teaching methodology and in particular some of the questions about early education and childcare where we have an opportunity to be thinking about studying those things in our educational profile.

129
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,008
That went in on 7-1.

130
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:49,833
You all have copies that Lisa Malone shared with you with this meeting agenda of those two deliverables.

131
00:07:50,793 --> 00:08:00,899
We are also working to update the website so that all of those deliverables are available to the public so you can look out for that on the public site coming up.

132
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,342
But those deliverables have gone over to MSBA.

133
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,847
The next thing that we submitted on the 11th, which was last week, was our enrollment projection.

134
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:23,681
And that goes through a series of questions around not just school enrollment, but verifying that their numbers that they get from DESE are correct, as well as asking a lot of questions about

135
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:33,168
the development plans of the city in terms of housing capacity, housing expansion, and all of that.

136
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:35,689
So the mayor's office was very helpful.

137
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:51,279
Alicia Hunt in particular was critical to collecting all of the information from a whole bunch of different folks across the administration, including like the number of building permits and the housing projects that are sort of in permitting phase and how many units they're supposed to be.

138
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:03,809
And the other thing we had to submit with our enrollment projection was a lot of information about our special education programs that Joan Bowen helped with.

139
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:13,778
And then a big discussion around our early education and child care programming that Dr. Pelosi was very integral.

140
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:18,121
So all of that went in on the 7th, sorry, on the 11th, and then

141
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:32,556
On Friday evening, thanks to the help of John McLaughlin and in particular, Paul Rousseau and Dr. Cushing, we submitted our maintenance and capital planning documentation, which was

142
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:57,888
sort of a beast to submit because it covered everything from what are the job descriptions of your maintenance staff to what should your maintenance budget be and if there is a variance between your actual budget and what you think it should be why is there a variance and essentially like asking us to respond to how will we ensure good solid maintenance of the building so it required a ton of

143
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:07,198
exhibits and attachments and lots of work by the finance office under Jerry McHugh and Noel.

144
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:14,506
So all of that work finally, finally, last finishing touches went in on the 12th.

145
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:35,815
I did talk with MSBA last week and at the time what they indicated to me was that the next step for us would be a meeting where we essentially agree on a certified number of students that we would be studying the size of the building for.

146
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:42,540
When I asked last week what she thought the timeline of that would be, she indicated that we should expect

147
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,903
to set up that meeting either in late summer or early fall.

148
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:53,089
And yesterday, I got an email saying that they're available to talk to us as soon as next week.

149
00:10:53,209 --> 00:11:08,222
So we will be having that meeting next week with MSBA and folks from the mayor's team and from the administration, where they will go through sort of their deep dive into all of the information we submitted, the housing plans, everything.

150
00:11:08,823 --> 00:11:09,884
And then we will talk about

151
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,393
what that certified enrollment number should look like.

152
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:20,377
So that is the next piece in the puzzle and the next step for us.

153
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:30,285
Once that is done, all of our information will have to go to the board for consideration and approval to move to what they call Module 2.

154
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:42,379
That according to the 270 day timeline that would have had us at the February board meeting.

155
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:52,267
I am hopeful that we will make an appearance at a sooner board meeting than February given that we're sort of moving quickly through our deliverables.

156
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:52,448
So.

157
00:11:53,028 --> 00:12:07,140
I'm not sure exactly where that will land or what the lead time is between the time when we say like we're sort of all in agreement about this enrollment study and when reasonably things can get to the board for consideration.

158
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,182
So we'll sort of learn more about that in the coming weeks.

159
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:18,469
But that is a wrap, as they say, for the eligibility phase.

160
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:21,452
So I'll stop and ask if anybody has any questions.

161
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,847
Do you know how frequently the board meets?

162
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:32,388
Is it quarterly or?

163
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:34,189
They meet every other month.

164
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,870
So they have a December meeting.

165
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,391
They have an October meeting.

166
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:45,912
So they must have an August meeting is my guess.

167
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,613
But yeah, it's like an every other month schedule.

168
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:56,286
Okay, well, seeing and hearing no other questions.

169
00:12:57,746 --> 00:13:13,592
The other thing that I wanted to mention in terms of next steps is for this group to really start to think about immersing itself in what they call module two, which is officially called assembling the project team.

170
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:19,374
So this is where we will put out a procurement to hire an owner's project manager.

171
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:22,395
And we will bring that person on board.

172
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:29,198
And then that OPM will help us craft our procurement to secure the architect.

173
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:40,263
So there is a process around the work that the OPM will do with us in order to inform that architect's bid or bid request.

174
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:49,998
As I've started reading, there is a template that I believe MSBA requires us to use to secure the OPM.

175
00:13:50,018 --> 00:14:00,307
I have been in touch with the procurement office to make sure like we have a good understanding of what all is needed from the city side for compliance purposes.

176
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:08,773
But between now and the next meeting, if you all can find 40 minutes or so to immerse yourself in sort of that next module,

177
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:09,974
process.

178
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:15,218
I think that would be informative and educational for everybody in terms of like what we need to do.

179
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:23,663
But but briefly, we will have to form a selection committee, who will who will pick the OPM essentially.

180
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:28,727
So there's going to be some work for us to sort of get that procurement ready to go out the door.

181
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:31,388
And then once we receive those

182
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:39,898
Bids back there will we among us will have to decide how the selection committee will be formed is my understanding.

183
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:48,467
And then there may be some meetings with MSBA or like roundtables that happen that they may require us to go to so.

184
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:54,231
There is a whole slew of other things that happen in module two because you move on to the architect.

185
00:14:54,291 --> 00:15:05,735
But like in my mind, once we have the OPM on board, it will be somebody who does this for a living with MSBA and they will be able to sort of help educate us along the way.

186
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:09,237
So that's just a sort of to do for everybody.

187
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:13,619
And I'm still like reading and diving through those documents myself.

188
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:18,241
So that is something we'll talk about and take up in our next

189
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,082
Regular meeting.

190
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:23,185
Questions about that Tracy.

191
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:26,127
Where do we find module 2?

192
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:36,978
If you go onto the MSBA website, there's a section called building with us, and it specs it out, module one, module two, module three.

193
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:40,962
So if you go in there, you can like really dive in.

194
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:43,504
There's lots of information out there.

195
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:53,893
All the model documents are out there, as well as, you know, there are documents around like really like what they see in terms of,

196
00:15:55,434 --> 00:16:06,127
costs that other communities have incurred or over the course of this next phase, both for the OPM and the designer and then in construction.

197
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:13,076
And, you know, it's hard to look at those and really assess, like, how does that compare to what we will do

198
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:20,222
I will say that MSBA was comfortable with the allocation of $3 million.

199
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:27,047
And they don't give communities numbers, but they are happy.

200
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:32,432
They will tell a community if they have not allocated a sufficient amount of funds for the face.

201
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,492
So we're good there.

202
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:38,136
And obviously, the procurement will have to support whatever we do from there.

203
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:41,839
So yeah, all of that is on their website.

204
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:49,192
And there's lots of templates and information out there.

205
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:51,534
Their board meetings are public.

206
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:57,680
Everyone is welcome to join, as are all of their meetings.

207
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,805
So if there are meetings that you see out there, you're all welcome to just join and listen and be a participant.

208
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:11,992
But there will be some formal things that we have to attend over the course of the next phase as well.

209
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,333
So we'll keep an eye on that.

210
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,972
Any other questions about Module 2?

211
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,160
All right.

212
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:48,880
So the other thing that I wanted to make sure that I say out loud is that we originally had an August 14th meeting scheduled for the full committee via Zoom, and we will not have that meeting as a full committee because we are very much

213
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,703
in a mode of waiting to hear.

214
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:58,465
So I don't want to take up your time in that next meeting if there is an action for this group to take.

215
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:11,991
Instead, the Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee will meet at that time on August 14th at 6 p.m., and that will help us fill the gap of the meeting that I needed to reschedule at the end of June.

216
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:19,005
And they will be working on the communications and community agent subcommittee.

217
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:33,611
We'll be working on some of the surveys to collect FAQs from residents, as well as a survey that gets out to all our boards and commissions to help understand sort of who needs to be plugged into the process and when.

218
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,852
And then the other thing that we'll be working on is

219
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:47,604
you know, the start of what will become a little bit of like a roadshow kind of document that we can use to talk about where we are with the project.

220
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:58,082
And I also am in touch with a couple of folks in a couple of districts about tours to be scheduled over the course of this summer.

221
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:01,723
So as soon as I have those dates, I will let you know so you can mark your calendar.

222
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:08,886
My contacts are just trying to like work with their contacts and navigate everybody's school vacation out of office time.

223
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,007
So more to come on that.

224
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:13,708
But as those get scheduled, I will keep you posted.

225
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:25,698
Are there any other questions from the group about where we are, what we're doing, anything?

226
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:38,781
Just wanted to say I'm just so happy that we're making great progress and I'm very optimistic about next week's meeting.

227
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,842
So thank you, Member Graham, for all of your leadership.

228
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:46,123
It was a true team effort.

229
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:53,518
There was a lot of documentation, particularly on the maintenance capital planning.

230
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:55,260
Oh, thank you for that reminder, though.

231
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,684
The enrollment projection and the maintenance and capital planning information gets submitted directly into a portal.

232
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:08,548
So it's not quite as easy to just pop it out to the site and link it there.

233
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,633
So I'm working through how to make that information shareable.

234
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,256
We have working documents that we use to get those answers ready.

235
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,540
And they're a hot mess, like working documents are.

236
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:27,065
So I'm just working on how to make sure there can be a cohesive story there.

237
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:31,108
And then we will publish all of that stuff out to the website as well if people are interested.

238
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,431
And we will share all of that with you all as soon as it's

239
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,073
Um, as soon as it's cleaned up.

240
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:48,881
So that's on my, that's on my to do list over the coming days is just to figure out like, especially with the maintenance stuff, it's just, it's a lot and it's a hundred attachments and all kinds of things.

241
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:57,147
So, um, any other questions, comments, thoughts?

242
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:10,363
Okay, is there a motion to adjourn?

243
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:28,251
I'll just also thank you, member Graham, for leading the charge and to the whole team, as you said, it's a team effort, but for getting this in and in so timely, it's exciting to see everything moving forward so quickly.

244
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:29,532
So thank you.

245
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:31,313
And with that being said, I'll move to adjourn.

246
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:34,773
Motion to adjourn by Mayor Lungo Kern.

247
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:36,494
Seconded, Maria.

248
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:39,494
Seconded by Maria Dorsey.

249
00:21:39,854 --> 00:21:41,595
And one more painful roll call.

250
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:42,515
Jenny Graham, yes.

251
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:43,655

252
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:44,175

254
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:49,016
Yes.

255
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:51,457
Dr. Cushing.

256
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:52,417
Yes.

257
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,157
Dr. Galluzzi, absent.

258
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:56,218
Marta Cabral.

259
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:57,718
Yes.

260
00:21:58,973 --> 00:21:59,614
Libby Brown.

261
00:22:00,294 --> 00:22:00,534
Yes.

262
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:02,196
Marissa Desmond.

263
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,458
Maria Dorsey.

264
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:05,198
Yes.

265
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:06,580
Brian Hilliard.

266
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:12,324
Yes.

267
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:13,946
Tracy Keene.

268
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:15,007
Yes.

269
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:16,864
Emily Lazaro?

270
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,486
Yes.

271
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:19,547
Nicole Morrell?

272
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:20,408
Yes.

273
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:21,750
Errol Apate?

274
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:22,591
Yes.

275
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:23,972
Luke Preissner?

276
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:24,493
Absent.

277
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:30,380
So 12 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, three absent.

278
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,663
That's probably the fastest meeting we'll ever have.

279
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:33,764
Thank you, everyone.

280
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:34,385
Have a good night.
