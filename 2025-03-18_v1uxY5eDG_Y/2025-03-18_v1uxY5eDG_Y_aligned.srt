1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:03,391
the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:05,193
The secretary will call the roll.

3
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:15,382
Present.

4
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:16,503
Seven present, none absent.

5
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:18,105
All please rise and salute our flag.

6
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:25,852
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,952
under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

8
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:37,756
I would now like to invite Ms.

9
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:46,340
Caldwell up to give a brief synopsis of the Columbus School Student Office's inauguration ceremony.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,181
Ms.

11
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:47,541
Caldwell.

12
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:48,899
Thank you.

13
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,040
Good evening, everybody.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:01:02,089
And I'd like to welcome our parents, our students, our grandparents, and friends of the Columbus School, as well as Mr. Platty, the fourth grade teacher.

15
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,251
Oh, thanks, Joe.

16
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,073
Miss Kay, the principal.

17
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,056
Miss Sherman Hudson, the assistant principal of the Columbus School.

18
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:13,839
And I believe I saw Miss Ross here as well.

19
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,800
Thank you for coming.

20
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,302
So very briefly, Mr. Platty's

21
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:25,250
Fourth grade class at the Columbus Elementary School learned all about the electoral process this fall.

22
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:35,382
After completing a social studies unit on our system of government, citizenship, which included rights and responsibilities, and the U.S.

23
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,446
electoral process, the class held its own election.

24
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:49,793
To coincide with the presidential election, Mr. Plattie provided the students with a virtual experience of our country's electoral process.

25
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:56,617
His fourth grade class held their own election for a class president and a vice president.

26
00:01:57,572 --> 00:02:02,996
The students follow the same procedures used in our national presidential election.

27
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:07,099
There was a primary, and then there was also a final election.

28
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,961
The process began with nominations.

29
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:19,929
Students could name or nominate a fellow student for either office, providing the nomination was supported by two fellow students.

30
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:26,500
There were nine students nominated for president and three for vice president.

31
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:49,450
The nominated students had to complete the following, write and give a two-minute speech, which was a persuasive writing assignment, explaining, convincing classmates why they should be elected, make one to two 24 by 30-inch campaign posters, and create campaign flyers and or buttons.

32
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,878
The issues students addressed included the following.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:08,154
The students wanted more independent reading time in class, an extra recess when class follows PBIS 100%, and PBIS is positive behavior for students.

34
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:15,318
Persuade Mr. Platty for one homework-free night when students complete a classroom job.

35
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:29,061
Be available to listen to concerns or ideas a classmate might have, and to advocate for the student with the teacher, and to become a role model for the class.

36
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:36,302
Some candidates put their names on pencils and candy bars, which were distributed to the electorate.

37
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:43,203
The two top vote getters for president and vice president went into the final election.

38
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:46,886
Once again, the candidates presented to their classmates.

39
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,568
Secret ballots were cast.

40
00:03:50,669 --> 00:04:01,898
And I'd like to call Mr. Clady up to the podium right now because I believe he should do the honors of announcing the winners of the presidential and vice presidential election of the Columbus Elementary School.

41
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:03,059
Thank you.

42
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:15,867
Madam Mayor, members of the school committee, Superintendent Belson, Assistant Superintendent Ms.

43
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:20,250
Caldwell, Deputy Superintendent, Principal of the Columbus School, Ms.

44
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,653
Kay, Assistant Principal Nancy Sherman-Hudson, my first piano teacher.

45
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:36,542
It is with great pleasure that I am pleased to announce the president of the class of room 307, fourth grade at the Columbus Elementary is Mariah Matul.

46
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:47,877
And our class vice president, hiding behind the flag bearer, is Alex Lombardo.

47
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,739
The colors will now be presented by Joelle Ritchie.

48
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,680
Please present the colors, Mr. Ritchie.

49
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:18,082
Mr. Ritchie is accompanied by President-Elect Mariah Mattel and Vice President-Elect Alexandra Lombardo.

50
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:27,349
Mr. Superintendent, could you please place your right hand

51
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:38,577
on the Bible, and repeat after me.

52
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,418
Raise left hand on the Bible.

53
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm sorry, right hand.

54
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,080
Good girl.

55
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:43,782
I, say your name.

56
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:46,525

00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,896
Madam Vice President, it's your turn.

00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,079

Congratulations.

107
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:43,583
And at this time, we'd like to invite our president to say a few words, if you'd like to.

108
00:08:47,967 --> 00:09:02,232
As class president, I promise to do my best for my classmates and work with Vice President Alexandra in coming up with ideas to make this a great fourth grade year.

109
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:06,533
Alexandra and I have some great accomplishments already.

110
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:17,557
The first one is that we started a fundraising penny drive and raised $62 for the World Wildlife Fund to save two endangered animals.

111
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:30,828
The second one is that we successfully petitioned our teacher to give us a reading coupon.

112
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:36,912
If we do all our homework, we get to sit and enjoy some pleasure reading on our own.

113
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:40,254
And we get to sit in Mr. Potty's special chair.

114
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:56,890
The third one is that we successfully petitioned our teacher for extra recess when we make progress with our positive behavior goals.

115
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,712
We have won two recesses so far.

116
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:17,821
The fourth one is that we came up with a coupon system, which helps save the environment by cutting down on wasting classroom paper towels.

117
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:18,661
Very good.

118
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:33,792
And finally, on behalf of myself, Vice President Alexandra, and our entire class, we want to thank Mariburg for making this amazing act.

119
00:10:43,532 --> 00:10:46,814
She's already made quite a few accomplishments in such a short time.

120
00:10:47,755 --> 00:11:07,229
And on behalf of the school committee, we'd like to present you with pennies for your penny drive.

121
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,871
Mr. Flagbearer, please retire the colors.

122
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:17,629
Thank you ladies, great job.

123
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:36,100
Madam Mayor, I have to say that without any question of a doubt, and I am sure the audience will all agree, that is the most positive thing that has happened during this election season.

124
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,081
Thank you very much.

125
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:53,849
Madam Mayor.

126
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,730
Mr. Superintendent.

127
00:11:56,871 --> 00:12:02,914
Without taking any positions in the upcoming election, Medford is certainly right out front.

128
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:07,856
We've just elected two females to the top jobs.

129
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:09,797
We're ahead of the curve.

130
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,745
Thank you all so much for being here tonight.

131
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:21,291
This is a very special event for us, as well as for all of you parents, students, teachers, and administrators.

132
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,073
So thank you all for being a part of this tonight.

133
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:33,805
Mrs. Cuno.

134
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:44,586
Now this was refreshing, I have to say, and this is why we sit here sometimes, and I'll speak for myself, and this was very well, very well worth.

135
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,091
why we're here.

136
00:12:46,811 --> 00:13:01,306
I just want to say thank you to everyone, but I also want to congratulate Mr. Plattie for really bringing the ideas to our children, letting them come to school happy, letting them come to school because they want to learn.

137
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:06,631
I know, I get emotional for all this stuff, but it really

138
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:09,253
You know, people think maybe this isn't important.

139
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:16,657
It's very important, because these children have learned so much about our governmental process that they don't even know they've learned.

140
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,037
So, thank you.

141
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:18,478
Very good.

142
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:19,598
Thank you, Mr. Pratt.

143
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:27,002
Did you want to say a few words?

144
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:42,038
I just want to make some thank yous, and I hope I get everybody in the list here, because I do want to first start with the mayor, because this was originally supposed to start off as just something at six o'clock before the meeting started, and we were going to come in and out without being obtrusive.

145
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:48,741
And Mayor Burke turned this into a fantastic extravaganza and event that these girls and their families will never ever forget.

146
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,443
So I would like to thank you for doing such a great job.

147
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:55,385
And your two staff members, Linda Colletti, Lauren Felch,

148
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:07,502
And I'd like to give a shout out of thanks to our Superintendent Belson and to our School Principal Kathy Kay and our Assistant Principal Nancy Sherman-Hudson for all your support in getting this and helping in endorsing all of this.

149
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:11,867
And I almost forgot, our Assistant Superintendent of Schools, Diane Caldwell.

150
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,071
And thanks to the committee for inviting us in.

151
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,911
Thank you very, very much.

152
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:19,852
Thank you, Mr. Clady.

153
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:23,133
Ms.

154
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:23,613
Van de Kloot.

155
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:27,095
Do you suppose that they could help us with our election next time around?

156
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,049
scoped up the talent.

157
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:40,893
I already scoped out the talent before the meeting and a few people have already volunteered on my campaign.

158
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:45,496
I'm sure there's a few that will be here someday, so great job students.

159
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:50,761
Have a great evening, get home and finish your homework so that Mr. Platt is happy with you tomorrow.

160
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:58,180
Could someone make a motion for suspension of the rules so that we could present the math students?

161
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,720
Motion for suspension of the rules by Ms.

162
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,281
Van de Kloot.

163
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:01,781
Is there a second?

164
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:02,161
Second.

165
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:02,901
By Ms.

166
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:03,461
Benedetto.

167
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:04,282
All those in favor?

168
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:04,582
Aye.

169
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:05,402
All those opposed?

170
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,942
Suspension is granted.

171
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:09,343
Thank you.

172
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:11,044
Thank you.

173
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:12,204
It's item 7-1.

174
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,885
Presentation of Math Student Achievement Awards.

175
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:16,866
Mr. Superintendent.

176
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:34,318
Madam Mayor and members of the committee and ladies and gentlemen, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents each year recognizes outstanding students in each community for which there is a superintendent who is a member of Mass.

177
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,840
These awards are not given lightly.

178
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:45,065
They're given to individuals who have not only accomplished academic excellence, but have done other terrific things in their school environments.

179
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:56,272
So this evening, we have two presentations, one to a member of Medford High School and one to a member of the Medford Vocational Technical High School, both seniors and both outstanding individuals.

180
00:15:56,773 --> 00:16:01,276
So at this time, it's my great pleasure to read you about the first one, and then we'll bring that person up.

181
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,978
And then we'll do the second and do the same.

182
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:08,971
The first individual is a member of the class of 2017 at Medford High School.

183
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:13,155
He is a consistent honor roll student with a GPA of 4.07.

184
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:21,843
Zachary is interested in environmental studies and plans to apply to several small colleges for environmental programs.

185
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:32,812
At Medford High School, he is the captain of the swim team, a former member of the crew team, as well as a member of the Roots and Shoots Club, which works for environmental change in the school and community.

186
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:38,514
He is a member of the Mustang of the Fells Club, which promotes outdoor education.

187
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:49,618
He participated in the Brainstart Entrepreneurship Program last year at MHS, and is a past Triple Crown award winner for outstanding academic and civic achievements at Medford High School.

188
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:57,329
Zachary is a runner who participated in the Medford Jingle Bells run fundraiser and last year ran the Burlington Marathon.

189
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,832
In addition to his sports and clubs, Zachary works at the Medford High School pool as a lifeguard.

190
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:09,096
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my distinct pleasure to call up for your recognition, Zachary Mafio.

191
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:10,157
Zachary, where are you?

192
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:21,597
Congratulations, Zach.

193
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:21,917
Thank you.

194
00:17:22,197 --> 00:17:23,618
Congratulations, Zach.

195
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:24,198
Good job.

196
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,978
Would you like to say a few words?

197
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:27,578
Oh.

198
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,419
If you'd like.

199
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:36,880
I'd just like to say thank you to the City Council for this honor and the Student Council.

200
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:41,521
And thank you to you, Mayor Burke, and Superintendent Belson.

201
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:42,522
It's truly an honor.

202
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:43,682
Thank you, Zach.

203
00:17:48,911 --> 00:18:00,122
I was lucky enough last spring to do a hike with Zach and some of his fellow members of the Mustang Trail and it was quite a unique experience and they know all about the trail.

204
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:05,967
They started it up themselves and it's quite a something to be very proud of so he'll do great with environmental studies.

205
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,857
Our next award winner is from the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

206
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:37,663
This individual is a senior in the construction craft laborers and is ranked number two in the senior class.

207
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:45,830
A hard worker and always eager to learn, she has spent the last three years learning many skills in the construction and carpentry field.

208
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:51,195
Last year she was a medal winner in masonry at the Regional Skills USA competition.

209
00:18:52,681 --> 00:19:03,487
She spent the summer working with a general contractor and recently was hired at Cleveland Fence Company in Stonehenge, Massachusetts, where she will work in a cooperative education job.

210
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:13,332
Her teachers report that during his time at MHS, he had been a consistent and committed student and a great asset to the Construction Craft Laborers Program.

211
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,817
Long-term goal is to become a general contractor.

212
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:23,261
Immediate goals are to join and work for construction or carpentry union while pursuing a degree in construction management.

213
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,983
It's our pleasure to introduce Valerie Seju.

214
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:35,910
Okay.

215
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,450
Okay.

216
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,473
So we'll make sure that it's presented and that, uh,

217
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:42,903
individuals duly recognized.

218
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:43,523
Very good.

219
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,143
Thank you.

220
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:52,865
Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

221
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,325

Report of Committees, Curriculum Subcommittee Meeting.

247
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:37,715
Ms.

248
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,536
VanderKloof is the chairperson.

249
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:40,677
Hi.

250
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,560
We did have a meeting on October 13th.

251
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,821
I was the chair.

252
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:50,584
Subcommittee members Mia Mastone and Robert Scurry were present.

253
00:20:50,964 --> 00:21:02,913
Also present was Kathy Kretz and Arenda Benedetto, the superintendent, assistant superintendent Diane Caldwell, director of curriculum Bernadette Riccidelli, director of humanities Nicole Chiesa,

254
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,688
Director of Math, Carolyn Joy.

255
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:06,269
Director of Science, Rocco Sieri.

256
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,511
Director of Pupil Services, Kathleen Madaglio.

257
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,193
Director of ELL, Leslie Trotta.

258
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:20,361
All of our principals, teachers, Cole Sanford and parents, Alexandra Laurie, Alicia Karen, Melanie McLaughlin, Michelle Ciccolo, and Jen Lewis.

259
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:25,745
The purpose of the meeting was to review and discuss the 2000 state test results.

260
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:31,290
We were each provided with the reports on the test results in all areas which are attached to this report.

261
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:38,536
Deputy Nelson and Assistant Superintendent Caldwell discussed the state testing and the variables affecting the testing.

262
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:45,044
They explained that the discussion would focus on subgroup data for park rates 3 to 8 and MCAS.

263
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:50,531
Deputy Superintendent introduced Nicole Chiesa, Caroline Joy, and Rocky Sierra.

264
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:52,832
Ms.

265
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:54,674
Caldwell gave a brief history of MCAS.

266
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:57,777
It was also stated there was no state data available this year.

267
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:03,983
Then we had, by Nicole Chiesa, an overview of the ELA MCAS grade 10 results.

268
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,529
Superintendent Belson clarified the Asian subgroup population.

269
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:11,163
It is not homogeneous.

270
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:15,606
It includes a wide range of groups from across the continent, and it varies from city to city.

271
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:24,393
We continued with an overview of the MCAS grade 10 results, and then we went to the science results for grades 5, 8, and 10.

272
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:32,780
Discussion was held about the difficulty of disaggregating grade 10 science as students were taking different content areas and are in different grade levels.

273
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,662
They also discussed the low scores for grade 5.

274
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:39,205
Mr. Cieri said that grade 5 scores were low across the board,

275
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:41,504
and he plans research programs this year.

276
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:47,068
They also need to look at the budget for material supplies and additional professional development for elementary students.

277
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:57,817
A view of PARC ELA mathematics for grades three to eight, PARC and ELA mathematics for grades three to eight followed with a review of the highlights and the subgroup data.

278
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:03,082
Discussion was held regarding computer-based testing at the Andrew School and paper testing.

279
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:07,886
It was determined that more time is needed for elementary staff to learn how to use computers when testing.

280
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,521
Dr. McAdilly explained the park assessments.

281
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:12,282
This is Medford's first year.

282
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:17,286
Students are required to not only answer the question, but also to explain how they got there.

283
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:21,288
Mr. Benedetto asked about comparison of like districts to Medford.

284
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:22,989
A report will be generated.

285
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:23,449
Ms.

286
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:28,292
Nelson described the five point scale park uses and the four point MCAS scale.

287
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:28,853
Ms.

288
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:35,437
Nelson also reviewed student report inconsistencies around the following changes in numbers between levels, plus or minus

289
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:39,241
7.4 range and the explanation of the legend.

290
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,365
I asked what was the takeaway from the evening.

291
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:49,274
Superintendent Belson said that we need to get better, improve science and math scores, review and purchase a new elementary science program

292
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:51,808
and look hard at our specialized population.

293
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:55,771
There's a lot of transition statewide, and the state is still sorting it out.

294
00:23:56,371 --> 00:23:56,551
Ms.

295
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:01,034
McStone would like to look at the Brooks School to collaborate on effective teaching strategies around science.

296
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:05,157
The number of ELL students at the Brooks is much less than the other schools.

297
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:07,979
Testing in 2017 was discussed.

298
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,060
The high school will continue to use MCAS.

299
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,924
MCAS 2.0 is untimed, no long compositions, and will resemble part questions.

300
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:20,103
Grades four and eight will have online testing of all students.

301
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,365
The Andrews will be online testing for all grades.

302
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:29,487
A meeting with Revere and Burlington Public Schools is planned to look at infrastructure needs for technology.

303
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:30,327
Ms.

304
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:34,689
McLaughlin raised concerns around students with disabilities taking MCAS 2.0.

305
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,050
It will be discussed in the weeks ahead.

306
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,791
Our meeting was adjourned at 9 p.m.

307
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:42,612
Respectfully submitted myself as chair.

308
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:43,753
Thank you, Ms.

309
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,233
Van de Kloot.

310
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:45,916
Mr. Benedetto.

311
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:46,556
Thank you.

312
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:47,437
Thank you for the report.

313
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:49,758
And I apologize for coming in late that evening.

314
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:59,364
Um, so I missed a little bit about the, um, the MCAS scores for math in ELA for our 10th graders.

315
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:04,748
Do we do a comparison, um, from this year to the last few years?

316
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,329
Did we get a graph of that?

317
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:09,391
Cause I didn't, I didn't get it that evening and I don't see it tonight.

318
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:10,452
Mr. Superintendent.

319
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:14,094
This, uh, report, uh,

320
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:18,538
was basically a follow-up on things that we didn't cover in the first time.

321
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,660
We did give you a report earlier on state assessment results and accountability ratings.

322
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:33,183
And that included a lot of the high school 10th grade MCAS scores and comparisons with the state, because that's the only place where the state had any comparative data.

323
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,084
They didn't do anything in the other areas.

324
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:37,624
But it's in the back of your report here.

325
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,425
You've got this last piece here, which does that.

326
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:39,995
Okay.

327
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,916
Also, do, do have, we can, okay.

328
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:51,158
We show the graph for the high school and the junior high for the last few years of MCAS for 10th and eighth and fourth grade.

329
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:54,419
Well, you can see this in this, in these charts.

330
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,599
That's where that's right.

331
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,160
I see it for some is if the high school as well.

332
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,740
Okay, great.

333
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,480
Okay.

334
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:01,708
Yep, thank you.

335
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:03,489
I just didn't see it when I was looking through it.

336
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:04,089
That's OK, no problem.

337
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,230
And I was late that evening.

338
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,211
Again, I apologize for that.

339
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:07,212
A lot of paper here.

340
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,875
Also, the district comparison, I know you'll need some time to get that to us.

341
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:15,879
Could you add that to the list of outstanding items on our agenda?

342
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,983
So that way, within the next few meetings, you'd be able to remember that until that's covered.

343
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:23,044
We can do that.

344
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:24,445
We're working on that now.

345
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:26,647
OK, so just add it to our agenda, then.

346
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:26,707
OK.

347
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:27,608
That's the report's item 11.

348
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:27,988
Yes, 11.

349
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:28,528
OK, not a problem.

350
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:29,829
Thank you very much.

351
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,071
Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

352
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,792
Is there a motion on the floor to accept the report?

353
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:36,153
Motion to accept.

354
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:37,614
Motion to accept.

355
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:38,635
Offered by Mr. Benedetto.

356
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:39,315
Seconded by Ms.

357
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:39,816
Van de Kloet.

358
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:40,636
All those in favor?

359
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:42,217
All those opposed?

360
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:45,459
Motion passes with the report being added to our list.

361
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,180
Neighbor, can I say one more thing?

362
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,540
Certainly.

363
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:53,985
So my understanding, Mr. Superintendent, is that we are now a level two school district?

364
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:54,285
We are.

365
00:26:54,805 --> 00:27:05,429
So I was the one that yelled quite a few times that when we were level three, so I would like to congratulate everybody who worked so hard last year to move us back to the level two district.

366
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:12,191
That's a great accomplishment for everybody that works in this community and for our students as well as.

367
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:17,475
Parents and the children that also have really tried hard on these exams.

368
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:20,018
So we are a level two district.

369
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:25,202
I'd like everybody to know we are now a level, and I'm very proud to say that, and very happy to say that.

370
00:27:25,282 --> 00:27:29,907
And I would probably say it all year, just like I said, I was worried when we were level three.

371
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:32,189
I'm glad to see us moving in the right direction.

372
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,970
Great work, thank you very much.

373
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:36,724
Ms.

374
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:37,145
Cuno.

375
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:55,600
Just a point of information, as far as subcommittee meetings, I'd like to have people that are watching and people that are in the audience to understand also, is that when we have subcommittee meetings, the people that are on those subcommittees are the people that are responsible for those meetings to ask questions that evening and to request anything.

376
00:27:56,781 --> 00:28:07,269
If we as school committee members do go to a subcommittee meeting, we go as residents of the city, we do not hold the hat of a school committee member.

377
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:14,655
So therefore, sometimes it's kind of hard to go without really overlapping that.

378
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:18,578
So that's really something that I want people to understand.

379
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:23,502
So it's not, if we're going to have subcommittee meetings, that is the purpose of the subcommittee meeting.

380
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:29,877
for the people on those committees to bring that information to us and people understand that.

381
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:31,437
Very good.

382
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:34,698
Community participation.

383
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,198
Melanie McLaughlin, president of the CPAC.

384
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:37,558
Ms.

385
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:38,079
McLaughlin.

386
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:42,060
Good evening.

387
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,140
Good evening.

388
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,466
Hello, Madam Mayor.

389
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:48,689
Hello, Superintendent Belson, school committee members.

390
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:50,130
Thank you for having me here tonight.

391
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:58,277
I am coming on behalf of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council, but also on behalf of high-need students in Medford.

392
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:03,902
For those of you who may be watching who don't know who I am, my name is Melanie Parkinson-McLaughlin.

393
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:09,748
I am the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council, but also sort of on a personal note, I want to share that

394
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:14,166
I also happen to grow up in an economically disadvantaged home.

395
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:15,826
I went to Lawrence Public Schools.

396
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:20,788
I have some background in that area as well, as well as having a daughter with a disability.

397
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:32,874
So when we talk about high-need students, as most of you here know, but perhaps others don't, high-need students would be economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English language students.

398
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:38,556
So at the end of last year for the school committee, I brought a report to the members here

399
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,167
in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.

400
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:45,092
And I just wanted to take a moment for the recommendations on that PowerPoint.

401
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:55,387
At the end of the PowerPoint, we had some recommendations that we made to the school committee, and there was a suggestion after the recommendation that perhaps there would be a subcommittee

402
00:29:55,647 --> 00:30:00,249
committee of the whole that could be created to talk more about some of the recommendations.

403
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:03,890
Unfortunately, four or five months have gone by that hasn't happened.

404
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,531
So we're here to revisit that.

405
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:17,455
Number one, that's sort of one of our priorities here, but also having had some time to review the presentation that we did and also having had some time to see and hear from families with additional concerns around high needs students.

406
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:22,957
We made some addendum to the recommendations specifically to the high need student population as well.

407
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:26,108
and also related to the district goals.

408
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:29,090
So I just want to take one moment to sort of look at that.

409
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:38,375
I also wanted to say, you know, regarding the last school committee meeting, I came into that meeting after a parent had got up and spoken.

410
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:39,775
I was out of context.

411
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:43,317
I did not know what the context of the parent's presentation was.

412
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:44,478
I found out subsequently.

413
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:52,822
But what I did see when I came in, and it was very confusing for an outsider, what I saw when I came in was a lot of discussion around students with disabilities.

414
00:30:53,282 --> 00:30:55,866
without any sort of context of what that discussion was.

415
00:30:55,926 --> 00:31:02,856
And it was alarming to me as the parent, certainly of a student with disability, but also as a co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

416
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:09,445
I was subsequently contacted by a number of families who also felt very alarmed by the rhetoric they felt was here.

417
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:13,553
that night regarding students with disabilities and some of the conversation that was had.

418
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:22,304
One thing that I want to remind folks here is that when we talk about all students, I certainly hope that we are talking about students with disabilities.

419
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,028
Students with disabilities, EL students,

420
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,615
economically disadvantaged students are all students, I would think.

421
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,337
So I just wanted to mention that.

422
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:36,461
Regarding the recommendations that we had, I won't bore you with some of the report that we did last year.

423
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:39,083
You all have copies of the report, that PowerPoint.

424
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:44,227
It was titled The State of Special Education in Medford.

425
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:48,150
It is available on the district website for folks who would like to see it.

426
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,192
I believe it's under the CPAC heading.

427
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:51,132
It has been modified.

428
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:54,295
I will send the superintendent's office and

429
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:57,908
Allison Goldsberry, the modification so that they can share that.

430
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:01,531
And I just talked to sort of I talked about the high need students.

431
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:07,135
I had a clip of the high need students and some information on that with a with a graphic of the high need students.

432
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:16,423
And then Superintendent Bellson, I actually was hoping for your advice here because I'm trying to understand some of these numbers and I want I'm hoping you might be able to help me out for the high need students.

433
00:32:16,503 --> 00:32:21,447
I know that it's defined as economically disadvantaged students with disabilities and English language learners.

434
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:29,827
So when I go to the DESE website and I look at the data on our website regarding our school district profile, and it says economically disadvantaged is 25.3%.

435
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:33,569
Students with disabilities, 18%.

436
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,172
And English language learners, 7.5%.

437
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:46,196
So I'm wondering if I'm adding that up correctly, would that mean that our total high needs population in the city of Medford is 50%?

438
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:47,416
No.

439
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:47,937
Okay.

440
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,438
What the state has done,

441
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:53,472
is they've created a high needs category.

442
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:57,394
And in that category, an individual might fit in more than one activity.

443
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:04,957
A youngster might be a person who doesn't speak English as a first language, might be special needs, and might also be economically disadvantaged.

444
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:10,319
So one person might be in three categories, multiple categories.

445
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:19,143
So you could find that different scores, different activities are skewed by the fact that an individual repeats themselves in multiple categories.

446
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:27,303
So we have to break those out periodically as we go, just to see exactly what's the dominant category that's driving a particular result.

447
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:36,768
So high needs is sort of an accumulation or cumulative amount of all the students who fall into any one of those categories, as opposed to one.

448
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:38,049
So 50% would be too high.

449
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:38,669
OK.

450
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,231
So what would you say would be a fair percentage?

451
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:41,971
Would you say bog?

452
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:47,635
Well, I want to look at the latest, because basically, the other thing that took place is Title I,

453
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:53,785
Uh, which normally defined, um, economically disadvantaged.

454
00:33:54,265 --> 00:34:01,387
The rule was changed and because it was changed, the numbers came way down and it affected communities across the state.

455
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:05,648
So I don't want to speculate at this point in time, but I, we certainly are going to break it out.

456
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:06,289
Okay.

457
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:06,689
That's great.

458
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:07,529
Thank you.

459
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:16,592
And also I would say that it's fair to say that there's a, you know, we see a lot on the States from reports from Desi and, uh, the state of special education in the state of Massachusetts anyway.

460
00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:25,704
that there's a lot of disproportionality, certainly around minorities and English language learners being identified as special education or more highly identified or not.

461
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:34,986
And also, according to Tom Hare's report that I shared with the school committee a week or two ago, a couple of weeks ago, and also regarding their achievement, the achievement gap.

462
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:35,686
Is that right?

463
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:40,507
Well, you know, disproportionality or what they call prima facie denial in some instances.

464
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:41,408
Yeah.

465
00:34:44,032 --> 00:35:00,015
tendency in school districts or across almost any institution if a youngster is not doing well to speculate as to whether that youngster has a learning disability, whether it's language-based, whether it's a temporary distraction that the youngster is going through, maybe some family dysfunction, some other things going on in their life.

466
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:06,596
So it's really hard to know whether the identification is really 100%.

467
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:13,737
But clearly, we have to pay a lot of attention to making sure that a youngster, let's say, who doesn't speak English as a first language

468
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:16,877
isn't automatically included as a special needs student.

469
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:17,337
That's right.

470
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:22,898
Or a youngster as a special needs student isn't automatically assumed to be of a particular category.

471
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:23,278
Right.

472
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,079
It may very well be that it's a standalone.

473
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:26,599
Right.

474
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,919
So it's going to be done very, very carefully.

475
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:34,500
And it's going to be done case by case, school by school, so that we really know who's where.

476
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,181
Right.

477
00:35:35,261 --> 00:35:36,701
And I would say, I would agree with that.

478
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:41,962
And I would say, but the data does show that oftentimes that these communities are certainly marginalized.

479
00:35:42,686 --> 00:35:49,648
the socioeconomically disadvantaged, the students with disabilities, and the English language learners.

480
00:35:49,808 --> 00:35:56,991
Our summary for our report last year talked about the substantial achievement gap between typical students and high need students in Medford.

481
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:09,115
For those who are watching or in the audience who don't know what achievement gap is, I would venture, I'm not an educator yet, but I would venture to say that the achievement gap is for success rates for students on MCAS

482
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:23,646
So typical students and the gap would be for minority students or economically disadvantaged students or English language learners might look somewhere around this if you're talking people who are proficient on MCAS and people who are not.

483
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:24,906
Is that accurate or?

484
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:32,168
Well, the gap is between the youngsters who don't necessarily fall into these subgroup categories and those youngsters who do.

485
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:36,809
But it's important to note, and this was brought out at our last meeting,

486
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:45,447
that Medford's achievement levels in these subgroups either met or exceeded the state average in each of these categories.

487
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:53,693
So what it really means is, is the state using an instrument that properly assesses the appropriate development of these youngsters?

488
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,895
Is it fair to give a youngster a test in English

489
00:36:58,006 --> 00:37:04,489
in their first year in this country not speaking English and then trying to determine whether this youngster knows enough.

490
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:22,836
I think that the assessment system really deserves a work over because it's inappropriate to ask youngsters to do things for which they are not particularly good at it at this point in their life because of their genesis, where they are at that point in time.

491
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:26,317
So a youngster who might be progressing at a nice level for

492
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:33,656
his or her situation might take an extra year or two to get to that level.

493
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:34,457
What's wrong with that?

494
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:39,480
The goal is to get to the achievement level as much as possible.

495
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,401
And if it takes a little longer, fine.

496
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:42,482
Some people learn faster.

497
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:43,482
Some people learn slower.

498
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:46,784
Some people are more skilled in a mathematical area.

499
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:48,325
Some people are more skilled in a language area.

500
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:55,670
And so we need to have a better assessment system than the vanilla that we're getting right now

501
00:37:56,255 --> 00:38:03,178
And that's going to be a topic of discussion among superintendents, school committee members, and others as we approach our meetings coming forward.

502
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:09,161
ESSA, and we'll have that discussion tonight as part of it, makes some changes in NCLB, but not enough.

503
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:10,462
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

504
00:38:10,482 --> 00:38:12,983
And I think Universal Design for Learning hopefully will help with that.

505
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:17,165
But I think there's a lot more that we agree on than we realize sometimes.

506
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:18,686
And I'm glad to hear that's the case.

507
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:24,809
I also wanted to say that I was very happy to see tonight the self-advocates, the students who were self-advocates here.

508
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,309
and being recognized for their achievements.

509
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,329
That was wonderful to see.

510
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,732
And it is very important for us to focus on positive things that are happening in our district as well.

511
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:37,634
For the students that were able to speak for themselves tonight, I couldn't have felt prouder.

512
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:53,342
But I also want us to remember for the students who cannot speak for themselves, we have a significant population in this community that is not able to speak on their behalf, whether they are students with disabilities, whether they are economically disadvantaged families or whether they're English language learners.

513
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:58,763
And because of my passion and because of my background, I am fortunate enough to be able to speak on their behalf.

514
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,784
And that's what I want to do.

515
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:01,005
And that's what I'll continue to do.

516
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:07,110
So I also just want to ask the full inclusion rates for I want to add sort of our summary on a report.

517
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,493
The full inclusion rates were a little bit less than state average, at least on last year's data.

518
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:15,817
Dropout rates were a little bit higher, and the substantially separate setting was a little bit higher than state average.

519
00:39:16,478 --> 00:39:18,860
Now getting to the district priority goals and SMART goals.

520
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,103
So I know that the district just published their priority goals and SMART goals.

521
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:22,563
Is that right?

522
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:34,016
And I was really excited to see that district priority goal to district priority goal seven and district priority goal six are all aligned with the recommendations that we have for the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

523
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:41,383
Specifically, district priority goal two was to expand efforts to meet the academic, emotional, social and physical needs of Medford's diverse student population.

524
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:51,011
And there were some recommendations from the I assume from the committee and on how that would be done, including hours of training on implementation of social emotional curriculum, curriculum,

525
00:39:51,647 --> 00:40:00,433
Three outreach events that allow for community staff and family partnerships, alternative educational supports for students using positive behavioral intervention supports and credit recovery.

526
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:06,057
And this is also published on the district website, the district goals and SMART goals for educators.

527
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:09,039
District priority goal six, which is differentiated instruction.

528
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,323
We are very happy to see, to promote differentiated instruction within a tiered model so that the needs of all students are met.

529
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:19,787
The suggestion was two professional development workshops, teacher training for

530
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:28,549
U or NI teachers, and then revised units of instruction using understanding by design, also in align with our goals, which was really great.

531
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:32,031
And district goals, priority seven, family engagement.

532
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:42,198
The family engagement piece, to continue to promote communication between home and school in order to strengthen the link between parents and educators, community members, and other stakeholders.

533
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,322
And the two items on there were educators would be trained in the school brains

534
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:49,966
initiative with a parent portal.

535
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:57,751
And this is a software program that allows parents and educators to be able to access data on their students that should be rolling out soon, I hear.

536
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:10,759
And then item number two is collaboration between school and community will increase by 10 percent district wide during the school year over the previous year, as evidenced by sign in sheets and other attendance taking methods.

537
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,643
And while we're while we're happy to see that family engagement as part of the district goal goals for this coming year,

538
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,381
10% feels really short, and we're concerned about that.

539
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:28,803
And we're also concerned about how the measure of that family engagement is really happening, and especially how it's really happening for families that aren't speaking English.

540
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:41,386
So again, we would love the CPAC to be brought to the table at some of these events to be able to offer our input and our advice, and also other community stakeholders, stakeholders from the EL community, stakeholders from the economically disadvantaged community.

541
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:58,742
I just want to mention that teachers in a 2014 TELMAS educator survey, the teachers were given a survey and they were asked the question, in which of the following areas, if any, do you need professional development to teach your students more effectively?

542
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,306
Sixty percent of teachers in the TELMAS educator survey

543
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:07,389
said closing the achievement gap.

544
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:08,990
56% said teaching students with disabilities.

545
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,792
52% said differentiating instruction.

546
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:14,674
51% said co-teaching and collaborative teaching.

547
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:17,955
And 45% said promoting cultural competency.

548
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,138
And again, promoting cultural competency we believe goes hand in hand with family engagement.

549
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:28,301
I'm not gonna read the rest of the report because I've given, I've left a copy of it here with you folks.

550
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:31,003
I did, we did add a couple of items in our,

551
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:36,482
CPAC recommendations for improved family and community engagement, we had about 10 recommendations.

552
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:53,246
We also added family ambassadors per subgroup in EL, SES, and SWD, which is what we said, and then also potentially outside consultation, whether it be from places like the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Lesley University, or Tufts University.

553
00:42:55,692 --> 00:43:04,055
Finally, our two big asks for tonight, and this is something that we're actually hoping we can get an answer on tonight so that we're not waiting another five months or six months to get an answer.

554
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:05,395
We have to ask tonight.

555
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:17,679
The specific ask for tonight is we are asking the school committee, Madam Mayor and the superintendent to create and endorse a high needs subcommittee of the school committee where we can answer some of the questions that are part of their support.

556
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:22,461
And hopefully we can bring stakeholders to the table that can provide more information and move the needle.

557
00:43:22,843 --> 00:43:24,304
in Medford forward for all of us.

558
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:40,033
And then the other is, the other ask that we have is, you know, we had a few parents here at the last school committee, at the last school committee meeting, and there was some discussion around cultural competency at one of our schools in particular, although I would venture to say that it's probably at a lot of our schools is an issue.

559
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:48,137
And I think you know that we were talking about piloting the Understanding Our Differences Disability Awareness Program at the Brooks Elementary School this year.

560
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:50,719
The Brooks teachers had decided for fifth grade teachers

561
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:54,766
pilot the autism unit for the fifth grade at our school.

562
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:59,529
The Understanding Our Differences program can be found on understandingourdifferences.org.

563
00:43:59,629 --> 00:44:03,833
It's a program that is run through Newton Public Schools and through a lot of schools in our community.

564
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:18,385
We would recommend that that Understanding Our Differences program be used in other community schools here in Medford so that we can have sensitivity around students with disabilities, students with high needs, including medical needs, diabetes, asthma, allergies, et cetera.

565
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:20,166
And I think that's it.

566
00:44:21,053 --> 00:44:21,413
Thank you.

567
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:22,234
Sure.

568
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:22,854
Any questions?

569
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:23,574
Ms.

570
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,135
Kratz, you're blinking.

571
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:28,237
No, no, I'm sorry.

572
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:28,557
Ms.

573
00:44:28,577 --> 00:44:29,617
Cooney.

574
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:31,538
Thank you, Melanie, for your report.

575
00:44:31,758 --> 00:44:33,039
Um, just a couple of things.

576
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:36,321
You just, you were speaking about a survey that was given.

577
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:40,543
Could you reiterate who gave out the survey and where it was given?

578
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:41,003
Yep.

579
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:41,743
That's the tell.

580
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:43,144
Do you want to share that superintendent?

581
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:44,184
Oh, okay.

582
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,305
It's the 2014 tell mass survey.

583
00:44:46,365 --> 00:44:49,267
So it's a department of education survey of educators.

584
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:53,096
OK, and they're random educators throughout the whole state of Massachusetts, correct?

585
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:53,917
That's correct.

586
00:44:54,517 --> 00:45:02,661
And the other thing you're also speaking about the piloting underwriting, understanding our difference, our differences program.

587
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:02,961
Yes.

588
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,022
That you're saying that you're piloting now at the Brooks.

589
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:08,103
Well, we had we are intending to pilot it this year at the Brooks.

590
00:45:08,143 --> 00:45:08,383
Yes.

591
00:45:08,443 --> 00:45:10,784
We had teachers trained at the end of last year.

592
00:45:11,565 --> 00:45:15,186
We had the understanding our differences trainer come out and work with our fifth grade teachers.

593
00:45:15,586 --> 00:45:17,307
And now it's implementing the program.

594
00:45:17,707 --> 00:45:18,768
And it's about a two hour

595
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:32,395
disability awareness program within our fifth grade classrooms, and it has a sort of loosely, I wouldn't call it curriculum, but a sort of directive on how to apply this to hours of learning with your students.

596
00:45:32,415 --> 00:45:36,596
And we actually had, I was part of the training at the end of last year, and it was actually very interesting.

597
00:45:36,616 --> 00:45:41,937
We did some things you could even try at home, or folks could try at home, try to do a family game without using any words.

598
00:45:42,557 --> 00:45:46,998
Try to, you know, do a, I don't know, a scrabble, but you can't speak to each other.

599
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,990
and see how you communicate, give yourself a chance to communicate.

600
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,132
So there were some exercises and activities that really helped sensitize people to differences.

601
00:45:55,152 --> 00:46:08,777
Okay, was this, I'm just trying to think back if this was something that was brought to us that we had any part of saying of what schools were gonna be piloted or what schools weren't gonna be piloted through the mayor to the superintendent?

602
00:46:09,657 --> 00:46:11,558
So let me make a suggestion.

603
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:13,118
There's a lot of material here.

604
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:17,160
It can't be discussed in the robust way it needs to be discussed.

605
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:19,995
forum like this because, you know, there's too much involved.

606
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:23,238
Schedule a committee, the whole meeting, let's get to it.

607
00:46:23,278 --> 00:46:28,442
We'll get in the background and then we can decide which items can be done in what sequence and where.

608
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:33,106
But if we do try to do it here, we'll be back and forth for a long period of time and it's not really going to do it.

609
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,988
So let's schedule a committee, the whole meeting.

610
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:38,390
Let's look at some dates and I'll get back to you with some possible dates and we can do that.

611
00:46:38,811 --> 00:46:42,654
But, but excuse me, but this, this seems like it's already happening.

612
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,116
Well, it's happening in one school, but remember,

613
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,615
We're asking our faculty and people to do an awful lot right now.

614
00:46:48,695 --> 00:46:50,236
They're taking school brains.

615
00:46:50,256 --> 00:46:51,857
They're doing a million different workshops.

616
00:46:52,757 --> 00:46:54,138
They've also got to teach their classes.

617
00:46:54,518 --> 00:47:01,942
I want to make sure that we sit down and we actually roll things out in a very, very digestible way, and we get everybody on board.

618
00:47:02,283 --> 00:47:04,984
Otherwise, we're just running a program, and it won't work.

619
00:47:05,044 --> 00:47:05,644
It won't stick.

620
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:07,345
So let's have a meeting.

621
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:08,366
Let's go over it.

622
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:11,288
Let's decide how we can roll things out intelligently.

623
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:12,929
And let's see which things can be

624
00:47:13,971 --> 00:47:16,493
let's say integrated with other initiatives that are already going on.

625
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,475
And I think we're in a better place if we do that.

626
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:19,156
Okay.

627
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:25,461
And I'm not saying no, I understand that the teachers have a lot, I guess what my question is, who chose the Brooks and when did that happen?

628
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:31,426
Principals have a certain amount of autonomy to do things that respond to what they see in their buildings.

629
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:36,070
But when someone does something and it works, we're naturally interested in it.

630
00:47:36,631 --> 00:47:39,133
But what works in one building may not work in another.

631
00:47:39,725 --> 00:47:41,225
and we just need to talk about it, that's all.

632
00:47:41,385 --> 00:47:52,288
Okay, because I mean, the way it was explained is that this was a two-hour program that was taught to our teachers that I think we should have at least have known about, so at least we know what was going on in the school.

633
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:54,688
Again, principals have a certain amount of autonomy.

634
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,169
We don't micromanage everything that happens every day in the buildings.

635
00:47:58,749 --> 00:48:06,090
We let people do some of the things that they think are appropriate, you know, and when it becomes something that the whole district is interested in, then maybe we bring it here.

636
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:08,371
We could be talking about every program,

637
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:11,282
Not every school had a mock election.

638
00:48:11,742 --> 00:48:13,923
Not every school had another thing going on.

639
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:15,684
Schools have their own identities.

640
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:17,204
We want them to have their own identities.

641
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:24,807
But let's take a look at this as a gestalt and a committee of the whole, and I think you might have a better way to decide which things should move forward.

642
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:27,189
Ms.

643
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,011
Vander Kloot.

644
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:31,933
I think committee of the whole is the way to go initially.

645
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:44,883
Melanie, just to respond to your big ask, I think we should start that way because I know one of the concerns is when we get into who's going to be on the subcommittee and we all want to be or we have a subcommittee and then we all show up anyway.

646
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:49,564
But then some people aren't really voting members versus whatever.

647
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:54,825
So I think by starting this with a committee of the whole makes a lot of sense.

648
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:59,886
And then perhaps we can move to decide whether a subcommittee makes a lot of sense.

649
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:04,188
I'm not anti-subcommittee by any means focused on this.

650
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:08,549
I just understand what some of the challenges are.

651
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:09,989
It's a lot of information.

652
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:12,850
And I think everybody's interested.

653
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,510
That's one of the things is we're all interested.

654
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:17,136
Well, I think that was evident from what we saw tonight.

655
00:49:17,196 --> 00:49:19,437
And it's the children that are our main interest.

656
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:20,958
And that can be seen for sure.

657
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:22,959
Mr. Benedetto.

658
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:23,560
Thank you.

659
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,640
Thank you for your report.

660
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,002
It's always very informative, very quick, a lot of information.

661
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,863
And I learn a lot.

662
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:35,086
I also agree that we need to have a subcommittee meeting.

663
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:40,128
So at this point, I'm making a motion to move this item to subcommittee.

664
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:40,989
Committee of the whole.

665
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:42,109
To committee of the whole.

666
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:42,930
Rather, sorry.

667
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:46,256
many of the whole within the next two weeks?

668
00:49:47,656 --> 00:49:48,536
Is that too soon?

669
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:49,236
Two months?

670
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:51,357
I think you've got a lot going on right now.

671
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:54,278
You've got another meeting, you're going to be touring capital.

672
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:55,838
Let's do it in a reasonable time frame.

673
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:57,018
I'll get back to you with dates.

674
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:59,799
Let's make sure that we can prepare for it properly.

675
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:01,659
We meet with CPAC, we meet with others.

676
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:09,101
Let's get an agenda that's sequenced, that's coherent, and then we can move forward in a positive kind of way.

677
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:12,642
To just simply get it in just to get it in is not, I don't think, productive.

678
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:19,168
So, um, can we put within the next two months, Mr. Superintendent, certainly, certainly sooner than that.

679
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,608
Okay.

680
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:22,009
So my motion is on the floor.

681
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:28,930
It needs a second on the motion that a committee of the whole be held in the next two months, which we promise you it will not be two months.

682
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:29,770
All those in favor.

683
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:31,311
All those opposed.

684
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:32,691
Motion passes.

685
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:33,491
Thank you.

686
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:41,733
And I just wanted to add, if there are any folks watching that are from the EL population or the economically disadvantaged population, we would welcome you to the committee of the whole meeting as well.

687
00:50:41,753 --> 00:50:42,113
Of course.

688
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:42,493
Thank you.

689
00:50:43,038 --> 00:50:43,458
Thank you.

690
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:51,922
Report of the superintendent report on Roberts elementary school grants.

691
00:50:52,022 --> 00:50:52,963
Mr. Superintendent.

692
00:50:54,023 --> 00:51:00,046
Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we're going to call on our assistant superintendent superintendent Diane Caldwell to talk about this report.

693
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:02,547
Good evening again.

694
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:05,909
Um, I'm just going to correct the title of this report.

695
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:12,472
Although the Roberts school is involved, this is a report on all elementary school, um, grants.

696
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:19,449
So we are pleased to inform you that several grants have been awarded to our elementary schools.

697
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:22,031
So I'd like to talk to you about a few of them.

698
00:51:22,852 --> 00:51:31,462
Joanne McKay is a third grade teacher at the Roberts Elementary School, and she applied for a grant through the Medford Educational Foundation during the spring

699
00:51:32,212 --> 00:51:32,993
of 2016.

700
00:51:33,754 --> 00:51:40,421
She was awarded $600 to host a math night for families of the Roberts Elementary School.

701
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:45,986
Some activities will be for children in grades kindergarten through grade five.

702
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:49,910
There'll be math board games and larger math man-made games.

703
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:58,155
And some examples of this could include beanbag hopscotch, dance grids, and multiplication basketball.

704
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:05,879
So I can't wait to actually go to the Roberts Elementary School on November 17th to participate in these games.

705
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:08,260
Michaela Kelly, J.P.

706
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:17,485
Cormier, and Christina Federico, who are teachers at the Roberts Elementary School, are brainstorming to come up with an evening of fun for our students and our families.

707
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:35,567
In addition to that, Katie Rockwell, who is an EL teacher at the Columbus Elementary School, was also awarded a Medford Educational Foundation grant for Enhanced ELL Solutions, a program produced by the makers of Reading A to Z.

708
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:54,706
This program is a computer-based program that will support our EL students, including support for content vocabulary in math, science, and in social studies, and additional printable readers for students that they can take home and do some reading practice at home.

709
00:52:55,666 --> 00:53:03,887
The program will complement the resources we already have in our journeys program, which was a question that some of our school committee had.

710
00:53:03,928 --> 00:53:06,088
We just wanted to make sure it was aligned with our journeys.

711
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:16,886
The additional data that we can collect by using these assessments should help make EL instruction even more targeted to students' greatest areas of need.

712
00:53:17,466 --> 00:53:28,789
In short, the program that we purchase with this grant will allow us to offer even more reading resources targeted for our ELL students, which is something that we desperately need.

713
00:53:29,935 --> 00:53:35,957
And I'd also like to mention that Cynthia Griffin is a grade three teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School.

714
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:43,858
And she wrote and received a grant for $200 towards a school field trip to Plymouth Plantation.

715
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:52,761
This grant is offered once per year for any K-12 school that applies in early September and is provided through the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

716
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:58,062
The trip must be a nonprofit cultural activity or institution

717
00:53:58,683 --> 00:54:00,544
in Massachusetts, within Massachusetts.

718
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:10,491
And I also know that Michael Coates, who is our third grade teacher at the Brooks Elementary School, will be applying for another Medford Educational Foundation grant.

719
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:13,112
You know that he's written his book already.

720
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:22,038
And now he's going to pilot building boats and then putting them on the Mystic River and watching

721
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:28,675
the boats float away, and the children will build the boats in his grade three classroom and then go off to the Mystic River.

722
00:54:30,136 --> 00:54:33,778
He will be writing a grant with Medford Education Foundation, obviously.

723
00:54:34,259 --> 00:54:38,682
We owe a debt of gratitude to the MEF for always being so supportive.

724
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,611
of Medford Public Schools.

725
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:41,952
And I'm happy to take any questions.

726
00:54:41,972 --> 00:54:42,312
Thank you Ms.

727
00:54:42,332 --> 00:54:42,592
Calvo.

728
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,133
And if I could from the chair just thank the co-chair Ms.

729
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:52,258
Van de Kloot for all of her hard work on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation and bringing it back to life in a productive way.

730
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:52,478
Ms.

731
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,098
Van de Kloot.

732
00:54:53,238 --> 00:54:53,618
Thank you.

733
00:54:54,059 --> 00:55:01,123
I just wanted to mention that in fact that this is only a small part of the grants that we gave out in these funding cycles.

734
00:55:02,043 --> 00:55:07,026
And President Anne Frenning-Kassooth and David Sayers who's been the

735
00:55:07,326 --> 00:55:20,946
Head of the Grants Committee will be coming forward in a couple of weeks time to tell you about some of the other grants that we funded either in the spring cycle or we are collecting grants right now and the applications are open.

736
00:55:21,106 --> 00:55:23,029
We decided to extend it to the end of October.

737
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:24,470
for the next round.

738
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,231
So it's very exciting.

739
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:26,691
It's great.

740
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:30,753
It's really kind of fun to do something positive like this.

741
00:55:31,553 --> 00:55:37,417
And we really, really appreciate all the teachers who write the grants.

742
00:55:37,657 --> 00:55:47,182
And also, it's been very, very helpful to be working so closely with the school district so that when there is a question about is this consistent with our goals,

743
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:48,323
educational goals.

744
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:54,588
We have great people and great support, including helping everything work, so I really appreciate that.

745
00:55:55,368 --> 00:55:55,889
Great job.

746
00:55:56,469 --> 00:55:57,150
Congratulations.

747
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,570
Thank you.

748
00:55:58,911 --> 00:56:00,953
Motion to receive and place on file this report.

749
00:56:01,293 --> 00:56:01,994
All those in favor?

750
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:03,693
All those opposed?

751
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:04,433
Motion passes.

752
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:08,154
Report on TB response and follow-up action steps.

753
00:56:08,354 --> 00:56:17,236
And before the superintendent gives his report, I just really want to thank him and his staff for the outstanding job that was done during this issue.

754
00:56:17,777 --> 00:56:22,798
Also, the City of Medford Health Department, which played a major role, as well as the Department of Public Health.

755
00:56:22,818 --> 00:56:27,559
A lot of people came to the table in order to provide information to the families so that

756
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:30,780
people would not be fearful and scared.

757
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,000
So thank you all for the amazing work that you did, in particular Ms.

758
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,440
Vento.

759
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:34,860
Thank you.

760
00:56:35,301 --> 00:56:36,241
Mr. Superintendent.

761
00:56:36,301 --> 00:56:41,202
Members of the committee, Tony Vento is with us this evening, and we'll just go through some of it.

762
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:44,702
If you have any specific questions, Tony is here to answer them.

763
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:49,563
I provide you with documents that have been produced and gone out to parents.

764
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:55,505
From the outset, we've worked closely with MassDBH, with the Medford Board of Health.

765
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:56,565
We appreciate all their help.

766
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:57,385
They've done a great job.

767
00:56:58,558 --> 00:57:06,459
right on the spot, helping us right away, making sure we did things the way we needed to, as well as our own medical team under Tony's direction here at the schools.

768
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:20,162
On Wednesday, October 26th, there will be a TB testing of individuals who have been identified as being in close contact with the individual who was diagnosed with TB.

769
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:27,763
There were 194 MHS students who were identified, five middle school students, and 14 adult personnel.

770
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:38,688
On the 20th, in the Cowan Theater, we will have a public information night available to everyone from 7 o'clock on to answer any questions that anyone might have.

771
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:47,899
Individuals may choose to have the test conducted by their own physician, and then we would ask them to provide us with the information that would indicate that it was done.

772
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:56,208
If there is a finding, then there would be some follow-up antibiotic activity.

773
00:57:56,688 --> 00:58:05,095
If there is no finding, it would be a second round of testing during the winter period to see if something emerged subsequent to.

774
00:58:07,077 --> 00:58:15,783
Since the original case was diagnosed, there have been no further identifications, and the DPH procedure has been followed precisely to ensure due diligence.

775
00:58:15,803 --> 00:58:17,765
You have letters here.

776
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:28,929
But I'm happy to take any questions or have the questions referred to Tony so that if you have any gaps in your understanding of what's taken place, we can answer them this evening.

777
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:32,490
And then again, on the 20th, we encourage anyone who really has some questions.

778
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,011
I have not received a lot of phone calls.

779
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:36,671
I did originally receive the handful.

780
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:42,613
I know Tony received a handful, but once they were done, it pretty much was pretty quiet.

781
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:46,194
And most people were satisfied with the information they received.

782
00:58:46,851 --> 00:58:49,432
But Tony is here, and you might want to direct questions to him.

783
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:49,792
Maybe, Ms.

784
00:58:49,832 --> 00:58:56,295
Vento, if you could just speak to the symptoms, just so the people watching at home understand what to look for.

785
00:58:56,375 --> 00:59:02,417
The symptoms of active, well, there's a difference between latent infection and active tuberculosis.

786
00:59:02,477 --> 00:59:08,840
So you really demonstrate symptoms when you cross into an active tuberculosis state.

787
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:16,483
That would include severe fatigue, weight loss, a cough that persists longer than three weeks,

788
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:22,904
Oftentimes the cough becomes a bloody cough, night sweats, fever, chills.

789
00:59:23,945 --> 00:59:29,646
So those would be mostly what you would see with an active TB infection.

790
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:30,806
Thank you.

791
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:32,726
Ms.

792
00:59:32,746 --> 00:59:33,086
Cuno.

793
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:34,147
Thank you.

794
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:35,447
Just a couple of questions.

795
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:44,609
One is I know that the superintendent said that parents, if they choose to do this on their own as far as the testing, how about if they have to pay out of pocket?

796
00:59:45,691 --> 00:59:46,611
No, there's no payment.

797
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:51,414
If they go to health insurance, which they should have, that would cover it.

798
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,395
That's one of those things that's covered by health insurance.

799
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,956
And if they come through us, there's no charge whatsoever.

800
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:58,657
The Department of Public Health has assured us.

801
00:59:58,737 --> 01:00:03,540
I mean, they're collecting the health insurance on all the students and the faculty that they're testing.

802
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,702
But if there are out-of-pocket costs, they will cover the out-of-pocket costs.

803
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:13,869
So it'll first be run through insurance and then supplemented, if needed, by Department of Public Health.

804
01:00:13,969 --> 01:00:14,069
OK.

805
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:23,572
And the other thing is that the calls and emails that I got were actually who determined who's identified.

806
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:27,433
And parents are like, well, my child is in that school.

807
01:00:27,953 --> 01:00:28,893
How do I know that?

808
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,974
How do they know that that child wasn't near the other child?

809
01:00:32,558 --> 01:00:38,000
And it's a very fine line, but we also have to understand that there are a lot of students that walk our halls.

810
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,061
And different stories go out there for different parents.

811
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:48,544
So at least if we could at least advise parents how at least we came to identifying the student.

812
01:00:48,564 --> 01:00:52,726
The Department of Public Health determined that according to a criteria list.

813
01:00:52,866 --> 01:01:01,829
And close contacts are identified by the length of contact you have with the infected person.

814
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:06,405
So if you think of circles, the first circle would be your immediate family.

815
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:14,390
The second circle would be your extended family because they would have the most consistent regular contact with that person.

816
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,471
Then it starts extending out.

817
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:20,914
The next would be school classmates who sit in class with the student.

818
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:28,519
Students who are in or people in extracurricular activities with a student or a faculty member.

819
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,100
And then it just goes out from there.

820
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:40,622
So for people who are passing in the hallway, let's say, your risk becomes very low because the contact is brief.

821
01:01:40,722 --> 01:01:41,622
It's not direct.

822
01:01:42,062 --> 01:01:44,083
You have a lot of air around you to disperse.

823
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:49,944
The people who are at most risk are those with extended close contact.

824
01:01:50,724 --> 01:01:53,004
So that's how the list was determined.

825
01:01:53,564 --> 01:01:58,205
I mean, there are students in the building that are in other parts of the building that never crossed paths.

826
01:01:58,522 --> 01:02:01,344
I mean, they would be considered nil risk.

827
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:01,805
Right.

828
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:06,869
Well, I appreciate that because like I said, I think it was just parents just, you know, hearing different things.

829
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:13,955
And I know that everyone's done their due diligence and doing such a really remarkable job in such a very short period of time.

830
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:14,936
But again,

831
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,125
different stories go out there.

832
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:20,508
And so parents were saying, well, wait a minute, how do I know who's identified?

833
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:28,335
And without overstepping the confidentiality situation, it was just more like, okay, tell me the stages of how it was.

834
01:02:28,715 --> 01:02:32,318
So for parents that are listening, I hope they heard this.

835
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:39,704
And I'm hoping that we are gonna have that meeting, that parents, if they still have questions or concerns, come to it.

836
01:02:40,948 --> 01:02:48,430
And I would suggest that Thursday evening be filmed so that it can go on our school channel as well for those that are unable to come out to the meeting.

837
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:49,390
Ms.

838
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:49,750
Kretz.

839
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:54,991
I just, I had some of the same questions that Emory had and Tony, you answered them.

840
01:02:55,031 --> 01:02:55,792
Thank you very much.

841
01:02:56,252 --> 01:03:01,653
And I also wanted to thank superintendent Belson for, you know, personally calling some parents back on,

842
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:05,672
It was, you know, really a great, um, a lot of help from everybody.

843
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:11,896
And you know, you know, a lot of the answers were, you know, handled very well and, and I appreciate it.

844
01:03:12,036 --> 01:03:12,536
I really do.

845
01:03:12,896 --> 01:03:13,677
Thank you very much.

846
01:03:13,697 --> 01:03:14,057
Thank you.

847
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:16,839
Very good.

848
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:19,860
There's a motion to receive in place on file this report.

849
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:20,981
So moved.

850
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:22,082
All those in favor.

851
01:03:22,782 --> 01:03:23,563
All those opposed.

852
01:03:23,823 --> 01:03:24,663
The motion passes.

853
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:26,044
Thank you very much.

854
01:03:26,084 --> 01:03:26,865
Great job on this.

855
01:03:26,925 --> 01:03:27,345
Thank you.

856
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,112
Report on DESE planning for ESSA accountability system.

857
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:42,697
So as you know, No Child Left Behind has been replaced by Every Student Succeeds Act.

858
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,323
And that legislation begins in 2016-2017 as a transition year with full implementation in 2017-2018.

859
01:03:57,294 --> 01:03:59,215
Now there are several key elements of the act.

860
01:03:59,955 --> 01:04:11,259
I want to give you enough of it so you understand it, but not so much that you get overwhelmed by it because there's an awful lot of pieces and we'll have to break it down a piece at a time in order for it to really be understood.

861
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:18,641
ESSA comprises nine title grants which provide funding to districts and states.

862
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:20,882
Currently there are about five or six.

863
01:04:21,762 --> 01:04:24,623
I'm not sure how we count them these days because they keep putting them together.

864
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:35,012
Title IV grant represents a new funding source, which is an allocation grant for districts in the area of student support services, something that would speak to some of the discussion we had a little bit earlier.

865
01:04:36,033 --> 01:04:49,480
Districts and states are required to conform to the requirements of ESSA, so that No Child Left Behind is now giving way to ESSA, and districts and states now must adopt ESSA rules.

866
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:58,835
ESSA encourages state agencies to think differently about how best to support low-performing schools as the school improvement grants are no longer available.

867
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:06,919
So they're asking the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to talk to us about how we could best benefit from their help.

868
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,542
That should be a very robust discussion, especially in our conference and so on and so forth going forward.

869
01:05:14,523 --> 01:05:19,185
ESSA minimizes Title I prescriptive school and district accountability requirements.

870
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:28,907
No Child Left Behind had very, very specific things under Title I. The SSA wiped some of it away, but it adds some things that are interesting, too.

871
01:05:30,568 --> 01:05:33,009
Equitable access is perhaps one of the biggest areas.

872
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,370
What is equitable access?

873
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,631
Does it mean every school gets the same thing?

874
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:40,533
Does it mean it's based on proportion of low income?

875
01:05:40,593 --> 01:05:42,374
Is it based on proportion of high needs?

876
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:43,234
What is it?

877
01:05:44,055 --> 01:05:45,856
Equitable doesn't automatically mean things.

878
01:05:45,896 --> 01:05:47,337
What if you have a teacher in a school who

879
01:05:48,808 --> 01:05:51,270
$80,000 a year and a teacher makes $60,000 a year.

880
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:56,413
Is it different or is it the same thing as long as there's a teacher there who's experienced and can do the job?

881
01:05:56,973 --> 01:05:58,594
Those things are yet to be fleshed out.

882
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:02,977
And it's problematic because, naturally, we hire teachers at different stages of their career.

883
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:08,221
And a lot of it's based on how many years they've been with us and what their degrees are.

884
01:06:08,761 --> 01:06:12,623
That doesn't necessarily mean they're better or worse at what they will do.

885
01:06:12,643 --> 01:06:18,387
There's a shift in focus on the Title II program from highly qualified to reporting on student

886
01:06:18,794 --> 01:06:19,735
learning experience.

887
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:25,799
So instead of determining just the teachers are highly qualified, the question will be, what have the students learned?

888
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,922
And they have to give us some rubrics to determine that going forward.

889
01:06:31,344 --> 01:06:37,548
It focuses mostly on quality access to education, access to quality education.

890
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:47,676
DESE is going to continue to collect certain data, but it doesn't mean it's going to have a particular impact on what we do or don't do.

891
01:06:48,986 --> 01:06:55,069
Inexperienced teachers will be expected to do different things, but we haven't got guidelines yet.

892
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:03,973
Total funding for this year has been about the same, a little bit different, with a larger shift in Title IV student support money.

893
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:08,555
The federal government has readjusted funding levels and our state will receive less money.

894
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:12,257
State receives less money, our district receives less money.

895
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:14,778
In most cases, not always.

896
01:07:15,572 --> 01:07:22,816
DESE does not have the FY18 budget, and they're likely not to know for quite a while as to how much money will or won't be there.

897
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:37,024
And of course, you know, with an election year, Congress, who knows what Congress will appropriate and what they won't appropriate until the election actually takes place and we determine who chairs which committees and who's in the White House.

898
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:42,627
It maintains a lot of the requirements under the 1965 Act.

899
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:48,758
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the original one.

900
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:53,319
There's some innovative assessment encouragement that will be there.

901
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:58,299
The definition of supplement versus supplant has changed.

902
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,000
That's another little thing we've got to get a good handle on.

903
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:09,841
What does it mean to add to something versus to shift the burden from the locality to the feds?

904
01:08:10,622 --> 01:08:13,222
That's something that comes up all the time.

905
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:19,365
We're hopeful that, you know, we'll get clarity on this sooner rather than later so we can plan.

906
01:08:20,185 --> 01:08:25,448
Problem with some of these things is we don't find out until well after we've gone through budget and says, well, guess what?

907
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:26,149
This is the new rule.

908
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:30,591
Hopefully we'll find out more as this early part of the year progresses.

909
01:08:31,391 --> 01:08:34,173
There's some new accountability requirements on the ESSA.

910
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:38,475
I've talked about that when we had the discussion on the test scores.

911
01:08:39,456 --> 01:08:41,497
Some of the key points in the new system might include

912
01:08:42,842 --> 01:09:11,623
maintaining the annual testing requirement, retaining 95% assessment participation requirement, making sure people participate, differentiation between schools, depending on what they're supposed to be doing, long-term goals from the state to measure interim progress of all students in subgroups, new accountability indicators, and

913
01:09:12,553 --> 01:09:14,234
They're dumping the CPI.

914
01:09:14,274 --> 01:09:15,235
You know what the CPI is?

915
01:09:15,435 --> 01:09:16,936
The Cumulative Performance Index?

916
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:19,498
That has been the staple of NCLB.

917
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,841
And then it got changed to the Growth Interest, SGP.

918
01:09:23,321 --> 01:09:26,123
Then it got changed to a couple of other things that were going on.

919
01:09:26,743 --> 01:09:35,390
So the more they keep changing the rules, the tougher it is for us to follow as to what's going to be the way they're going to make determinations.

920
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,731
I provided a PowerPoint for you.

921
01:09:38,172 --> 01:09:39,753
We should go over it at some point.

922
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:41,839
But we'll be studying it.

923
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:45,743
I'll be looking for more information in the upcoming weeks at the conference.

924
01:09:45,763 --> 01:09:52,569
We'll be sharing with our colleagues as to what they think and what's going on so that we can come back and give you real specifics.

925
01:09:53,150 --> 01:10:00,157
And we'll be talking to our people who are involved in the federal education agencies to find out where they see the trends are going.

926
01:10:00,737 --> 01:10:02,479
But this is the first rush of information.

927
01:10:03,086 --> 01:10:03,667
It is different.

928
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,089
It isn't totally different, but it's different.

929
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:16,199
And we need to pay attention to it so we can take maximum advantage of it, optimum advantage of it, while at the same time not losing out on any possibilities that would be helpful to us.

930
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,001
Happy to take any questions you have.

931
01:10:19,817 --> 01:10:19,937
Ms.

932
01:10:19,957 --> 01:10:20,477
Van de Kloot.

933
01:10:21,938 --> 01:10:32,281
Mr. Superintendent, I'm wondering if there's any way that we can advocate for that a five-year graduation rate also be included.

934
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:39,343
We've talked on multiple occasions that everything has been based on a four-year graduation rate.

935
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:47,785
but we have had, as well as many other school systems, additional students who might take a little bit more time, but they do reach the goal.

936
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:53,626
So I'm wondering if, it mentions the high school graduation rates will still be, you know, part of this.

937
01:10:53,966 --> 01:11:05,389
I'm wondering if there's any way that both the four-year and the five-year graduation rate could be included in when we provide data so that we can look at

938
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:07,710
success in different ways.

939
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,333
So we have that, and our graduation rate, by the way, went up this year.

940
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:14,397
The data you had in front of you from the last presentation was previous year.

941
01:11:15,698 --> 01:11:19,741
Part of that, you know, is a function of how people view what is success.

942
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:25,847
So if a youngster is missing one course in June and makes it up over the summer, they're not part of the four-year graduation rate.

943
01:11:26,132 --> 01:11:27,352
Well, that's exactly what I'm saying.

944
01:11:27,372 --> 01:11:28,313
That's the whole point of it.

945
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:30,974
So we can provide that information to you.

946
01:11:30,994 --> 01:11:36,896
The trick will be getting the state and the feds to recognize that as legitimate, especially for youngsters who are challenged.

947
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:43,758
Mr. Superintendent, my question is how do we move along the discussion of including the five-year graduation?

948
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:46,299
at the state and federal level.

949
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:55,064
What we do is we get colleagues on school committees, colleagues in my office, principals around the state, to make that point on a regular basis.

950
01:11:55,084 --> 01:12:02,289
And that's something that should come up in November when we're down with colleagues, because that's the kind of thing that really needs to be understood.

951
01:12:02,309 --> 01:12:03,790
There shouldn't be a rush to succeed.

952
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:12,955
There should be a steady, intelligent path to succeed, especially for youngsters who don't speak English as a first language, especially for youngsters who are working with cognitive

953
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,954
and procedural difficulties.

954
01:12:15,674 --> 01:12:16,375
I mean, it's unfair.

955
01:12:17,056 --> 01:12:18,057
It's just truly unfair.

956
01:12:18,137 --> 01:12:20,279
And it makes them look like they're not doing what they need to do.

957
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,081
Our school systems aren't doing it.

958
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:26,305
In fact, it would be a shame not to give a youngster more time if they needed it.

959
01:12:27,105 --> 01:12:29,388
This is the kind of stuff that needs to get out there.

960
01:12:29,988 --> 01:12:30,889
And I agree with you.

961
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:33,712
This is something that should be front and center in our discussions.

962
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:43,519
I think the old thinking was always, well, you know, you put off these kids a little bit longer and keep managing the data to avoid youngsters being reported out.

963
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:46,140
It's not a question of managing data.

964
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,481
It's a question of providing effective education.

965
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:54,143
It's a question of recognizing the differences between different types of learners and supporting them.

966
01:12:54,163 --> 01:12:58,445
You know, the average college completion rate, I said that the other night, is six years.

967
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:00,025
Six years.

968
01:13:01,146 --> 01:13:04,127
Most kids take time to complete college, and it's not

969
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:09,593
unlikely that a percentage of youngsters should take more time in high school to complete.

970
01:13:10,294 --> 01:13:18,099
Not because they can't do it, but because they need to pace themselves differently so they can learn and take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of them.

971
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:19,700
So I agree with you very much.

972
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:30,407
Yeah, I think that's something that our school committee could take as a responsibility of talking about this and bringing it forward when we attend meetings outside of Medford, and also within Medford too.

973
01:13:31,968 --> 01:13:33,869
I think it's something that the whole state would benefit from.

974
01:13:35,547 --> 01:13:37,488
Can we make a motion for our next meeting?

975
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:40,569
Could you write up a motion that we can vote on?

976
01:13:40,589 --> 01:13:40,889
Sure.

977
01:13:40,989 --> 01:13:42,030
And then you can deliver it down?

978
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,571
Yep.

979
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:44,331
On behalf of Ms.

980
01:13:44,351 --> 01:13:46,852
Van de Kloet, thank you.

981
01:13:48,313 --> 01:13:50,834
Is there a motion to receive and place on file this report?

982
01:13:51,074 --> 01:13:51,714
Motion by Ms.

983
01:13:51,754 --> 01:13:52,935
Cuno, seconded by Ms.

984
01:13:53,335 --> 01:13:53,835
Van de Kloet.

985
01:13:53,855 --> 01:13:54,555
All those in favor?

986
01:13:54,575 --> 01:13:54,635
Aye.

987
01:13:55,116 --> 01:13:55,716
All those opposed?

988
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:56,456
Motion passes.

989
01:13:57,397 --> 01:14:00,718
Report on snow day, school cancellation protocols.

990
01:14:03,197 --> 01:14:11,859
So the reason this is on your agenda is every year I get asked around this time, how do we decide when school closes and what can we do about it?

991
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:15,339
Now, the main message is this.

992
01:14:16,499 --> 01:14:23,841
You should start planning now as a parent about a situation that might occur and who will help to cover your youngsters.

993
01:14:24,261 --> 01:14:29,762
If you have to go to work, who's going to stay at home, what neighbors can work with you.

994
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,161
What situations can occur?

995
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:38,064
Can you talk to your employers who may be coming in a little bit later on certain days to get things under control?

996
01:14:38,544 --> 01:14:40,385
You can't wait until the day it happens.

997
01:14:40,645 --> 01:14:41,926
You've got to start thinking about it.

998
01:14:42,466 --> 01:14:44,888
And oftentimes, we don't get

999
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:49,541
a final call until later, because we don't know if the storm is going to hit.

1000
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:53,765
You know, meteorologists do their job, but they can't be sure.

1001
01:14:54,565 --> 01:14:59,029
Sometimes the storm veers off at the last second, and sometimes it veers in at the last second.

1002
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,711
And we need to be careful.

1003
01:15:00,771 --> 01:15:09,058
And sometimes the storm doesn't seem like it's coming to us at the beginning of school, but it's going to hit at 10 o'clock in the morning, and getting young people home is its own problem.

1004
01:15:09,861 --> 01:15:14,905
The other thing that we have to deal with is the fact that some youngsters have no one at home on a regular basis.

1005
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:18,547
And getting them to school means they might get to eat a hot meal.

1006
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:20,268
They have some supervision.

1007
01:15:21,529 --> 01:15:24,892
There's some other things going on that we want to provide.

1008
01:15:25,572 --> 01:15:31,316
On the other hand, if you really feel uptight and you really feel like maybe your child shouldn't be out, it's your option to keep them home.

1009
01:15:32,597 --> 01:15:36,500
Missing a day is not going to change the world as long as you're diligent about following up on the work.

1010
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:39,020
We've got to understand these things.

1011
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,541
Now, it takes a lot to figure this out.

1012
01:15:40,561 --> 01:15:41,721
We talk to the DPW.

1013
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:44,322
We talk to the police department.

1014
01:15:44,362 --> 01:15:45,623
We talk to the fire department.

1015
01:15:45,683 --> 01:15:47,763
We talk to our own custodial crews.

1016
01:15:48,123 --> 01:15:50,544
We talk to the contractors who plow our schools.

1017
01:15:50,944 --> 01:15:51,925
We talk to neighbors.

1018
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:53,285
What are they doing?

1019
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:54,185
How are they doing it?

1020
01:15:55,066 --> 01:15:56,766
And some places are more challenging than others.

1021
01:15:57,226 --> 01:16:03,068
If you live in the narrow streets of Everett and Malden, it's a lot tougher to plow those streets than it is maybe in Medford.

1022
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:05,709
It's a lot tougher to do certain things

1023
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:13,162
and they have to make decisions a little bit earlier because they can't get their crews out as fast as our crews get out.

1024
01:16:15,162 --> 01:16:17,883
We want to provide intelligent days.

1025
01:16:18,163 --> 01:16:20,843
We also have to think about the days if teachers can't get there.

1026
01:16:21,344 --> 01:16:28,505
So school is open and the faculty can't make it in because they no longer all live in Medford or one community over.

1027
01:16:29,065 --> 01:16:30,786
People live in wider areas.

1028
01:16:31,406 --> 01:16:36,087
So to have a day where the faculty is missing doesn't give us a quality education day.

1029
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:42,764
We started earlier this year, so that should help in terms of days, but you never know.

1030
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:45,344
We've had years where there's been no school days.

1031
01:16:45,744 --> 01:16:48,545
We've had years when a couple years ago there was seven or eight school days.

1032
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:50,126
And last year there were three.

1033
01:16:50,786 --> 01:16:51,746
So it's hard to know.

1034
01:16:51,846 --> 01:16:54,767
And one year we shut down schools when the buildings were too cold.

1035
01:16:55,967 --> 01:16:58,068
And it wasn't a question of snow, it just was too cold.

1036
01:16:58,908 --> 01:16:59,988
So there's a lot of reasons.

1037
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,349
And we try to be upfront.

1038
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:05,970
There's always somebody who tells me we shouldn't have done it, and there's somebody who always tells me we should have done it.

1039
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:07,364
I mean, I guarantee you.

1040
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:09,246
And of course, the funniest things are the calls from the kids.

1041
01:17:10,027 --> 01:17:11,109
Hello, this is a parent.

1042
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:13,972
I don't think kids should be going to school today.

1043
01:17:13,992 --> 01:17:17,537
Hello, I had to shovel all day yesterday.

1044
01:17:17,597 --> 01:17:19,179
I need at least one day to play in this stuff.

1045
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,264
I mean, it's really funny what the kids will call up and say and do.

1046
01:17:25,533 --> 01:17:26,634
You know, you understand?

1047
01:17:26,654 --> 01:17:27,415
Thank you, Mr. Supreme.

1048
01:17:27,615 --> 01:17:28,736
But that's what it is, OK?

1049
01:17:28,996 --> 01:17:31,738
So a little bit of planning right now would be helpful.

1050
01:17:31,778 --> 01:17:33,219
We're going to wish it away.

1051
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,660
Mr. Benedetto.

1052
01:17:36,121 --> 01:17:37,562
So this is a good point.

1053
01:17:38,343 --> 01:17:45,148
I know a few years ago, I brought it up when we had so many snow days, that there is other ways to learn and teach our students.

1054
01:17:45,228 --> 01:17:52,294
In a lot of other communities, they either have a snow day backpack where students complete some work so they don't fall behind.

1055
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:57,396
Well, this is an opportunity to look at online learning for our community.

1056
01:17:57,776 --> 01:18:07,681
And, you know, we live in the Northeast, but we still take AP classes on the same day as everybody else in the country, no matter how many snow days we have and how many we don't.

1057
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:12,523
So the learning has to be done in some classes by a specific date.

1058
01:18:13,045 --> 01:18:27,852
So I would really, really like to talk to you at some point about more online learning opportunities for our students and to have us present maybe to the state different ways for children to study from home.

1059
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:32,754
That being said, Mr. Belson, you know how I feel.

1060
01:18:33,054 --> 01:18:41,918
I like to see our buildings open even for any kids that come, even if it's less teachers, even if it's anything because some kids don't have a warm house.

1061
01:18:42,455 --> 01:18:44,956
to stay in all day or parental supervision.

1062
01:18:45,396 --> 01:18:49,717
And some kids depend on our schools to have their breakfast and their lunch.

1063
01:18:50,117 --> 01:18:52,918
And they really shouldn't be home alone all that long.

1064
01:18:53,358 --> 01:19:03,861
So any opportunity that you can, I'm going to ask you to please try to keep some of our school buildings open for those families that really need us to be there for them on an everyday basis.

1065
01:19:04,481 --> 01:19:07,682
So that's how I feel, even though I hate driving in the snow.

1066
01:19:08,412 --> 01:19:08,832
understand.

1067
01:19:09,032 --> 01:19:10,293
Good luck making that call.

1068
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:12,794
And I'm glad it's not me making that decision.

1069
01:19:14,815 --> 01:19:17,336
It's a one thing we should also mention is our young people.

1070
01:19:17,396 --> 01:19:29,521
We've tried to encourage them, especially the older children to help out with neighbors who may be elderly or infirmed because obviously sidewalks and things of that type need to be shoveled so that youngsters don't have to walk in streets.

1071
01:19:30,482 --> 01:19:37,345
Uh, and we don't have situations where it's unsafe when a little kid is behind a huge snowbank.

1072
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:49,853
So those are things we need to talk a little bit about to the community about how they can help us make sure that if there's an accumulation of snow, it doesn't block the visibility for youngsters near buses or near cars.

1073
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:51,685
Ms.

1074
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:52,085
Cuno.

1075
01:19:52,586 --> 01:20:03,591
While we're on that, I was just thinking that I know in the past we've had a list of senior citizens or people that actually need help to to snow, remove their snow.

1076
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:08,373
And we've had students that have done it for like community service and things like that.

1077
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:15,717
So if we could look into it again and see if the counseling and aging and maybe speak to our,

1078
01:20:17,398 --> 01:20:19,499
Councilors at school maybe come up.

1079
01:20:19,579 --> 01:20:25,122
I know that it's difficult sometimes we don't have a lot a lot of students but if we could get something working like that that would be good.

1080
01:20:25,457 --> 01:20:25,697
Good.

1081
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:25,877
Yep.

1082
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:29,558
They have something in place that we met over the end of last winter.

1083
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:29,679
Right.

1084
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,619
Hopefully we'll be ready to go.

1085
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:32,840
On the motion by Ms.

1086
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:35,381
Discari to receive in place on file, seconded by Ms.

1087
01:20:35,421 --> 01:20:35,821
Van de Kloot.

1088
01:20:35,841 --> 01:20:36,541
All those in favor?

1089
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:37,561
All those opposed?

1090
01:20:38,342 --> 01:20:39,102
Motion passes.

1091
01:20:39,962 --> 01:20:43,123
Motion to move negotiations and legal matters to the end of the agenda.

1092
01:20:44,064 --> 01:20:45,164
So moved on that motion, Ms.

1093
01:20:45,204 --> 01:20:46,885
Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

1094
01:20:47,025 --> 01:20:47,525
Cuneo.

1095
01:20:48,165 --> 01:20:48,865
All those in favor?

1096
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:49,205
Aye.

1097
01:20:49,526 --> 01:20:50,086
All those opposed?

1098
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,166
Motion passes.

1099
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:53,387
Motion to suspend the rules matter.

1100
01:20:53,827 --> 01:20:55,267
Motion to take new business.

1101
01:20:55,668 --> 01:20:56,388
Okay.

1102
01:20:56,408 --> 01:21:01,770
They had trimmed the branches, but I will look at that.

1103
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:02,310
We'll do.

1104
01:21:19,758 --> 01:21:20,339
New business.

1105
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,105
M.A.S.C., conference resolutions.

1106
01:21:24,225 --> 01:21:26,910
There are four resolutions in our packet.

1107
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:28,652
They are quite lengthy.

1108
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:32,559
Is there a motion to read the entire resolution?

1109
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:32,619
Ms.

1110
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:33,320
Vandekloot.

1111
01:21:35,283 --> 01:21:41,746
is if we could just get to the core of it I think we can do so in one or two sentences.

1112
01:21:43,467 --> 01:21:50,231
The first one has to do with the foundation budget which is used to calculate all the local aid that we get from for the school department from the state.

1113
01:21:50,751 --> 01:22:03,938
It's be it resolved that MASC calls upon the legislature to enact the recommendations of the foundation budget into law and further that the legislature order the Commission to reconvene in order to conduct further deliberations and

1114
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:17,321
and make such recommendations as the FBRC may propose, and further, that the FBRC shall address and make recommendations toward the overall accuracy of the adequacy of the overall foundation budget.

1115
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:19,241
Mr. Superintendent.

1116
01:22:19,461 --> 01:22:27,563
Madam Mayor, the one thing I want to stress with this particular motion, while the motion itself is good, the adequacy word is very important.

1117
01:22:28,023 --> 01:22:32,004
Because if they only put a certain amount of money, and even if it's more money,

1118
01:22:32,597 --> 01:22:37,519
and it gets distributed in ways that Medford doesn't get any money, it doesn't help us.

1119
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:54,888
And it's important that they increase the foundation budget, but it's also important that they understand that adequacy means that every community has to receive more than it's currently receiving now, not just those communities that fall below foundation.

1120
01:22:55,468 --> 01:23:00,030
So that's critical, you know, that we stress when we talk at the conference about adequacy being

1121
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:03,451
funding everyone, because everyone can use the money.

1122
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:09,316
You know, there's that John Greenleaf Whittier quote that I love so much, but I modify it.

1123
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:14,480
John Greenleaf Whittier said, of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are what might have been.

1124
01:23:15,001 --> 01:23:15,661
I changed that.

1125
01:23:15,801 --> 01:23:20,105
Of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are subject to appropriation.

1126
01:23:20,906 --> 01:23:24,428
Because when they don't appropriate enough money, the language doesn't mean anything.

1127
01:23:25,269 --> 01:23:28,772
They've got to understand that communities like Medford

1128
01:23:29,286 --> 01:23:34,851
may be wealthier than certain other communities, not as wealthy as others, but we need money.

1129
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:47,562
You can't have a Foundation Budget Review Committee that wipes out additional funding to 150 communities, which is what the Foundation Budget Review Committee distribution would have done, including Medford.

1130
01:23:49,144 --> 01:23:51,205
We should vote yes, but we should vote for adequacy.

1131
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:53,347
We should push adequacy in our discussion.

1132
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:55,390
Ms.

1133
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:55,931
Van de Kloot.

1134
01:23:56,271 --> 01:24:03,297
Is there a way that we should amend this resolution so that it covers our concern?

1135
01:24:03,957 --> 01:24:07,140
I'm just looking as I read it, having heard your point.

1136
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:18,929
I mean, basically we should be saying that all communities should receive an increase that is consistent with the demands and the mandates that the state has put in place.

1137
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:21,852
The state has increased the number of mandates to communities, as you know.

1138
01:24:22,614 --> 01:24:25,335
Unfunded mandates is almost a way of life at the state house.

1139
01:24:26,715 --> 01:24:32,776
We cannot continue to allow that to happen because we continue to use our own money for things.

1140
01:24:33,957 --> 01:24:39,298
And then as a result, eventually we have to cut other things that we don't want to cut or you can't go where you want to go.

1141
01:24:39,998 --> 01:24:49,560
So remember this year when we talked budget, I told you that we got $55 per pupil minimum aid, new money on the chapter 70, which was more than a 25 of the year before.

1142
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:51,321
But the net net was we lost $200,000.

1143
01:24:54,327 --> 01:24:55,007
That's not a win.

1144
01:24:55,948 --> 01:25:00,791
What that is is a partial win.

1145
01:25:00,951 --> 01:25:02,332
It's a balancing act.

1146
01:25:03,093 --> 01:25:09,577
We need to make sure that if they're going to increase the foundation budget, that it adequately reflects the needs of all communities.

1147
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:15,241
That's the message to the MASC Resolutions Committee and to the state.

1148
01:25:18,748 --> 01:25:19,968
Point of information, Mr. Scarey.

1149
01:25:19,988 --> 01:25:30,591
Given the plight of the state's economy and the present budget shortcomings that the governor released this weekend, have cities and towns been notified that they may have to tighten their belts?

1150
01:25:30,771 --> 01:25:31,171
We have not.

1151
01:25:31,191 --> 01:25:33,652
We have not had any 9C cuts inflicted upon us yet.

1152
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:37,513
Have we received all the scheduled receipts and first quarter payments from Commonwealth?

1153
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:37,673
Uh-huh.

1154
01:25:38,053 --> 01:25:38,593
Okay.

1155
01:25:38,613 --> 01:25:40,934
I'd be curious to see what October's receipts look like.

1156
01:25:41,334 --> 01:25:42,294
September look better?

1157
01:25:43,703 --> 01:25:44,263
but not great.

1158
01:25:44,903 --> 01:25:49,444
There's cuts across the board that could eventually trickle down and affect us.

1159
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:50,105
Right.

1160
01:25:50,565 --> 01:25:50,985
It did.

1161
01:25:51,005 --> 01:26:00,747
I think back in 2009, we had nine seat cuts, which are really hard to do when you get notice in December and January, because you're basically cutting a year's worth of a cut in six months.

1162
01:26:01,027 --> 01:26:02,168
That's why I brought this up.

1163
01:26:02,228 --> 01:26:05,628
I want to make sure that we're at the top of the picture.

1164
01:26:05,748 --> 01:26:06,969
We're following quite closely.

1165
01:26:06,989 --> 01:26:07,549
Thank you.

1166
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:11,350
Is there a motion for approval of this first resolution?

1167
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:13,791
Well, I just have a question.

1168
01:26:14,811 --> 01:26:28,258
Then should we admit, should we propose an amendment to the adequacies, continuing it by saying adequacy, meaning the needs of all communities to make it very clear where we stand with this?

1169
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:34,001
Well, I think, I think we should put that into our, into our language.

1170
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:38,703
So that adequacy that we should stress adequacy and you know, and,

1171
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:43,182
a full distribution to all communities, you know, under chapter 70, not just some.

1172
01:26:43,582 --> 01:26:44,843
So that's what I'm saying.

1173
01:26:44,963 --> 01:26:50,147
So amending, amending this, amending it, amending it, adding another, adding an emphasis point, right?

1174
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:58,312
So that way, whoever our delegate is that goes to the conference, Mr. Scary will actually have to stand up and, and express what our needs are.

1175
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,834
So that's why I want to make sure that we amend it properly.

1176
01:27:00,854 --> 01:27:08,139
It's important to note that if you expect the legislature to enact something, if you have 150 cities and towns that aren't going to benefit,

1177
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:10,406
it's unlikely they're going to enact it.

1178
01:27:10,446 --> 01:27:15,890
So the likelihood of it being enacted has a greater chance if every community is a winner.

1179
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:16,911
Right?

1180
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:17,131
No.

1181
01:27:17,171 --> 01:27:17,912
And I agree with you.

1182
01:27:17,952 --> 01:27:29,902
I'm just saying that if we are going to be looking at these proposals and the resolutions, I mean that we make a stand to make sure that if we're going to amend it, we have to be properly, we'll do it properly now.

1183
01:27:30,323 --> 01:27:33,225
So that way our delegate could express that when he goes down.

1184
01:27:34,626 --> 01:27:34,827
So,

1185
01:27:36,198 --> 01:27:42,641
I make a motion that we also change the adequacy, including the meeting, meaning of needs all me.

1186
01:27:42,961 --> 01:27:43,522
Oh my gosh.

1187
01:27:44,122 --> 01:27:56,768
Meeting that it meets all communities on the motion as amended on resolution one motion seconded roll call vote.

1188
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:00,390
Yes.

1189
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:12,154
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative on the motion as amended.

1190
01:28:12,995 --> 01:28:15,959
Resolution 2, tax reform ballot question.

1191
01:28:17,601 --> 01:28:23,189
Talks about greater tax equity that will not raise taxes on any but the wealthiest residents of Massachusetts.

1192
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:44,112
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Massachusetts Association of School Committees explore ways to promote social and economic equity through a valid initiative whose purpose may include a state constitutional amendment, tax reform, protection of the state's neediest residents of all ages, and seeks additional revenue only from tax reform affecting the state's wealthiest residents.

1193
01:28:44,712 --> 01:28:55,697
Further, that the goal of such a ballot referendum will be to secure a stronger financial base to underwrite needed improvements in the infrastructure of the Commonwealth, as well as the educational, social, and economic well-being of its residents.

1194
01:28:56,657 --> 01:29:01,180
Is there a motion on the floor for approval of this resolution number two?

1195
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,520
Motion for approval.

1196
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,821
Mr. Scarry, seconded by Ms.

1197
01:29:03,941 --> 01:29:04,421
DeAnderklut.

1198
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:05,421
Roll call vote, please.

1199
01:29:05,501 --> 01:29:05,562
Ms.

1200
01:29:05,582 --> 01:29:05,882
Scarry.

1201
01:29:06,022 --> 01:29:06,262
Yes.

1202
01:29:12,017 --> 01:29:15,038
Yes, seven to zero, seven in favor, motion passes.

1203
01:29:16,539 --> 01:29:18,680
Resolution three, charter school reform.

1204
01:29:19,461 --> 01:29:21,101
Oh, this is a long one.

1205
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:23,142
I'm going to go right down to the be it resolved.

1206
01:29:23,182 --> 01:29:34,948
Therefore, be it resolved that the Massachusetts Association of School Committees urge the citizens of the Commonwealth to reject such a ballot initiative and further, that MASC seeks legislative approval of a comprehensive set of reforms that include, one,

1207
01:29:35,648 --> 01:29:46,232
Establishment of strict guidelines or regulations to require the charter schools enrolled represent cross-sections of students residing within the school service areas.

1208
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:52,874
Two, reporting of accurate number of students who leave charter schools to return to the sending district or district of residence.

1209
01:29:53,754 --> 01:29:57,056
Three, requiring, well I'm sorry, requiring the Mass.

1210
01:29:57,076 --> 01:30:10,363
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to retain and report accurate data on enrollment of students with learning disabilities, physical disabilities, economic disadvantage, emotional disability, and status as racial and linguistic minorities.

1211
01:30:11,163 --> 01:30:23,596
Four, state requirements that any charter school authorized in a community without its consent be funded in full by the Commonwealth rather than by expropriation of Chapter 70 education aid from ascending cities, towns, and regions.

1212
01:30:24,357 --> 01:30:32,125
Five, state funding in full of any mitigation funds created to offset the loss of state funding for students who become students in charter schools.

1213
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:34,868
Mr. Benedetto.

1214
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:38,650
First of all, I feel like, um, I work, I work at a charter school.

1215
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:49,693
Um, I believe my school does adhere to all these rules and regulations, but as an employee of that school district, I choose to abstain from voting at this, at this time.

1216
01:30:49,733 --> 01:30:54,475
So noted that Mr. Benedetto will abstain based upon her working for a charter school.

1217
01:30:55,515 --> 01:30:56,616
Is the motion for approval by Ms.

1218
01:30:56,636 --> 01:30:57,816
Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Ms.

1219
01:30:57,856 --> 01:30:58,336

1220
01:30:58,616 --> 01:30:59,097
Roll call Ms.

1221

Ms.

1223
01:30:59,397 --> 01:30:59,717
Cuneo.

1224
01:31:00,737 --> 01:31:01,017
Yes.

1225
01:31:01,717 --> 01:31:02,798
Mr. Benedetto.

1226
01:31:02,818 --> 01:31:03,158
Abstain.

1227
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:08,967
Yes.

1228
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,491
Six in the affirmative, one abstained, motion passes.

1229
01:31:12,052 --> 01:31:15,317
Resolution four, social and emotional well-being of students.

1230
01:31:16,312 --> 01:31:41,798
So be it resolved that the Mass Association School Committee shall be directed to deploy such resources of the association independently and in collaboration with other organizations to gather resources, identify strategies, and improve public awareness of the importance of addressing students' social and emotional well-being, and further, that MASC shall give consideration to such public policy initiatives that prioritize action by stakeholders and stakeholders

1231
01:31:42,598 --> 01:31:51,824
in collaboration with expert behavioral and health care providers as the most effective entities for addressing strategies that are in the best interest of the community.

1232
01:31:52,385 --> 01:31:53,365
Motion for approval by Ms.

1233
01:31:53,405 --> 01:31:54,866

Roll call vote, please, Ms.

Tescari.

1237

Ms.

1238
01:31:57,488 --> 01:31:59,149
Van de Kloet would like to speak on this first.

1239
01:31:59,169 --> 01:31:59,209
Ms.

1240
01:31:59,289 --> 01:31:59,910
Van de Kloet?

1241
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:14,454
Very good.

1242
01:32:15,175 --> 01:32:15,695
Mr. Scary.

1243
01:32:15,836 --> 01:32:23,382
Roll call, please.

1244
01:32:24,283 --> 01:32:24,523
Yes.

1245
01:32:24,563 --> 01:32:25,604
Seven in the affirmative.

1246
01:32:25,704 --> 01:32:27,065
None of the negative motion passes.

1247
01:32:27,706 --> 01:32:28,447
Thank you very much.

1248
01:32:30,737 --> 01:32:33,339
Okay, resolution submitted by Member Van de Kloet.

1249
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:39,843
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee urges the citizens of Medford to vote no on charter school expansion question two this November.

1250
01:32:39,923 --> 01:32:40,063
Ms.

1251
01:32:40,104 --> 01:32:40,544
Van de Kloet.

1252
01:32:41,404 --> 01:32:45,968
So, there's obviously many, many different levels of conversation that we could have on this.

1253
01:32:46,368 --> 01:32:49,450
I'm going to strictly take mine to the financial.

1254
01:32:50,651 --> 01:32:52,132
Right now, it costs Medford

1255
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:55,773
approximately $4 million to fund our charter school students.

1256
01:32:57,494 --> 01:33:06,316
We have 10 students less than last year, but it's costing us $270,000 more this year.

1257
01:33:07,076 --> 01:33:07,817
Why is that?

1258
01:33:08,257 --> 01:33:14,639
It's because the state has underfunded the charter school account by $57 million.

1259
01:33:15,955 --> 01:33:19,358
So this comes to one of those unfunded mandates.

1260
01:33:20,339 --> 01:33:23,182
It's not a question of how good charter schools are or how not.

1261
01:33:23,522 --> 01:33:32,150
Right now we're simply talking about a funding mechanism and the number of charter schools that would be potentially approved by this would only have a greater impact.

1262
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:40,318
Therefore, I certainly personally have been urging people to vote no on two because of the particular way the funding works.

1263
01:33:41,418 --> 01:33:46,400
And I would urge the school committee to take a stand and say vote no on two.

1264
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:50,981
There's a motion on the floor for approval of Ms.

1265
01:33:51,021 --> 01:33:53,742
Van de Kloot's recommendation, seconded by Ms.

1266
01:33:53,782 --> 01:33:54,262
Cuno.

1267
01:33:54,422 --> 01:33:55,462
Would you like a roll call on this?

1268
01:33:55,942 --> 01:33:56,202
Sure.

1269
01:33:56,822 --> 01:33:58,923
Roll call, Mr. Skerry.

1270
01:34:08,454 --> 01:34:11,284
Yes, six in the affirmative, one abstain, motion passes.

1271
01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:15,128
over $4 million.

1272
01:34:15,968 --> 01:34:16,949
That's on our cherry sheets.

1273
01:34:16,989 --> 01:34:23,531
Anyone can go up to the state website and they can look up Medford's cherry sheet, which was named after the color it used to be printed on back in the dark ages.

1274
01:34:24,271 --> 01:34:26,032
And you can look up the state aid.

1275
01:34:26,472 --> 01:34:29,073
And you can see the revenue that comes from the state expenses.

1276
01:34:29,133 --> 01:34:30,413
They charge us such as tea.

1277
01:34:30,753 --> 01:34:34,974
They hit us for being a tea community, which is quite a couple million dollars.

1278
01:34:35,555 --> 01:34:37,515
Charter schools is another big hit that we have.

1279
01:34:37,535 --> 01:34:41,316
And then you see the monies that come to the city from the state as well.

1280
01:34:41,736 --> 01:34:42,777
So please, go up and look.

1281
01:34:43,697 --> 01:34:44,317
It's enlightening.

1282
01:34:46,878 --> 01:34:59,380
Yeah, I think the thing about the charter schools is we're not, like you said, we're not saying they're not great educational facilities, but when you pluck one first grader out of the school, maybe one first out of another school, we don't lose a whole classroom.

1283
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,960
So we don't gain any efficiencies.

1284
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,881
We just, we lose one here and there.

1285
01:35:03,401 --> 01:35:05,701
And the next thing you know, we're up to what number, Mr. Billson?

1286
01:35:05,881 --> 01:35:06,622
About 330 right now.

1287
01:35:06,642 --> 01:35:07,282
330 spread amongst.

1288
01:35:09,775 --> 01:35:13,077
you know, all the different grades and schools and classrooms.

1289
01:35:13,117 --> 01:35:19,421
So we're not able to just cut classrooms, you know, without putting on numbers up to the 25, 26 average.

1290
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:27,787
So a few years ago we did a study along with MASS and we found that we could fund those youngsters by putting them in classrooms.

1291
01:35:28,647 --> 01:35:32,570
Um, at this point in time back then at about a third of the cost.

1292
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:37,833
So when people say that there is no loss of revenue,

1293
01:35:38,493 --> 01:35:41,699
They don't do the numbers like we do the numbers.

1294
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,844
There may be some communities that don't have space.

1295
01:35:44,345 --> 01:35:47,732
There may be some situations that don't exist, that don't work 100%.

1296
01:35:47,772 --> 01:35:50,417
But in this community, it will work.

1297
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,120
Very good.

1298
01:35:52,880 --> 01:36:01,304
Resolution proposed by Mayor Burke, proclamation by Mayor Burke, supporting and celebrating keeping lights on, keeping lights on after school of proclamation.

1299
01:36:02,164 --> 01:36:04,205
Can I read this whole motion?

1300
01:36:05,225 --> 01:36:13,669
Whereas the citizens of Medford stand firmly committed to quality after school programs and opportunities because they provide challenging and engaging learning experiences that help

1301
01:36:14,129 --> 01:36:23,213
Children develop social, emotional, physical and academic skills while supporting working families, ensuring their children are safe and productive after the traditional school day ends.

1302
01:36:23,894 --> 01:36:35,079
Whereas the City of Medford has provided significant leadership in the area of community involvement in the education and well-being of our youth, grounded in the principle that quality after-school programs are key to helping our children become successful adults.

1303
01:36:35,799 --> 01:36:47,728
Whereas Lights On After School, the national celebration of after-school programs held this year on October 22, 2016, promotes the importance of quality after-school programs in the lives of children, families, and communities.

1304
01:36:48,268 --> 01:36:50,269
Whereas more than 28 million children in the U.S.

1305
01:36:50,309 --> 01:36:54,973
have parents who work outside the home, and 15.1 million children have no place to go after school.

1306
01:36:55,773 --> 01:37:03,599
Whereas many after-school programs across the country are facing funding shortfalls so severe that they are being forced to close their doors and turn off their lights.

1307
01:37:04,511 --> 01:37:16,013
Whereas the City of Medford is committed to investing in the health and safety of all young people by providing after-school and out-of-school time programs that will help close the achievement gap and prepare young people to compete in the global economy.

1308
01:37:16,553 --> 01:37:25,955
Whereas it is important to engage families, schools, and communities in advancing the welfare of our children and ensure the lights stay on and the doors stay open for all children after school.

1309
01:37:26,515 --> 01:37:31,516
Now the FRI, Stephanie Burke, Mayor of the City of Medford, do hereby proclaim October 22, 2016 to be Lights On After School Day.

1310
01:37:34,436 --> 01:37:45,739
and urge all the citizens of Medford to take cognizance of this event and participate fittingly in its observance, given this 17th day of October in the year 2016, and of the independence of the United States of America, the 240.

1311
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:47,019
Motion for approval.

1312
01:37:48,059 --> 01:37:50,360
Motion for approval, seconded by Ms.

1313
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:51,000
Van de Kloot.

1314
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:51,940
All those in favor?

1315
01:37:52,661 --> 01:37:53,301
All those opposed?

1316
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:54,081
Motion passes.

1317
01:37:55,421 --> 01:37:55,781
Thank you.

1318
01:37:57,082 --> 01:37:57,782
Mr. Benedetto.

1319
01:37:57,802 --> 01:38:01,643
I just need two updates from the super- Do you still have other resolutions?

1320
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:05,473
Okay?

1321
01:38:05,773 --> 01:38:06,494
Yep, sorry.

1322
01:38:07,735 --> 01:38:08,795
School Committee Resolution.

1323
01:38:08,815 --> 01:38:13,318
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Thomas English.

1324
01:38:13,398 --> 01:38:17,500
Mr. English was a Medford High School physical education health teacher and coach for many years.

1325
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:21,183
He was the husband of Marlene English, former Medford Public School Secretary.

1326
01:38:22,243 --> 01:38:27,246
Further, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Beth Wood.

1327
01:38:27,487 --> 01:38:31,269
Miss Wood was the sister of former Director of Administration and Finance, Pat Bailey.

1328
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:37,339
be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of John Viveros.

1329
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:40,724
Mr. Viveros was a longtime custodian for the Medford Public Schools.

1330
01:38:41,224 --> 01:38:47,473
And if I could just add one, that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Hannah Young, former Medford High School student.

1331
01:38:47,973 --> 01:38:49,715
All please rise for a moment of silence, please.

1332
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:06,521
Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

1333
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:08,602
Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1334
01:39:09,162 --> 01:39:13,485
Superintendent, through you to Superintendent Belson, he gave us two updates.

1335
01:39:13,585 --> 01:39:15,766
I don't know if you wanted to go over them publicly.

1336
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:23,832
One was for the completion, complete rollout of school brains and when that will take place.

1337
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:27,394
Mr. Superintendent.

1338
01:39:27,954 --> 01:39:30,496
And the other one is the MBTA bus passes.

1339
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:35,780
All right, so on the School Brains activity, as you know, we've switched from iPass to School Brains.

1340
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:46,944
It's a much more comprehensive and much more, let's say, modernized version of school software that would keep track of students, staff, and other records and the like.

1341
01:39:47,404 --> 01:39:48,684
But there was a rollout period.

1342
01:39:49,405 --> 01:39:56,007
And the primary activity initially was, one, to transfer information from iPass to School Brains.

1343
01:39:56,547 --> 01:39:58,288
There's still some data that has to be cleaned.

1344
01:39:58,857 --> 01:40:04,860
It's a very arduous process because some of the material is in different formats from one to the other.

1345
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:09,282
It has to be individually looked at to be sure of accuracy as people come and go.

1346
01:40:09,782 --> 01:40:10,643
And it's not static.

1347
01:40:10,923 --> 01:40:13,544
What's true today may not be true tomorrow as people come and leave.

1348
01:40:15,525 --> 01:40:18,287
Secondly, there needs to be training on this.

1349
01:40:18,327 --> 01:40:19,527
And there is training going on.

1350
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:24,910
In fact, tomorrow, there is a train-the-trainer activity at the schools where we're

1351
01:40:25,653 --> 01:40:28,974
empowering certain teachers and administrators to become lead people.

1352
01:40:29,814 --> 01:40:36,395
And on the school, uh, professional development day, we're having an all school activity that will, we'll deal with that as well.

1353
01:40:36,915 --> 01:40:42,156
Our primary activity initially is to roll out the attendance and grade reporting activities.

1354
01:40:42,196 --> 01:40:45,357
Cause that's, what's essential for us to, to do what has to be done.

1355
01:40:45,377 --> 01:40:48,537
And also the materials that are associated with, with state reporting.

1356
01:40:49,497 --> 01:40:53,598
Uh, we will then work on the parent portal, the high school and the vocational school,

1357
01:40:54,455 --> 01:41:01,558
uh, as we'll be ready at the end of the first quarter around November 17th to open up the parent portal for students at those schools.

1358
01:41:02,299 --> 01:41:16,585
Uh, we think the middle schools probably have a good shot to be opened by the first of the year and the elementary schools are working on their standards report cards and we get a better handle on that once that's been cleaned up and we know exactly when they can be able to comment on that.

1359
01:41:16,645 --> 01:41:18,226
But it's making progress.

1360
01:41:18,266 --> 01:41:19,087
We want to do it right.

1361
01:41:19,107 --> 01:41:19,147
Um,

1362
01:41:20,974 --> 01:41:30,582
There is something called a System Interoperational Framework, SIF, that is important to coordinate with the state, because if you will, garbage in, garbage out.

1363
01:41:31,103 --> 01:41:33,945
And once you get that kind of thing happening, it becomes impossible.

1364
01:41:34,586 --> 01:41:40,631
And just simply by inverting the first name and the last name in some reports can create all kinds of errors.

1365
01:41:40,651 --> 01:41:43,073
So we have to be very careful as we convert.

1366
01:41:43,173 --> 01:41:48,698
In the long run, it'll be distinctly to our advantage that it may take a little bit longer, but our goal remains the same.

1367
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:57,482
to increase our interactivity with parents, and to provide people with full information, and to be able to create reports that will help us all better understand what's going on.

1368
01:41:57,822 --> 01:41:59,983
So that's that particular activity.

1369
01:42:00,463 --> 01:42:03,724
In some places it'll be a little bit slower than others, but we're working on it.

1370
01:42:04,304 --> 01:42:06,325
And we're certainly not stopping what we need to do.

1371
01:42:07,385 --> 01:42:09,506
On the school bus, okay.

1372
01:42:09,526 --> 01:42:10,686
Mr. Benedetto has a question.

1373
01:42:10,946 --> 01:42:11,126
Sure.

1374
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:24,584
Mr. Superintendent, I'm wondering if you could maybe work up a timeline in the next month or so, so that way parents know or tell us how you're going to communicate to parents when the rollout for the parent portal piece will be.

1375
01:42:25,485 --> 01:42:29,386
I've been getting a few phone calls and messages from parents.

1376
01:42:29,486 --> 01:42:35,428
They're eager to use this program and they were really looking for a specific date.

1377
01:42:36,009 --> 01:42:37,069
Well, you know, I don't want to be,

1378
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,623
foolish enough to say something that I can't deliver on.

1379
01:42:40,743 --> 01:42:45,788
And one of the things that we want to be careful about is we make a promise and we can't keep it, we're worse off.

1380
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:48,971
I told you that the high school will be ready at the end of the first quarter.

1381
01:42:49,571 --> 01:42:52,374
We think the middle school will be ready by the first of the year, if not sooner.

1382
01:42:52,394 --> 01:43:01,283
And the elementary schools will roll out a little bit differently because they have different informational reporting things than the standards report cards than the other two frameworks.

1383
01:43:01,893 --> 01:43:03,374
So we need to be a little bit careful.

1384
01:43:03,794 --> 01:43:04,735
Let's just put it this way.

1385
01:43:04,795 --> 01:43:06,256
We are diligently proceeding.

1386
01:43:06,736 --> 01:43:09,979
I'll have a better idea after the training is done in November.

1387
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:17,044
Again, to see what teachers' minds are, what they feel comfortable with, and we can work our way through.

1388
01:43:17,084 --> 01:43:19,125
But I understand that people are anxious.

1389
01:43:19,225 --> 01:43:23,448
On the other hand, I certainly don't want to make promises I can't keep, because that only creates more problems.

1390
01:43:25,169 --> 01:43:26,791
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1391
01:43:26,831 --> 01:43:30,053
So even if we put it up on our website that we're working

1392
01:43:30,728 --> 01:43:35,811
are coming soon, approximate hopeful dates, whatever way you want to put it.

1393
01:43:35,871 --> 01:43:40,014
At least so parents have an understanding of what they're looking for.

1394
01:43:41,155 --> 01:43:46,678
I have experienced school districts turning over, and I really know that this takes a long time.

1395
01:43:46,718 --> 01:43:51,281
And some school districts don't even turn it over till the parents leave first or second year.

1396
01:43:51,321 --> 01:43:54,083
They wait until all think glitches are out.

1397
01:43:55,004 --> 01:43:58,266
So I understand that you are trying to expedite this quickly.

1398
01:43:59,046 --> 01:44:00,127
And I do appreciate that.

1399
01:44:00,543 --> 01:44:10,048
Also, would you just, um, put that on our agenda that, you know, just to update us on the dates, if you could do that, I would appreciate that.

1400
01:44:10,729 --> 01:44:17,092
Um, the MBTA bus passes, uh, the MBTA changed the rules.

1401
01:44:17,812 --> 01:44:20,834
The MBTA gave what they called an M pass and an S pass.

1402
01:44:21,234 --> 01:44:29,659
The M pass is a pass that allows you to buy a pass for 30 days for a month and it's $30 and that gives you unlimited writing privileges.

1403
01:44:30,227 --> 01:44:38,274
The S-pass was a pass that you could put $10 on and you could use up to $10 for a time and then get another pass, get it renewed.

1404
01:44:38,755 --> 01:44:44,340
The difficulty is that the S-pass was being abused widely and the MBTA pulled it in.

1405
01:44:45,021 --> 01:44:50,145
And they said, school systems and communities are now responsible if the wrong people use it.

1406
01:44:50,946 --> 01:44:52,287
And what we had people losing it,

1407
01:44:53,665 --> 01:44:55,747
letting their cousins and their relatives use it.

1408
01:44:56,448 --> 01:44:58,590
And there was all kinds of problems associated with that.

1409
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:05,716
So we recognize that it's a, it's something that we want to be available to people, but we want to do it in a measured way.

1410
01:45:06,096 --> 01:45:09,860
So I've given you a report tonight to show that we've checked it out.

1411
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:10,440
We're following it.

1412
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:16,206
We're going to do it a limited amount of the time, especially for those people who clearly have a need to have it.

1413
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:17,647
But at the same token,

1414
01:45:18,492 --> 01:45:25,196
We want to be very careful that we don't have abuse and we don't have lost passes and things like that because then we'll get charged for it.

1415
01:45:25,837 --> 01:45:26,857
And that's not going to happen.

1416
01:45:26,957 --> 01:45:31,500
It's not just a Medford issue, it's across the state, across the, let's say the MBTA area.

1417
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:37,223
So this is an MBTA driven activity and we want to control it.

1418
01:45:37,263 --> 01:45:42,406
Plus the fact too, it's a lot of man hours, person hours if you will, to control these passes.

1419
01:45:43,147 --> 01:45:45,268
People come in, I've lost my pass, can I have another one?

1420
01:45:47,231 --> 01:45:48,892
It's a lot of work associated with.

1421
01:45:48,932 --> 01:45:54,935
So we need to create a certain sense that this is something you need to protect and you need to use it wisely.

1422
01:45:55,235 --> 01:45:58,556
And if someone doesn't use it appropriately, they won't get it again.

1423
01:45:59,637 --> 01:45:59,837
Ms.

1424
01:45:59,857 --> 01:46:00,637
Cunoz first.

1425
01:46:01,798 --> 01:46:04,399
Just to go back on school brains.

1426
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:09,822
A little bit frustrating because I totally understand it's a huge undertaking.

1427
01:46:10,677 --> 01:46:13,759
But like we're doing train-the-trainer assistance now.

1428
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:21,025
Why don't we do train-the-trainer like in the summertime so that way we could try to get the system up and going?

1429
01:46:21,045 --> 01:46:22,907
I guess that's one question.

1430
01:46:23,367 --> 01:46:24,668
The other question is that

1431
01:46:26,108 --> 01:46:30,089
You know, we have, it's common nature how it is.

1432
01:46:30,129 --> 01:46:31,509
You know, we had the I-PASS.

1433
01:46:31,889 --> 01:46:34,130
When we had I-PASS, everybody hated I-PASS.

1434
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:37,091
Now we have school brains and everybody loves I-PASS.

1435
01:46:37,471 --> 01:46:38,731
So it's just the way it is.

1436
01:46:39,191 --> 01:46:53,435
But the fact remains is that now we have people that have been used to at least getting on, checking their children's grades or, you know, getting progress reports via the I-PASS.

1437
01:46:54,437 --> 01:46:56,298
Now it's kind of like they're closed.

1438
01:46:56,398 --> 01:46:57,459
It's completely closed.

1439
01:46:57,639 --> 01:47:03,063
So I guess my concern is, as far as parents, what are we asking them to do?

1440
01:47:03,403 --> 01:47:06,525
Are we asking them to go back to sending emails to their teachers?

1441
01:47:07,606 --> 01:47:11,368
It's not elementary school that I'm talking about as much as middle school and high school.

1442
01:47:11,788 --> 01:47:16,151
Parents aren't in the yard that they see their teachers.

1443
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:17,472
Everybody has different hours.

1444
01:47:18,133 --> 01:47:21,175
I don't want to get to the point where we're bombarding our teachers

1445
01:47:21,855 --> 01:47:24,057
But what are we going to be telling our parents?

1446
01:47:24,898 --> 01:47:28,621
Like, we're not going to get, the high school is not going to be rolling it out until after the first quarter.

1447
01:47:29,242 --> 01:47:31,644
Parents have, you know, questions.

1448
01:47:31,664 --> 01:47:32,945
They want to know what's going on.

1449
01:47:33,446 --> 01:47:34,287
What are we telling them?

1450
01:47:34,567 --> 01:47:34,767
All right.

1451
01:47:34,787 --> 01:47:37,910
Well, what I told you before, basically we did a lot of training last year.

1452
01:47:38,531 --> 01:47:39,932
We had to negotiate a contract.

1453
01:47:40,012 --> 01:47:41,433
We did negotiate the contract.

1454
01:47:41,794 --> 01:47:43,015
Then we had to work in training.

1455
01:47:43,668 --> 01:47:47,551
Teachers were uncomfortable using some of these things, and it took time to get them going.

1456
01:47:47,591 --> 01:47:48,812
We did run training last year.

1457
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:52,515
They didn't consider it to be sufficient enough, and they wanted to do more.

1458
01:47:52,635 --> 01:47:54,616
In the summer, people are away.

1459
01:47:54,636 --> 01:47:56,017
You can only do so much.

1460
01:47:56,057 --> 01:47:59,600
You can only do what the people that want to come in and want to work on it.

1461
01:48:00,461 --> 01:48:01,782
There are other things that are going on.

1462
01:48:02,322 --> 01:48:04,564
So it's happening.

1463
01:48:05,243 --> 01:48:09,867
And the goal was to do it right and to have it be a long-term value to us.

1464
01:48:10,448 --> 01:48:14,191
I don't want to rush it and create a situation where we promise you things and then we can't do it.

1465
01:48:14,932 --> 01:48:17,814
And as far as a little inconvenience in the front end, I understand that.

1466
01:48:18,294 --> 01:48:20,496
But better to have that little inconvenience in the front end.

1467
01:48:21,057 --> 01:48:23,199
You can certainly communicate with your teachers by email.

1468
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:24,860
You can certainly call up the school.

1469
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:27,602
You certainly can visit to get any information.

1470
01:48:27,642 --> 01:48:29,544
We're certainly still sending out progress reports.

1471
01:48:30,045 --> 01:48:32,006
That's not something we've stopped doing.

1472
01:48:33,419 --> 01:48:35,960
The electronic system is going to take a little bit longer.

1473
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,560
The high school will happen very shortly.

1474
01:48:38,341 --> 01:48:40,061
Middle school, I think, will follow pretty quickly.

1475
01:48:40,661 --> 01:48:45,643
And then the elementary schools will have to figure out what's the best way to do that going forward.

1476
01:48:46,123 --> 01:48:49,284
I don't think anyone is trying to slow it down.

1477
01:48:49,665 --> 01:48:51,605
I just think it takes time to do it right.

1478
01:48:52,365 --> 01:48:58,287
And if we rush it and we do something, we're going to probably find we'll have more headaches down the road than we really bargained for.

1479
01:48:58,728 --> 01:49:01,308
Garbage in, garbage out, we don't want that to happen.

1480
01:49:01,689 --> 01:49:02,569
So I appreciate it.

1481
01:49:03,251 --> 01:49:06,480
Hopefully people understand that we're doing everything we can to get it going.

1482
01:49:07,162 --> 01:49:09,027
In a short period of time, it'll happen.

1483
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:09,788
Okay.

1484
01:49:09,888 --> 01:49:15,830
And I, I mean, I totally understand that, but I, again, I agree with all of my colleagues that at least put it out there.

1485
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:23,412
So that way, you know, we don't have different schools saying different messages or sending different messages because I think that was the frustrating part.

1486
01:49:23,832 --> 01:49:25,472
People want to appease everyone.

1487
01:49:25,952 --> 01:49:30,414
But as you said, you don't want to throw out a date and then parents are expecting that date.

1488
01:49:30,494 --> 01:49:33,274
And now we come across as not abiding by that.

1489
01:49:35,175 --> 01:49:35,335
Ms.

1490
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:35,835
Van de Kloot.

1491
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,472
It's okay.

1492
01:49:40,492 --> 01:49:41,172
You're all set?

1493
01:49:41,232 --> 01:49:41,412
Yeah.

1494
01:49:41,732 --> 01:49:41,912
Ms.

1495
01:49:41,932 --> 01:49:42,352
Mustone.

1496
01:49:43,153 --> 01:49:49,214
I was hoping that Cheryl could just speak about the Roberts community event to just give a shout out to our Yad Seal.

1497
01:49:49,354 --> 01:49:49,994
After we're all set.

1498
01:49:50,054 --> 01:49:51,995
Okay.

1499
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:54,116
I just had a few more things too.

1500
01:49:54,756 --> 01:49:59,637
First of all, I want to say thank you for helping the parents that came forward about the MBA TA passes.

1501
01:49:59,977 --> 01:50:02,618
When I reached out to them, they were very happy with

1502
01:50:03,333 --> 01:50:09,476
the administration and how they resolved their issues and how they opened it up to people in need of that.

1503
01:50:09,656 --> 01:50:13,558
And if other people are in need, then they should contact, I'm not exactly sure.

1504
01:50:13,938 --> 01:50:18,520
Joanne Mortel is the person on the point of this particular bus pass.

1505
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:21,121
She's in the accounts payable office of the schools.

1506
01:50:21,661 --> 01:50:24,162
You can look it up from the business offices to the phone number.

1507
01:50:24,182 --> 01:50:25,483
I don't have it in front of me right now.

1508
01:50:26,943 --> 01:50:30,785
He's a person issuing them and paying attention to their monitoring.

1509
01:50:30,805 --> 01:50:36,429
And it's a lot of work and I appreciate all the work that Joanne has done to keep things in place.

1510
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:40,732
So my last item is a few items in there.

1511
01:50:40,952 --> 01:50:48,136
They're just items that I would like to see listed on, um, under number 11 that, uh, reports we've requested.

1512
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:51,678
And as they requested, we take them off the list and it helps me, um,

1513
01:50:53,083 --> 01:51:01,870
It's like my to-do list, and I go from meeting to meeting and rewrite the list, so it's just helpful to have it on the bottom there.

1514
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:03,931
Someone very smart suggested I do that.

1515
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:14,279
Anyway, the first one would be the letter to Rep Donato and Gobley regarding the crossing guard at Salem Street, and asking them to help us with it.

1516
01:51:14,379 --> 01:51:15,320
I mean, Felsway, right?

1517
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:19,903
The other one would be the cost report of all

1518
01:51:20,454 --> 01:51:25,275
expenses for the MASC conference from last year and projected costs for next year.

1519
01:51:28,416 --> 01:51:34,598
And there was a couple of items my colleague, Ms.

1520
01:51:34,638 --> 01:51:45,581
Kretz, requested, and that would be to add a bus to go from the elementary school to the high school for the field trip.

1521
01:51:50,447 --> 01:51:51,527
Oh, okay.

1522
01:51:51,928 --> 01:51:52,848
I thought it was miscarriage.

1523
01:51:52,868 --> 01:51:53,128
Sorry.

1524
01:51:53,148 --> 01:52:04,672
It might've been Emory in, um, in that, um, update on the MCAS students that did not pass MCAS in adding a prep class.

1525
01:52:05,412 --> 01:52:08,093
Um, if that's been added, we've done that.

1526
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:09,134
Oh, okay.

1527
01:52:09,174 --> 01:52:09,894
That's good to know.

1528
01:52:09,974 --> 01:52:18,537
We, I know that that question came up last time about how we were going to provide extra additional help and where that money was coming for from.

1529
01:52:19,052 --> 01:52:21,573
to help students that have to retake the MCAS.

1530
01:52:21,994 --> 01:52:24,415
So I know that that came up at our last meeting as well.

1531
01:52:25,255 --> 01:52:27,597
So that has been done, and that class is scheduled.

1532
01:52:27,617 --> 01:52:30,038
Yeah, we'll get you a report on that.

1533
01:52:30,318 --> 01:52:30,478
OK.

1534
01:52:30,819 --> 01:52:33,640
It helps me keep everything straight, and I appreciate it.

1535
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:34,160
Thank you.

1536
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:34,701
Thank you.

1537
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:36,802
Oh, Ms.

1538
01:52:36,842 --> 01:52:37,262
Kritz.

1539
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:47,568
I want to mention, I did follow up with Mr. Johnson regarding the Fulton Street and the Felsway stop.

1540
01:52:48,355 --> 01:52:57,117
and they no longer use that as a bus stop, so they don't cross the students, because I had contacted him, and he spoke back, got back to me.

1541
01:52:58,257 --> 01:53:02,618
It used to be a popular crossing area when St.

1542
01:53:03,018 --> 01:53:05,078
Francis was open for parochial school.

1543
01:53:06,019 --> 01:53:11,380
They don't use that any longer, and they discourage students from crossing.

1544
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:17,701
In fact, they re-roaded the buses to have them stop on the appropriate sides of the Fells Way,

1545
01:53:18,232 --> 01:53:19,573
to get to their homes.

1546
01:53:20,474 --> 01:53:24,738
I did clarify that with Mr. Johnson after our last meeting.

1547
01:53:25,078 --> 01:53:33,785
And I also spoke to him and he said that they're doing great with their crossing guard at the Roberts.

1548
01:53:33,866 --> 01:53:38,510
However, it's very busy and it's very congested.

1549
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:45,956
And in fact, they might need two crossing guards because of the narrow streets and

1550
01:53:46,437 --> 01:53:51,281
making sure that students cross safely, and having somebody direct the traffic.

1551
01:53:52,062 --> 01:53:59,127
It's just very busy in that area, as well as the Brooks, which we're all aware of.

1552
01:53:59,427 --> 01:54:08,775
So I wanted to definitely mention that, because he mentioned that to me, that if there was any way to get another crossing guard, that would be helpful.

1553
01:54:09,575 --> 01:54:12,838
So maybe that's something that we would have to look at.

1554
01:54:14,359 --> 01:54:14,839
Thank you, Ms.

1555
01:54:14,859 --> 01:54:15,100
Kratz.

1556
01:54:16,252 --> 01:54:16,392
Ms.

1557
01:54:16,412 --> 01:54:18,416
Mustone?

1558
01:54:18,656 --> 01:54:20,760
A Roberts announcement?

1559
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:21,321
Yes, please.

1560
01:54:21,361 --> 01:54:21,702
On an event?

1561
01:54:21,802 --> 01:54:22,242
Thank you.

1562
01:54:22,323 --> 01:54:22,763
Big event.

1563
01:54:25,253 --> 01:54:26,454
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1564
01:54:26,554 --> 01:54:27,895
I live at 281 Park Street.

1565
01:54:28,455 --> 01:54:29,156
And Ms.

1566
01:54:29,176 --> 01:54:35,020
Caldwell mentioned that we are applying for several grants this year for different enrichment for the students.

1567
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,982
Those grants don't usually cover the entire event.

1568
01:54:38,102 --> 01:54:46,328
So this Saturday from 9 to 3, the Roberts Elementary School will be holding a yard sale to try to cover the cost of the rest of these events.

1569
01:54:47,352 --> 01:54:54,957
It's estimated now that we have three U-Hauls worth of items, and every dollar that we raise will go directly to enrichment for our nearly 600 students.

1570
01:54:55,017 --> 01:54:57,679
So if anyone can come, we're right down on Park Street.

1571
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:58,580
What was the time?

1572
01:54:58,980 --> 01:55:00,822
It's from nine to three this Saturday.

1573
01:55:01,262 --> 01:55:02,002
Thank you, Cheryl.

1574
01:55:03,123 --> 01:55:04,404
I saw a lot of it on our porch.

1575
01:55:04,484 --> 01:55:05,105
It all looks good.

1576
01:55:05,925 --> 01:55:06,345
Thank you.

1577
01:55:07,426 --> 01:55:07,586
Ms.

1578
01:55:07,626 --> 01:55:08,107
Vander Kloot.

1579
01:55:08,247 --> 01:55:09,808
While we're under suspension, I also just,

1580
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:20,840
In our packet, we received a reminder that our next meeting will be on October 24th at the superintendent's conference room to discuss the capital plan, and it will begin at 6.30.

1581
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:23,381
Very good.

1582
01:55:23,701 --> 01:55:27,342
And also this Sunday is Medford Day, 1 to 4 behind the Andrews School.

1583
01:55:27,382 --> 01:55:37,404
There will be musical entertainment, kids activities, adult entertainment, charitable organizations will be there with various informational and or

1584
01:55:38,194 --> 01:55:39,816
activities for everyone.

1585
01:55:39,916 --> 01:55:41,657
So please come on down to the Andrews School.

1586
01:55:42,658 --> 01:55:43,118
Medford Day.

1587
01:55:44,789 --> 01:55:46,390
There are so many.

1588
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:53,653
I mean, if you look at our packets, you'll see that if you're looking for anything in the city of Medford, we definitely offer a lot.

1589
01:55:53,713 --> 01:55:58,976
So if you're looking for something every night, every day, or even two, three times a day, we have an event to go to.

1590
01:55:59,436 --> 01:56:03,618
But one of the events I do want to give a shout out to, and that is the Kiwanis.

1591
01:56:03,998 --> 01:56:08,780
They are doing their taste of Italy at the high school Wednesday night, this Wednesday night from six to nine.

1592
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:15,670
And tickets are $40, everyone is welcome, and because the money that's raised there actually does benefit our students.

1593
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:23,838
They receive scholarships from the Kiwanis, and they have been very generous over the years, not only for scholarships, but for other things that they've given to our school system.

1594
01:56:23,938 --> 01:56:26,480
So I want to say- Great food, great entertainment.

1595
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:27,381
Yep, everything.

1596
01:56:28,722 --> 01:56:29,362
Great charity.

1597
01:56:31,644 --> 01:56:32,245
In the foyer.

1598
01:56:32,325 --> 01:56:33,486
In the foyer, the lobby.

1599
01:56:35,533 --> 01:56:43,257
is that it's also the National Honor Society Information Night, which is 6.30 to 7.30 in the Caron Theater.

1600
01:56:43,938 --> 01:56:44,638
That's been moved.

1601
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:50,321
It's been moved up to the science lab and with appropriate arrangements so that the youngsters can come and go freely.

1602
01:56:50,661 --> 01:56:52,062
Okay, that makes much more sense.

1603
01:56:52,382 --> 01:56:53,143
Great, thank you.

1604
01:56:53,443 --> 01:56:53,823
Very good.

1605
01:56:54,363 --> 01:57:02,428
Just might also announce, if I can, Madam Mayor, that tomorrow at noontime, the Medford High School band will be playing at the Science Museum

1606
01:57:03,310 --> 01:57:13,159
uh, for a special announcement from former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg and Medford resident, uh, who I believe will be making a major presentation to the science museum.

1607
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:19,765
Great motion to revert to the regular order of business, which is item six negotiations and legal matters.

1608
01:57:19,845 --> 01:57:22,928
We, there were motion to go into executive session offered by Ms.

1609
01:57:23,068 --> 01:57:24,169
Vandekloot, seconded by Ms.

1610
01:57:24,209 --> 01:57:24,829
Cuneo, Ms.

1611
01:57:24,849 --> 01:57:25,290
Tuscarie.

1612
01:57:30,982 --> 01:57:32,327
No need to come back up.

1613
01:57:32,829 --> 01:57:34,736
Yes, seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

1614
01:57:34,776 --> 01:57:36,622
We will now go into executive session.
