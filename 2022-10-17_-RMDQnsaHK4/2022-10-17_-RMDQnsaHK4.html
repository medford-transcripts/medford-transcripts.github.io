driver international global messenger down syndrome does not define us as people. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=3460.982s">It</a>  is a condition that makes it harder for us to learn, but with patience and persistence, we are able to contribute to our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=3469.968s">I</a>  also want to just thank member Graham and member McLaughlin for

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4104.213s">So</a>  I'd like to come to you tonight for the approval of a trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4108.256s">Every</a>  four years or so, the band applies to the Disney Performing Arts Showcase in Disney World in Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4116.22s">And</a>  we've been accepted again to perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4119.502s">It</a>  comes as part of a performance package and as well as an educational package. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4123.724s">So</a>  the students are able to participate in film scoring workshops and performer workshops where they get to work with Disney engineers <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4131.232s">and</a>  they are able to kind of hone in some skills and learn some new things about being a performer and kind of how the Disney world works. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4137.953s">Disney</a>  also has a college program that they work with a bunch of interns. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4141.434s">So</a>  they kind of get an overview of that program as well, which is kind of nice to see what some opportunities could hold for things that might be interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4148.575s">I</a>  submitted a pretty, pretty detailed packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4154.796s">Everything</a>  is kind of laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4155.716s">Are</a>  there any questions on there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4157.877s">Would</a>  you like me to talk about more? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4159.317s">What</a>  would you like me to discuss?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4160.95s">Oh,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4161.59s">Is</a>  this during April vacation?</p>

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4162.931s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4163.791s">Yeah,</a>  we leave right before our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4166.252s">It</a>  is from the 12th to the 19th.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4168.733s">Wonderful.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4169.993s">So</a>  it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4170.974s">I</a>  had a question.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4171.554s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4172.474s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4172.994s">I</a>  know that there's been some communications today about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4177.316s">And</a>  I'm just trying to, this is really, I'm hoping you can answer this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4182.298s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4184.619s">The</a>  registration form <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4187.938s">says</a>  Bennett Studios, student travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4192.181s">And</a>  so families signed that some number of months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4198.446s">And</a>  then now it's not flying, it's Amtrak. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4203.43s">And</a>  did Bennett make that unilaterally, even though there's contracts with each and every family? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4209.494s">Who</a>  made that change that instead of a four-hour flight, it's a 30-hour train ride each way?</p>

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4216.434s">Um,</a>  we, um, so, um, we looked into what we do is we put out bids for travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4223.216s">So</a>  we put in some bids for airline tickets and, um, we had budgeted a certain amount for airlines and the airline tickets came in around $1,100 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4231.377s">Um,</a>  so it could be a considerable, um, increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4234.498s">We're</a>  looking at like around a thousand, probably 800 to a thousand dollars per kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4238.319s">In</a>  addition to the package. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4240.159s">Um,</a>  the thing that's hard about traveling as an ensemble is that we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4243.993s">just</a>  traveling for vacation purposes or for fun purposes, although we will have fun, we're traveling as an ensemble. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4250.657s">So</a>  if we're missing parts of the ensemble, we're not going to proudly represent Medford as well as we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4256.881s">So</a>  if we're like, you know, you just go down there with two flutes and a drum, it's not gonna sound like if the entire band was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4262.784s">So</a>  what we did is we kind of went back to the drawing board and we looked at a few options. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4266.387s">We</a>  looked into taking a boat, we looked into taking a train, we looked into chartering our own plane, and we looked into buses, like busing down from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4274.238s">So</a>  I got bids back on all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4276.679s">And</a>  the cheapest by far option was to take Amtrak, which would be an Amtrak train leaving from Boston to New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4287.682s">And</a>  then we switch over and we go from New York to Orlando. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4291.983s">We</a>  are trying to keep the cost down as much as possible because we want to make it accessible for as many students to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4298.886s">The</a>  round trip airfare was a little over $1,100. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4303.834s">the</a>  round trip Amtrak was $282 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4307.416s">So</a>  that was a significant decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4313.1s">So</a>  what happened with that process is once we did that, I posted information on the band app. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4320.806s">We</a>  have an application that goes out to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4323.067s">I</a>  believe you're still on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4325.249s">And</a>  from there, we had a Zoom meeting this summer and I kind of presented the different options on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4330.112s">We</a>  had a few parents that were concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4332.365s">Because</a>  there had been a group that had traveled to Florida and then their flight got canceled and they were stranded at the airport for a few days so. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4339.55s">We</a>  had a bunch of things come up, we kind of addressed all those issues and we did take a vote at that at that meeting on zoom to see if people were interested in this and. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4347.572s">And</a>  they were, and the kids really excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4350.393s">After</a>  that, after we voted and kind of talked about it, I did ask for chaperones, which after you ask people, you know, to go on a train for 26 hours, I did get seven chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4361.099s">So</a>  people are willing to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4363.28s">The</a>  kids are excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4364.501s">And</a>  for right now, we do have the Southwest has not released their dates yet for April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4370.904s">They</a>  released those the 27th at the end of this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4373.665s">So</a>  we will still look into, there are still a few options. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4375.946s">We</a>  can try to get tickets to fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4377.959s">But</a>  right now, our main concern is just making it accessible for students and making it affordable so that the most, you know, more members of the band can attend.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4385.886s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4386.606s">And</a>  I have one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4388.328s">I</a>  have not been on Amtrak in a while, but I have been on Amtrak. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4394.212s">And</a>  will the students be just, will we have reserved <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4399.634s">seats</a>  and cars, or will the students just be mixed in with the public?</p>

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4404.279s">No,</a>  so we book as a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4405.74s">When</a>  you book as a group, they book all your seats together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4407.843s">So</a>  we have like a kind of a car to ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4410.465s">There</a>  are a few extra seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4411.466s">I</a>  can't imagine anyone who would want to sit in our car, but they're welcome to join. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4416.251s">And</a>  then the students are within their, like, they'll be with their chaperone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4420.596s">So</a>  they'll sit like they're adults sitting in between them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4423.756s">And</a>  then they do have, they will have the availability to go into the restaurant car where they can walk around and get, they can eat their meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4430.739s">They</a>  can go to the observation car where it's like more loungy kind of comfy furniture. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4435.522s">And</a>  they're able to kind of like, you know, take in the scenery and see all the different States will be traveling through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4440.024s">And</a>  so we're looking at a few different things to do on the, on the train, but they're, they're excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4445.786s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4446.267s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4446.627s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4447.107s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4451.769s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4452.21s">I'm</a>  just a couple more questions about the change that happened price change with the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4460.078s">The</a>  price went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4461.179s">The</a>  price went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4461.92s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4462.661s">And</a>  if there are parents out there who think that <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4468.57s">spending</a>  30 hours on the train is not doable for one reason or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4472.372s">Do</a>  they have other options? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4474.493s">I</a>  think we've gotten some feedback today from parents who are feeling like this was not.</p>

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4482.856s">Yeah,</a>  unfortunately that parent missed our meeting that we had over the summer where we discussed all this stuff with the travel agent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4488.398s">But</a>  we are able to offer a refund for anyone who at this point is unhappy with the travel change. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4495.181s">Yeah,</a>  for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4496.122s">Perfect,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4498.957s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4499.097s">Stone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4500.398s">So</a>  three of our kids are going on the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4503.519s">I</a>  will be not chaperoning for a 24-hour train ride, but if you do get Southwest, then I would like to volunteer to chaperone if you get that flight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4512.683s">So</a>  thank you, but Teague and Nevin and Rowan seem to be very excited that they think it's the Orient Express that they're going on to Florida.</p>

    <p>[Rello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4520.646s">One</a>  kid's going to wear his pajamas the whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4522.286s">He</a>  thinks it's like the Polar Express. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4523.587s">So</a>  I know they're all excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4525.148s">We</a>  don't get a lot of trains around here, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4526.448s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4528.229s">That'll</a>  be fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4529.52s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4530.501s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4533.182s">Motion</a>  to approve by Member Mustone, seconded by Member Hays.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4558.271s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4559.251s">Good</a>  evening, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4561.632s">As</a>  we discussed in our executive session, and as was announced on Friday, the district has reached a tentative agreement with the Medford Teachers Association, bringing to a conclusion 11 months of negotiations, which I know has occupied a good amount of time in this forum and many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4580.277s">I'm</a>  gonna briefly summarize the tentative agreement for you this evening, as I did in the executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4586.428s">and</a>  take your questions from a procedural standpoint for members of the community who have been following along as this process has evolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4595.692s">The</a>  tentative agreement means that the members of the teacher's bargaining unit will be asked to vote to ratify the TA. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4605.316s">It's</a>  my understanding that that's going to happen within the course of the next week, but that's certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4611.274s">incumbent</a>  upon the union to schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4614.037s">At</a>  that point, subsequent to the ratification, it will be presented again for your approval, as we did with the previous TAs that we've reached so we just go through this first slide you've seen several times and thankfully <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4631.715s">We</a>  have an increasing amount of green represented in this table. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4636.698s">You</a>  can see that the remaining, there's four remaining units, two of whom the negotiations have not commenced for different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4644.342s">And</a>  then our negotiations with the custodial bargaining unit and the security monitors are ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4652.026s">And</a>  there'll be additional meetings taking place this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4654.887s">It's</a>  my hope that we'll have an update for you on that in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4660.833s">The</a>  financial implications of the agreement that have been reached with the teachers, consistent with some of the numbers that you've, you've seen before, there'll be a 2.5% cost of living adjustment, and the three fiscal years, but of the agreement that's FY 22 which is last year that'll be retroactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4681.127s">FY</a>  23, which is the fiscal year that we are currently in and FY 24 which is the fiscal year that will begin this coming summer on July 1 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4689.459s">In</a>  addition, on the final day of the fiscal year and FY 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4696.088s">There'll</a>  be a 1% increase that will take effect in the subsequent fiscal year and FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4702.295s">And</a>  then there'll be the one time payments, which we intend to use one time funding related sources, including the answer grants of $, for each of the three years that the contract covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4717.145s">With</a>  regard to language changes, it is a relatively reform-like contract, but you can see some of the highlights that the district is very pleased with, and I think that the union joins us in, obviously they join us in support of these changes since we negotiated them, but I think that there's consensus on the part of both parties that <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4743.43s">Some</a>  of these reforms that were the product of discussions that took place over the course of the last year will position us to serve students better, which has been our objective from the beginning of the negotiation as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4757.341s">First,</a>  there's a competitive and sustainable wage increase as you know that was one of our key strategic priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4763.186s">when</a>  the negotiations, when we were setting goals back in the summer of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4766.947s">And</a>  I think that by any reasonable measure, we've achieved that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4773.169s">The</a>  most sort of real feel change that we'll be communicating out to families, I anticipate in the coming weeks, once the agreements are ratified and approved, will be a change to the elementary school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4787.992s">Wednesdays</a>  will effective <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4790.733s">No</a>  sooner than January, it's our hope, no later than late January, Wednesdays will be a traditional school day similar to how Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are, there will be scheduled at the district's discretion, some half days at the elementary level that will be used for professional development and other administrative purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4812.29s">it's</a>  sort of a work in progress as to how exactly that's going to be implemented this school year, given that the transition to the full school day Wednesdays will not occur until halfway through the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4822.438s">So</a>  we'll have some additional information for you in the coming weeks regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4827.182s">A</a>  number of the other provisions have to do with consultation requirements, depending on the composition of various classrooms, particularly at the elementary level, when there's a higher concentration of need, and making sure that we're being thoughtful and strategic about <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4842.154s">our</a>  staffing alignments and making sure that we are utilizing teacher voice for purposes of establishing class rosters. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4852.441s">It</a>  was a point that the union raised and I think that resonated with the members of the administration and the negotiating team. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4858.504s">That's</a>  something that from a practical standpoint, we as an organization can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4864.868s">And</a>  so I've said before in relation to this point that we're grateful to the MTA for raising this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4871.69s">and</a>  advocating on behalf of their members in the hope that we can improve that practice on the district's part. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4878.459s">There</a>  are some other additional targeted strategic professional development obligations some changes with respect to compensation for teachers that are picking up additional workload. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4890.208s">I</a>  would identify that as a shared interest in the part of the district in the Union. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4895.092s">Beyond</a>  the sort of obvious compensation implications institutionalizing various incentives that can lead to broader. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4902.618s">Arrays</a>  of a broader array of electives and course offerings for students is something that we see as an objective and we hope that that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4910.663s">We</a>  hope that that interest will be advanced as a result of these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4914.464s">There</a>  will be an advisory committee that will be working throughout the course of this year, as they did last year, working to develop a reformed high school student schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4924.706s">The</a>  goal having to be greater alignment between the academic and vocational sides of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4929.627s">And</a>  then through that, more equitable course offerings for students that are pursuing a chapter 74 pathway, making sure that they have <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4938.992s">an</a>  opportunity to engage in <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4941.607s">of</a>  various electives from art, music, and to other courses that we hope to develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4946.488s">It's</a>  also through a reform schedule, which is, to be clear, the reform schedule is not part of this contract, but the commitment to work on it in the life of this contract is part of this agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4958.331s">And</a>  so we'll also be working to make sure that we can develop a schedule that is more equitable from the perspective of high-need, most vulnerable populations of students who <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4969.671s">currently</a>  due to various services that they need to receive during the course of the school day, have fewer schedule options than they should, and then their peers enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4979.613s">There's</a>  also some modifications related to performance evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4984.314s">Again,</a>  another shared interest that the district and the union share, making sure that we're having a thoughtful and constructive evaluation process that improves practices and also instills accountability across the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5001.191s">In</a>  terms of what happens next, as I said, they'll be, the teachers will vote to ratify and we'll ask you to vote to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5008.552s">It's</a>  our hope that that happens before the end of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5011.413s">We</a>  are in the process now of implementing all the agreements that have been reached so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5016.874s">That</a>  means retroactive payments for bargaining units that have been without a cost of living adjustment since the beginning of FY21, excuse me, FY22, which is all the way back to July of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5030.237s">continuation</a>  of negotiations with the remaining units that I mentioned earlier, we have the two units that we still need to begin negotiations with. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5038.265s">And</a>  then beyond that, we have some. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5046.448s">discussions,</a>  deliberations that we will be engaged in, thinking back across this process and how we got to an agreement and the parts of that agreement that I think both parties can take pride in, in the hope that it serves the interests of students going forward, and hopefully some discussion and discourse about what, as an organization, we can do more effectively in the years ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5072.634s">So</a>  with that, I'm happy to take questions.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5076.581s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy member Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5079.022s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5079.582s">It</a>  may not be a good answer for this but um, when can be the units that have already settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5087.706s">Was</a>  it a week or two at this point now go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5090.167s">When</a>  could they start seeing their retro checks.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5099.065s">sooner</a>  rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5100.346s">We're</a>  working on that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5101.827s">There's</a>  a little bit of complexity when we're charging back to previous fiscal years, but we're working closely with the city on that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5111.553s">And</a>  it's my expectation that the units that we came to agreements with in September, it is my hope that before the end of the month, they will see some of that retroactive activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5123.141s">It's</a>  certainly by the end of November, but it's my hope that it'll be by the end of this month.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5126.704s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5127.124s">And</a>  just sort of a technical, is that likely to be like all of them drop at once or as they're processed one at a time?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5136.426s">I</a>  think it's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5138.286s">And</a>  part of that complexity with respect to the previous fiscal years, normally it would be separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5144.787s">In</a>  this case, where the retros are coming both from some one-time funding sources and the previous fiscal year, there's a possibility we're going to be able to do more of it at once, which would just <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5156.349s">I</a>  think is the sentiment that had been expressed by our bargaining partners is that they would appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5160.851s">And</a>  so that's what we're working on finalizing right now.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5164.093s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5165.574s">I</a>  don't expect a long delay between the two events, not simultaneous.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5170.417s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5173.718s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[lRR2dgf0NZM_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5176.68s">I</a>  didn't see any more questions, so I was going to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5178.501s">I</a>  just need the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5179.501s">Sorry,</a>  the second page.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5187.871s">Yes,</a>  I just wanted to thank my entire senior leadership team for their tireless work during the negotiation process with the MTA and to also thank the MTA for coming to the TA that we have before us which is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5207.811s">a</a>  very good agreement and I look forward to getting the results next week, but I just wanted to sincerely express my thanks for all the hard work that went in over these past 11 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5221.434s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5222.714s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edwards-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5224.795s">Number</a>  five, we have report on MCAS and MCAS alternative results 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5231.216s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5231.956s">Suzanne</a>  Galusi, assistant superintendent of academics and instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5236.65s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5236.85s">Joan</a>  Bowen, Director of Student Services, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment, and Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5248.279s">Faiza</a>  Khan, Director of Mathematics, and Mr. Rocco Sieri, Director of Science. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5254.584s">Welcome,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5256.245s">I'll</a>  turn it over to you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5259.824s">Welcome,</a>  thank you, good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee and Medford community, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5267.05s">Tonight</a>  I'm here with, I was going to mention everybody's name, but the mayor, I think kind of covered that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5274.796s">I</a>  just kind of wanted to start as like an introduction just to, I know that there's been a lot of discourse, a lot of media coverage around the 2022 MCAS results. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5285.644s">Tonight,</a>  our goal is to, <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5288.678s">review</a>  the information that the Department of Education has set out regarding the format, the scoring, as well as the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5297.863s">And</a>  then Dr. Riccadeli and I will also talk about next steps moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5302.726s">So</a>  I'm going to pass it off to Dr. Riccadeli.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5306.228s">So</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5308.87s">It's</a>  nice to see everybody tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5311.089s">So</a>  I think at this point, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5312.389s">Glusi</a>  just went over the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5315.39s">So</a>  I think that the next part is I'm going to introduce Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5318.651s">Joan</a>  Bowen to talk about the MCAS results.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5323.192s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5324.733s">So</a>  the MCAS assessment is designed to measure a student's knowledge of key concepts and skills outlined in the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5334.073s">but</a>  there are a small number of students with the most significant disabilities who are unable to take the standard MCAS test, even with accommodations, and they participate in the MCAS Alt Assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5347.221s">This</a>  is participation in the MCAS is determined annually at the student's team meeting using the decision-making tool for MCAS participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5359.608s">And</a>  I've included that link in the packet tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5363.339s">The</a>  MCAS ALT assessment consists of a portfolio of specific materials collected annually by the student and the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5372.486s">Evidence</a>  for the portfolio may include work samples, instructional data, videotapes, and other supporting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5381.972s">Every</a>  fall, the teachers are provided training through DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5387.325s">And</a>  the identified students are giving a skill survey for each strand. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5392.009s">The</a>  strands selected include ELA, there's one reading and one language. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5397.593s">In</a>  math, there's three strands. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5399.715s">And</a>  in science and technology, there's three strands. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5403.317s">Based</a>  on the results of the survey, teachers select entry points or access skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5408.561s">And</a>  then students participate in the same content areas as their grade level peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5416.63s">Once</a>  a student is identified to participate, the skill survey is completed and the special education teachers have to perform the following activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5426.536s">They</a>  set up the work folders, they select measurable outcomes and classroom assessment activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5432.799s">They</a>  complete the binder following the DESE guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5437.201s">And</a>  once it's completed, the teacher meets with the parent or guardian or caregiver, and they review the ALT assessment and the parent must sign off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5445.916s">We</a>  submitted to DESE by the deadline, which this year is March 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5450.978s">Preliminary</a>  scores are distributed in the summer, and then the results are mailed to the guardians, caregivers, when the standard MCAS scores are sent out to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5463.704s">So</a>  this year, our participation <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5467.381s">We</a>  had a total of 15 in district students participate in the MCAS alt. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5472.623s">There</a>  were four Asian students, three Hispanic, four white, and four black. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5479.105s">Six</a>  students of the 15 were identified as low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5484.301s">And</a>  then our audit district participation, we currently have 39 students in out of district, we had four students who participated in the m cast all and they were for white students and none of the students were identified as low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5501.482s">So</a>  once the DSEE receives the ALT assessment, the students are scored based on the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5509.35s">So</a>  there's the level of complexity, there's demonstration of skills and concepts, the level of independence the student has, a self-evaluation, which the student needs to reflect on their ability to self-correct, monitor and evaluate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5525.711s">looking</a>  at the identified strand, and then just their generalized performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5530.779s">So</a>  based on that, there's the four categories that students get scored on, and it's progressing, emerging, awareness, and incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5541.874s">And</a>  then the next couple of pages are just the district results. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5545.356s">So</a>  the first, these are all of our district students, and I broke it down by school and grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5552.921s">And</a>  as you can see, the third graders took ELA and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5557.404s">Fourth</a>  graders also did ELA and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5560.346s">Fifth</a>  graders participated in English, math, and science. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5566.104s">And</a>  then the next page is a continuation of our middle school, our secondary school, secondary level students in the sixth, seventh, and then we had three 10th graders who completed an ELA and math. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5581.837s">And</a>  then the last page is our out-of-district students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5585.339s">I</a>  did report that there were four students that participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5588.701s">We're</a>  still waiting for one score from an out-of-district placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5591.903s">We're</a>  hoping to get it by the end of this week, but this is the results of the out-of-district. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5597.787s">I</a>  did not list the name of the particular school because we may only have one student at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5604.552s">So</a>  these are just the students that participated in the alternate assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5609.724s">So</a>  I didn't know if anyone had any questions.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5613.468s">Member</a>  McLaughlin has a question and then member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5617.552s">Oh,</a>  member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5619.334s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5620.175s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5621.296s">Bowen</a>  for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5623.078s">I</a>  was wondering, we had a family ask, is there an option for if you want to opt out of MCAS alt?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5634.249s">I</a>  mean, there is an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5636.171s">MCAS</a>  Alt is not required for graduation, but it is, we do wanna be able to have a baseline of the students' performance so we can see it as they progress through the years taking the MCAS Alt. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5654.504s">Standard</a>  MCAS, there's an option to opt out, but it does impact the district scores.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5663.297s">what</a>  doesn't impact the district scores if they opt out? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5667.1s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5669.542s">In</a>  the standard MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5671.764s">Oh,</a>  in standard MCAS, right, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5673.365s">But</a>  in MCAS also doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5674.926s">So</a>  in other words, there are, you can opt out of MCAS all just as you could regular MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5680.871s">Anybody</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[lRR2dgf0NZM_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5682.692s">Yes,</a>  I believe so.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5684.754s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5685.694s">That's</a>  what I needed to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5687.095s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5688.156s">And</a>  thanks for the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5689.917s">Oh,</a>  you're welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5691.619s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5692.339s">Bowen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5694.523s">Somebody</a>  else taking over page nine great.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5699.534s">Okay,</a>  so with regard to context setting, so setting the context for looking at these scores and determining meaning from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5709.862s">So</a>  we are gonna look at statewide data released by the Department of Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5714.085s">Please</a>  know that the district receives its own data from the Edwin system through the security portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5720.29s">There's</a>  also data that is reported on the public Department of Education site. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5727.358s">It's</a>  important obviously to understand these achievement scores because it helps us detect where there needs to be adjustments to curriculum and instruction and in plans moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5739.667s">As</a>  we look at the MCAS test administration from 2019 to the present 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5743.489s">So</a>  just to give you a visual here, in 2019, all grades had a full test administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5755.959s">And</a>  then going back to 2020, no tests were administered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5760.642s">In</a>  2021, half tests were administered for grades three through eight, and full tests were administered for grade 10 in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5770.127s">And</a>  for 2022, for all grades, full tests were administered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5775.751s">So</a>  I think that is important in looking at historical context, because it does have implications for <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5784.79s">growth</a>  and for accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5789.402s">The</a>  Department of Ed has publicly released some information <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5793.663s">prior</a>  to the release of individual data, I should say, data for individual districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5800.626s">So</a>  according to the Department of Education, in 2022, overall math scores increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5809.249s">English</a>  language arts scores declined across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5814.271s">Of</a>  course, there is impact in the lower writing scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5818.294s">we,</a>  you know, we've worked to do with regard to getting those scores up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5822.979s">And</a>  certainly there are early literacy challenges and, you know, working to remediate those students who in those very young, in their very young years missed out on the in-person instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5837.449s">Science</a>  scores increase slightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5840.231s">When</a>  we compare these results to pre-pandemic levels, again, we have a ways to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5845.574s">We</a>  have a lot of work to do to recover learning loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5849.056s">Across</a>  the state, student absenteeism was a challenge and still, to a point, remains a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5859.023s">Moving</a>  on, more information from the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5863.484s">During</a>  the last three years of the pandemic education, access to instruction has been a barrier for some students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5872.065s">Chronic</a>  absenteeism increased in the state 138% in 2022 for students in grades three through eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5877.946s">18%</a>  of all students missed 18 or more days in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5886.808s">28%</a>  missed 18 or more days in 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5890.309s">So</a>  keeping in mind that COVID was still occurring, students and staff needed to be absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5897.811s">So</a>  that's where these high percentage, high absentee percentages come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5904.013s">Statewide</a>  students missed 1.7 school days due to COVID positive cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5910.495s">This</a>  data does not include students who missed school as close contacts and staff absences.</p>

    <p>[lRR2dgf0NZM_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5920.669s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5921.51s">Can</a>  I just ask a quick question before we move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5925.253s">How</a>  did our absenteeism compared to what happened across the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5928.615s">Like,</a>  was it more? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5929.376s">Was</a>  it less? <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5930.076s">Was</a>  it similar?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5931.538s">So</a>  it's so interesting you've asked that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5933.599s">So</a>  Kim Miles, our data analyst, is working on that data right now, which takes some time because if students were absent because of COVID positive or even close contacts, they weren't really, it's a separate accounting system because in our system, <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5950.219s">that</a>  was like, it wasn't counted as an absent necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5953.262s">So</a>  she's working on that and I'll be able to give that information to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5957.485s">It</a>  just takes some time for her to parse it out.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5960.347s">And</a>  member Graham, just to build upon what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5963.95s">Galucci</a>  was sharing, we now have a new coding for COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5969.255s">We</a>  have COVID for quarantining, COVID-Q and COVID-S. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5976.781s">But</a>  when it first came out, all of that was kind of kept confidential with the nurses of what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5985.927s">So</a>  that's also part of the unpacking of trying to see how those absences were coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=5992.751s">Because</a>  it was something that I had requested, but it's labor intensive because we used a different coding system. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=6000.796s">But</a>  definitely between quarantining more than once, potentially if you are exposed, <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=6006.739s">and</a>  possibly getting sick from COVID itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=6011.242s">There</a>  were significant absences, and just to see 1.7 million school days across the Commonwealth, that's like an unbelievable number.</p>
