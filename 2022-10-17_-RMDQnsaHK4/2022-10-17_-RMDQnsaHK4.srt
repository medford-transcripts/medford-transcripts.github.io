[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

190
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:03,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

191
01:08:04,325 --> 01:08:04,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

192
01:08:05,325 --> 01:08:07,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, say up.

193
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:12,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to approve the band trip to Disney in April 2023.

194
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:15,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss Rello, coordinator of performing arts.

195
01:08:15,832 --> 01:08:17,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get your microphone turned back on.

196
01:08:19,014 --> 01:08:20,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Press the little button with the person.

197
01:08:21,852 --> 01:08:22,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect, thank you.

198
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:27,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to come to you tonight for the approval of a trip.

199
01:08:28,256 --> 01:08:35,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Every four years or so, the band applies to the Disney Performing Arts Showcase in Disney World in Florida.

200
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been accepted again to perform.

201
01:08:39,502 --> 01:08:43,644
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes as part of a performance package and as well as an educational package.

202
01:08:43,724 --> 01:08:50,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So the students are able to participate in film scoring workshops and performer workshops where they get to work with Disney engineers

203
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:57,193
[SPEAKER_02]: and they are able to kind of hone in some skills and learn some new things about being a performer and kind of how the Disney world works.

204
01:08:57,953 --> 01:09:01,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney also has a college program that they work with a bunch of interns.

205
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:08,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of get an overview of that program as well, which is kind of nice to see what some opportunities could hold for things that might be interested in.

206
01:09:08,575 --> 01:09:12,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I submitted a pretty, pretty detailed packet.

207
01:09:14,796 --> 01:09:15,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is kind of laid out.

208
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:17,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions on there?

209
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:19,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like me to talk about more?

210
01:09:19,317 --> 01:09:20,197
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you like me to discuss?

211
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:21,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's great.

212
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this during April vacation?

213
01:09:22,931 --> 01:09:23,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

214
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:25,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we leave right before our hands.

215
01:09:26,252 --> 01:09:28,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It is from the 12th to the 19th.

216
01:09:28,733 --> 01:09:29,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

217
01:09:29,993 --> 01:09:30,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great.

218
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:31,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question.

219
01:09:31,554 --> 01:09:32,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau.

220
01:09:32,474 --> 01:09:32,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

221
01:09:32,994 --> 01:09:36,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that there's been some communications today about this.

222
01:09:37,316 --> 01:09:42,138
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just trying to, this is really, I'm hoping you can answer this question.

223
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:43,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

224
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:45,639
[SPEAKER_19]: The registration form

225
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:51,681
[SPEAKER_19]: says Bennett Studios, student travel.

226
01:09:52,181 --> 01:09:57,525
[SPEAKER_19]: And so families signed that some number of months ago.

227
01:09:58,446 --> 01:10:02,369
[SPEAKER_19]: And then now it's not flying, it's Amtrak.

228
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:09,154
[SPEAKER_19]: And did Bennett make that unilaterally, even though there's contracts with each and every family?

229
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:15,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Who made that change that instead of a four-hour flight, it's a 30-hour train ride each way?

230
01:10:16,434 --> 01:10:22,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we, um, so, um, we looked into what we do is we put out bids for travel.

231
01:10:23,216 --> 01:10:30,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put in some bids for airline tickets and, um, we had budgeted a certain amount for airlines and the airline tickets came in around $1,100 per student.

232
01:10:31,377 --> 01:10:34,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it could be a considerable, um, increase.

233
01:10:34,498 --> 01:10:37,979
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at like around a thousand, probably 800 to a thousand dollars per kid.

234
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:39,559
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to the package.

235
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the thing that's hard about traveling as an ensemble is that we're not.

236
01:10:43,993 --> 01:10:50,617
[SPEAKER_02]: just traveling for vacation purposes or for fun purposes, although we will have fun, we're traveling as an ensemble.

237
01:10:50,657 --> 01:10:56,501
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're missing parts of the ensemble, we're not going to proudly represent Medford as well as we could.

238
01:10:56,881 --> 01:11:01,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're like, you know, you just go down there with two flutes and a drum, it's not gonna sound like if the entire band was coming.

239
01:11:02,784 --> 01:11:06,346
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we kind of went back to the drawing board and we looked at a few options.

240
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:13,691
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked into taking a boat, we looked into taking a train, we looked into chartering our own plane, and we looked into buses, like busing down from Medford.

241
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:16,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got bids back on all of those.

242
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cheapest by far option was to take Amtrak, which would be an Amtrak train leaving from Boston to New York.

243
01:11:27,682 --> 01:11:30,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we switch over and we go from New York to Orlando.

244
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:37,905
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to keep the cost down as much as possible because we want to make it accessible for as many students to attend.

245
01:11:38,886 --> 01:11:40,946
[SPEAKER_02]: The round trip airfare was a little over $1,100.

246
01:11:43,834 --> 01:11:47,276
[SPEAKER_02]: the round trip Amtrak was $282 per student.

247
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:51,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a significant decrease.

248
01:11:53,100 --> 01:12:00,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened with that process is once we did that, I posted information on the band app.

249
01:12:00,806 --> 01:12:03,047
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an application that goes out to everybody.

250
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:04,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you're still on it.

251
01:12:05,249 --> 01:12:10,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, we had a Zoom meeting this summer and I kind of presented the different options on things.

252
01:12:10,112 --> 01:12:11,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a few parents that were concerned

253
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:18,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there had been a group that had traveled to Florida and then their flight got canceled and they were stranded at the airport for a few days so.

254
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:27,056
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a bunch of things come up, we kind of addressed all those issues and we did take a vote at that at that meeting on zoom to see if people were interested in this and.

255
01:12:27,572 --> 01:12:29,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were, and the kids really excited.

256
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:41,019
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, after we voted and kind of talked about it, I did ask for chaperones, which after you ask people, you know, to go on a train for 26 hours, I did get seven chaperones.

257
01:12:41,099 --> 01:12:43,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are willing to go.

258
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,120
[SPEAKER_02]: The kids are excited.

259
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:50,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And for right now, we do have the Southwest has not released their dates yet for April vacation.

260
01:12:50,904 --> 01:12:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: They released those the 27th at the end of this month.

261
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,906
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will still look into, there are still a few options.

262
01:12:55,946 --> 01:12:57,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We can try to get tickets to fly.

263
01:12:57,959 --> 01:13:05,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, our main concern is just making it accessible for students and making it affordable so that the most, you know, more members of the band can attend.

264
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:06,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you.

265
01:13:06,606 --> 01:13:08,067
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have one other question.

266
01:13:08,328 --> 01:13:13,752
[SPEAKER_19]: I have not been on Amtrak in a while, but I have been on Amtrak.

267
01:13:14,212 --> 01:13:18,556
[SPEAKER_19]: And will the students be just, will we have reserved

268
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:23,678
[SPEAKER_19]: seats and cars, or will the students just be mixed in with the public?

269
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:25,620
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so we book as a group.

270
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,742
[SPEAKER_02]: When you book as a group, they book all your seats together.

271
01:13:27,843 --> 01:13:29,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have like a kind of a car to ourselves.

272
01:13:30,465 --> 01:13:31,406
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few extra seats.

273
01:13:31,466 --> 01:13:35,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine anyone who would want to sit in our car, but they're welcome to join.

274
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the students are within their, like, they'll be with their chaperone.

275
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:42,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll sit like they're adults sitting in between them.

276
01:13:43,756 --> 01:13:49,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they do have, they will have the availability to go into the restaurant car where they can walk around and get, they can eat their meals.

277
01:13:50,739 --> 01:13:55,482
[SPEAKER_02]: They can go to the observation car where it's like more loungy kind of comfy furniture.

278
01:13:55,522 --> 01:13:59,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're able to kind of like, you know, take in the scenery and see all the different States will be traveling through.

279
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:05,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're looking at a few different things to do on the, on the train, but they're, they're excited.

280
01:14:05,786 --> 01:14:05,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

281
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:06,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

282
01:14:06,627 --> 01:14:06,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

283
01:14:07,107 --> 01:14:07,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

284
01:14:11,769 --> 01:14:12,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

285
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:19,497
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just a couple more questions about the change that happened price change with the contract.

286
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:20,659
[SPEAKER_13]: The price went down.

287
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:21,840
[SPEAKER_13]: The price went down.

288
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

289
01:14:22,661 --> 01:14:27,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there are parents out there who think that

290
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:32,312
[SPEAKER_13]: spending 30 hours on the train is not doable for one reason or another.

291
01:14:32,372 --> 01:14:33,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Do they have other options?

292
01:14:34,493 --> 01:14:40,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've gotten some feedback today from parents who are feeling like this was not.

293
01:14:42,856 --> 01:14:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unfortunately that parent missed our meeting that we had over the summer where we discussed all this stuff with the travel agent.

294
01:14:48,398 --> 01:14:54,921
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are able to offer a refund for anyone who at this point is unhappy with the travel change.

295
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:55,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.

296
01:14:56,122 --> 01:14:56,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect, thank you.

297
01:14:58,957 --> 01:14:59,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

298
01:14:59,097 --> 01:14:59,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Stone?

299
01:15:00,398 --> 01:15:02,659
[SPEAKER_14]: So three of our kids are going on the trip.

300
01:15:03,519 --> 01:15:12,162
[SPEAKER_14]: I will be not chaperoning for a 24-hour train ride, but if you do get Southwest, then I would like to volunteer to chaperone if you get that flight.

301
01:15:12,683 --> 01:15:20,606
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, but Teague and Nevin and Rowan seem to be very excited that they think it's the Orient Express that they're going on to Florida.

302
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,266
[SPEAKER_02]: One kid's going to wear his pajamas the whole time.

303
01:15:22,286 --> 01:15:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: He thinks it's like the Polar Express.

304
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:24,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know they're all excited.

305
01:15:25,148 --> 01:15:26,428
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get a lot of trains around here, I guess.

306
01:15:26,448 --> 01:15:26,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

307
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:28,609
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be fun.

308
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

309
01:15:30,501 --> 01:15:32,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion for approval?

310
01:15:33,182 --> 01:15:36,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve by Member Mustone, seconded by Member Hays.

311
01:15:36,384 --> 01:15:37,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

312
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:39,506
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

313
01:15:40,047 --> 01:15:40,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

314
01:15:41,488 --> 01:15:41,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

315
01:15:42,628 --> 01:15:43,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes unanimously.

316
01:15:44,109 --> 01:15:44,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

317
01:15:44,549 --> 01:15:46,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

318
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:49,973
[SPEAKER_09]: We have number four report on labor relations.

319
01:15:50,033 --> 01:15:53,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. David Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

320
01:15:58,271 --> 01:15:58,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mayor.

321
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:00,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, members of the school committee.

322
01:16:01,632 --> 01:16:19,237
[SPEAKER_01]: As we discussed in our executive session, and as was announced on Friday, the district has reached a tentative agreement with the Medford Teachers Association, bringing to a conclusion 11 months of negotiations, which I know has occupied a good amount of time in this forum and many others.

323
01:16:20,277 --> 01:16:25,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna briefly summarize the tentative agreement for you this evening, as I did in the executive session.

324
01:16:26,428 --> 01:16:34,752
[SPEAKER_01]: and take your questions from a procedural standpoint for members of the community who have been following along as this process has evolved.

325
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:44,456
[SPEAKER_01]: The tentative agreement means that the members of the teacher's bargaining unit will be asked to vote to ratify the TA.

326
01:16:45,316 --> 01:16:48,937
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my understanding that that's going to happen within the course of the next week, but that's certainly

327
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,056
[SPEAKER_01]: incumbent upon the union to schedule.

328
01:16:54,037 --> 01:17:08,989
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, subsequent to the ratification, it will be presented again for your approval, as we did with the previous TAs that we've reached so we just go through this first slide you've seen several times and thankfully

329
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:15,757
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an increasing amount of green represented in this table.

330
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:23,601
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the remaining, there's four remaining units, two of whom the negotiations have not commenced for different reasons.

331
01:17:24,342 --> 01:17:30,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our negotiations with the custodial bargaining unit and the security monitors are ongoing.

332
01:17:32,026 --> 01:17:34,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be additional meetings taking place this week.

333
01:17:34,887 --> 01:17:39,490
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my hope that we'll have an update for you on that in the near future.

334
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:59,846
[SPEAKER_01]: The financial implications of the agreement that have been reached with the teachers, consistent with some of the numbers that you've, you've seen before, there'll be a 2.5% cost of living adjustment, and the three fiscal years, but of the agreement that's FY 22 which is last year that'll be retroactive.

335
01:18:01,127 --> 01:18:09,299
[SPEAKER_01]: FY 23, which is the fiscal year that we are currently in and FY 24 which is the fiscal year that will begin this coming summer on July 1 2023.

336
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:11,462
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, on the final day of the fiscal year and FY 24.

337
01:18:16,088 --> 01:18:21,715
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a 1% increase that will take effect in the subsequent fiscal year and FY 25.

338
01:18:22,295 --> 01:18:34,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'll be the one time payments, which we intend to use one time funding related sources, including the answer grants of $, for each of the three years that the contract covers.

339
01:18:37,145 --> 01:19:02,511
[SPEAKER_01]: With regard to language changes, it is a relatively reform-like contract, but you can see some of the highlights that the district is very pleased with, and I think that the union joins us in, obviously they join us in support of these changes since we negotiated them, but I think that there's consensus on the part of both parties that

340
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:16,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these reforms that were the product of discussions that took place over the course of the last year will position us to serve students better, which has been our objective from the beginning of the negotiation as you know.

341
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:22,666
[SPEAKER_01]: First, there's a competitive and sustainable wage increase as you know that was one of our key strategic priorities.

342
01:19:23,186 --> 01:19:26,587
[SPEAKER_01]: when the negotiations, when we were setting goals back in the summer of 2021.

343
01:19:26,947 --> 01:19:31,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that by any reasonable measure, we've achieved that.

344
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:47,072
[SPEAKER_01]: The most sort of real feel change that we'll be communicating out to families, I anticipate in the coming weeks, once the agreements are ratified and approved, will be a change to the elementary school day.

345
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesdays will effective

346
01:19:50,733 --> 01:20:10,501
[SPEAKER_01]: No sooner than January, it's our hope, no later than late January, Wednesdays will be a traditional school day similar to how Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are, there will be scheduled at the district's discretion, some half days at the elementary level that will be used for professional development and other administrative purposes.

347
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:21,758
[SPEAKER_01]: it's sort of a work in progress as to how exactly that's going to be implemented this school year, given that the transition to the full school day Wednesdays will not occur until halfway through the school year.

348
01:20:22,438 --> 01:20:26,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have some additional information for you in the coming weeks regarding that.

349
01:20:27,182 --> 01:20:41,674
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of the other provisions have to do with consultation requirements, depending on the composition of various classrooms, particularly at the elementary level, when there's a higher concentration of need, and making sure that we're being thoughtful and strategic about

350
01:20:42,154 --> 01:20:51,620
[SPEAKER_01]: our staffing alignments and making sure that we are utilizing teacher voice for purposes of establishing class rosters.

351
01:20:52,441 --> 01:20:58,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a point that the union raised and I think that resonated with the members of the administration and the negotiating team.

352
01:20:58,504 --> 01:21:04,008
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that from a practical standpoint, we as an organization can do better.

353
01:21:04,868 --> 01:21:10,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've said before in relation to this point that we're grateful to the MTA for raising this issue.

354
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:17,364
[SPEAKER_01]: and advocating on behalf of their members in the hope that we can improve that practice on the district's part.

355
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:28,927
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some other additional targeted strategic professional development obligations some changes with respect to compensation for teachers that are picking up additional workload.

356
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:33,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I would identify that as a shared interest in the part of the district in the Union.

357
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:42,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond the sort of obvious compensation implications institutionalizing various incentives that can lead to broader.

358
01:21:42,618 --> 01:21:50,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Arrays of a broader array of electives and course offerings for students is something that we see as an objective and we hope that that.

359
01:21:50,663 --> 01:21:53,464
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that that interest will be advanced as a result of these changes.

360
01:21:54,464 --> 01:22:03,926
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be an advisory committee that will be working throughout the course of this year, as they did last year, working to develop a reformed high school student schedule.

361
01:22:04,706 --> 01:22:08,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal having to be greater alignment between the academic and vocational sides of the school.

362
01:22:09,627 --> 01:22:17,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through that, more equitable course offerings for students that are pursuing a chapter 74 pathway, making sure that they have

363
01:22:18,992 --> 01:22:20,281
[SPEAKER_01]: an opportunity to engage in

364
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:25,708
[SPEAKER_01]: of various electives from art, music, and to other courses that we hope to develop.

365
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:37,831
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also through a reform schedule, which is, to be clear, the reform schedule is not part of this contract, but the commitment to work on it in the life of this contract is part of this agreement.

366
01:22:38,331 --> 01:22:48,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll also be working to make sure that we can develop a schedule that is more equitable from the perspective of high-need, most vulnerable populations of students who

367
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:59,593
[SPEAKER_01]: currently due to various services that they need to receive during the course of the school day, have fewer schedule options than they should, and then their peers enjoy.

368
01:22:59,613 --> 01:23:03,674
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some modifications related to performance evaluation.

369
01:23:04,314 --> 01:23:19,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, another shared interest that the district and the union share, making sure that we're having a thoughtful and constructive evaluation process that improves practices and also instills accountability across the organization.

370
01:23:21,191 --> 01:23:27,572
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of what happens next, as I said, they'll be, the teachers will vote to ratify and we'll ask you to vote to approve.

371
01:23:28,552 --> 01:23:30,553
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our hope that that happens before the end of the month.

372
01:23:31,413 --> 01:23:35,794
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the process now of implementing all the agreements that have been reached so far.

373
01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:48,096
[SPEAKER_01]: That means retroactive payments for bargaining units that have been without a cost of living adjustment since the beginning of FY21, excuse me, FY22, which is all the way back to July of 2021.

374
01:23:50,237 --> 01:23:57,464
[SPEAKER_01]: continuation of negotiations with the remaining units that I mentioned earlier, we have the two units that we still need to begin negotiations with.

375
01:23:58,265 --> 01:24:04,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And then beyond that, we have some.

376
01:24:06,448 --> 01:24:32,334
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions, deliberations that we will be engaged in, thinking back across this process and how we got to an agreement and the parts of that agreement that I think both parties can take pride in, in the hope that it serves the interests of students going forward, and hopefully some discussion and discourse about what, as an organization, we can do more effectively in the years ahead.

377
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'm happy to take questions.

378
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:38,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy member Rousseau.

379
01:24:39,022 --> 01:24:39,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

380
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:46,906
[SPEAKER_19]: It may not be a good answer for this but um, when can be the units that have already settled.

381
01:24:47,706 --> 01:24:49,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Was it a week or two at this point now go.

382
01:24:50,167 --> 01:24:53,309
[SPEAKER_19]: When could they start seeing their retro checks.

383
01:24:59,065 --> 01:25:00,326
[SPEAKER_01]: sooner rather than later.

384
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:01,807
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on that right now.

385
01:25:01,827 --> 01:25:11,453
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of complexity when we're charging back to previous fiscal years, but we're working closely with the city on that right now.

386
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:22,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my expectation that the units that we came to agreements with in September, it is my hope that before the end of the month, they will see some of that retroactive activity.

387
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:26,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly by the end of November, but it's my hope that it'll be by the end of this month.

388
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:27,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

389
01:25:27,124 --> 01:25:35,706
[SPEAKER_19]: And just sort of a technical, is that likely to be like all of them drop at once or as they're processed one at a time?

390
01:25:36,426 --> 01:25:37,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good question.

391
01:25:38,286 --> 01:25:44,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that complexity with respect to the previous fiscal years, normally it would be separate.

392
01:25:44,787 --> 01:25:55,069
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, where the retros are coming both from some one-time funding sources and the previous fiscal year, there's a possibility we're going to be able to do more of it at once, which would just

393
01:25:56,349 --> 01:26:00,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is the sentiment that had been expressed by our bargaining partners is that they would appreciate that.

394
01:26:00,851 --> 01:26:03,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we're working on finalizing right now.

395
01:26:04,093 --> 01:26:04,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

396
01:26:05,574 --> 01:26:08,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect a long delay between the two events, not simultaneous.

397
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:11,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

398
01:26:11,717 --> 01:26:11,997
Thank you.

399
01:26:13,718 --> 01:26:13,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

400
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see any more questions, so I was going to move on.

401
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:19,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I just need the agenda.

402
01:26:19,501 --> 01:26:20,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, the second page.

403
01:26:27,871 --> 01:26:46,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I just wanted to thank my entire senior leadership team for their tireless work during the negotiation process with the MTA and to also thank the MTA for coming to the TA that we have before us which is.

404
01:26:47,811 --> 01:27:00,834
[SPEAKER_17]: a very good agreement and I look forward to getting the results next week, but I just wanted to sincerely express my thanks for all the hard work that went in over these past 11 months.

405
01:27:01,434 --> 01:27:01,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

406
01:27:02,714 --> 01:27:03,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Edwards-Vincent.

407
01:27:04,795 --> 01:27:11,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Number five, we have report on MCAS and MCAS alternative results 2022.

408
01:27:11,216 --> 01:27:11,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

409
01:27:11,956 --> 01:27:16,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Suzanne Galusi, assistant superintendent of academics and instruction.

410
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:16,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

411
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:28,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment, and Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities, and Ms.

412
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:34,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Faiza Khan, Director of Mathematics, and Mr. Rocco Sieri, Director of Science.

413
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:35,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, everybody.

414
01:27:36,245 --> 01:27:37,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn it over to you.

415
01:27:39,824 --> 01:27:46,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, thank you, good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee and Medford community, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

416
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:53,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight I'm here with, I was going to mention everybody's name, but the mayor, I think kind of covered that.

417
01:27:54,796 --> 01:28:05,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of wanted to start as like an introduction just to, I know that there's been a lot of discourse, a lot of media coverage around the 2022 MCAS results.

418
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:07,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, our goal is to,

419
01:28:08,678 --> 01:28:17,083
[SPEAKER_07]: review the information that the Department of Education has set out regarding the format, the scoring, as well as the results.

420
01:28:17,863 --> 01:28:21,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Dr. Riccadeli and I will also talk about next steps moving forward.

421
01:28:22,726 --> 01:28:25,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to pass it off to Dr. Riccadeli.

422
01:28:26,228 --> 01:28:28,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So good evening.

423
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see everybody tonight.

424
01:28:31,089 --> 01:28:32,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think at this point, Ms.

425
01:28:32,389 --> 01:28:34,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Glusi just went over the agenda.

426
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:38,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that the next part is I'm going to introduce Ms.

427
01:28:38,651 --> 01:28:42,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan Bowen to talk about the MCAS results.

428
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:43,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

429
01:28:44,733 --> 01:28:53,535
[SPEAKER_21]: So the MCAS assessment is designed to measure a student's knowledge of key concepts and skills outlined in the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

430
01:28:54,073 --> 01:29:06,440
[SPEAKER_21]: but there are a small number of students with the most significant disabilities who are unable to take the standard MCAS test, even with accommodations, and they participate in the MCAS Alt Assessment.

431
01:29:07,221 --> 01:29:19,268
[SPEAKER_21]: This is participation in the MCAS is determined annually at the student's team meeting using the decision-making tool for MCAS participation.

432
01:29:19,608 --> 01:29:22,110
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've included that link in the packet tonight.

433
01:29:23,339 --> 01:29:31,705
[SPEAKER_21]: The MCAS ALT assessment consists of a portfolio of specific materials collected annually by the student and the teacher.

434
01:29:32,486 --> 01:29:39,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Evidence for the portfolio may include work samples, instructional data, videotapes, and other supporting information.

435
01:29:41,972 --> 01:29:46,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Every fall, the teachers are provided training through DESE.

436
01:29:47,325 --> 01:29:51,268
[SPEAKER_21]: And the identified students are giving a skill survey for each strand.

437
01:29:52,009 --> 01:29:56,852
[SPEAKER_21]: The strands selected include ELA, there's one reading and one language.

438
01:29:57,593 --> 01:29:59,254
[SPEAKER_21]: In math, there's three strands.

439
01:29:59,715 --> 01:30:02,517
[SPEAKER_21]: And in science and technology, there's three strands.

440
01:30:03,317 --> 01:30:07,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Based on the results of the survey, teachers select entry points or access skills.

441
01:30:08,561 --> 01:30:13,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And then students participate in the same content areas as their grade level peers.

442
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:25,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Once a student is identified to participate, the skill survey is completed and the special education teachers have to perform the following activities.

443
01:30:26,536 --> 01:30:32,159
[SPEAKER_21]: They set up the work folders, they select measurable outcomes and classroom assessment activities.

444
01:30:32,799 --> 01:30:36,541
[SPEAKER_21]: They complete the binder following the DESE guidelines.

445
01:30:37,201 --> 01:30:45,206
[SPEAKER_21]: And once it's completed, the teacher meets with the parent or guardian or caregiver, and they review the ALT assessment and the parent must sign off on it.

446
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:50,138
[SPEAKER_21]: We submitted to DESE by the deadline, which this year is March 31st.

447
01:30:50,978 --> 01:31:02,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Preliminary scores are distributed in the summer, and then the results are mailed to the guardians, caregivers, when the standard MCAS scores are sent out to everyone.

448
01:31:03,704 --> 01:31:06,825
[SPEAKER_21]: So this year, our participation

449
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:11,782
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a total of 15 in district students participate in the MCAS alt.

450
01:31:12,623 --> 01:31:17,464
[SPEAKER_21]: There were four Asian students, three Hispanic, four white, and four black.

451
01:31:19,105 --> 01:31:23,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Six students of the 15 were identified as low income.

452
01:31:24,301 --> 01:31:39,248
[SPEAKER_21]: And then our audit district participation, we currently have 39 students in out of district, we had four students who participated in the m cast all and they were for white students and none of the students were identified as low income.

453
01:31:41,482 --> 01:31:49,209
[SPEAKER_21]: So once the DSEE receives the ALT assessment, the students are scored based on the following.

454
01:31:49,350 --> 01:32:05,165
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's the level of complexity, there's demonstration of skills and concepts, the level of independence the student has, a self-evaluation, which the student needs to reflect on their ability to self-correct, monitor and evaluate.

455
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:10,278
[SPEAKER_21]: looking at the identified strand, and then just their generalized performance.

456
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:19,954
[SPEAKER_21]: So based on that, there's the four categories that students get scored on, and it's progressing, emerging, awareness, and incomplete.

457
01:32:21,874 --> 01:32:25,296
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the next couple of pages are just the district results.

458
01:32:25,356 --> 01:32:32,401
[SPEAKER_21]: So the first, these are all of our district students, and I broke it down by school and grade level.

459
01:32:32,921 --> 01:32:36,584
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you can see, the third graders took ELA and math.

460
01:32:37,404 --> 01:32:39,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Fourth graders also did ELA and math.

461
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:44,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Fifth graders participated in English, math, and science.

462
01:32:46,104 --> 01:33:00,056
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the next page is a continuation of our middle school, our secondary school, secondary level students in the sixth, seventh, and then we had three 10th graders who completed an ELA and math.

463
01:33:01,837 --> 01:33:04,879
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the last page is our out-of-district students.

464
01:33:05,339 --> 01:33:08,641
[SPEAKER_21]: I did report that there were four students that participated.

465
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:11,883
[SPEAKER_21]: We're still waiting for one score from an out-of-district placement.

466
01:33:11,903 --> 01:33:17,667
[SPEAKER_21]: We're hoping to get it by the end of this week, but this is the results of the out-of-district.

467
01:33:17,787 --> 01:33:24,251
[SPEAKER_21]: I did not list the name of the particular school because we may only have one student at that school.

468
01:33:24,552 --> 01:33:28,194
[SPEAKER_21]: So these are just the students that participated in the alternate assessment.

469
01:33:29,724 --> 01:33:31,686
[SPEAKER_21]: So I didn't know if anyone had any questions.

470
01:33:33,468 --> 01:33:37,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin has a question and then member Ruseau.

471
01:33:37,552 --> 01:33:38,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, member McLaughlin.

472
01:33:39,334 --> 01:33:40,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

473
01:33:40,175 --> 01:33:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

474
01:33:41,296 --> 01:33:42,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowen for the presentation.

475
01:33:43,078 --> 01:33:51,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering, we had a family ask, is there an option for if you want to opt out of MCAS alt?

476
01:33:54,249 --> 01:33:55,570
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there is an option.

477
01:33:56,171 --> 01:34:12,723
[SPEAKER_21]: MCAS Alt is not required for graduation, but it is, we do wanna be able to have a baseline of the students' performance so we can see it as they progress through the years taking the MCAS Alt.

478
01:34:14,504 --> 01:34:20,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Standard MCAS, there's an option to opt out, but it does impact the district scores.

479
01:34:23,297 --> 01:34:26,179
[SPEAKER_06]: what doesn't impact the district scores if they opt out?

480
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:27,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

481
01:34:29,542 --> 01:34:30,763
[SPEAKER_06]: In the standard MCAS.

482
01:34:31,764 --> 01:34:33,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, in standard MCAS, right, right.

483
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:34,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But in MCAS also doesn't.

484
01:34:34,926 --> 01:34:40,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, there are, you can opt out of MCAS all just as you could regular MCAS.

485
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:41,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody can do that.

486
01:34:42,692 --> 01:34:43,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I believe so.

487
01:34:44,754 --> 01:34:45,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

488
01:34:45,694 --> 01:34:47,075
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I needed to answer.

489
01:34:47,095 --> 01:34:47,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

490
01:34:48,156 --> 01:34:49,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for the presentation.

491
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:50,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're welcome.

492
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:52,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

493
01:34:52,339 --> 01:34:52,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowen.

494
01:34:54,523 --> 01:34:56,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody else taking over page nine great.

495
01:34:59,534 --> 01:35:08,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so with regard to context setting, so setting the context for looking at these scores and determining meaning from them.

496
01:35:09,862 --> 01:35:13,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are gonna look at statewide data released by the Department of Ed.

497
01:35:14,085 --> 01:35:19,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Please know that the district receives its own data from the Edwin system through the security portal.

498
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:23,812
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also data that is reported on the public Department of Education site.

499
01:35:27,358 --> 01:35:38,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important obviously to understand these achievement scores because it helps us detect where there needs to be adjustments to curriculum and instruction and in plans moving forward.

500
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:43,449
[SPEAKER_04]: As we look at the MCAS test administration from 2019 to the present 2022.

501
01:35:43,489 --> 01:35:47,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to give you a visual here, in 2019, all grades had a full test administration.

502
01:35:55,959 --> 01:36:00,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And then going back to 2020, no tests were administered.

503
01:36:00,642 --> 01:36:09,187
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2021, half tests were administered for grades three through eight, and full tests were administered for grade 10 in 2021.

504
01:36:10,127 --> 01:36:14,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And for 2022, for all grades, full tests were administered.

505
01:36:15,751 --> 01:36:21,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that is important in looking at historical context, because it does have implications for

506
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:27,237
[SPEAKER_04]: growth and for accountability.

507
01:36:29,402 --> 01:36:32,430
[SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Ed has publicly released some information

508
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:40,006
[SPEAKER_04]: prior to the release of individual data, I should say, data for individual districts.

509
01:36:40,626 --> 01:36:48,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So according to the Department of Education, in 2022, overall math scores increased.

510
01:36:49,249 --> 01:36:53,771
[SPEAKER_04]: English language arts scores declined across the state.

511
01:36:54,271 --> 01:36:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there is impact in the lower writing scores.

512
01:36:58,294 --> 01:37:02,078
[SPEAKER_04]: we, you know, we've worked to do with regard to getting those scores up.

513
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:16,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly there are early literacy challenges and, you know, working to remediate those students who in those very young, in their very young years missed out on the in-person instruction.

514
01:37:17,449 --> 01:37:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Science scores increase slightly.

515
01:37:20,231 --> 01:37:25,554
[SPEAKER_04]: When we compare these results to pre-pandemic levels, again, we have a ways to go.

516
01:37:25,574 --> 01:37:28,376
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of work to do to recover learning loss.

517
01:37:29,056 --> 01:37:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Across the state, student absenteeism was a challenge and still, to a point, remains a challenge.

518
01:37:39,023 --> 01:37:42,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, more information from the Department of Education.

519
01:37:43,484 --> 01:37:50,905
[SPEAKER_04]: During the last three years of the pandemic education, access to instruction has been a barrier for some students.

520
01:37:52,065 --> 01:37:57,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Chronic absenteeism increased in the state 138% in 2022 for students in grades three through eight.

521
01:37:57,946 --> 01:38:00,247
[SPEAKER_04]: 18% of all students missed 18 or more days in 2021.

522
01:38:06,808 --> 01:38:09,849
[SPEAKER_04]: 28% missed 18 or more days in 2022.

523
01:38:10,309 --> 01:38:17,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So keeping in mind that COVID was still occurring, students and staff needed to be absent.

524
01:38:17,811 --> 01:38:22,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where these high percentage, high absentee percentages come in.

525
01:38:24,013 --> 01:38:28,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Statewide students missed 1.7 school days due to COVID positive cases.

526
01:38:30,495 --> 01:38:34,996
[SPEAKER_04]: This data does not include students who missed school as close contacts and staff absences.

527
01:38:40,669 --> 01:38:41,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

528
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:44,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I just ask a quick question before we move on?

529
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:48,375
[SPEAKER_13]: How did our absenteeism compared to what happened across the state?

530
01:38:48,615 --> 01:38:49,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, was it more?

531
01:38:49,376 --> 01:38:49,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it less?

532
01:38:50,076 --> 01:38:51,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it similar?

533
01:38:51,538 --> 01:38:53,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's so interesting you've asked that question.

534
01:38:53,599 --> 01:39:09,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So Kim Miles, our data analyst, is working on that data right now, which takes some time because if students were absent because of COVID positive or even close contacts, they weren't really, it's a separate accounting system because in our system,

535
01:39:10,219 --> 01:39:13,161
[SPEAKER_07]: that was like, it wasn't counted as an absent necessarily.

536
01:39:13,262 --> 01:39:17,385
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's working on that and I'll be able to give that information to the district.

537
01:39:17,485 --> 01:39:20,167
[SPEAKER_07]: It just takes some time for her to parse it out.

538
01:39:20,347 --> 01:39:23,930
[SPEAKER_17]: And member Graham, just to build upon what Ms.

539
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:28,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Galucci was sharing, we now have a new coding for COVID.

540
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:35,940
[SPEAKER_17]: We have COVID for quarantining, COVID-Q and COVID-S.

541
01:39:36,781 --> 01:39:45,827
[SPEAKER_17]: But when it first came out, all of that was kind of kept confidential with the nurses of what was going on.

542
01:39:45,927 --> 01:39:52,731
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's also part of the unpacking of trying to see how those absences were coded.

543
01:39:52,751 --> 01:39:59,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it was something that I had requested, but it's labor intensive because we used a different coding system.

544
01:40:00,796 --> 01:40:06,019
[SPEAKER_17]: But definitely between quarantining more than once, potentially if you are exposed,

545
01:40:06,739 --> 01:40:09,121
[SPEAKER_17]: and possibly getting sick from COVID itself.

546
01:40:11,242 --> 01:40:20,568
[SPEAKER_17]: There were significant absences, and just to see 1.7 million school days across the Commonwealth, that's like an unbelievable number.

547
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:22,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was just for COVID positive.

548
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:25,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's unbelievable.

549
01:40:26,732 --> 01:40:27,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor?

550
01:40:28,033 --> 01:40:28,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

551
01:40:29,134 --> 01:40:29,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

552
01:40:29,494 --> 01:40:32,236
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to beat this dead horse too much, but the state's 138%.

553
01:40:35,626 --> 01:40:37,747
[SPEAKER_19]: That's inclusive of COVID.

554
01:40:38,347 --> 01:40:39,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct, correct.

555
01:40:39,507 --> 01:40:44,168
[SPEAKER_19]: So we will get the numbers once the pain of figuring it all out is done.

556
01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:46,129
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the COVID ones?

557
01:40:46,149 --> 01:40:47,049
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the total?

558
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:47,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

559
01:40:48,369 --> 01:41:04,314
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I would just wonder a bit about, I don't remember exactly when it happened, but reporting a positive COVID for your kid has always been a little, I believe that,

560
01:41:06,616 --> 01:41:17,906
[SPEAKER_19]: science has updated that on the website to make it possible, but when one of my kids was positive, I went to the website and I sat through

561
01:41:19,301 --> 01:41:21,503
[SPEAKER_19]: many meetings where we were told how all this worked.

562
01:41:22,023 --> 01:41:25,486
[SPEAKER_19]: But of course, until you have to do it, you don't memorize it exactly.

563
01:41:25,946 --> 01:41:30,789
[SPEAKER_19]: I went to our website in May, and I could not figure out how to report that my daughter had COVID.

564
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:35,593
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, she hadn't missed much school.

565
01:41:35,653 --> 01:41:37,214
[SPEAKER_19]: I could have just been like, whatever.

566
01:41:37,834 --> 01:41:47,021
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just do want to make sure that the 2022, which is the one that ended in June, that it

567
01:41:47,837 --> 01:41:56,440
[SPEAKER_19]: The caveats around that are gonna be pretty substantial because I'm sure that lots of people did not report it.

568
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:02,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, which is why it's taking Ms.

569
01:42:02,121 --> 01:42:08,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Miles a little bit of time because there was some of that just to coordinate as well with Avery Hines.

570
01:42:08,683 --> 01:42:16,786
[SPEAKER_19]: So the regular absence system wouldn't even show a student who was COVID positive.

571
01:42:17,176 --> 01:42:21,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct, but it also would show students who are positive but told nobody.

572
01:42:22,961 --> 01:42:30,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct, and they wouldn't be in the positive pool either so I guess I'm just kind of questioning how much effort is involved is it worth that I guess is sort of my.

573
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:42,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the curriculum directors will report later the percentage in terms of how many students per grade level participated in the MCAS scores, in the MCAS tests, which is very high.

574
01:42:42,647 --> 01:42:49,210
[SPEAKER_07]: We just wanted to have that additional data as a counter to this for how it impact, what the impact was in Medford.

575
01:42:50,551 --> 01:42:52,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just gonna take some time to get that information.

576
01:42:55,614 --> 01:43:00,617
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a great segue to talk about the chronic absenteeism due to the pandemic.

577
01:43:00,953 --> 01:43:02,534
[SPEAKER_07]: to talk about student growth percentile.

578
01:43:04,454 --> 01:43:23,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So typically when the Department of Education through MCAS determines student growth percentile, it's based on two years of data where like that first year is worth 40%, that second year is worth 60% and a percentile is determined.

579
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:32,414
[SPEAKER_07]: The difficulty now is that there's been this break and there hasn't really been a formal way to do that.

580
01:43:33,334 --> 01:43:47,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So what the Department of Education is trying to encourage is that this last year's 2022 serves as the new baseline in which we move forward in terms of achievement and accountability.

581
01:43:48,762 --> 01:43:51,703
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are using the same recording

582
01:43:52,239 --> 01:44:06,006
[SPEAKER_07]: as you can see here, as they used last year, which we have in bold that for parents at home, when reports come home, which they were mailed out last week, so I'm sure they probably maybe came over the weekend.

583
01:44:06,786 --> 01:44:11,848
[SPEAKER_07]: The typical growth range is still 40 to 59 percentage points.

584
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:15,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

585
01:44:18,459 --> 01:44:21,060
[SPEAKER_19]: just mentioned it, that's what I'm going to ask.

586
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,320
[SPEAKER_19]: We mail them to families?

587
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:23,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

588
01:44:23,581 --> 01:44:27,942
[SPEAKER_19]: So who mails it to a family for a student who's now at a district?

589
01:44:28,062 --> 01:44:31,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Because would we be mailing it still?

590
01:44:32,203 --> 01:44:32,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

591
01:44:33,164 --> 01:44:33,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

592
01:44:34,344 --> 01:44:35,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Have they all gone out?

593
01:44:35,745 --> 01:44:37,145
[SPEAKER_07]: They went out on Friday.

594
01:44:37,165 --> 01:44:38,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it's only Monday.

595
01:44:38,525 --> 01:44:39,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

596
01:44:39,826 --> 01:44:40,266
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

597
01:44:42,429 --> 01:44:42,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

598
01:44:42,749 --> 01:44:58,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of the other going from, from the student growth percentile, typically the MCAS results, there's an accountability piece that isn't applicable due to the disruption of data.

599
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:02,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So there will be no overall district accountability determination.

600
01:45:02,747 --> 01:45:07,952
[SPEAKER_07]: What they're doing is just continuing the determination that districts have had in the past.

601
01:45:08,473 --> 01:45:08,753
[SPEAKER_07]: We have

602
01:45:09,628 --> 01:45:13,910
[SPEAKER_07]: not been, so those underperforming districts, that will continue.

603
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:17,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And districts that aren't, we're still held harmless for that.

604
01:45:18,631 --> 01:45:21,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the Department of Education has not set targets.

605
01:45:21,753 --> 01:45:30,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Typically for MCAS, there's a target that the Department of Education will set for each school and for each district that they want them to meet.

606
01:45:31,156 --> 01:45:33,457
[SPEAKER_07]: They have not done that due to the pandemic.

607
01:45:33,837 --> 01:45:36,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore, there's no progress towards any targets.

608
01:45:36,958 --> 01:45:37,419
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no,

609
01:45:39,051 --> 01:45:42,914
[SPEAKER_07]: new accountability for this year's scores.

610
01:45:45,956 --> 01:45:49,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so moving on to the next slide comparable districts.

611
01:45:49,799 --> 01:45:56,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in the past we've used Dart, which is a it's a tool that the Department of Education puts out.

612
01:45:58,396 --> 01:46:06,844
[SPEAKER_04]: in which districts that are similar in demographics and other features are compared to our own district.

613
01:46:07,625 --> 01:46:10,107
[SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Ed has not put out a 2022 DART

614
01:46:12,689 --> 01:46:13,669
[SPEAKER_04]: listing yet.

615
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:21,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we did was we went in and we looked at what the comparable dark districts were for last year and the previous year.

616
01:46:22,392 --> 01:46:24,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And we used those communities.

617
01:46:24,953 --> 01:46:29,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see in yellow where Medford is compared to the other districts.

618
01:46:29,475 --> 01:46:39,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So we used to compare, we compared Medford to Methuen, Peabody, Quincy, Somerville, Weymouth, and Woburn, which again have their basis in what the Department of Ed has

619
01:46:39,787 --> 01:46:41,669
[SPEAKER_04]: used as comparison sources before.

620
01:46:42,209 --> 01:46:52,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see where there are percentages in which Medford is higher, and there are percentages for achievement, where it is lower.

621
01:46:53,179 --> 01:46:59,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first, the first column we have English language arts that's grades three through eight.

622
01:47:00,485 --> 01:47:08,008
[SPEAKER_04]: If they chunk it those those grades three through eight are together for English and then we have math grades three through eight.

623
01:47:08,628 --> 01:47:20,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have ELA math and science, technology and engineering for grade 10 then the next chunk is grades five and eight for science, technology and engineering.

624
01:47:20,495 --> 01:47:25,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the MCAS percentages of meeting or exceeding expectations.

625
01:47:26,418 --> 01:47:30,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving over to the right-hand columns, we have the growth.

626
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:33,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you remember back to the last slide that Ms.

627
01:47:33,662 --> 01:47:41,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Pelosi showed, or maybe it was two slides ago, in which she talked about typical growth, typical growth is 40 to 59.

628
01:47:42,546 --> 01:47:46,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see that our scores are between the 40 and 59.

629
01:47:47,972 --> 01:47:48,512
[SPEAKER_04]: and 59.

630
01:47:48,853 --> 01:47:53,255
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're well within that typical growth.

631
01:47:56,137 --> 01:48:06,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this, I'm not going to go over every number here unless someone had a question, but you can just see comparatively how Medford rated compared to some other communities.

632
01:48:07,915 --> 01:48:13,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So unless there are any other questions for that, at this point, we're going to segue over to the individual subjects.

633
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:16,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to start with science.

634
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:24,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we will ask you to do, if at all possible, is to hold your questions until the end of the science section.

635
01:48:24,424 --> 01:48:29,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, at the end of the math section, the end of the ELA section.

636
01:48:30,087 --> 01:48:36,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, Rocco Sieri will discuss the MCAS science, technology, and engineering results.

637
01:48:41,271 --> 01:48:45,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, superintendent and school committee members.

638
01:48:46,481 --> 01:48:50,248
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice to be in person, be able to see you all face to face.

639
01:48:53,097 --> 01:48:59,422
[SPEAKER_12]: There are, I do wanna go over the test design since it differs a bit from the ELA and the math test.

640
01:49:00,703 --> 01:49:05,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And you received a print report that goes over some of those details.

641
01:49:06,587 --> 01:49:11,571
[SPEAKER_12]: As said before, the content standards are the main component where the questions are developed.

642
01:49:13,193 --> 01:49:21,239
[SPEAKER_12]: In 2019, the grade five and grade eight exam were fully operational.

643
01:49:22,309 --> 01:49:28,594
[SPEAKER_12]: and tied to the next generation MCAS exam was released.

644
01:49:29,014 --> 01:49:31,857
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know, in 2020, the exam was canceled.

645
01:49:32,437 --> 01:49:38,682
[SPEAKER_12]: And in 2021, the exam was one half of what, it was just one session.

646
01:49:40,023 --> 01:49:50,651
[SPEAKER_12]: And so 2022 was officially only the third administration of this exam, but it was only the second fully operational version of the exam.

647
01:49:52,369 --> 01:50:00,731
[SPEAKER_12]: For grade 10, I just wanna find the notes, so don't misspeak.

648
01:50:01,672 --> 01:50:10,314
[SPEAKER_12]: The next generation MCAS science and technology exam was given for the first time at the high school this past spring.

649
01:50:12,074 --> 01:50:18,736
[SPEAKER_12]: In August of 2022, this very past August, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education benchmarked the exam.

650
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:28,504
[SPEAKER_12]: And the exam achievement levels now use the current next generation MCAS levels, just like the ones that are used on the ELA and mathematics exam.

651
01:50:28,824 --> 01:50:35,607
[SPEAKER_12]: They use the exceeds expectations met expectations partially met expectations and not meeting expectations.

652
01:50:36,868 --> 01:50:38,188
[SPEAKER_12]: The state did release.

653
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:44,761
[SPEAKER_12]: some comparative data for the legacy MCAS benchmarks.

654
01:50:45,641 --> 01:51:02,549
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the report, it's listed as a table, but I have a fairly large bar chart that's gonna appear that I'd like to spend a little time on once we get to grade 10, so that I can fully explain that particular slide.

655
01:51:03,345 --> 01:51:04,686
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the test design.

656
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:16,271
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'm just gonna do some very high level highlights from the grade five, grade eight, and then speak on the high school exam.

657
01:51:16,972 --> 01:51:29,558
[SPEAKER_12]: So as you can see in this graph, it reports the percentages of students at the exceeding meeting, partially meeting and not meeting for the district and for the state.

658
01:51:30,478 --> 01:51:31,879
[SPEAKER_12]: The district is in light blue,

659
01:51:32,512 --> 01:51:35,976
[SPEAKER_12]: and the state is in dark blue.

660
01:51:36,997 --> 01:51:45,466
[SPEAKER_12]: At grade five, the state led the district by five percentage points at the exceeding and meeting expectations.

661
01:51:47,591 --> 01:51:52,573
[SPEAKER_12]: There were more students at partially meeting this year than there were the prior year.

662
01:51:53,154 --> 01:52:03,419
[SPEAKER_12]: So looking at the table that's reported in the report, you'll notice that there are more students at that partially meeting than there were the year before, year over year in the district.

663
01:52:04,859 --> 01:52:10,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And there were also this year in 2022, fewer students who are not meeting this year.

664
01:52:10,981 --> 01:52:14,182
[SPEAKER_12]: who were not meeting expectations than the prior year.

665
01:52:14,623 --> 01:52:17,604
[SPEAKER_12]: So year over year, the results are better.

666
01:52:17,724 --> 01:52:23,687
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we still trail the state in the exceeding and meeting category when you add them up.

667
01:52:28,809 --> 01:52:38,093
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of looking forward for this year, I think one of the items that we really need to keep in mind is that we would like to see

668
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:43,582
[SPEAKER_12]: greater implementation of FOSS with the hands-on activities.

669
01:52:43,602 --> 01:52:47,905
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that we invested in several years ago as the pandemic hit.

670
01:52:48,885 --> 01:53:02,153
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a lot of decisions to be made and time to be spent in other classes and there was a lot of absenteeism as has been noted and some uncertainty around what was going to be covered.

671
01:53:03,454 --> 01:53:09,317
[SPEAKER_12]: So it decreased our ability to focus on the hands-on components to the FOSS program which is

672
01:53:09,898 --> 01:53:14,961
[SPEAKER_12]: it's a pretty critical way of learning science in elementary school.

673
01:53:15,721 --> 01:53:19,223
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's one area which we'll be looking at a little more deeply.

674
01:53:21,084 --> 01:53:33,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, we began the NWEA MAP exam last year, and it's gonna be a great tool for us because we will administer the science version grades three, four, and five twice a year.

675
01:53:34,264 --> 01:53:48,647
[SPEAKER_12]: and it will give us an opportunity to progress monitor for kids and do some diving, a little bit deeper dive into the science data for classroom and grade level standards.

676
01:53:51,168 --> 01:54:03,791
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll also be conducting instructional rounds to observe classroom implementation and the needs at each grade level, and then some continued work with the special education department, the EL department,

677
01:54:04,110 --> 01:54:08,153
[SPEAKER_12]: to continue to support the needs of the learners in our classrooms for science.

678
01:54:11,836 --> 01:54:13,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Scroll to the next slide.

679
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:25,646
[SPEAKER_12]: In middle school, there isn't great differences between the state and the district.

680
01:54:26,186 --> 01:54:32,531
[SPEAKER_12]: At grade eight, the state did lead by four percentage points at exceeding in meeting, but you can see that

681
01:54:34,051 --> 01:54:42,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Even visually, we are very close to what the state has in terms of its achievement on the exam.

682
01:54:43,779 --> 01:54:47,842
[SPEAKER_12]: The state, in fact, had 42% at meeting and exceeding.

683
01:54:48,563 --> 01:54:50,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is some differences at the schools.

684
01:54:51,265 --> 01:54:58,290
[SPEAKER_12]: The Andrews has 42% meeting and exceeding, and the McGlynn has 37% meeting and exceeding.

685
01:54:59,171 --> 01:54:59,771
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we

686
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:14,504
[SPEAKER_12]: as a district house, the population at the McGlynn middle school, and that represents about 50 students of the hundred and 72 that took the exam this year, so it's something that can impact the score.

687
01:55:16,845 --> 01:55:23,749
[SPEAKER_12]: These are students that are either very recently in the country and learning English or a few years out.

688
01:55:23,929 --> 01:55:31,812
[SPEAKER_12]: So these kinds of things will appear in the data in those particular grade levels.

689
01:55:33,293 --> 01:55:37,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's a greater number of action items for grade eight.

690
01:55:37,695 --> 01:55:45,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, really it's for middle school, not just for grade eight, but grade eight, the grade eight exam incorporates grade six through eight curriculum.

691
01:55:47,256 --> 01:55:59,207
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will be looking at the new types of questions that have been asked on the MCAS exam and we began this last year with one half of the exam questions that were available.

692
01:56:00,728 --> 01:56:03,851
[SPEAKER_12]: The state had released them now we have a full exam, so there will be more.

693
01:56:04,429 --> 01:56:15,717
[SPEAKER_12]: sample questions that we can look at, and we'll incorporate those into teaching and looking to see if we can progress monitor the students in the current year.

694
01:56:16,297 --> 01:56:31,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, we'll use the NWEA map for science twice a year at grades six, seven, and eight, and it'll allow us to see, to identify the content areas where students are stronger, where they might need additional support,

695
01:56:33,145 --> 01:56:34,527
[SPEAKER_12]: and progress monitor.

696
01:56:36,188 --> 01:56:53,642
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll also be working on professional development, looking at high leverage instructional strategies, which include hands on inquiry, incorporation of science practices, something that we've been doing more of in the writing side of things, which is a

697
01:56:54,797 --> 01:57:08,185
[SPEAKER_12]: claim evidence and reasoning, it's a way of writing paragraphs for short writing assignments in the discipline, and then looking at how we can plan phenomena-based lesson plans.

698
01:57:09,486 --> 01:57:23,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, it's another approach being, it's found in the materials that we have, but it's also something being promoted sort of in the US as an approach for science teaching.

699
01:57:25,326 --> 01:57:35,133
[SPEAKER_12]: We also provide the item analysis to the teachers on the test, which is in the appendix of the report.

700
01:57:36,354 --> 01:57:42,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And also looking at both the standards and domains and the individual question item analysis.

701
01:57:42,699 --> 01:57:54,607
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we work as a team to identify if there are any questions that might have confused students on how they were phrased, but also looking at the curriculum to see when that particular topic is addressed

702
01:57:55,137 --> 01:58:01,861
[SPEAKER_12]: in grade six, seven, and eight to see if we can make it a more robust approach as the students approach the exam.

703
01:58:03,802 --> 01:58:16,869
[SPEAKER_12]: We also work with some of our community partners, whether they're academic or business-based to try to identify activities that really excite kids to study and continue to learn about science, technology, engineering.

704
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:24,781
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna move on to the third chart.

705
01:58:25,762 --> 01:58:34,167
[SPEAKER_12]: And while this one uses the same information, I need to sort of explain what we're looking at.

706
01:58:34,807 --> 01:58:49,597
[SPEAKER_12]: To the left with the blue, light blue and dark blue is the data from the exam using the exceeding, meeting, partially meeting, and not meeting expectations achievement levels.

707
01:58:50,860 --> 01:59:04,083
[SPEAKER_12]: And on the right with the orange and teal colors is the exams results with the legacy scale.

708
01:59:05,343 --> 01:59:19,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Students in the class of 2025 and 2024 were held to the legacy standard scale, which means that our students

709
01:59:20,541 --> 01:59:28,306
[SPEAKER_12]: overall actually outperform the state by two percentage points at the advanced and proficient levels.

710
01:59:29,327 --> 01:59:41,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So we would have to look at the right side of the bar chart to see what our performance level on achievement is for the high stakes version of the exam at grade 10.

711
01:59:44,228 --> 01:59:51,513
[SPEAKER_12]: The new version of the exceeding meeting, partially meeting and not meeting, was set in August.

712
01:59:52,553 --> 02:00:02,080
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's the same test and the same students, but you'll notice some pretty interesting differences that are revealed in that data.

713
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:17,398
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing that I noticed when I looked at it was that our students perform slightly lower than the state at the meeting and the exceeding, whereas in the legacy, they perform better than the state.

714
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:25,942
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing I noticed was that both the state and the district perform about 47%

715
02:00:28,997 --> 02:00:34,680
[SPEAKER_12]: 47% of the students perform at the exceeding or meeting achievement levels.

716
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:54,989
[SPEAKER_12]: When I think about that and look at the other scale where I see 64% of students being advanced and proficient, I sort of have a lot of questions raised in my mind about how the setting was done.

717
02:00:56,010 --> 02:00:56,110
[SPEAKER_12]: And

718
02:00:57,642 --> 02:01:17,233
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I can personally do much about it because the standard setting is done at the state level, but I do wanna bring it to your attention that these two scales represent the exact same, the exact same exam administration and the exact same students with two different scales.

719
02:01:18,234 --> 02:01:25,498
[SPEAKER_12]: In the future, it will be the MCAS 2.0 achievement scale that will be used.

720
02:01:26,325 --> 02:01:30,387
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, our students are experiencing the legacy scale.

721
02:01:31,147 --> 02:01:42,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what that speaks to in the future, but it is a little bit something that is troubling to me as an educator.

722
02:01:42,993 --> 02:01:47,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to show you the data so that you can make your own decisions on it.

723
02:01:49,196 --> 02:01:49,897
[SPEAKER_12]: That being said,

724
02:01:53,999 --> 02:01:56,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Students took the next generation MCAS with a comic book.

725
02:01:57,641 --> 02:02:01,803
[SPEAKER_12]: They needed to attain a needs improvement or above to be eligible to earn a high school diploma.

726
02:02:02,923 --> 02:02:12,248
[SPEAKER_12]: 89% of our students at grades 10 and 11, the current grade 10 and 11 students, classes of 2024 and 2025, earned their competency determination.

727
02:02:14,208 --> 02:02:20,171
[SPEAKER_12]: As I had mentioned, August, 2022, the DESE had set and released these next generation achievement levels.

728
02:02:22,506 --> 02:02:31,208
[SPEAKER_12]: The new achievement levels exceeding expectations, meeting expectations, partially meeting expectations and not meeting expectations use the same 22 MCAS exam.

729
02:02:32,228 --> 02:02:45,511
[SPEAKER_12]: The students of the class of 2025 and those in the class of 2024 who took that 2022 MCAS biology will receive a competency determination based on the legacy achievement levels.

730
02:02:47,043 --> 02:02:54,946
[SPEAKER_12]: but that will change for the class of 2026 and beyond, who are the current grade nine students and then anyone who comes up after them.

731
02:02:55,946 --> 02:03:05,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this point, I kind of put that in a bracket in terms of understanding what happened at grade 10.

732
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:08,711
[SPEAKER_12]: It's our first experience with that particular exam.

733
02:03:10,076 --> 02:03:18,902
[SPEAKER_12]: and that grading scale, so we have to sort of anticipate it and move with it, but we really wanted to understand what it was.

734
02:03:20,824 --> 02:03:26,307
[SPEAKER_12]: And this year we do have at least some data to look at and also some test questions that we can look at.

735
02:03:28,649 --> 02:03:35,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Our action items at the high school, we're gonna continue to support students taking the MCAS exams and the MCAS retakes.

736
02:03:38,322 --> 02:04:06,271
[SPEAKER_12]: administering the NWA map for science in grades nine and 10 to allow us to just do some early identification of some content area readiness, whether that means at grade 10 we're looking at what potential elective courses or pathways that students want to achieve, whether we can get them ready for those, or at grade nine, trying to identify early which standards might need some additional support for the upcoming

737
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:09,831
[SPEAKER_12]: 2023 Biology MCAS.

738
02:04:10,731 --> 02:04:14,093
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll continue the professional development that we began earlier this year.

739
02:04:15,394 --> 02:04:30,503
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to do some more data dives with the NWA map results and refine our pacing guides for biology and chemistry and the other subjects as well, and then work with the other departments to make sure that our

740
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:37,022
[SPEAKER_12]: content area is accessible for students that are EL and students with special needs.

741
02:04:39,723 --> 02:04:41,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Siri.

742
02:04:42,064 --> 02:04:46,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have member McLaughlin online who has question right.

743
02:04:48,286 --> 02:04:48,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

744
02:04:56,068 --> 02:04:58,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else from the floor have any questions?

745
02:04:59,209 --> 02:05:00,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Graham and then come on up.

746
02:05:04,457 --> 02:05:07,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a quick question about the implementation of FOSS.

747
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:11,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Will we be able to say we're done implementing FOSS at the end of this year?

748
02:05:12,143 --> 02:05:15,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like we've been talking about this for a really long time.

749
02:05:15,305 --> 02:05:31,318
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know COVID has interrupted in the middle of it, but I want us to get to the point where we can close the book on feeling like we're still in implementation mode because there are so many other things that we have to implement at the elementary school.

750
02:05:31,498 --> 02:05:32,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to figure out

751
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:38,009
[SPEAKER_13]: there seems to still be stuff to do there from an implementation perspective.

752
02:05:38,630 --> 02:05:41,617
[SPEAKER_13]: And it seems like that's unusual at this point.

753
02:05:42,199 --> 02:05:51,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so when we began looking at it, I believe it was back in 2017 2018 it was our pilot year 2018 we we adopted we trained teachers 2019 was our first like full year implementation 2020 we all know what happened 21.

754
02:05:51,425 --> 02:05:53,086
[SPEAKER_12]: We had some modified schedules.

755
02:06:06,471 --> 02:06:09,013
[SPEAKER_12]: in terms of when science was being taught.

756
02:06:10,374 --> 02:06:16,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I feel like this year is the year we're okay.

757
02:06:16,818 --> 02:06:33,470
[SPEAKER_12]: We can say all teachers have one year of solid implementation under their belt and we can move on and just kind of, like you said, close the book on it and have the expectation that this is the model program we're using.

758
02:06:35,095 --> 02:06:36,476
[SPEAKER_12]: It has been difficult.

759
02:06:36,576 --> 02:06:48,022
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no way of getting around the facts that have sort of transpired over the last couple of years as we went through the implementation.

760
02:06:48,062 --> 02:06:55,425
[SPEAKER_12]: But for sure, we're in a better place than we were maybe five years ago when we had a curriculum that was pretty old.

761
02:06:56,026 --> 02:06:58,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, my kids are done with elementary school at this point.

762
02:06:58,607 --> 02:07:01,208
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the concern, right?

763
02:07:01,248 --> 02:07:02,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Like when this stuff takes five years,

764
02:07:03,562 --> 02:07:07,325
[SPEAKER_13]: you lost a whole building full of kids through the implementation process.

765
02:07:07,365 --> 02:07:30,760
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make sure that going forward, like, and again, there's so much to do at the elementary level that I just want to make sure the teachers feel properly supported, that they've had the right PD, they have the supplies that they need, like that just literally were good by the end of this year, because I just next year, it's going to be math and ELA and all the other things.

766
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:31,140
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just,

767
02:07:32,802 --> 02:07:45,667
[SPEAKER_13]: I definitely want the teachers to feel like they've had, they've gotten what they need to feel good about delivering this curriculum, which the kids love, because it's hands-on with some fidelity.

768
02:07:45,687 --> 02:07:48,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

769
02:07:49,169 --> 02:07:50,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Noah Brewer, our student rep, has a question.

770
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:53,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mayor, I'm back on.

771
02:07:53,931 --> 02:07:54,471
[SPEAKER_08]: The question went.

772
02:07:54,491 --> 02:07:57,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Noah, go ahead.

773
02:07:57,757 --> 02:08:03,463
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was just wondering what the data collection process for the NWEA map looks like.

774
02:08:04,904 --> 02:08:15,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Once students take the exam, there's about a 24-hour turnaround for those results to be available to teachers and to administrators.

775
02:08:15,755 --> 02:08:20,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And we sort of look at how it breaks down by category.

776
02:08:21,052 --> 02:08:27,797
[SPEAKER_12]: by subject area and then by strand, which is the test.

777
02:08:28,077 --> 02:08:32,961
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't recall if you've taken it yet or not, but it does have a variety of subject areas.

778
02:08:33,381 --> 02:08:50,173
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll see in that one test, a little bit of life science or biology, a little bit of chemistry or physical sciences, a little bit of earth and space sciences, but the questions themselves can then be broken down and looked at with pretty good detail for each student.

779
02:08:50,612 --> 02:08:56,994
[SPEAKER_12]: And we use that data, we kind of put it together and look at it by class to see what we can do to help students.

780
02:08:58,275 --> 02:09:00,516
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just like its own exam?

781
02:09:01,256 --> 02:09:02,877
[SPEAKER_12]: It is its own exam, yes.

782
02:09:06,418 --> 02:09:08,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin, and then Member Kreatz.

783
02:09:09,599 --> 02:09:10,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mayor.

784
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:14,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Seary for the presentation.

785
02:09:14,202 --> 02:09:25,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I also just wanted to ask, I really appreciate you putting on the presentation, the collaboration with other departments, specifically growing the collaboration with the EL and special education departments.

786
02:09:25,230 --> 02:09:28,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really great to see that.

787
02:09:28,052 --> 02:09:33,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we talk a lot about sort of breaking down silos and working collaboratively.

788
02:09:33,917 --> 02:09:36,879
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really think we need to see more of that, frankly.

789
02:09:37,654 --> 02:09:43,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, even to be able to have the MCAS alt presentations these past two years has been super helpful.

790
02:09:44,075 --> 02:09:57,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I would like to know just collectively, not just from you, but collectively, I guess, and it could, I'm sure it's a bigger question, but I would like it to be part of the presentation or follow-up is how are we addressing our achievement gaps, right?

791
02:09:57,938 --> 02:10:02,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that our lowest performing subgroups are our students with disabilities.

792
02:10:02,858 --> 02:10:05,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Our English learners are economically disadvantaged.

793
02:10:06,201 --> 02:10:12,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what is our achievement gap and how are we addressing it in terms of being able to bridge those gaps?

794
02:10:12,483 --> 02:10:26,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we have a bigger gap now, obviously with COVID and the COVID numbers, but I'm wondering how we're really thinking about this in terms of equity, which is one of our core values in terms of our whole district wide plan.

795
02:10:26,387 --> 02:10:34,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So not to put you on the spot here, I know you're one of several, but I just think collectively as a team, how are we thinking about this?

796
02:10:36,383 --> 02:10:42,706
[SPEAKER_12]: I can tell you from the perspective of the department and the teachers that we do discuss the subgroup data.

797
02:10:43,846 --> 02:10:53,290
[SPEAKER_12]: And just as the school committee views the subgroup data in tables, the teachers get the same information.

798
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:57,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And we try to address looking,

799
02:10:58,618 --> 02:11:05,627
[SPEAKER_12]: First we look at the data to understand what it's trying to inform us about, but then we also look a little bit deep.

800
02:11:05,908 --> 02:11:08,091
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what the data dive is for.

801
02:11:08,431 --> 02:11:13,678
[SPEAKER_12]: We look at the questions that are causing some challenges and also whether there are curricular

802
02:11:15,874 --> 02:11:28,041
[SPEAKER_12]: approaches that we can use to to improve our our approaches, especially for all the different learners that we have in our classrooms and that's a really sort of broad statement.

803
02:11:30,442 --> 02:11:34,144
[SPEAKER_12]: you're probably asking a bigger question as well that would be addressed.

804
02:11:36,203 --> 02:11:38,887
[SPEAKER_12]: by, you know, by the central administration.

805
02:11:38,907 --> 02:11:40,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

806
02:11:40,669 --> 02:11:41,531
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to also just say.

807
02:11:49,429 --> 02:12:05,159
[SPEAKER_17]: that the achievement gap is incredibly important to us and we will be looking at ways to constantly improve instruction and using that data analysis cycle to go back and revisit topics where students may have had difficulty.

808
02:12:05,739 --> 02:12:09,401
[SPEAKER_17]: So using data to inform instruction is going to be critically important.

809
02:12:10,062 --> 02:12:14,785
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do wanna emphasize the importance of looking at our student growth data.

810
02:12:15,465 --> 02:12:19,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Because students all start everyone has a starting point.

811
02:12:20,269 --> 02:12:32,339
[SPEAKER_17]: So, irregardless of socioeconomic race, wherever you are, whatever your starting point is, we want you to show growth at the end of the year.

812
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:37,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So even if a student is not starting the year on grade level.

813
02:12:38,024 --> 02:12:40,286
[SPEAKER_17]: they can still show a year's growth.

814
02:12:40,767 --> 02:12:44,810
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's that number that was shown earlier on with the 40 to 59.

815
02:12:45,411 --> 02:12:59,524
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the number where it's taking the student, especially for our students with disabilities, students that are English learners that we know that they don't have the same starting point as a general education student.

816
02:13:00,445 --> 02:13:04,487
[SPEAKER_17]: if you look at their growth, you want to be able to see growth for every student.

817
02:13:05,248 --> 02:13:21,057
[SPEAKER_17]: And for our students that we could say, well, they are general education students as a parent or as a member of the community, you could say, I wanna see even greater growth because they don't have some of the other barriers that could limit them at this point in time.

818
02:13:21,638 --> 02:13:26,981
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do wanna say that as we look at our data and review our data,

819
02:13:27,481 --> 02:13:34,267
[SPEAKER_17]: that it's critically important for all for us to also be looking at student growth percentile, and that's kind of.

820
02:13:36,411 --> 02:13:49,423
[SPEAKER_17]: what I've been paying closer attention to, because it looks at each student on an individualized basis, and you can see whether growth is taking place and learning is taking place.

821
02:13:50,103 --> 02:13:54,947
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to stress that piece, and I'm sure member Galusi, Ms.

822
02:13:54,967 --> 02:13:58,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Galusi, Assistant Superintendent Galusi has something else to add.

823
02:13:58,491 --> 02:13:58,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

824
02:13:59,710 --> 02:14:10,623
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you, you pretty much said what I was going to say, but additionally Dr Rick and Ellie and I are going to cover a district wide kind of next steps and where we go from here.

825
02:14:10,983 --> 02:14:15,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And with all due respect to the Department of Education.

826
02:14:15,649 --> 02:14:18,672
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a test that's administered once in a year.

827
02:14:20,635 --> 02:14:22,916
[SPEAKER_07]: There has been a big disruption in the past two years.

828
02:14:22,956 --> 02:14:25,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And so right now it's even more difficult to see growth.

829
02:14:25,756 --> 02:14:36,459
[SPEAKER_07]: But what we're really going to be looking at, and that will be in the next meeting, is the NWEA map, because that's administered three times a year.

830
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:45,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to give us the progress monitoring and the growth that we're going to really be able to use to drill down to make sure we're supporting all of our students.

831
02:14:45,662 --> 02:14:48,903
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk a little bit about that at the end of the presentation.

832
02:14:50,609 --> 02:14:52,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe just to be fair, if we could.

833
02:14:52,855 --> 02:14:56,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, can I just actually follow up with one thing, Mayor, just in response?

834
02:14:58,428 --> 02:14:59,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

835
02:14:59,895 --> 02:15:00,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

836
02:15:00,476 --> 02:15:01,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that.

837
02:15:01,997 --> 02:15:04,799
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate student growth percentiles as well.

838
02:15:04,839 --> 02:15:05,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to look at.

839
02:15:06,361 --> 02:15:11,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important, obviously, to be positive and especially amid a pandemic and all the work that's been done.

840
02:15:11,525 --> 02:15:14,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to stress that I understand that as well.

841
02:15:14,908 --> 02:15:24,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I also just wanted to add that I know that we all know that every student is a general education student and some students receive EL services or special education services.

842
02:15:24,337 --> 02:15:25,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're all general

843
02:15:25,879 --> 02:15:33,845
[SPEAKER_06]: students, but also just wanted to hope that even with the NWEA presentation, which is great that it's three times a year and

844
02:15:34,266 --> 02:15:35,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do respect to Desi as well.

845
02:15:35,587 --> 02:15:38,468
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a one-time assessment annually.

846
02:15:38,488 --> 02:15:44,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of the assessment is to look at what the achievement gap is and who is or is not achieving and what that looks like.

847
02:15:44,330 --> 02:15:53,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess I would just ask respectfully in presentations, if we can also, or even maybe there's another presentation, I don't know, I would defer to Central on this as well.

848
02:15:53,773 --> 02:15:59,535
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can talk about what the achievement gap is and how we're actually addressing it, I think it would be really helpful.

849
02:15:59,575 --> 02:16:01,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think if we don't name things,

850
02:16:01,836 --> 02:16:04,717
[SPEAKER_06]: then they can just be ambiguous and people don't really understand them.

851
02:16:04,797 --> 02:16:08,279
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would really encourage us to think about talking about that as well.

852
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:09,259
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

853
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:11,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

854
02:16:13,601 --> 02:16:14,922
[SPEAKER_08]: So member Kreatz.

855
02:16:18,443 --> 02:16:19,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the report.

856
02:16:20,124 --> 02:16:27,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a question because I know I've always been concerned with, you know, when your high school student got to take the exam,

857
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:35,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that percentage that student doesn't fall within the range, you know, that they need to be eligible to get the high school diploma.

858
02:16:36,397 --> 02:16:37,578
[SPEAKER_03]: that can be very stressful.

859
02:16:38,599 --> 02:16:40,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know it's really early on.

860
02:16:41,581 --> 02:16:51,309
[SPEAKER_03]: So as part of the process, is there gonna be any planning to assist those students who didn't, are they gonna have to retake it?

861
02:16:51,709 --> 02:16:54,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Will there be some assistance?

862
02:16:54,171 --> 02:17:00,717
[SPEAKER_12]: So unlike some of the other exams, there's a lot of retaking in science.

863
02:17:00,797 --> 02:17:02,298
[SPEAKER_12]: We try to anticipate the,

864
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:24,855
[SPEAKER_12]: the ability of students to pass an exam in science early in grade nine, that was always our mark, to get kids to pass the science exam in grade nine, and then allow them as many retakes as we can possibly get them if necessary, as we move forward.

865
02:17:25,276 --> 02:17:31,881
[SPEAKER_12]: So that opportunity is still there and they get support, whether it's after school or during school through scheduling,

866
02:17:32,501 --> 02:17:42,526
[SPEAKER_12]: that addresses, it's more targeted to the standards that they may have had as challenges or particular strategies that they might need to pass the exam.

867
02:17:43,647 --> 02:17:57,734
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's, yeah, there's a lot of work that happens behind the scenes, I guess, to support the learners and to make sure that by the time they're in grade 12 that they've mastered or passed the exam so that they can graduate from high school.

868
02:17:58,915 --> 02:17:59,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

869
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:01,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

870
02:18:01,902 --> 02:18:02,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

871
02:18:02,983 --> 02:18:03,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

872
02:18:03,524 --> 02:18:06,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up we have Miss Khan.

873
02:18:07,008 --> 02:18:07,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

874
02:18:12,716 --> 02:18:13,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

875
02:18:13,837 --> 02:18:15,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everybody.

876
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:16,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for having me here.

877
02:18:37,037 --> 02:18:38,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great, thank you.

878
02:18:38,978 --> 02:18:43,040
[SPEAKER_20]: So good evening, everybody, and thank you for having me here.

879
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:50,223
[SPEAKER_20]: The first slide that I have up is in regards to the student growth percentile.

880
02:18:51,503 --> 02:19:05,449
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see that five out of six grades that are listed here or shown here basically fell within or more of typical growth

881
02:19:06,598 --> 02:19:09,680
[SPEAKER_20]: One of them is even in high growth, that's our 10th grade.

882
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:20,204
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll move on to the next slide because that will give more of an insight into our meeting and exceeding expectations.

883
02:19:22,674 --> 02:19:29,578
[SPEAKER_20]: So the state outperformed the district in the combined category by 7%.

884
02:19:30,599 --> 02:19:37,183
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't see any SGP for third grade because the district, the state doesn't report it.

885
02:19:37,323 --> 02:19:39,985
[SPEAKER_20]: There is no baseline for third grade.

886
02:19:40,005 --> 02:19:44,347
[SPEAKER_20]: So we don't see it on the SGP graph.

887
02:19:45,068 --> 02:19:50,851
[SPEAKER_20]: And one school outperformed the state in the combined exceeding and meeting expectations.

888
02:19:52,952 --> 02:20:08,845
[SPEAKER_20]: What we have seen and I just I'm happy to see that myself in the in the math department is that when we are looking at the district percent possible points and the state percent possible points

889
02:20:09,525 --> 02:20:13,206
[SPEAKER_20]: We are seeing that the district has closed the gap from previous years.

890
02:20:13,907 --> 02:20:19,209
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's very much in line with what Dr. Riccardelli and Ms.

891
02:20:19,229 --> 02:20:24,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Gallucci had mentioned is coming to us from the state as well.

892
02:20:25,431 --> 02:20:30,433
[SPEAKER_20]: And that it started in third grade that we saw the gaps closing in.

893
02:20:31,428 --> 02:20:46,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Then when we reach the fourth grade, it's basically the same thing that we see the gaps closing in, but we see a larger gap in meeting and exceeding expectations of the district versus the state.

894
02:20:48,099 --> 02:20:52,802
[SPEAKER_20]: What we notice also, even though we do notice that trailing behind,

895
02:20:53,877 --> 02:21:00,782
[SPEAKER_20]: is that two schools outperformed the state in the combined exceeding and meeting expectations at this grade level.

896
02:21:01,623 --> 02:21:18,136
[SPEAKER_20]: At the fifth grade level, the state outperformed the district by 3% points, but the SGP at this grade level, as shown on the first slide, was right on the boundary of typical and high growth.

897
02:21:19,357 --> 02:21:21,439
[SPEAKER_20]: And one school outperformed the state,

898
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:25,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, it wasn't 40, it was 66.

899
02:21:29,126 --> 02:21:29,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

900
02:21:31,348 --> 02:21:32,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it 66?

901
02:21:32,149 --> 02:21:34,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, is it 48?

902
02:21:36,113 --> 02:21:41,538
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, the SGP of one school was 66, but overall we had 48 SGP for the district.

903
02:21:43,473 --> 02:22:04,178
[SPEAKER_20]: So the action items are pretty much as you guys approved investigations three by Turk that it being more inquiry based and discussion centered approach to math that it will be a good feeder program into our middle schools, our students at the elementary level will learn how to discuss math.

904
02:22:04,558 --> 02:22:24,041
[SPEAKER_20]: how to problem solve, how to explore, rather than watching a video and just learning from the video or learning more from an I do approach of a teacher, they will be working on you do approach, where they explore the concepts.

905
02:22:24,882 --> 02:22:34,353
[SPEAKER_20]: And this year, we also got a grant and we are going to be implementing ST Math as an enrichment and as a remediation tool both.

906
02:22:34,734 --> 02:22:37,797
[SPEAKER_20]: Teachers are getting trained this coming Wednesday, 2 to 3.30.

907
02:22:40,561 --> 02:22:53,998
[SPEAKER_20]: At the middle school level, our sixth grade trail behind by 11% altogether, even though our exceeding expectations, we were 2% above the state level.

908
02:22:55,614 --> 02:23:05,141
[SPEAKER_20]: We are working on our sixth grade scores and I will go in more detail when it comes to the action items.

909
02:23:06,002 --> 02:23:10,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Seventh grade, I'm extremely pleased with the seventh grade scores.

910
02:23:12,367 --> 02:23:26,798
[SPEAKER_20]: We feel that the schools, one school's SGP was in high growth range and the other was on the higher end of the typical growth, which usually did not it actually was didn't used to be the case at all in the past.

911
02:23:28,178 --> 02:23:33,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Seemingly, they have worked on a certain piece of curriculum more.

912
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:40,523
[SPEAKER_20]: They have moved it up in the pacing guide, and that seems to have worked for us.

913
02:23:41,843 --> 02:23:45,224
[SPEAKER_20]: One school matched the state in exceeding expectations category.

914
02:23:48,470 --> 02:23:59,457
[SPEAKER_20]: basically both meeting and exceeding expectations for the district was 3% off from the state.

915
02:24:00,458 --> 02:24:06,122
[SPEAKER_20]: The eighth grade is where one school matched the state in meeting expectations category.

916
02:24:06,982 --> 02:24:15,708
[SPEAKER_20]: When I look at the closing the gaps for the district, for the content area, for the percent possible points,

917
02:24:16,235 --> 02:24:25,907
[SPEAKER_20]: I see that eighth grade is the one that has more gaps than in any other grades.

918
02:24:25,987 --> 02:24:27,949
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody else has closed the gaps.

919
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:46,069
[SPEAKER_20]: It has stayed the same, so we have some work to do in that particular grade level, so the action items for the middle schools are continue using illustrative mathematics for the standard classes and big ideas for the pre algebra algebra group.

920
02:24:47,178 --> 02:24:55,820
[SPEAKER_20]: reorganizing the acceleration by teaching half of eighth grade standards in seventh and others in eighth grade, along with algebra one standards.

921
02:24:56,700 --> 02:24:58,761
[SPEAKER_20]: We were teaching two grade levels in one.

922
02:24:59,981 --> 02:25:04,762
[SPEAKER_20]: And this actually last year was our first year and we have had much success with it.

923
02:25:04,842 --> 02:25:06,703
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will continue with that.

924
02:25:08,263 --> 02:25:13,286
[SPEAKER_20]: We offered a math extended day opportunity for 10 weeks to support student needs.

925
02:25:14,227 --> 02:25:19,210
[SPEAKER_20]: We feel like that made a difference at the middle school level, especially definitely at the seventh grade level.

926
02:25:20,371 --> 02:25:24,753
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a four day math camp for grade six, seventh and eighth.

927
02:25:25,954 --> 02:25:31,077
[SPEAKER_20]: But we do feel that the math extended day opportunity made a bigger difference.

928
02:25:32,119 --> 02:25:42,524
[SPEAKER_20]: So for the math 10th grade level, the SGP for the district was 61%, not percent, I apologize, it was 61.

929
02:25:42,584 --> 02:25:48,566
[SPEAKER_20]: So it barely made it above the typical growth.

930
02:25:49,927 --> 02:25:51,728
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is something we are,

931
02:25:52,964 --> 02:25:54,305
[SPEAKER_20]: very pleased with.

932
02:25:55,465 --> 02:26:14,113
[SPEAKER_20]: For the graduation requirements, this is where it gets a little bit tricky with the DESE is that if you earn a score of 486 or higher, we see that you have met the graduation requirement, aka competency determination.

933
02:26:15,333 --> 02:26:28,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Based on the scores that we have at the high school level, 61% of the district's high schoolers who achieved the partially meeting expectations met the high school graduation requirement.

934
02:26:28,837 --> 02:26:42,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though it showed that they are only in the partially meeting category, the scores were such that they do not have to be taking, be on an EPP or the Educational Proficiency Plan.

935
02:26:43,683 --> 02:26:51,250
[SPEAKER_20]: For 2022, DESE allowed those with a score of 469 to 485 to go on an EPP and not retest.

936
02:26:53,131 --> 02:27:07,584
[SPEAKER_20]: And based on this, 21% of the district's 10th graders who achieved not meeting expectations do not have to retest and will be on an EPP to achieve the math high school graduation requirements.

937
02:27:09,935 --> 02:27:21,039
[SPEAKER_20]: And action items for the high schools high school is review great pacing guides and modify sequencing, which is what worked for us in a couple of grades.

938
02:27:22,519 --> 02:27:27,641
[SPEAKER_20]: And we want to make sure that spiral learning continues on and improving student performance.

939
02:27:28,361 --> 02:27:29,142
[SPEAKER_20]: will be our goal.

940
02:27:30,342 --> 02:27:35,745
[SPEAKER_20]: Grades K through five will use program specific pacing guides for program assessment purposes.

941
02:27:35,985 --> 02:27:39,066
[SPEAKER_20]: And we want to continue that for the high school as well.

942
02:27:39,666 --> 02:27:41,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Developing and updating the core syllabi.

943
02:27:42,128 --> 02:27:51,552
[SPEAKER_20]: We did that this year to make sure we have the existing, you know, we are current with the 2017 frameworks.

944
02:27:52,312 --> 02:27:54,713
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be extending the educational opportunities

945
02:27:56,328 --> 02:28:02,069
[SPEAKER_20]: through the committee recommendations, which will continue to work throughout this year.

946
02:28:02,509 --> 02:28:06,290
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be exploring options for the electives category.

947
02:28:07,071 --> 02:28:13,232
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have already introduced a personal finance course, which is five credit elective.

948
02:28:13,612 --> 02:28:15,873
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's mostly for the seniors this year.

949
02:28:16,293 --> 02:28:21,154
[SPEAKER_20]: We ran two sections of it and both of them are all full.

950
02:28:22,349 --> 02:28:29,172
[SPEAKER_20]: We are looking at introducing integrated mathematics pathways for integrated math two.

951
02:28:29,332 --> 02:28:32,153
[SPEAKER_20]: We already have introduced it for integrated one.

952
02:28:33,194 --> 02:28:35,875
[SPEAKER_20]: We have about 60 plus students in three sections.

953
02:28:36,862 --> 02:28:43,406
[SPEAKER_20]: We will be keeping a track of the data, we'll be looking at it, we'll be analyzing it through the committee and in department meetings.

954
02:28:44,247 --> 02:28:53,212
[SPEAKER_20]: We are and we will be providing additional resources to teachers so that we can have more elective courses.

955
02:28:53,733 --> 02:28:58,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Some courses that we are looking at are business math and data analytics.

956
02:28:58,716 --> 02:29:03,579
[SPEAKER_20]: They're supposed to be courses that are picking up

957
02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:09,200
[SPEAKER_20]: And we hope to have an introduction done within the next couple of years.

958
02:29:10,261 --> 02:29:15,042
[SPEAKER_20]: We would like to have the math extended day opportunity for our kids.

959
02:29:16,162 --> 02:29:19,983
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel we all feel that that made a difference.

960
02:29:20,563 --> 02:29:28,925
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the four day math camp that ran through the grant for grades nine through 10, if it comes back, that will be awesome as well.

961
02:29:29,653 --> 02:29:37,192
[SPEAKER_20]: The action items for K through 12 are basically the emphasis needs to be and will continue to be on inquiry based problem solving.

962
02:29:38,148 --> 02:29:45,294
[SPEAKER_20]: strategies because that's a life skill that our students need to have and we recognize the need for it.

963
02:29:46,475 --> 02:29:58,566
[SPEAKER_20]: We wanna make sure that there's a departmental vision and mission statement that is based on the problem solving skills and development of those in our students K through 12.

964
02:29:58,646 --> 02:30:02,729
[SPEAKER_20]: We will continue to research the best math practices

965
02:30:03,570 --> 02:30:10,417
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to make sure that we provide our teachers with the professional development in line with the goal of the department.

966
02:30:11,117 --> 02:30:15,681
[SPEAKER_20]: We are incorporating data-driven strategies through NWEA MAP growth.

967
02:30:16,462 --> 02:30:26,412
[SPEAKER_20]: We continue to analyze the data and come up with action plans based on the NWEA MAP data and the MCAS data.

968
02:30:27,236 --> 02:30:30,397
[SPEAKER_20]: and the two sub steps are listed below.

969
02:30:30,758 --> 02:30:35,840
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's where we are at with the math department.

970
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:36,420
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

971
02:30:38,461 --> 02:30:38,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

972
02:30:38,941 --> 02:30:39,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

973
02:30:40,282 --> 02:30:42,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I know member McLaughlin has a question.

974
02:30:45,124 --> 02:30:49,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I wanted to thank you, Dr. Khan for the presentation.

975
02:30:49,106 --> 02:30:54,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're always so thoughtful in the pieces that you do and thank everyone else there.

976
02:30:54,388 --> 02:30:55,669
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also wanted to ask,

977
02:30:56,923 --> 02:31:14,969
[SPEAKER_06]: if there is any intersectionality around EL curriculum and special education curriculum and the varying curriculum departments, particularly in terms of like professional development, differentiated instruction, you know, those sorts of things, how that's actually happening, or is it happening?

978
02:31:15,249 --> 02:31:15,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

979
02:31:16,732 --> 02:31:19,553
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right, thank you for asking that question.

980
02:31:19,693 --> 02:31:37,882
[SPEAKER_20]: So our department meetings, every other meeting, we have our special education teachers, educators join us and a sampling of what takes place in those meetings and the professional development opportunities that

981
02:31:38,959 --> 02:32:03,219
[SPEAKER_20]: that we provide within our department includes questioning techniques from your students, culturally responsive teaching, how to differentiate instruction, how to write your content and language objectives so that they serve your EL population and that they're also helpful to our students

982
02:32:03,699 --> 02:32:07,783
[SPEAKER_20]: special education students, and so on and so forth.

983
02:32:08,024 --> 02:32:13,629
[SPEAKER_20]: We have also have professional development on student centered techniques and strategies.

984
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:23,859
[SPEAKER_20]: We discuss during our department meetings what's working for our overall population, not just for the general education.

985
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:37,087
[SPEAKER_20]: students and we do a lot of peer observations and strategy implementations, discussions as well in our department meetings.

986
02:32:37,668 --> 02:32:45,733
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm happy to take further suggestions and work on them, but that's what has been going on so far in the department.

987
02:32:46,153 --> 02:32:47,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Very helpful, thank you.

988
02:32:49,636 --> 02:32:51,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, member Hays, then member Rousseau.

989
02:32:55,469 --> 02:32:56,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Potato potato.

990
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:02,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a quick question about the investigation program at the elementary level.

991
02:33:03,893 --> 02:33:14,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I recall the early versions of investigations that some of the criticisms were that they lacked some of that procedural like a real emphasis on that in the early math facts and things has that been.

992
02:33:15,034 --> 02:33:25,918
[SPEAKER_05]: remediated or are we adding extra in to make up for what it might be lacking since it's very problem solving based and sometimes does, or at least in the past, it didn't have.

993
02:33:26,259 --> 02:33:26,779
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

994
02:33:26,959 --> 02:33:30,460
[SPEAKER_20]: So investigations three has had several versions of it.

995
02:33:31,521 --> 02:33:41,625
[SPEAKER_20]: This version, as far as the committee reviewed it, and that's why they choose this particular program over bridges is because one of the reasons was that

996
02:33:42,265 --> 02:33:46,851
[SPEAKER_20]: It provides a good balance between the two because I definitely see the need of procedural.

997
02:33:46,871 --> 02:33:56,103
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, emphasis on procedures and I also see definitely the need for inquiry based and problem solving now.

998
02:33:57,585 --> 02:34:00,209
[SPEAKER_20]: When we talk about the balance it really.

999
02:34:01,064 --> 02:34:11,013
[SPEAKER_20]: It depends on our student population, it depends on our educators, the professional development that's being provided to them and and so.

1000
02:34:12,054 --> 02:34:25,406
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe that it is providing a balance now only time will tell so we'll continue to revise it and get feedback on it from the teachers, I have already been in a couple of classrooms and it has been an awesome.

1001
02:34:25,908 --> 02:34:29,291
[SPEAKER_20]: awesome experience because they invited me and I saw a good balance.

1002
02:34:29,891 --> 02:34:32,233
[SPEAKER_20]: Now is everybody every day going to be like that?

1003
02:34:32,433 --> 02:34:33,353
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not too sure.

1004
02:34:34,835 --> 02:34:41,079
[SPEAKER_20]: But I do see that this is one of the best that's out there in terms of providing balance.

1005
02:34:44,582 --> 02:34:45,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1006
02:34:45,442 --> 02:34:45,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1007
02:34:46,623 --> 02:34:46,723
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm

1008
02:34:48,379 --> 02:34:51,541
[SPEAKER_19]: confused a bit on not meeting expectations.

1009
02:34:51,942 --> 02:35:01,069
[SPEAKER_19]: The 21% of the district's 10th graders who achieved not meeting expectations, which is a score of 469 to 485, right?

1010
02:35:03,911 --> 02:35:04,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Or 469 and below.

1011
02:35:05,412 --> 02:35:05,692
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1012
02:35:05,812 --> 02:35:09,275
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I go on, let me just move to that.

1013
02:35:09,495 --> 02:35:10,876
[SPEAKER_20]: Oops, right here.

1014
02:35:13,567 --> 02:35:19,011
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, so either, yes, it's between 469 to 485, actually.

1015
02:35:19,071 --> 02:35:22,513
[SPEAKER_19]: So for students that had a 468 and below?

1016
02:35:23,794 --> 02:35:24,995
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1017
02:35:26,036 --> 02:35:28,438
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not included in the 21% of students?

1018
02:35:28,658 --> 02:35:29,398
[SPEAKER_20]: No, they're not.

1019
02:35:29,839 --> 02:35:32,961
[SPEAKER_19]: How many, what percentage of students were 468 and below?

1020
02:35:32,981 --> 02:35:34,942
[SPEAKER_19]: 468 or below, so we, so,

1021
02:35:39,446 --> 02:35:47,510
[SPEAKER_20]: When we are talking about what percentage, are we talking about the overall or we can just deduct 21 from 100?

1022
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:58,296
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would say that about 79% of the students who were not meeting would actually be retesting.

1023
02:35:59,721 --> 02:36:03,622
[SPEAKER_19]: You're saying 79% of our 10th graders couldn't pass the math MCAS.

1024
02:36:03,802 --> 02:36:13,764
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm saying 79% of those who scored 469 or below will be retesting.

1025
02:36:14,685 --> 02:36:19,306
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm asking the question of all of the student body who are 10th graders and took the MCAS test.

1026
02:36:20,424 --> 02:36:30,008
[SPEAKER_19]: what percentage of them must retake it because they could not get a score that the state will accept for competency under any circumstances, whether you do EPP or not?

1027
02:36:31,529 --> 02:36:32,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it one student?

1028
02:36:32,589 --> 02:36:33,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it a hundred?

1029
02:36:34,630 --> 02:36:45,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I would say that if that's, let me calculate that and I will, because I don't wanna do the math in my head and then make a mistake.

1030
02:36:46,534 --> 02:36:52,259
[SPEAKER_19]: This just seems like the, this seems to me like the, the banner number.

1031
02:36:53,460 --> 02:37:00,246
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, of however many 10th graders we have what like 300 and something of every case.

1032
02:37:00,867 --> 02:37:04,830
[SPEAKER_19]: If you told me that half of our 10th graders are not going to get a diploma.

1033
02:37:05,411 --> 02:37:07,853
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we should all stop talking about other things for a while.

1034
02:37:11,027 --> 02:37:22,422
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't tell from so I mean what I see is 21% of our 10th graders had a score that in any other year they're not getting a diploma until they retested the state has decided.

1035
02:37:23,844 --> 02:37:25,286
[SPEAKER_19]: We won't make you take the test again.

1036
02:37:26,403 --> 02:37:37,726
[SPEAKER_19]: So 21% is like 60, 70 students who normally would not get a diploma without another passing test in math, but now can simply do this EPP instead.

1037
02:37:38,706 --> 02:37:42,667
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's 60 or 70 kids, and I'm just making numbers up roughly.

1038
02:37:43,207 --> 02:37:53,310
[SPEAKER_19]: But what, I mean, I don't know whether of the 79% of the other students, what percentage of them are

1039
02:37:55,930 --> 02:37:58,972
[SPEAKER_19]: not meeting expectations and are below 469.

1040
02:37:59,052 --> 02:38:02,033
[SPEAKER_20]: So a total of 294 students tested this year for 10th grade.

1041
02:38:02,053 --> 02:38:02,854
[SPEAKER_20]: 77 were the ones on

1042
02:38:15,730 --> 02:38:29,602
[SPEAKER_20]: ep 77% 77 of those do not have to take the exam at the they don't have to retest then plus another 99 plus another 27 so let's do that.

1043
02:38:37,689 --> 02:38:40,872
[SPEAKER_11]: hope that's not right, because that means 91 students.

1044
02:38:42,895 --> 02:38:48,058
[SPEAKER_19]: didn't meet expectations to the point where they won't even get a diploma if they can't get a passing test.

1045
02:38:54,421 --> 02:38:54,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Oops.

1046
02:38:55,042 --> 02:38:56,162
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

1047
02:38:58,804 --> 02:38:59,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's check that math.

1048
02:38:59,644 --> 02:39:00,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a little off.

1049
02:39:01,725 --> 02:39:02,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, probably.

1050
02:39:02,526 --> 02:39:04,087
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm doing it the other way.

1051
02:39:05,902 --> 02:39:13,886
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me get back to you because I just- My next question, of course, will be is how does that compare to the state?

1052
02:39:14,466 --> 02:39:27,493
[SPEAKER_19]: And I mean, the ones that are not meeting expectations and will not get a diploma until they pass a test or get to the 486 plus EPP in 11th or 12th grade or something.

1053
02:39:27,993 --> 02:39:29,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So page 11.

1054
02:39:29,994 --> 02:39:33,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Page 11 in the report gives a breakdown for grade 10.

1055
02:39:36,298 --> 02:39:50,985
[SPEAKER_07]: so that you can see that not me the only thing that I would yes so the number will be actually 14 percent of our students did not meet expectations where it was 10 for page 11 our page 11 has

1056
02:39:56,021 --> 02:39:57,022
[SPEAKER_20]: My report.

1057
02:39:57,102 --> 02:39:59,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the slide deck, in the report.

1058
02:39:59,104 --> 02:40:12,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Page 11 has a table that shows that 14% of students, Medford students, do not meet expectations, and it was 10% of state.

1059
02:40:13,676 --> 02:40:15,257
[SPEAKER_07]: That was about 42 students.

1060
02:40:17,860 --> 02:40:20,522
[SPEAKER_19]: And without spending all night on this,

1061
02:40:22,486 --> 02:40:35,951
[SPEAKER_19]: from your past experience, is that a dramatic increase or is it three times as many students or, I'm not asking for an exact number, but is it normal that there's two students and now we have 40 something students?

1062
02:40:36,491 --> 02:40:38,552
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not a dramatic increase.

1063
02:40:38,612 --> 02:40:49,376
[SPEAKER_20]: We have seen these numbers before and that's the group that we are gonna be focusing on more, but this is not,

1064
02:40:50,009 --> 02:40:52,310
[SPEAKER_20]: out of the norm, which is not a huge number.

1065
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:57,352
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see on 2021, it was 16% for the district and 12% for the state.

1066
02:40:57,372 --> 02:40:58,872
[SPEAKER_20]: So that 4% stays in that.

1067
02:40:58,892 --> 02:41:02,093
[SPEAKER_20]: And you can also see for 2021, it was 52 students in that category.

1068
02:41:10,868 --> 02:41:19,515
[SPEAKER_20]: yeah that's less is better yeah so our numbers people students who will be retesting will be definitely be lower than 42.

1069
02:41:19,695 --> 02:41:23,638
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, this not meeting expectations 42 is all.

1070
02:41:26,445 --> 02:41:28,086
[SPEAKER_19]: of the not meeting expectations.

1071
02:41:28,146 --> 02:41:28,666
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

1072
02:41:28,806 --> 02:41:39,373
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you take out from this number of 42, you take out the students who got right on the boundary, which is 469, which is about nine students.

1073
02:41:40,013 --> 02:41:41,614
[SPEAKER_20]: So then the rest of the students.

1074
02:41:42,435 --> 02:41:44,476
[SPEAKER_19]: So nine students were in the safe zone.

1075
02:41:44,916 --> 02:41:46,397
[SPEAKER_20]: They were in the EPP zone.

1076
02:41:46,617 --> 02:41:47,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, the EPP zone.

1077
02:41:48,118 --> 02:41:48,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1078
02:41:49,439 --> 02:41:49,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1079
02:41:50,180 --> 02:41:50,980
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't make it easy.

1080
02:41:52,081 --> 02:41:53,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1081
02:41:57,048 --> 02:41:57,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor.

1082
02:41:57,408 --> 02:42:00,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Melanie, yes.

1083
02:42:01,052 --> 02:42:01,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

1084
02:42:02,993 --> 02:42:03,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1085
02:42:05,376 --> 02:42:08,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Move on to English Language Arts.

1086
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:11,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, we have ELA.

1087
02:42:11,201 --> 02:42:12,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll wait till ELA.

1088
02:42:12,662 --> 02:42:15,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1089
02:42:15,685 --> 02:42:16,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Chiesa.

1090
02:42:16,786 --> 02:42:17,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1091
02:42:33,217 --> 02:42:34,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody.

1092
02:42:34,858 --> 02:42:35,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody.

1093
02:42:35,798 --> 02:42:36,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I on?

1094
02:42:36,438 --> 02:42:36,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1095
02:42:36,858 --> 02:42:37,198
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

1096
02:42:40,819 --> 02:42:44,941
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I am the last of the presenters for the subject areas.

1097
02:42:45,621 --> 02:42:48,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to follow a similar format to what Ms.

1098
02:42:48,762 --> 02:42:50,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Khan had done.

1099
02:42:50,582 --> 02:42:52,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll begin with the student growth percentiles.

1100
02:42:54,404 --> 02:42:56,184
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll do this way.

1101
02:42:56,284 --> 02:43:01,566
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, and as you were already told, the graph on the right

1102
02:43:02,728 --> 02:43:04,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the student growth percentile slide.

1103
02:43:04,409 --> 02:43:05,470
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ian, thank you.

1104
02:43:06,190 --> 02:43:11,433
[SPEAKER_00]: That has the legend of what low growth, low growth, typical growth, high growth would be.

1105
02:43:11,473 --> 02:43:13,614
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as it was for mathematics.

1106
02:43:14,195 --> 02:43:21,999
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that for all grade levels, we were within what DESE has determined as the typical growth area.

1107
02:43:22,459 --> 02:43:28,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there were a variety school to school, but this is the overall for grades four through 10.

1108
02:43:29,243 --> 02:43:29,744
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Ms.

1109
02:43:29,764 --> 02:43:30,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Khan said,

1110
02:43:30,794 --> 02:43:34,235
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously no data for grade three because there's no comparison point.

1111
02:43:36,376 --> 02:43:47,500
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move into third grade, we see that our students were on par with the state in the combined exceeding and meeting expectations performance levels.

1112
02:43:49,581 --> 02:43:58,124
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no SGP, as I just said, for grade three, and three out of our four elementary schools were able to exceed the state's combined performance level.

1113
02:43:59,364 --> 02:44:00,125
[SPEAKER_00]: For grade four,

1114
02:44:01,594 --> 02:44:09,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford outperformed the state in the combined exceeding and meeting expectations performance level by three percentage points.

1115
02:44:10,442 --> 02:44:18,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Two out of our four elementary schools exceeded that state average by 11 percentage points, which is quite significant.

1116
02:44:20,230 --> 02:44:26,635
[SPEAKER_00]: And grade four's district mean SGP was 47, which is defined as typical growth by DESE.

1117
02:44:28,072 --> 02:44:34,177
[SPEAKER_00]: All four elementary schools had an SGP of 43 or higher, which again is within the typical growth category.

1118
02:44:36,098 --> 02:44:40,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to fifth grade, we had a little dip compared to the state.

1119
02:44:41,322 --> 02:44:46,786
[SPEAKER_00]: We were three percentage points below the state in that combined exceeding and meeting expectations performance level.

1120
02:44:48,407 --> 02:44:53,070
[SPEAKER_00]: The SGP was still within the typical growth as defined by DESE at 45.

1121
02:44:55,078 --> 02:45:08,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And the SGP for the four elementary schools which you do have in the narrative more detailed report which you received range from 42 to 51 again falling within that typical growth category.

1122
02:45:11,093 --> 02:45:16,518
[SPEAKER_00]: The action items for elementary I know there's a lot listed there I won't go through each one unless you'd like me to.

1123
02:45:17,162 --> 02:45:20,404
[SPEAKER_00]: but similar to what Mr. Seary and Ms.

1124
02:45:20,444 --> 02:45:31,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Kahn said, we will be actively using NWEA MAP growth, which is our diagnostic assessment to support our students in K through five.

1125
02:45:32,412 --> 02:45:45,801
[SPEAKER_00]: At the elementary level, we'll continue with the strong implementation of ECRI, which is for our K through two students, but obviously has the impact, lays down that foundation for all elementary grades.

1126
02:45:47,454 --> 02:45:55,996
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be selecting our new district elementary reading program, which I'm happy to talk more about as I go through the presentation.

1127
02:45:57,297 --> 02:46:05,759
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue with our grade level data meetings and we're hopeful to have an MCAS extended day opportunity to support literacy needs.

1128
02:46:06,259 --> 02:46:14,481
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will continue to work with our special education and EL staff as well to make sure that we're supporting all of our groups of students.

1129
02:46:17,233 --> 02:46:18,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to our middle school.

1130
02:46:20,394 --> 02:46:27,217
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a dip in sixth grade, which we definitely have to look at and do some work with.

1131
02:46:27,277 --> 02:46:30,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were 10 percentage points below the state for grade six.

1132
02:46:31,259 --> 02:46:42,284
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still within the mean SGP for typical growth, but obviously we wanna be on par and ideally exceeding the state, which we have done in years past in grade six.

1133
02:46:43,164 --> 02:46:44,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So some work to do there.

1134
02:46:45,786 --> 02:46:46,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade seven.

1135
02:46:47,748 --> 02:46:52,991
[SPEAKER_00]: was where our seventh graders scored seven percentage points above the state.

1136
02:46:54,012 --> 02:47:05,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It was significant growth to years past, although we try not to compare too much to 21, given that this was a full year test and 2021 was half year test.

1137
02:47:05,939 --> 02:47:07,981
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean SGP was 53.

1138
02:47:08,461 --> 02:47:13,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to point out that at the Andrews, the mean SGP was 60, which fell within the high growth range.

1139
02:47:13,989 --> 02:47:17,771
[SPEAKER_00]: And the McGlynn stayed strong at 46 for typical growth range as well.

1140
02:47:17,811 --> 02:47:27,975
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended overall with typical growth in grade seven, and we were able to outperform the state in that category, in that combined category.

1141
02:47:29,976 --> 02:47:35,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade eight trailed six percentage points in exceeding and meeting expectations.

1142
02:47:35,998 --> 02:47:38,920
[SPEAKER_00]: We still had a strong SGP of typical growth within 48.

1143
02:47:40,622 --> 02:47:48,204
[SPEAKER_00]: and both schools did attain typical growth with 51 at the McGlynn and 44 at the Andrews.

1144
02:47:50,784 --> 02:47:57,306
[SPEAKER_00]: For action items at the middle school, we are, again, extensively going to use the NWEA map growth.

1145
02:47:57,846 --> 02:48:01,106
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be able to look at the students.

1146
02:48:01,286 --> 02:48:07,688
[SPEAKER_00]: We have literacy tier two support staff, one at the Andrews, one at the McGlynn,

1147
02:48:09,281 --> 02:48:14,765
[SPEAKER_00]: So this data will help keep us informed on the needs, the varying literacy needs of our students.

1148
02:48:14,785 --> 02:48:18,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we know, there are a lot of different literacy demands on our students.

1149
02:48:20,610 --> 02:48:25,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Each teacher receives specific data related to their own classrooms.

1150
02:48:25,593 --> 02:48:31,278
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the opportunity to look at how their students grew or didn't grow as much in the past.

1151
02:48:31,878 --> 02:48:37,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps us reflect on what curriculum and or instructional shifts we'll need to make.

1152
02:48:37,571 --> 02:48:41,494
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have the opportunity to look at the students they currently have.

1153
02:48:41,874 --> 02:48:43,275
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes a little bit of time.

1154
02:48:43,335 --> 02:48:48,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Desi doesn't give us this pretty report and says, here's the students you have now and here's their scores.

1155
02:48:48,759 --> 02:48:54,462
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's extremely important to reflect on the year before, but also the students in front of you.

1156
02:48:54,963 --> 02:48:58,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do create data drives so that the teachers will have that information.

1157
02:49:00,066 --> 02:49:02,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will look at that in department meetings throughout the year.

1158
02:49:03,008 --> 02:49:04,909
[SPEAKER_00]: We have

1159
02:49:06,209 --> 02:49:18,898
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely have Newsella implemented, which allows for students to access informational information, which we know is very important in the ELA test.

1160
02:49:19,819 --> 02:49:26,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Newsella helps students access informational pieces within their own Lexile levels.

1161
02:49:27,985 --> 02:49:30,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will continue to refine our curriculum.

1162
02:49:30,567 --> 02:49:33,609
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, of course, always working with our special education

1163
02:49:34,130 --> 02:49:43,032
[SPEAKER_00]: and English learner administrators, teachers, staff, to make sure we are engaging in a cohesive effort to support all of our students.

1164
02:49:46,053 --> 02:49:53,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, at the 10th grade level, the district's 10th grade across the district trailed the state by six percentage points.

1165
02:49:54,274 --> 02:50:01,216
[SPEAKER_00]: The district met the state average in exceeding expectations, but fell six percentage points below from meeting expectations.

1166
02:50:02,065 --> 02:50:09,889
[SPEAKER_00]: and the grade 10 mean SGP held strong at 54 within the higher end of typical growth.

1167
02:50:12,150 --> 02:50:13,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Touching upon what Ms.

1168
02:50:13,671 --> 02:50:21,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Khan just talked about and what Mr. Russo, what member Ruseau asked about was competency determination.

1169
02:50:21,615 --> 02:50:28,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting is the state has decided to label our students

1170
02:50:29,036 --> 02:50:31,097
[SPEAKER_00]: as partially meeting expectations.

1171
02:50:31,117 --> 02:50:47,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go back to that grade 10 slide for just one moment, we see that 34% of the district's 10th graders partially met expectations, which in previous years has meant that those students go on an EPP.

1172
02:50:49,361 --> 02:50:54,643
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the state has made a shift and they have said, if you get a 472 or higher,

1173
02:50:56,860 --> 02:51:02,181
[SPEAKER_00]: and 472 to 499 is within that partially meeting range.

1174
02:51:02,401 --> 02:51:06,982
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a 472 or higher, you're done, you've passed the MCAS.

1175
02:51:07,463 --> 02:51:17,805
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've met the competency determination rate, but we're still putting you in the partially meeting expectations, which is difficult to understand.

1176
02:51:17,865 --> 02:51:23,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the Department of Education sends a nice cover letter to explain this to parents as well.

1177
02:51:23,446 --> 02:51:25,527
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, just thinking about that,

1178
02:51:27,199 --> 02:51:29,340
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think it's something important to point out.

1179
02:51:29,820 --> 02:51:31,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does this mean for Medford?

1180
02:51:31,781 --> 02:51:38,803
[SPEAKER_00]: So within our partially meeting expectations group, and I could pull this out for our high schoolers.

1181
02:51:38,863 --> 02:51:42,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers aren't, you know, the first number is the district.

1182
02:51:42,564 --> 02:51:44,825
[SPEAKER_00]: So includes out of district, it includes everybody.

1183
02:51:45,345 --> 02:51:53,848
[SPEAKER_00]: But within our high school, we have 94% of partially meeting expectations who met the competency determination graduation requirement.

1184
02:51:54,318 --> 02:52:06,240
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that within that partially meeting range, only two students will go on an EPP, or thereabouts, you know, thereabouts.

1185
02:52:07,561 --> 02:52:14,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, in the past, if you got not meeting expectations, you automatically retest it.

1186
02:52:15,902 --> 02:52:17,423
[SPEAKER_00]: The state has also changed that.

1187
02:52:17,583 --> 02:52:18,563
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying if you have a 455,

1188
02:52:20,458 --> 02:52:26,281
[SPEAKER_00]: to a 471, you can go on an EPP to meet the competency determination graduation requirement.

1189
02:52:27,221 --> 02:52:35,565
[SPEAKER_00]: That leaves us with a very small number of students at our high school level that need to retest in order to achieve the competency determination.

1190
02:52:36,345 --> 02:52:39,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I point that out because it confused me a little bit as well.

1191
02:52:39,386 --> 02:52:47,189
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see partially meeting expectations, I assume that there has to be more to meet the graduation requirement, but the state has made these changes.

1192
02:52:50,316 --> 02:52:52,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Action items for the high school level.

1193
02:52:52,557 --> 02:53:00,740
[SPEAKER_00]: The use, again, we're looking really closely at the NWEA diagnostic tool that is given to our ninth and our 10th graders.

1194
02:53:00,800 --> 02:53:15,625
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to use that data to place students in what we call literacy challenge classes, which are tier two classes that meet two out of the six cycles, not graded, to help support their literacy needs.

1195
02:53:16,477 --> 02:53:23,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly to the middle and the high school, excuse me, to the middle school, we try to provide as much data as possible.

1196
02:53:23,401 --> 02:53:34,206
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to keep in mind that the 10th graders, our current juniors, the 10th graders who took this test, the last time they took the MCAS was when they were in seventh grade.

1197
02:53:34,226 --> 02:53:40,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at that data, the teachers have to keep that in mind that it's been three years since they had tested.

1198
02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:43,031
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparisons are a little tricky.

1199
02:53:44,112 --> 02:53:56,056
[SPEAKER_00]: But we definitely make sure that the teachers have data of the students in front of them, which would mean their grade eight tests, which they did take, and the data of their former students as well.

1200
02:53:56,436 --> 02:53:57,477
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we can look.

1201
02:53:57,557 --> 02:54:02,518
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say, did they fall short in informational understanding and main idea and vocab?

1202
02:54:02,918 --> 02:54:06,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start to make some changes based on the sequencing.

1203
02:54:08,940 --> 02:54:09,741
[SPEAKER_00]: That concludes.

1204
02:54:09,781 --> 02:54:10,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't talk too quickly.

1205
02:54:11,962 --> 02:54:17,626
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go last, sometimes I go a little more quickly than normal, but I'm happy to answer the questions that you have.

1206
02:54:20,608 --> 02:54:20,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1207
02:54:26,833 --> 02:54:28,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays, then Member McLaughlin.

1208
02:54:32,156 --> 02:54:40,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I have a question about looking at the anchor strand analysis, which I know you don't talk about at this point, but we had it in our binder.

1209
02:54:41,150 --> 02:55:00,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing that stood out to me is that our lowest scores pretty much by far are in any question that involves writing, whether it was an actual essay or constructed response, they call it, or, you know, and to be fair, it matched the state really that that's true for the state too.

1210
02:55:00,845 --> 02:55:05,288
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm wondering for our district, what are we doing to really focus?

1211
02:55:05,668 --> 02:55:09,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we should focus on all of reading obviously, but clearly that's a,

1212
02:55:09,895 --> 02:55:11,015
[SPEAKER_05]: difficulty for our kids.

1213
02:55:11,075 --> 02:55:16,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, if you could also explain to me, what does production and distribution of writing refer to?

1214
02:55:16,778 --> 02:55:21,940
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny you ask that, because I thought that might be a question that the group asked, because it's a little funny.

1215
02:55:21,960 --> 02:55:24,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I start with that one, and then go back to your question?

1216
02:55:25,061 --> 02:55:29,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Production and distribution of writing falls within the English language arts standards.

1217
02:55:29,643 --> 02:55:36,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has three different pieces that fall under it, two of which can't really be tested on.

1218
02:55:36,725 --> 02:55:38,546
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, can use technology

1219
02:55:39,042 --> 02:55:42,685
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce writing, that's not gonna be something we see presented in the MCAS.

1220
02:55:43,386 --> 02:55:46,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one was able to publish work.

1221
02:55:47,089 --> 02:55:50,192
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really gonna see that as a percentage in here.

1222
02:55:50,812 --> 02:55:57,278
[SPEAKER_00]: What production and distribution of writing is for the MCAS is about how are you organizing your ideas?

1223
02:55:58,118 --> 02:56:04,684
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you setting up your body paragraphs, your intro, your conclusion to create some structure within there?

1224
02:56:06,361 --> 02:56:09,524
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what production and distribution of writing means on the MCAS.

1225
02:56:09,644 --> 02:56:14,087
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think about it more in the English classroom, it's going to mean a little bit more beyond that.

1226
02:56:14,387 --> 02:56:17,930
[SPEAKER_00]: With writing, you know, I saw that it varied.

1227
02:56:17,950 --> 02:56:19,871
[SPEAKER_00]: It did hit the state.

1228
02:56:20,152 --> 02:56:22,033
[SPEAKER_00]: It did hit or surpass the state in some grades.

1229
02:56:22,113 --> 02:56:24,275
[SPEAKER_00]: It did fall below the state in other grades.

1230
02:56:24,715 --> 02:56:34,983
[SPEAKER_00]: What we try to do, what we've seen with the writing on the MCAS over the past few years is that we've realized that writing is now defined as writing in response to reading.

1231
02:56:35,581 --> 02:56:47,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So no longer is it, they used to in fourth and seventh grade have the writing test and it would, you know, allow you to have some creativity within your writing, expand on your ideas a little bit more.

1232
02:56:48,248 --> 02:56:56,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the writing is usually, we don't know which one we're going to get, but it's usually a narrative, which means that not, but not a personal narrative.

1233
02:56:56,973 --> 02:57:01,976
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, take the story and retell what you just read in a different point of view.

1234
02:57:02,668 --> 02:57:06,470
[SPEAKER_00]: or continue the story, but you have to have fidelity to the original story.

1235
02:57:06,790 --> 02:57:14,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that where we have a lot of creative students, I still think that, you know, I love creative writing.

1236
02:57:14,114 --> 02:57:17,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think, you know, our tendency would be to go that route.

1237
02:57:17,296 --> 02:57:19,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have to work with the students to, um,

1238
02:57:23,041 --> 02:57:25,443
[SPEAKER_00]: use the way the state has defined narrative writing.

1239
02:57:25,523 --> 02:57:29,165
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's something that we've, that's been a shift and that's something we're working on.

1240
02:57:29,185 --> 02:57:37,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other challenge with writing, and again, I do think, you know, some grades we dipped that seem to be in grades where we dipped in other areas as well.

1241
02:57:37,190 --> 02:57:49,238
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed kind of consistent to me across the board, but the other area of writing that is definitely a struggle for some of our students is most of the passages, even the fourth grade passage that they allowed published online,

1242
02:57:50,043 --> 02:57:58,273
[SPEAKER_00]: asks you to not just write about one piece of writing, you're reading, it gives you two passages and it forces you to write about both.

1243
02:57:58,413 --> 02:58:09,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a question about explain how the use of recycling is important as evidenced by both texts, the students have to pull information from both

1244
02:58:10,181 --> 02:58:10,562
[SPEAKER_00]: excerpts.

1245
02:58:10,642 --> 02:58:13,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't, they automatically lose points.

1246
02:58:13,885 --> 02:58:18,529
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to understand what they're reading, which is a huge part because they can't write what they're reading about.

1247
02:58:19,030 --> 02:58:24,615
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are definitely our assessments are definitely doing that within the classroom to prepare them.

1248
02:58:25,015 --> 02:58:35,105
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still think it's a challenge to navigate three sometimes hard reading passages, and then to have to write about all three of them and be penalized without so something we're still continuing to work on.

1249
02:58:35,506 --> 02:58:39,848
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that explains some of the changes we've seen over the past couple of years with the MCASA.

1250
02:58:39,948 --> 02:58:40,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

1251
02:58:40,688 --> 02:58:40,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1252
02:58:40,988 --> 02:58:43,769
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a huge difference in what kids can do.

1253
02:58:43,869 --> 02:58:47,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a completely different task than writing a, used to just be the essay.

1254
02:58:47,450 --> 02:58:48,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was used to seeing.

1255
02:58:48,731 --> 02:58:49,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

1256
02:58:49,671 --> 02:59:03,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not always a change that we love because we do like creative writing and we do have our students engage in it, but the way we sequence our writing, we have to, you know, have that fall at a different time of year for the students so that they are prepared for this.

1257
02:59:04,721 --> 02:59:05,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1258
02:59:05,262 --> 02:59:05,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1259
02:59:05,703 --> 02:59:06,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1260
02:59:06,967 --> 02:59:07,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

1261
02:59:11,878 --> 02:59:12,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1262
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:14,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the presentation, Dr. Chiesa.

1263
02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:25,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was wondering if you had same going back to do the chair what number was so was saying earlier just about, you know, the number percentage wise and I apologize.

1264
02:59:25,070 --> 02:59:30,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually not in a position where I have my, my book in front of me.

1265
02:59:30,736 --> 02:59:36,242
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's a number that has sort of what is the 10th grade rate of

1266
02:59:37,418 --> 02:59:42,382
[SPEAKER_06]: students that did not meet expectations on the exam.

1267
02:59:42,442 --> 02:59:54,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess getting back to the other curriculum pieces as well, and this is what I was getting to earlier, is that disaggregated by demographics of who is not meeting expectations?

1268
02:59:54,673 --> 02:59:59,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just want to sort of look at, is there, you know, are we talking about, you know, trauma informed schools?

1269
02:59:59,898 --> 03:00:01,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we talking about, you know, more,

1270
03:00:02,253 --> 03:00:04,195
[SPEAKER_06]: of one population than the other, I don't know.

1271
03:00:04,255 --> 03:00:05,696
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it's two questions in there.

1272
03:00:05,736 --> 03:00:11,260
[SPEAKER_06]: How many students, if you broke down your percentage, for 10th grade did not meet expectations?

1273
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:18,045
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, i.e., unless they test and pass again, would not get a diploma.

1274
03:00:18,966 --> 03:00:23,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And is that then disaggregated further in terms of the demographic?

1275
03:00:25,371 --> 03:00:28,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're hitting upon, Member McLaughlin,

1276
03:00:30,848 --> 03:00:34,769
[SPEAKER_00]: conundrum that we're seeing this year with the percentages and the numbers.

1277
03:00:35,789 --> 03:00:46,911
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look at the, sorry, if I look at Medford's data for 10th grade, 13% of our district did not meet expectations.

1278
03:00:47,471 --> 03:00:52,172
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in a normal year, that would mean that those students must retest.

1279
03:00:52,772 --> 03:01:00,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the state has said a 455, which falls within not meeting expectations or higher

1280
03:01:01,397 --> 03:01:09,463
[SPEAKER_00]: just simply has to go on an EPP, doesn't have to retest, goes on the EPP, and then meets the competency determination.

1281
03:01:10,583 --> 03:01:24,673
[SPEAKER_00]: When I pull out what that means in terms of the number of students who have to retest, that leaves us with a very small number, below five that need to retest within our high school.

1282
03:01:26,820 --> 03:01:27,961
[SPEAKER_00]: which is positive news.

1283
03:01:28,821 --> 03:01:39,307
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course we wanna be in the meeting and exceeding, but that hopefully gives you a sense without being too specific given the smaller, I don't wanna be too specific given the smaller number of students.

1284
03:01:40,547 --> 03:01:49,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, okay, I'm not exactly sure on if we pulled out what that small number of students looks like in terms of subgroups.

1285
03:01:49,332 --> 03:01:50,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's what you're asking.

1286
03:01:51,113 --> 03:01:53,915
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that information at the time.

1287
03:01:53,975 --> 03:01:56,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the subgroup information within the packet

1288
03:01:56,820 --> 03:01:58,821
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is a little bit more holistic.

1289
03:02:00,501 --> 03:02:08,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and since the numbers are different as an odd year, maybe the data next year would be better in terms of knowing what the disaggregated data is.

1290
03:02:09,944 --> 03:02:10,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1291
03:02:10,804 --> 03:02:16,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And the class of 2026 will be crystal clear as you can see from that slide 49 too.

1292
03:02:16,566 --> 03:02:18,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1293
03:02:19,507 --> 03:02:19,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1294
03:02:22,528 --> 03:02:23,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hays.

1295
03:02:23,868 --> 03:02:24,468
[SPEAKER_05]: One more question.

1296
03:02:24,649 --> 03:02:25,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1297
03:02:26,584 --> 03:02:29,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it been implemented across the board now?

1298
03:02:29,225 --> 03:02:31,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you mentioned that as one of the action items.

1299
03:02:31,825 --> 03:02:34,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it in every classroom now?

1300
03:02:34,226 --> 03:02:34,906
[SPEAKER_00]: K through two.

1301
03:02:35,326 --> 03:02:36,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's in K through two.

1302
03:02:36,787 --> 03:02:37,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1303
03:02:37,867 --> 03:02:38,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

1304
03:02:38,067 --> 03:02:48,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Galussi has worked very hard on making sure that the professional development with Hill for Literacy has been there every step of the way so that the teachers felt really supported.

1305
03:02:49,510 --> 03:02:55,812
[SPEAKER_00]: And the initial data from NWEA shows growth in phonics, but I know we're not talking about that tonight,

1306
03:02:57,297 --> 03:03:00,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly it is implemented K one and two at this point.

1307
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:00,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

1308
03:03:01,080 --> 03:03:02,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to add anything?

1309
03:03:04,744 --> 03:03:08,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the only thing I would add is that it was fully implemented last year as well.

1310
03:03:08,608 --> 03:03:10,530
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is we're now going on year two.

1311
03:03:11,891 --> 03:03:12,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1312
03:03:12,712 --> 03:03:13,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1313
03:03:13,613 --> 03:03:15,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for a great presentation.

1314
03:03:15,374 --> 03:03:15,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1315
03:03:16,115 --> 03:03:16,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you everyone.

1316
03:03:18,720 --> 03:03:20,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they have a little bit more time.

1317
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:21,521
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go really quickly.

1318
03:03:21,541 --> 03:03:21,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1319
03:03:21,821 --> 03:03:32,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the last, Dr. Riccardelli and I, the last three slides just talk overall, which I know that all of the curriculum directors spoke about.

1320
03:03:32,403 --> 03:03:45,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the only thing that we would just high level, because presentation, would just be that to recap a little bit, our focus here at the public schools has always been on the whole child throughout the pandemic.

1321
03:03:45,926 --> 03:03:48,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that balance of making sure that students

1322
03:03:48,801 --> 03:03:53,225
[SPEAKER_07]: social emotional needs are met will also increase their academic outcomes.

1323
03:03:54,306 --> 03:04:04,494
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a lot of responses to make sure that that balance was there for students in terms of the responsive classroom and Nexus and Camp Mustang.

1324
03:04:04,714 --> 03:04:13,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So the list of things that we've done to help mitigate that learning loss to meet their social emotional needs will continue for next year.

1325
03:04:14,990 --> 03:04:30,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all of the curriculum directors spoke, we've had questions about the NWEA, but that is the progress monitoring piece just to remind you that is three times a year, so that that allows for the progress monitoring so that we can triangulate that data.

1326
03:04:31,504 --> 03:04:32,925
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things we are doing is

1327
03:04:35,982 --> 03:04:39,784
[SPEAKER_07]: having the data teams to talk about that.

1328
03:04:40,844 --> 03:04:45,526
[SPEAKER_07]: The curriculum directors are doing with their departments, but principals are also doing it with their staff.

1329
03:04:45,946 --> 03:05:05,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So that between the MCAS data, as well as the NWBA data, we're able to have data team meetings for progress monitoring, bring in the SST or the student supports plans, if need be, in order to create the supports that students need to make growth.

1330
03:05:08,798 --> 03:05:12,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so as we as we move forward.

1331
03:05:12,719 --> 03:05:14,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked a lot about what we're going to do.

1332
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:18,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We reflected back on our strategic plan.

1333
03:05:18,581 --> 03:05:25,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So our strategic plan is our map forward that we can we constructed a couple of years ago we did not forget it.

1334
03:05:25,942 --> 03:05:26,723
[SPEAKER_04]: It provides.

1335
03:05:28,243 --> 03:05:28,944
[SPEAKER_04]: A roadmap.

1336
03:05:29,324 --> 03:05:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So in looking at that we.

1337
03:05:32,548 --> 03:05:43,739
[SPEAKER_04]: It's taken right out of the strategic plan is to support instruction that focuses in on evidence based responses productive struggle academic discourse access for all in feedback.

1338
03:05:44,375 --> 03:05:49,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So standard two, when it comes to evaluating teachers is instruction.

1339
03:05:50,039 --> 03:05:56,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So along with that instruction, we are providing professional development, the focus in on those areas.

1340
03:05:57,524 --> 03:06:04,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to enhance faculty understanding on how these five core actions apply to the various content areas.

1341
03:06:06,180 --> 03:06:11,423
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to support a classroom culture of productive struggle and academic discourse.

1342
03:06:11,843 --> 03:06:22,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So by productive struggle, we're talking about that instruction that makes students reach, that it's not right there, but it's not so far away that they get frustrated.

1343
03:06:22,668 --> 03:06:28,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a zone, a zone of proximal development that is different for every student.

1344
03:06:29,091 --> 03:06:31,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where the differentiated instruction comes in.

1345
03:06:33,275 --> 03:06:41,223
[SPEAKER_04]: written and conversational evidence based responses by students, along with progressive and supported targeted feedback by educators.

1346
03:06:41,563 --> 03:06:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really looking for our teachers to give significant strategic feedback to students.

1347
03:06:50,289 --> 03:07:03,433
[SPEAKER_04]: to provide supportive and targeted feedback to instructional staff, consistent with district-sponsored supervision and evaluation, which is a two-year professional development program that our administrators have been going through.

1348
03:07:03,853 --> 03:07:18,358
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only do we want our teachers providing strategic feedback to our students, we want our administrators, including myself and my colleagues, to give that targeted feedback to teachers and other staff.

1349
03:07:19,622 --> 03:07:23,124
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to expand opportunities for peer observation through learning walks.

1350
03:07:23,324 --> 03:07:35,329
[SPEAKER_04]: If you remember, the superintendent started the work learning walks a few years ago, it's been on a hiatus for obvious reasons, but we do want to bring that back in a robust manner.

1351
03:07:37,591 --> 03:07:46,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked a little bit last time I was here, at least about the enhancement of our district's new educator mentoring and induction program, specifically for our newest staff.

1352
03:07:46,776 --> 03:08:05,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're hoping with the targeted feedback, with the focus on providing instruction that is, you know, a reach for student, but not so far of a reach that it's frustrating, along with support for them and our staff, we will be able to move forward in a positive way in our three MCAS tested subject areas.

1353
03:08:07,573 --> 03:08:07,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1354
03:08:09,855 --> 03:08:10,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Amber Hayes.

1355
03:08:12,017 --> 03:08:12,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, thanks.

1356
03:08:12,437 --> 03:08:15,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a general question, and this is why I waited until the end.

1357
03:08:17,902 --> 03:08:36,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at the data, when you do disaggregate by school, and I've only gotten so far at this point of doing elementary ELA, but there is a trend when you look back through the years of certain schools having higher scores than others, and it seems to mirror

1358
03:08:37,643 --> 03:08:39,384
[SPEAKER_05]: needs of the population in those schools.

1359
03:08:40,065 --> 03:08:51,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious about how that figures into your, you know, your data dives and what you're talking about and how you determine then equitable distribution of resources.

1360
03:08:53,172 --> 03:08:57,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how you level the playing field for those who are starting maybe with less.

1361
03:09:01,112 --> 03:09:15,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I think first, I would probably speak to part of the shift to the data is that's something that we're still kind of honing that practice in terms of like the data teams.

1362
03:09:15,700 --> 03:09:20,743
[SPEAKER_07]: The trend, so three of our four elementary schools qualify for Title I services.

1363
03:09:21,343 --> 03:09:26,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that is, so the two schools with the neediest population,

1364
03:09:27,389 --> 03:09:30,292
[SPEAKER_07]: require the more support in that area.

1365
03:09:30,552 --> 03:09:38,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have more staff put towards servicing students in those areas.

1366
03:09:39,179 --> 03:09:53,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as Dr. Riccadeli spoke to it, the need for the support is there, but there also is still the need for like the continued professional development and the focus on standard two, because the tier one piece is,

1367
03:09:55,692 --> 03:10:21,816
[SPEAKER_07]: really a big focus of where we're going right now, because the standard one is professional knowledge, and that piece I think is there, but the standard two of teaching all students and meeting students where they're at is the piece that is our continued work, so that we're also focusing, because for the standard two and meeting students where they're at,

1368
03:10:22,836 --> 03:10:51,896
[SPEAKER_07]: ensuring that we're meeting the needs of all of our students, that's general education students, that's our subgroups, that's the supports we're talking about globally and across schools, across grade levels, and across the district, and the enhancement of the professional development, the student support teams, the SSTs, the data dives, all of that is the work that we're putting in place right now so that we have clear

1369
03:10:52,552 --> 03:11:03,802
[SPEAKER_07]: student support plans that are going to meet those needs and then also uncover if there are other layers of support that we can add to those buildings that are going to be beneficial and meaningful.

1370
03:11:06,665 --> 03:11:19,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I guess I would hesitate to um a classroom teacher can only do so much if they've got a lot of needs in their classroom and they can be a wonderful great teacher who

1371
03:11:20,543 --> 03:11:23,925
[SPEAKER_05]: does all the things that a teacher needs to do to meet the needs of their students.

1372
03:11:23,985 --> 03:11:29,169
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've got more of those needs in your classroom, it's just going to be harder.

1373
03:11:29,249 --> 03:11:32,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what I mean, I guess, in terms of looking how we spread out our supports.

1374
03:11:35,473 --> 03:11:38,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just hoping that's a part of that.

1375
03:11:38,415 --> 03:11:41,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got limited resources, but it's just a question of, are we using them?

1376
03:11:42,058 --> 03:11:48,422
[SPEAKER_05]: When I look at the data and I see that we're really not leveling very much, at least as far as I can see from the data.

1377
03:11:49,895 --> 03:12:02,139
[SPEAKER_05]: between the schools and, you know, how we try to do that when we're, you know, our focus is on equity and are we looking at how to, how we use our resources equitably?

1378
03:12:02,579 --> 03:12:03,759
[SPEAKER_07]: We are, we are.

1379
03:12:04,600 --> 03:12:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that's part of something that is not going to be done overnight.

1380
03:12:08,401 --> 03:12:18,224
[SPEAKER_07]: That's part of the, the partnership here between Dr. Rigodelli and myself in doing, and with Joan Bowen and Paul Texera and having

1381
03:12:19,045 --> 03:12:22,788
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at the data and having those meetings to see where the supports are needed.

1382
03:12:23,169 --> 03:12:25,290
[SPEAKER_07]: That is definitely a part of the conversation.

1383
03:12:25,971 --> 03:12:26,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1384
03:12:27,893 --> 03:12:28,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor?

1385
03:12:28,293 --> 03:12:32,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin?

1386
03:12:33,803 --> 03:12:34,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

1387
03:12:35,785 --> 03:12:38,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the overall summation.

1388
03:12:38,488 --> 03:12:40,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to, there was, I had a couple of questions.

1389
03:12:40,770 --> 03:12:42,011
[SPEAKER_06]: One was on the second page.

1390
03:12:42,051 --> 03:12:46,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was a listing of items that were being done and one of them was advisories.

1391
03:12:46,296 --> 03:12:50,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was wondering if you could elaborate on what the advisories are, like what is that?

1392
03:12:52,722 --> 03:12:54,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So the advisories at the high school,

1393
03:13:00,057 --> 03:13:00,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1394
03:13:00,778 --> 03:13:01,039
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1395
03:13:01,119 --> 03:13:02,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm advisories at the high school.

1396
03:13:02,782 --> 03:13:05,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that that it says advisories.

1397
03:13:05,587 --> 03:13:06,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what she's talking about.

1398
03:13:06,648 --> 03:13:06,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um,

1399
03:13:09,196 --> 03:13:11,818
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm trying to think of the frequencies of the advisories.

1400
03:13:11,878 --> 03:13:14,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they're every two weeks at the high school.

1401
03:13:14,439 --> 03:13:16,100
[SPEAKER_04]: There are different topics that are brought up.

1402
03:13:16,660 --> 03:13:23,844
[SPEAKER_04]: They focus mainly on social emotional needs of the students at the high school.

1403
03:13:23,864 --> 03:13:30,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what the last topic was at the last advisory, which I believe was the last week.

1404
03:13:31,328 --> 03:13:32,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I have limited time.

1405
03:13:33,362 --> 03:13:34,422
[SPEAKER_04]: information on that.

1406
03:13:34,842 --> 03:13:35,463
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they?

1407
03:13:36,723 --> 03:13:38,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand what the advisories are.

1408
03:13:40,004 --> 03:13:40,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are.

1409
03:13:43,245 --> 03:13:46,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a time built into the high school schedule.

1410
03:13:46,226 --> 03:13:50,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It's approximately every two weeks, where I believe it's 30 minutes.

1411
03:13:51,307 --> 03:13:59,490
[SPEAKER_04]: The advisory teacher, which is also known as the homeroom teacher, will engage students in different activities focused around

1412
03:14:00,609 --> 03:14:15,975
[SPEAKER_04]: could be social-emotional health, it'd be some presentation that the high school administration is putting on, but it's to provide a more well-rounded opportunity for students.

1413
03:14:15,995 --> 03:14:24,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not focused in academics, it's focused on other, again, social-emotional wellbeing enhancement.

1414
03:14:28,259 --> 03:14:31,842
[SPEAKER_17]: The advisories work collaboratively with Miss Stacey Shulman.

1415
03:14:32,543 --> 03:14:41,490
[SPEAKER_17]: So, sometimes the her team, the guidance team and others are also deeply involved in what happens during advisory blocks.

1416
03:14:42,010 --> 03:14:50,437
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is definitely a self focus at the high school level, I can't say it's the exact equivalent of a nexus but if you were trying to

1417
03:14:50,717 --> 03:14:57,759
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, make a connection, I would say it's the high school version of Nexus that takes place like twice a month or something like that.

1418
03:14:58,839 --> 03:14:59,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1419
03:14:59,839 --> 03:15:19,684
[SPEAKER_06]: And then getting back to, again, through the chair, member Hays' point, and this is sort of what I've been saying throughout the presentations tonight around the demographic piece and really looking at, you know, teasing out the data in terms of what we're seeing on paper as well as we're talking about equity, because there are some schools

1420
03:15:22,128 --> 03:15:24,250
[SPEAKER_06]: who regularly score higher than other schools.

1421
03:15:24,310 --> 03:15:33,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all know that that's not because the students at a particular school or the teachers at a particular school are smarter or else than the other schools.

1422
03:15:35,178 --> 03:15:36,139
[SPEAKER_06]: There's reasons for that.

1423
03:15:36,219 --> 03:15:42,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we need to dig into what are the reasons for that and how are we equitably looking at our schools so that all of our students

1424
03:15:43,103 --> 03:15:49,264
[SPEAKER_06]: and all of our teachers are being, you know, equitably represented.

1425
03:15:49,704 --> 03:15:57,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And so to that end, I was also wondering, I know you guys are, you know, always plan exceptional and professional development.

1426
03:15:57,906 --> 03:16:02,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there was discussion around using experts that are already within the district for professional development.

1427
03:16:03,247 --> 03:16:08,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had seen at some point a spreadsheet on what professional development is offered sort of annually.

1428
03:16:08,548 --> 03:16:09,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm wondering if there's an opportunity

1429
03:16:10,595 --> 03:16:26,245
[SPEAKER_06]: for the school committee to see that as well so that we can be informed as we're looking at the MCAS reports and the governance sort of overall of the district, how the professional development is lending itself to the equitable piece as well.

1430
03:16:26,525 --> 03:16:32,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And in terms of resources for teachers and how we're using expertise within the district.

1431
03:16:32,189 --> 03:16:39,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a spreadsheet or list that can be shared with school committee in terms of what special, what professional development is being offered?

1432
03:16:42,395 --> 03:16:45,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we can compile that list.

1433
03:16:46,779 --> 03:16:50,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them were highlighted in this presentation this evening.

1434
03:16:51,043 --> 03:16:56,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it will be reiterated as we present the NWEA map results in terms of our focus.

1435
03:16:57,269 --> 03:17:07,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think it's important to note that in part of the restructuring that the superintendent did over the summer, and Dr. Riccadeli and I

1436
03:17:08,514 --> 03:17:18,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Working even more closely, one of the structures that we are implementing starting this year is having those leveled conversations with building principals.

1437
03:17:19,240 --> 03:17:32,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So that we're going out once a month to meet with the middle school principals to meet with the high school principals to have some of these conversations about data and using the data to inform instruction.

1438
03:17:33,360 --> 03:17:39,244
[SPEAKER_07]: and what they're doing in their buildings to build those support systems and how they're working with their teachers.

1439
03:17:39,984 --> 03:17:45,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that we're starting this year and will be ongoing.

1440
03:17:45,108 --> 03:17:57,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is an opportunity exactly created for what you're speaking about member McLaughlin, so that we'll be able to have those really deep conversations about supporting all of our students.

1441
03:18:00,609 --> 03:18:01,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1442
03:18:01,249 --> 03:18:03,451
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I think it's about diversifying as well.

1443
03:18:03,511 --> 03:18:04,812
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate that.

1444
03:18:04,852 --> 03:18:08,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that there's a commitment to equity, as you know, part of the bigger plan.

1445
03:18:08,574 --> 03:18:11,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm excited about what the future holds for us in that realm.

1446
03:18:11,816 --> 03:18:20,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also just sort of wanted to ask, yeah, I appreciate the product, the professional development, as well, just so we can understand sort of how

1447
03:18:20,757 --> 03:18:39,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the cultural competency just all the stuff that we're talking about how that's actually being applied so we can see, you know, because the governance does sort of go hand in hand with how that how that looks and what that you know what that is working and I just also wanted to add that when we're talking about populations and the differing populations in our school.

1448
03:18:40,031 --> 03:18:43,793
[SPEAKER_06]: that, you know, we're talking about our vulnerable populations.

1449
03:18:43,833 --> 03:18:44,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1450
03:18:44,213 --> 03:18:46,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we talk often about what equity is.

1451
03:18:46,834 --> 03:18:48,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not that everybody gets the same.

1452
03:18:48,395 --> 03:18:49,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that individuals get what they need.

1453
03:18:50,036 --> 03:18:50,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1454
03:18:50,236 --> 03:18:51,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody gets what they need.

1455
03:18:51,236 --> 03:18:52,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people need more.

1456
03:18:52,117 --> 03:18:56,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people need less based on what their backgrounds are based on what you know where they're at.

1457
03:18:57,499 --> 03:18:58,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think

1458
03:18:59,918 --> 03:19:06,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily wanna classify or categorize our students as the neediest students.

1459
03:19:06,779 --> 03:19:12,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna ensure that we're saying that our students can be more vulnerable in varying situations.

1460
03:19:12,480 --> 03:19:15,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanna make sure that there's a big difference in terms, and words matter, right?

1461
03:19:15,981 --> 03:19:28,463
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big difference in terms of looking at people as needy, as opposed to people that have different learning styles and that have additional resources or what have you.

1462
03:19:29,176 --> 03:19:29,957
[SPEAKER_06]: that are vulnerable.

1463
03:19:30,057 --> 03:19:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would prefer, you know, that we're talking about vulnerable as opposed to neediest.

1464
03:19:33,842 --> 03:19:37,727
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just wanted to put that out there as well, because I think that that words matter.

1465
03:19:38,428 --> 03:19:38,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1466
03:19:44,616 --> 03:19:45,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mistel.

1467
03:19:45,797 --> 03:19:46,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1468
03:19:46,840 --> 03:19:48,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you everybody for all the presentation.

1469
03:19:49,262 --> 03:19:57,447
[SPEAKER_14]: I do feel like I'm kind of in a time warp because it was probably more than five years ago, or maybe just about, I don't think many people in this room were there then.

1470
03:19:58,147 --> 03:20:05,812
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a concern with MCAS that the Brooks had nailed it in every area, in every grade, in every subject, and unfortunately other schools did not.

1471
03:20:06,412 --> 03:20:14,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And what came up was Title I, the three schools had Title I, but the Brooks still had a reading specialist that did the work of Title I, but wasn't paid for by Title I.

1472
03:20:15,109 --> 03:20:19,832
[SPEAKER_14]: At the Roberts, I know firsthand, oh, I can figure it out, because Quinn was in second grade, and now she's a sophomore in college.

1473
03:20:19,852 --> 03:20:20,913
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's how long ago it was.

1474
03:20:21,513 --> 03:20:32,420
[SPEAKER_14]: So she tested for Title I. Unfortunately, she was not the lowest of the seven that made it to Title I. So her teacher said, unfortunately, she's not the lowest of the seven.

1475
03:20:32,440 --> 03:20:34,441
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right, she definitely has a reading hiccup.

1476
03:20:35,402 --> 03:20:41,606
[SPEAKER_14]: So I said, so if she was in another class or another school, she might have been the lowest of the seven, depending who her peers were.

1477
03:20:41,966 --> 03:20:54,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think, and tell me if I'm not saying what people are thinking, but I think that's where the concern is like we have schools that have much greater need, but they still have the same staff as the Brooks who's doing great.

1478
03:20:55,457 --> 03:21:04,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's where the frustrations coming from like shouldn't we put the support for the school that might have 14 kids who really need title one but only seven of them are eligible.

1479
03:21:05,470 --> 03:21:07,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a great question.

1480
03:21:09,112 --> 03:21:17,775
[SPEAKER_07]: First, there is a mathematical way in which I have to put the supports based on the grant.

1481
03:21:18,976 --> 03:21:24,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, and of course, again, it's supplement, not supplant.

1482
03:21:24,498 --> 03:21:30,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I take where you just mentioned the Roberts, the Roberts has one Title I teacher, two remedial reading.

1483
03:21:31,681 --> 03:21:34,362
[SPEAKER_07]: The Brooks has two reading.

1484
03:21:35,526 --> 03:21:41,751
[SPEAKER_07]: not associated with title one and then the needs increased so the staff increases across the district.

1485
03:21:43,032 --> 03:21:54,181
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the shifts we've done during the pandemic is we're no longer using that ratio in order to determine students eligibility for receiving those tier two services.

1486
03:21:54,201 --> 03:21:54,562
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

1487
03:21:54,982 --> 03:22:01,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Because just like that calculation where it used to be the lowest six students.

1488
03:22:01,588 --> 03:22:01,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1489
03:22:02,148 --> 03:22:07,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we're doing is we're looking at the student need across grade levels.

1490
03:22:07,593 --> 03:22:09,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the lowest percentage of students

1491
03:22:12,048 --> 03:22:16,570
[SPEAKER_07]: We're assessing those students for their eligibility to receive the services.

1492
03:22:17,451 --> 03:22:23,154
[SPEAKER_07]: That way we're able to really service the students that require it the most.

1493
03:22:24,074 --> 03:22:32,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, also, I know I've said it but I'm just going to echo it again, or punctuated because of member McLaughlin statement is that.

1494
03:22:34,279 --> 03:22:37,762
[SPEAKER_07]: The tier two services need to be there to support 100%.

1495
03:22:38,122 --> 03:22:40,865
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the things that I'm looking at.

1496
03:22:42,806 --> 03:22:54,936
[SPEAKER_07]: But there also still is a need for the tier one, which is what is happening in the classroom, and what may be missed opportunities or what can we do to enhance like the,

1497
03:22:57,389 --> 03:23:05,531
[SPEAKER_07]: the tier one instruction to make sure that all teachers have what they need in order to meet their students needs within the classroom.

1498
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:17,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Because sometimes if you do look at the data, sometimes there are blips in where it's not necessarily a school with the most vulnerable where we see a dip.

1499
03:23:17,735 --> 03:23:21,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have to look at that data too, because, oh, there might be something going on.

1500
03:23:22,560 --> 03:23:24,601
[SPEAKER_07]: this school at this particular grade level.

1501
03:23:24,881 --> 03:23:26,763
[SPEAKER_14]: And right, we have math.

1502
03:23:26,843 --> 03:23:32,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember what the yeah, the teacher had been out and then the replacement was out.

1503
03:23:32,226 --> 03:23:35,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And then yeah, there's a lot of variables.

1504
03:23:35,708 --> 03:23:38,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that that's just my only point.

1505
03:23:38,250 --> 03:23:41,792
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know, I probably got a little off track.

1506
03:23:41,852 --> 03:23:43,693
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, but it's a good conversation.

1507
03:23:43,913 --> 03:23:44,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1508
03:23:45,734 --> 03:23:48,276
[SPEAKER_07]: To be continued because that's one of the things that

1509
03:23:48,749 --> 03:23:50,269
[SPEAKER_07]: we're looking at right now.

1510
03:23:50,409 --> 03:24:04,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's also a dance in terms of, so last year, the McGlynn Elementary was, per the data, the school that required the most services.

1511
03:24:04,573 --> 03:24:07,234
[SPEAKER_07]: And now for this school year, it's back being the Mississauga.

1512
03:24:07,774 --> 03:24:10,055
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good news too.

1513
03:24:10,075 --> 03:24:14,576
[SPEAKER_07]: So both of those schools are the two that need the greater assistance.

1514
03:24:15,964 --> 03:24:16,844
[SPEAKER_14]: You said they're back?

1515
03:24:16,864 --> 03:24:18,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I thought you meant they increased their numbers.

1516
03:24:18,405 --> 03:24:21,905
[SPEAKER_07]: No, meaning that now this year, I'm sorry if I was not clear.

1517
03:24:22,526 --> 03:24:33,228
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, the MSITUC, in terms of state data, is the school in which required, has the most need, yes.

1518
03:24:33,248 --> 03:24:34,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So more support should go there.

1519
03:24:34,568 --> 03:24:34,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1520
03:24:35,189 --> 03:24:35,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1521
03:24:38,329 --> 03:24:38,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor?

1522
03:24:42,510 --> 03:24:43,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

1523
03:24:43,971 --> 03:24:44,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharon, you're mic'd.

1524
03:24:46,001 --> 03:24:58,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just asked if you are able to actually shift the supports depending on, as you just said, if one school needs more than the other, but the next year it's a different school, you're able to shift the supports around like that?

1525
03:24:59,207 --> 03:24:59,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1526
03:25:00,528 --> 03:25:01,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1527
03:25:03,389 --> 03:25:03,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1528
03:25:03,990 --> 03:25:07,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to punctuate to the demographic piece of it.

1529
03:25:07,051 --> 03:25:11,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's really important that we're looking at certainly the tier one, two, and three.

1530
03:25:11,513 --> 03:25:15,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, and again, I think that this is a very important conversation and one that

1531
03:25:15,765 --> 03:25:17,448
[SPEAKER_06]: needs to be ongoing and continued.

1532
03:25:17,668 --> 03:25:20,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to punctuate again, the demographic piece.

1533
03:25:20,493 --> 03:25:27,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really looking at, you know, which populations are at which schools and how does that affect, you know, the outcomes in our scores.

1534
03:25:28,146 --> 03:25:28,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

1535
03:25:28,987 --> 03:25:29,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the report.

1536
03:25:32,655 --> 03:25:47,463
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I may, I just have one question or maybe a comment associated with this whole conversation, which is that the introduction of MAP really gives us actionable data in real time that MCAS doesn't.

1537
03:25:48,723 --> 03:25:57,308
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hoping that at budget time, you will be able to tell us based on what we have seen through MAP, this is how many kids

1538
03:25:57,990 --> 03:26:12,795
[SPEAKER_13]: require extra support, and this is how many people are needed to provide that extra support, and that the budget ask is commiserate with the number of students who have the need based on the data.

1539
03:26:12,895 --> 03:26:26,259
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hoping that that is where we're headed, that it's sort of viewable to all the rest of us that these shifts are happening, and really that the data is informing the budget.

1540
03:26:27,950 --> 03:26:28,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that in the plan?

1541
03:26:32,715 --> 03:26:32,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1542
03:26:33,156 --> 03:26:33,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.

1543
03:26:33,476 --> 03:26:33,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1544
03:26:33,957 --> 03:26:37,381
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1545
03:26:37,401 --> 03:26:37,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1546
03:26:39,383 --> 03:26:39,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1547
03:26:40,324 --> 03:26:40,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1548
03:26:40,864 --> 03:26:42,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want me to read?

1549
03:26:42,787 --> 03:26:43,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1550
03:26:43,247 --> 03:26:43,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1551
03:26:43,928 --> 03:26:44,449
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to go home?

1552
03:26:48,832 --> 03:26:51,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, item number seven continued business.

1553
03:26:52,195 --> 03:26:52,875
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have any.

1554
03:26:53,656 --> 03:27:02,102
[SPEAKER_13]: And item number eight new business selection of the school committee representative for the health education curriculum analysis team that he cat Dr. Cushing.

1555
03:27:10,009 --> 03:27:10,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1556
03:27:10,870 --> 03:27:26,383
[SPEAKER_15]: So as presented at the last meeting, we are simply looking for your nomination of a person to serve about four, four hours a month, approximately two meetings per month through the remainder of the year as we move through the heat path.

1557
03:27:26,643 --> 03:27:34,169
[SPEAKER_15]: So looking for your nomination, the request for other members of the community will be going out on Wednesday of this week.

1558
03:27:35,490 --> 03:27:40,711
[SPEAKER_15]: seeking to fill in the boxes that were shared with you on the graphic previously.

1559
03:27:41,772 --> 03:27:45,773
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be opening up to the wider community just later this week.

1560
03:27:46,153 --> 03:27:48,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Are the meetings in person at the high school?

1561
03:27:48,473 --> 03:27:50,154
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to offer a hybrid model.

1562
03:27:51,974 --> 03:27:55,955
[SPEAKER_15]: It just seems right given where society has moved.

1563
03:27:56,715 --> 03:28:01,297
[SPEAKER_15]: And hopefully we'll get greater participation for people who might not be able to make it out of work.

1564
03:28:01,737 --> 03:28:02,977
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll be able to have

1565
03:28:03,479 --> 03:28:05,060
[SPEAKER_15]: both the in-person and the hybrid as well.

1566
03:28:05,280 --> 03:28:05,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1567
03:28:06,921 --> 03:28:07,522
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau?

1568
03:28:08,262 --> 03:28:10,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I'd like to express interest.

1569
03:28:10,644 --> 03:28:16,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Sex ed was the health curriculum was one of the very first things that I met.

1570
03:28:16,248 --> 03:28:19,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I met with the administration prior to even being sworn in.

1571
03:28:20,811 --> 03:28:25,494
[SPEAKER_19]: And I won't say I've read every page of the Michigan model because the binder was like,

1572
03:28:26,212 --> 03:28:31,417
[SPEAKER_19]: six inches tall, but this has been a major concern and interest of mine.

1573
03:28:31,437 --> 03:28:36,782
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to send my own children off to the OWL program because frankly, we're not doing it.

1574
03:28:38,103 --> 03:28:41,026
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have a lot of interest in this topic.

1575
03:28:41,166 --> 03:28:44,589
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want everybody to know that I'm interested.

1576
03:28:44,609 --> 03:28:48,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1577
03:28:49,943 --> 03:28:50,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1578
03:28:51,584 --> 03:29:03,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I also wanted to express interest, but also just to share that, you know, I'm okay, and I appreciate member, through the chair, member Rousseau, through the vice chair, member Rousseau's longstanding interest as well.

1579
03:29:03,934 --> 03:29:19,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've reached out to Dr. Cushing just to be really clear that we are, that there is at least a representative that is addressing the English language and special education need in this realm.

1580
03:29:19,967 --> 03:29:24,244
[SPEAKER_06]: and how the health curriculum will be adapted for those populations.

1581
03:29:26,286 --> 03:29:53,836
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not, you know, me as a school committee member or, you know, in that realm or what have you, I wanna make sure that there's somebody in the community, whether it's a CPAC representative, another parent or, you know, expert, special education, somebody, an EL, somebody, so that we're really thinking about, particularly around, you know, our students in access classrooms and in connections classrooms, so students with ASDs, students with intellectual developmental disabilities,

1582
03:29:54,229 --> 03:29:57,371
[SPEAKER_06]: how are we going to be presenting this information to them as well?

1583
03:30:01,733 --> 03:30:02,253
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau?

1584
03:30:02,493 --> 03:30:03,514
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have one question.

1585
03:30:03,994 --> 03:30:09,397
[SPEAKER_19]: I was reviewing the HECAT assessment tool.

1586
03:30:11,358 --> 03:30:13,139
[SPEAKER_19]: That's part of the word, it's like the system system.

1587
03:30:14,199 --> 03:30:21,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, and I was noticing that there is nothing in there that I could find referencing English learners or

1588
03:30:22,748 --> 03:30:25,089
[SPEAKER_19]: special ed, and maybe I'm not looking in the right place.

1589
03:30:25,670 --> 03:30:32,594
[SPEAKER_19]: But when I do searches on those words, I kind of come up empty, and that surprised me.

1590
03:30:34,175 --> 03:30:36,776
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm just wondering if you know much more about it, and you can tell me.

1591
03:30:36,837 --> 03:30:38,918
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a separate section, and I'm not looking in the right place.

1592
03:30:38,938 --> 03:30:41,239
[SPEAKER_15]: No, so I mean, I can't specifically address it.

1593
03:30:41,259 --> 03:30:43,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I do know that the heat cap is published by the CDC.

1594
03:30:43,400 --> 03:30:48,904
[SPEAKER_15]: The CDC, as a federal government agency, does, you know,

1595
03:30:50,526 --> 03:30:52,167
[SPEAKER_15]: pay homage to all 50 states.

1596
03:30:53,388 --> 03:30:56,709
[SPEAKER_15]: And so some things may not have been included.

1597
03:30:56,990 --> 03:31:05,655
[SPEAKER_15]: However, given where we are, both as Medford, Massachusetts and the Metropolitan Public Schools, EL and special education will not be overlooked.

1598
03:31:05,715 --> 03:31:10,697
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will look to actively seek out members of those communities to help us with that.

1599
03:31:11,058 --> 03:31:14,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

1600
03:31:14,640 --> 03:31:17,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to make a motion to nominate member Rousseau for the committee.

1601
03:31:21,544 --> 03:31:27,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to nominate member Rousseau by member Graham, seconded by member Stone.

1602
03:31:28,928 --> 03:31:29,809
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1603
03:31:29,829 --> 03:31:30,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1604
03:31:32,890 --> 03:31:33,511
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1605
03:31:34,752 --> 03:31:35,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1606
03:31:36,473 --> 03:31:37,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

1607
03:31:37,613 --> 03:31:38,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you members of the committee.

1608
03:31:42,335 --> 03:31:46,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the next step, we have a number of policies that have been put forward.

1609
03:31:46,579 --> 03:31:53,564
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a reminder, under our rules, we read policy changes twice before they are formally approved.

1610
03:31:53,644 --> 03:31:55,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are all first reading.

1611
03:31:56,386 --> 03:32:00,469
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will give Mayor a break for tonight and read these policies.

1612
03:32:02,210 --> 03:32:03,771
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a man.

1613
03:32:04,032 --> 03:32:04,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1614
03:32:05,613 --> 03:32:09,636
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to give a little background on there's a lot of policies here.

1615
03:32:09,656 --> 03:32:11,237
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was joking with

1616
03:32:11,912 --> 03:32:29,175
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe the mayor and the superintendent that this was just a half an hour of work in the morning for me to come up with this many policies, we have easily a couple of hundred policies that we must adopt that we just haven't adopted through the decades.

1617
03:32:30,894 --> 03:32:50,463
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we receive, I believe all of us probably received the once or twice a year policy updates from our professional association, where they list a long list of policies that have been updated, whether the law has changed or whether there's been some rolling in a court somewhere.

1618
03:32:51,769 --> 03:32:56,572
[SPEAKER_19]: Or the policy is simply written in the 1950s and they realized they needed to update it.

1619
03:32:57,032 --> 03:33:05,497
[SPEAKER_19]: So we get this list, once or twice a year, and it just lists the policies and tells us, here's the new suggested policy.

1620
03:33:06,838 --> 03:33:09,299
[SPEAKER_19]: And many of the policies in that list are

1621
03:33:10,222 --> 03:33:15,364
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost all of those policies are changes amendments suggested improvements to language.

1622
03:33:15,944 --> 03:33:20,906
[SPEAKER_19]: But what I'm finding often is that Medford never adopted the policy in the first place.

1623
03:33:21,106 --> 03:33:24,667
[SPEAKER_19]: So when I submit these to the, to the agenda.

1624
03:33:25,147 --> 03:33:26,228
[SPEAKER_19]: I put at the beginning.

1625
03:33:27,833 --> 03:33:36,318
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, if we just look at the first one, it's, you know, will be adopted as new policy, which means that we have don't have the policy at the moment.

1626
03:33:36,919 --> 03:33:41,102
[SPEAKER_19]: And when it's an update, I just usually say it's an update or a replacement.

1627
03:33:41,882 --> 03:33:47,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes it's easier to just do whole language replacement rather than strike this line, strike this line.

1628
03:33:48,406 --> 03:33:51,128
[SPEAKER_19]: So these policies that are in this agenda are

1629
03:33:52,981 --> 03:33:58,946
[SPEAKER_19]: I won't say the verbatim from the policy manual, because sometimes they'll say things like, insert your name of your school committee here.

1630
03:33:59,947 --> 03:34:06,353
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's nothing that has been edited to reflect Medford specifically, other than perhaps changing the name.

1631
03:34:07,734 --> 03:34:16,622
[SPEAKER_19]: The one exception is that sometimes the policy will say, if you're a regional school district, do this, but we're not a regional school district, so that's not included.

1632
03:34:16,742 --> 03:34:18,523
[SPEAKER_19]: But I want everybody to know that these are the,

1633
03:34:19,284 --> 03:34:25,289
[SPEAKER_19]: standard policies that come from our template system from the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

1634
03:34:26,030 --> 03:34:27,831
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why I'm putting them forward.

1635
03:34:28,151 --> 03:34:38,980
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm more than willing to make a motion to waive the readings, although I don't know what everybody thinks on this particular set of policies is all finance and dry, no offense to Mr. Murphy.

1636
03:34:40,521 --> 03:34:42,242
[SPEAKER_19]: So just some background.

1637
03:34:45,085 --> 03:34:46,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to waive the first.

1638
03:34:47,298 --> 03:34:49,139
[SPEAKER_09]: with an explanation.

1639
03:34:50,259 --> 03:34:58,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, so item 2022-44, policy DK, payment procedures will be adopted as new policy based on the Mass.

1640
03:34:58,863 --> 03:35:01,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Association of School Committees for September 2022.

1641
03:35:02,265 --> 03:35:04,086
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion to waive the reading on the floor.

1642
03:35:04,886 --> 03:35:05,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1643
03:35:05,386 --> 03:35:06,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin.

1644
03:35:09,428 --> 03:35:10,188
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1645
03:35:10,208 --> 03:35:10,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1646
03:35:13,254 --> 03:35:14,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the reading is waived.

1647
03:35:15,715 --> 03:35:17,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to approve?

1648
03:35:18,476 --> 03:35:19,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve.

1649
03:35:20,276 --> 03:35:23,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kreatz.

1650
03:35:25,618 --> 03:35:26,559
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor, oh.

1651
03:35:31,360 --> 03:35:32,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sure.

1652
03:35:32,441 --> 03:35:32,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1653
03:35:33,861 --> 03:35:41,544
[SPEAKER_13]: So before we vote, is there something Mr. Murphy you'd like to add on this one or are you wanting to make a more global statement?

1654
03:35:48,519 --> 03:35:49,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need some clarity.

1655
03:35:49,840 --> 03:36:06,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as Mr. Rousseau said, most of these are strictly procedural matters that over the years, the Massachusetts Association of School Committees have just recommended that committees adopt in order to maintain practices consistent with the law.

1656
03:36:07,912 --> 03:36:12,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there are four financial control policies

1657
03:36:12,935 --> 03:36:19,444
[SPEAKER_01]: that are here, and three of the four are sort of blatantly obvious things that we already do.

1658
03:36:19,484 --> 03:36:25,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one says we have to keep the manual in my office, which I think was probably authored at the time before all the manuals were put online.

1659
03:36:26,272 --> 03:36:28,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I assure you we have access to that and a variety of other manuals.

1660
03:36:30,062 --> 03:36:48,540
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the budget transfer policy is the, the, the one that I would like some clarity as as from the committee as to whether or not there's an intention for a change in practice of any kind because different committees and different school departments can define a budget control center.

1661
03:36:49,221 --> 03:36:49,641
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.

1662
03:36:50,201 --> 03:36:56,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the exact application of that policy in Medford could be different from where it might be in a different district.

1663
03:36:56,523 --> 03:37:13,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's an intended model, but I know that the practice varies considerably, which is why in some committees, excuse me, in some communities, the school committee can spend a significant amount of time walking through each line item that occasionally needs to be transferred.

1664
03:37:14,507 --> 03:37:14,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And

1665
03:37:16,283 --> 03:37:25,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I would, I would be inclined as most finance administrators would to recommend against that level of specification.

1666
03:37:26,431 --> 03:37:32,917
[SPEAKER_01]: For a couple of reasons, your time and the time of the community is is one reason but the second reason is that.

1667
03:37:35,030 --> 03:37:50,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that what often happens between an administration and a school committee, that if the policy becomes too burdensome, then the administration is inclined to just structure the budget in a way that is different, that avoids the policy, essentially.

1668
03:37:50,136 --> 03:37:53,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the committee, obviously, as the body approving the budget, can then push back on that.

1669
03:37:53,978 --> 03:37:56,579
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it leads to sort of needless tension.

1670
03:37:57,199 --> 03:38:02,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I, as I said, the past two budget cycles,

1671
03:38:03,822 --> 03:38:08,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sort of made some progress in this this past spring but haven't really reached completion on it yet.

1672
03:38:09,145 --> 03:38:23,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the district would be well served with a more transparent and a slightly altered organization of the budget, and more, the resources are being spent in schools and so I think the school budgets should reflect that.

1673
03:38:24,473 --> 03:38:28,195
[SPEAKER_01]: But that migration is a process heavy migration.

1674
03:38:28,815 --> 03:38:40,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I don't want, if we're able to make further progress on that in terms of having a more transparent budget process, and frankly, the conversation tonight around how the resources are allocated at schools, I think sort of speak to this issue.

1675
03:38:41,263 --> 03:38:52,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want our change in that organizational process to run into this change in policy in a way that either surprises the committee or makes it impossible for the administration to do our job.

1676
03:38:53,251 --> 03:38:56,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than that, having a grants manual

1677
03:38:58,354 --> 03:39:22,361
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that we follow procurement procedures, all of those things, I think I would agree with the summary that this is not really earth shattering changes, but the budget transfer one, I think would be one that I would probably recommend we spend a little more time on so we can clearly articulate and make sure that we're acting consistent with your expectations, but also acting in a way that we can actually facilitate the work of the district.

1678
03:39:23,861 --> 03:39:24,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau.

1679
03:39:25,002 --> 03:39:25,322
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1680
03:39:26,206 --> 03:39:28,829
[SPEAKER_19]: That's actually the most interesting one to me as well.

1681
03:39:30,370 --> 03:39:43,404
[SPEAKER_19]: As you know, I go to virtually every training MASC offers and I get looks of shock when I mentioned that we have never approved a budget transfer from everybody in the room.

1682
03:39:44,786 --> 03:39:51,309
[SPEAKER_19]: It's worth noting it's a self-selecting group of school committee members that goes there, that is obviously interested in policies and procedures.

1683
03:39:51,929 --> 03:39:56,931
[SPEAKER_19]: So in fact, I don't take that to mean that the whole state, everybody does it this way.

1684
03:39:57,451 --> 03:40:08,015
[SPEAKER_19]: But when I think about this particular one about the budget transfer authority, I think about a scenario like this, and I don't mean to imply this is happening here, but the school committee has priorities.

1685
03:40:08,255 --> 03:40:11,676
[SPEAKER_19]: We set a budget, we wanna spend, I don't know, $800,000 on staff for something.

1686
03:40:16,096 --> 03:40:26,821
[SPEAKER_19]: then those people don't get hired, whether because they don't exist or because nobody's pushing to try and find the staff, because the administration doesn't agree necessarily, that's how we should be spending our $800,000.

1687
03:40:28,122 --> 03:40:31,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Six months, nine months into the school year, there's $800,000 of unspent money.

1688
03:40:32,684 --> 03:40:36,025
[SPEAKER_19]: You all spend it on what you think is important and want it to be spent on.

1689
03:40:36,866 --> 03:40:42,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And in the current setup, you can do that, none of us will ever know.

1690
03:40:44,952 --> 03:40:48,714
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not about trust, because I do trust you and the superintendent here.

1691
03:40:49,674 --> 03:41:06,803
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just this sense that with no budget transfer happening in this committee in the four and a half years I've been on, that you could be squirreling away millions of dollars of staff that you're not hiring, because you don't think we should be hiring that way.

1692
03:41:06,823 --> 03:41:08,884
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've all said that at the budget time.

1693
03:41:09,884 --> 03:41:12,926
[SPEAKER_19]: And the end of the year comes and you're doing your,

1694
03:41:13,581 --> 03:41:15,721
[SPEAKER_19]: your magic to finalize the year.

1695
03:41:16,002 --> 03:41:20,703
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's that money that didn't get spent, which happens every year, because you can't find staff that you really want.

1696
03:41:22,403 --> 03:41:23,403
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're none the wiser.

1697
03:41:23,923 --> 03:41:25,784
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just like, we wanted this to happen.

1698
03:41:26,324 --> 03:41:28,984
[SPEAKER_19]: You can say we couldn't find the staff or we didn't hire the staff.

1699
03:41:29,845 --> 03:41:34,806
[SPEAKER_19]: And that money got spent some other way that you wanted that we didn't want.

1700
03:41:35,366 --> 03:41:40,207
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to know what the middle, but I've also heard at these conference sessions,

1701
03:41:40,646 --> 03:41:54,695
[SPEAKER_19]: that some school committees and they're in town meeting town in places with town meetings, where there's a thousand different budget categories and every nickel has to be coming before somebody for votes.

1702
03:41:54,915 --> 03:41:57,477
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's like, they're like, nobody wants that.

1703
03:41:57,777 --> 03:42:10,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Nor does anyone want to work there often, but so, I mean, I think it does sound like perhaps a conversation is a good idea to try and find where's there a middle ground, because I think we should be doing some budget transfers and less hard budget.

1704
03:42:10,788 --> 03:42:14,952
[SPEAKER_19]: is so flawless that you can execute, and there's no need to move money around.

1705
03:42:15,012 --> 03:42:16,113
[SPEAKER_19]: But I've never heard that.

1706
03:42:16,553 --> 03:42:26,542
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in fact, I would say, Mr. So it's the opposite in that I agree with you that there has to be no for purposes of transparency, some degree of at least quarterly.

1707
03:42:27,263 --> 03:42:32,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a minimum, a notification process is required, right?

1708
03:42:33,008 --> 03:42:33,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Now,

1709
03:42:34,435 --> 03:42:51,330
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the conversations I think should be what are we obligated to notify the committee of and what are we obligated to come to the committee and seek permission for, because number one by notifying you as the governing body with the authority to over whatever we do, we're inviting you the opportunity to tell us like, thanks for the notification you're not doing that anymore.

1710
03:42:51,450 --> 03:42:51,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1711
03:42:51,991 --> 03:42:58,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think that's in, given how quickly some of the decisions have to be made for efficiency purposes.

1712
03:42:59,297 --> 03:43:09,423
[SPEAKER_01]: as a typical administrator, I would lean toward like the notification requirement versus the permission seeking requirement, because ultimately you're giving us permission when you approve the budget in the previous spring.

1713
03:43:09,843 --> 03:43:19,628
[SPEAKER_01]: To Mr. Rousseau's point, variables change from the spring until the next spring, and you have a responsibility to be informed about them, and we have a responsibility to share that information with you.

1714
03:43:19,968 --> 03:43:26,131
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have, at least in the last two years, given at least quarterly updates on the budget.

1715
03:43:26,151 --> 03:43:27,272
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason you haven't received

1716
03:43:27,712 --> 03:43:34,862
[SPEAKER_01]: quarterly update from the budget for the first quarter of this year is the budget just changed dramatically with the agreement of a variety of MOAs.

1717
03:43:34,922 --> 03:43:41,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it only made sense to get the labor piece and those variables settled before we moved on to updating you on how the budget is being spent.

1718
03:43:43,146 --> 03:43:48,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think frequency, permission versus notification are things that we need to discuss.

1719
03:43:48,848 --> 03:43:55,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the scope of the costs of the control centers is a critical variable that we have to identify.

1720
03:43:57,390 --> 03:44:00,291
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we can achieve all those things.

1721
03:44:01,351 --> 03:44:07,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I concur wholeheartedly that we have a responsibility to be discussing this information and seeking your input.

1722
03:44:08,233 --> 03:44:10,174
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is one that it can very,

1723
03:44:11,414 --> 03:44:28,528
[SPEAKER_01]: inadvertently become just from a mechanical perspective, all we do in this forum and I think I think there's a shared interest in avoiding that, if possible, so I would just ask that we continue that conversation and I think last thing I'll say, part of why this, the sort of.

1724
03:44:30,680 --> 03:44:40,770
[SPEAKER_01]: The authority piece is not a topic that I've broached previously in the last two years is, as I said, I don't think the budget is structured right now in the way that it should be from a transparency perspective.

1725
03:44:41,430 --> 03:44:48,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really want to get into advising you on budget transfers, when we're transferring to control centers that may or may not.

1726
03:44:49,958 --> 03:44:54,061
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly shouldn't even exist because they don't necessarily reflect how we're structured as an organization.

1727
03:44:54,121 --> 03:45:01,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we have to address that issue before we get into sort of like moving things from like one code to another.

1728
03:45:01,467 --> 03:45:08,773
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want you to infer in any way that I'm hesitant to share this responsibility with you because I agree with you.

1729
03:45:08,793 --> 03:45:15,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's intended to be a shared responsibility beyond just the sort of six weeks we focus on in the spring.

1730
03:45:16,505 --> 03:45:20,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion for approval for all three papers and motion to table 2022-46.

1731
03:45:20,528 --> 03:45:23,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can work that out.

1732
03:45:23,370 --> 03:45:29,054
[SPEAKER_19]: Could we, if it's a table, I can't comment.

1733
03:45:31,616 --> 03:45:39,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the question is whether it's being tabled or referred to the subcommittee and I don't have an opinion either way, as long as we can keep talking about this one that I've just flagged for it.

1734
03:45:39,502 --> 03:45:40,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll withdraw the motion to table.

1735
03:45:43,165 --> 03:45:44,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Referred to which subcommittee, RPE?

1736
03:45:46,119 --> 03:45:48,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume either the policy.

1737
03:45:48,100 --> 03:45:53,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to refer that the control policy to two.

1738
03:45:56,381 --> 03:46:11,245
[SPEAKER_13]: So a motion by Member Mustone to refer that policy to the rules policy and equity subcommittee seconded by Member Hays does your just for clarification does your motion include approval of the other policies listed on the agenda.

1739
03:46:15,735 --> 03:46:16,175
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

1740
03:46:16,235 --> 03:46:20,216
[SPEAKER_13]: I will just before we do that, I will just read the names just for clarity.

1741
03:46:20,436 --> 03:46:21,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1742
03:46:21,457 --> 03:46:26,559
[SPEAKER_13]: So 44 is 44 is payment procedures.

1743
03:46:26,579 --> 03:46:34,161
[SPEAKER_13]: 45 is the one that will be referred to the rules, policy and equity subcommittee, which is policy DBJ, budget transfer authority. 46.

1744
03:46:47,898 --> 03:46:49,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm sorry about that.

1745
03:46:51,859 --> 03:46:59,740
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got a The version on the online version is accurate.

1746
03:46:59,800 --> 03:47:02,761
[SPEAKER_17]: So, forty-five is the budget transfer.

1747
03:47:03,081 --> 03:47:03,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1748
03:47:04,181 --> 03:47:10,442
[SPEAKER_13]: So, twenty twenty-two forty-five is DBJ budget transfer authority.

1749
03:47:10,482 --> 03:47:13,723
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the one that will go to the rules policy and equity

1750
03:47:16,209 --> 03:47:16,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair?

1751
03:47:17,410 --> 03:47:17,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1752
03:47:19,291 --> 03:47:21,773
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking at it and see different numbers.

1753
03:47:21,933 --> 03:47:23,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

1754
03:47:23,594 --> 03:47:24,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Me too.

1755
03:47:24,635 --> 03:47:27,116
[SPEAKER_19]: I see 2245 is the payment procedures.

1756
03:47:27,136 --> 03:47:33,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's 44, 45, 47.

1757
03:47:34,061 --> 03:47:34,762
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no 47.

1758
03:47:43,623 --> 03:47:46,964
[SPEAKER_19]: You're missing the online, the printout is missing things.

1759
03:47:47,464 --> 03:47:50,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and I'm looking at the one that was posted.

1760
03:47:51,065 --> 03:47:53,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Is 46 the one that goes to the subcommittee?

1761
03:47:53,085 --> 03:47:53,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1762
03:47:54,125 --> 03:48:02,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Approve all except, approve the three except 45, budget transfer authority.

1763
03:48:03,407 --> 03:48:08,048
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think this printout that people are referring to is the inaccurate piece.

1764
03:48:09,813 --> 03:48:10,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1765
03:48:10,493 --> 03:48:27,222
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that said, 44 is payment procedures, 45 budget transfer authority, which will go to the rules policy and equity subcommittee under the motion that's on the floor.

1766
03:48:27,242 --> 03:48:37,287
[SPEAKER_13]: 46 is policy DGA authorized signatures, which is a replacement of the policy update for DGA.

1767
03:48:37,488 --> 03:48:37,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And then

1768
03:48:39,508 --> 03:48:43,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

1769
03:48:43,691 --> 03:48:57,721
[SPEAKER_13]: 47 is policy DI, which is fiscal accounting and reporting, which is a replacement of our DI fiscal accounting and reporting policy, which is also on the motion for approval of the first reading.

1770
03:48:57,801 --> 03:48:59,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that right, Member Mustone?

1771
03:48:59,802 --> 03:49:00,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1772
03:49:00,542 --> 03:49:00,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1773
03:49:01,283 --> 03:49:03,925
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion to approve 44, 46,

1774
03:49:07,580 --> 03:49:17,545
[SPEAKER_13]: and 47 and send 45 to the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee, the approval being for the first reading of those three policies.

1775
03:49:18,126 --> 03:49:18,866
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1776
03:49:18,886 --> 03:49:19,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1777
03:49:19,966 --> 03:49:20,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1778
03:49:20,647 --> 03:49:21,407
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1779
03:49:24,029 --> 03:49:24,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1780
03:49:25,509 --> 03:49:27,250
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I have, yes, that it's passed.

1781
03:49:27,991 --> 03:49:31,773
[SPEAKER_19]: There's actually another policy in the agenda that's online.

1782
03:49:33,533 --> 03:49:34,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there, hold on.

1783
03:49:34,673 --> 03:49:37,654
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a fiscal accounting ability and reporting.

1784
03:49:39,514 --> 03:49:43,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, no grants proposals and special projects.

1785
03:49:51,317 --> 03:49:55,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm sorry.

1786
03:49:56,038 --> 03:50:02,059
[SPEAKER_13]: So 2022 48 offered by member or so policy DD funding proposals and applications will be replaced and renamed.

1787
03:50:02,534 --> 03:50:06,837
[SPEAKER_13]: with the policy update from the Mass Association of School Committees for September, 2022.

1788
03:50:07,538 --> 03:50:09,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor to waive the reading?

1789
03:50:10,160 --> 03:50:11,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to waive the reading.

1790
03:50:12,081 --> 03:50:14,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by member Lungo-Koehn, seconded by member Mustone.

1791
03:50:14,664 --> 03:50:15,444
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1792
03:50:15,644 --> 03:50:16,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1793
03:50:16,705 --> 03:50:17,266
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1794
03:50:18,366 --> 03:50:19,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, motion passes.

1795
03:50:19,908 --> 03:50:22,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to approve the first reading on the floor?

1796
03:50:24,711 --> 03:50:27,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve the first reading by member Hays, seconded by member Mustone.

1797
03:50:29,035 --> 03:50:29,795
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1798
03:50:30,436 --> 03:50:30,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1799
03:50:30,916 --> 03:50:31,597
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1800
03:50:33,171 --> 03:50:33,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1801
03:50:35,493 --> 03:50:36,635
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe there's hold on.

1802
03:50:36,675 --> 03:50:38,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to keep scrolling here.

1803
03:50:41,580 --> 03:50:56,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Policy number 2022 49 offered by member Rousseau policy DDE subcommittee of the school committee will insert special before subcommittee in item six of the policy resulting in number six, a special subcommittee will be dissolved

1804
03:50:57,093 --> 03:51:03,358
[SPEAKER_13]: by the committee upon completion of its assignment, or it may be dissolved by a vote of the committee at any time.

1805
03:51:03,378 --> 03:51:06,001
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to speak on that real quick.

1806
03:51:06,201 --> 03:51:08,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau.

1807
03:51:11,305 --> 03:51:23,436
[SPEAKER_19]: I was reviewing that policy because there were some other updates we had made, and then it became very clear in this sentence that we meant to include special, because special subcommittees is another name for our

1808
03:51:25,950 --> 03:51:27,351
[SPEAKER_19]: like for the renaming committee.

1809
03:51:27,932 --> 03:51:30,714
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't dissolve subcommittees when they finish their work.

1810
03:51:30,834 --> 03:51:33,096
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd have to restart them every single time.

1811
03:51:33,736 --> 03:51:35,458
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's just a fix.

1812
03:51:36,078 --> 03:51:36,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, move approval.

1813
03:51:37,239 --> 03:51:37,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1814
03:51:38,220 --> 03:51:42,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve by Member Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Member Mustone.

1815
03:51:43,064 --> 03:51:43,865
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1816
03:51:43,885 --> 03:51:44,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1817
03:51:44,886 --> 03:51:45,606
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1818
03:51:46,747 --> 03:51:47,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1819
03:51:49,763 --> 03:51:56,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Number nine, reports requested, suspension and discipline update report offered by member McLaughlin.

1820
03:51:56,367 --> 03:51:59,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin, did you want to speak on this?

1821
03:52:01,431 --> 03:52:09,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just wanted to let the committee know that I was looking for, based on some recent

1822
03:52:10,805 --> 03:52:13,367
[SPEAKER_06]: suspension and discipline and concerns.

1823
03:52:14,067 --> 03:52:26,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there was in the packet, there should have been a handout on sort of disproportionality and discipline, particularly for students with disabilities and some of the processes that should occur under those instances.

1824
03:52:26,976 --> 03:52:35,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for something about the rate of suspension and discipline, and again, the demographic data and the grade level data.

1825
03:52:37,381 --> 03:52:43,563
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically, you know, with concern with some elementary suspension and discipline.

1826
03:52:45,304 --> 03:52:52,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was reaching out to the superintendent as well to see what that might look like and what a time they might be for that.

1827
03:52:52,107 --> 03:52:53,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to put that out there.

1828
03:52:53,907 --> 03:52:54,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1829
03:52:56,668 --> 03:52:57,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1830
03:52:58,029 --> 03:52:58,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau.

1831
03:53:00,330 --> 03:53:02,791
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually very much want this data as well.

1832
03:53:03,191 --> 03:53:04,211
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a rule number 44.

1833
03:53:06,380 --> 03:53:16,189
[SPEAKER_19]: which we adopted whenever we adopted it earlier this year, that says that we have to use the ad hoc report request procedure.

1834
03:53:17,430 --> 03:53:29,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And looking over that, I mean, when I, you know, member McLaughlin was not present and neither was member Hays when we created that procedure, but the goal of that procedure is to make sure that

1835
03:53:31,013 --> 03:53:40,796
[SPEAKER_19]: superintendent doesn't go create the report and then, you know, you wanted this piece of data and this piece of data is not in the report, so then they create another one and then your questions aren't getting answered.

1836
03:53:41,876 --> 03:53:52,899
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, the ad hoc report request procedure lists out, you know, you have to specify what is the data you want so that you get it because

1837
03:53:53,766 --> 03:53:56,428
[SPEAKER_19]: There's too much data, too many ways to do the data.

1838
03:53:57,469 --> 03:54:20,810
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I would just ask that Member McLaughlin review in the rules addendum two and submit it again to include that so that we can, because the other key element to this procedure is to make sure that if the request is for the superintendent to create a report that's going to take two people a month and a half of time,

1839
03:54:21,257 --> 03:54:35,881
[SPEAKER_19]: the committee should know that we're asking for that kind of a request of resources versus if the report could be something that the, you know, superintendent can get in five minutes, in which case, then that's a very different kind of scenario.

1840
03:54:36,341 --> 03:54:41,882
[SPEAKER_19]: But as we know from our financial and HR systems and the disconnect there, some reports are truly

1841
03:54:42,811 --> 03:54:44,252
[SPEAKER_19]: massively labor-intensive.

1842
03:54:44,352 --> 03:54:58,316
[SPEAKER_19]: And so understanding what are the questions that we're trying to answer and what are the data elements that are desired before the committee decides whether to expend those resources in the superintendent's office is why we created that rule.

1843
03:54:58,596 --> 03:54:59,477
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

1844
03:55:06,779 --> 03:55:12,181
[SPEAKER_09]: If I then may, through the chair, Member McLaughlin, do you have specifics you want to outline

1845
03:55:12,950 --> 03:55:13,451
[SPEAKER_09]: right now?

1846
03:55:13,511 --> 03:55:14,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you want to pull this back?

1847
03:55:14,712 --> 03:55:15,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

1848
03:55:15,433 --> 03:55:18,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I had my I didn't realize I was on mute.

1849
03:55:18,837 --> 03:55:19,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I was responding.

1850
03:55:19,838 --> 03:55:20,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I was asking to respond.

1851
03:55:21,880 --> 03:55:25,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can be more specific if the superintendent feels that she needs that.

1852
03:55:25,625 --> 03:55:33,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess part of what I understood for the ad hoc report, and maybe I misunderstood, there was a lot of policy that we were going through last year, as I'm sure everyone can remember.

1853
03:55:34,366 --> 03:55:38,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the report form request was optional.

1854
03:55:38,829 --> 03:55:52,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think that we had to necessarily fill out a specific form for the request, but if the rest of the committee feels that that's what we agreed to, then I'm fine with filling out a form to get the information.

1855
03:55:52,419 --> 03:55:59,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, what I did understand was that we wanted to present to the school committee the request for

1856
03:56:00,219 --> 03:56:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: a report and have some dialogue with the superintendent around what that timeline could be like or what the labor, how labor intensive that report would be.

1857
03:56:10,463 --> 03:56:27,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that suspension and discipline data is required annually anyway as a report to DESE, but I guess this is more specific to, you know, recent events and also with regard to recent policy, you know, as that we had last year as well around, you know, clarification around

1858
03:56:27,665 --> 03:56:29,306
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, are we doing suspensions?

1859
03:56:29,366 --> 03:56:30,586
[SPEAKER_06]: When are we doing suspensions?

1860
03:56:30,646 --> 03:56:33,508
[SPEAKER_06]: We, you know, had said under certain circumstances.

1861
03:56:33,528 --> 03:56:36,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of ambiguity around some of the policy as well.

1862
03:56:37,069 --> 03:56:46,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am happy to have a discussion with the rest of the committee to have folks weigh in and hear what they would like.

1863
03:56:47,013 --> 03:56:55,017
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that this is an important report and I am reluctant to delay further, but I'd like to hear from the rest of the committee.

1864
03:56:58,047 --> 03:57:00,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anybody else who would like to speak?

1865
03:57:03,892 --> 03:57:06,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Member, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1866
03:57:06,293 --> 03:57:24,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, through the chair, maybe we can give our suggestions to Member McLaughlin on what data we would like to see over the next week or so and just compile a new resolution and place that on to be more specific so we can vote for approval and get the report, you know, sometime in the early winter.

1867
03:57:27,648 --> 03:57:30,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent, does that work for you through the chair?

1868
03:57:32,291 --> 03:57:33,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that will work.

1869
03:57:35,094 --> 03:57:36,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you then.

1870
03:57:36,414 --> 03:57:37,695
