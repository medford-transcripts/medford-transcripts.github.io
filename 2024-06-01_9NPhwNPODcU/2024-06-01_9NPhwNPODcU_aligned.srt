1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,142
There'll be a meeting of the planning and permitting committee April 24th 2024.

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:05,544
This meeting will take place at six p.m.

3
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:10,988
In the city council chamber, second floor Medford City Hall, 85 George P has to drive and on zoom.

4
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:12,530
Mr. Clerk, would you please call the role?

5
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:18,214
That's a present.

6
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,337
There's present.

7
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:22,377
Also present.

8
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:23,118
Present.

9
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:27,185
Vice President Collins.

10
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:28,006
Present.

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,107
Five present, zero absent.

12
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:32,507
This meeting is called to order.

13
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,588
Thank you all very much for being here.

14
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:45,151
We have several city staff in the room and on Zoom, in addition to the committee members and our zoning consultants.

15
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,292
The action and discussion items for tonight's meeting

16
00:00:48,872 --> 00:01:02,403
is 24033 which is the paper number for the zoning ordinance updates that we are working through with the Innis associates team beginning a couple months ago and that will continue through most likely September of next year.

17
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,926
We also have an affordable housing training run by Mass Housing Partnership.

18
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:09,348
This will occur later in the meeting

19
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:22,465
We will reconvene after the public works committee, so stay tuned for that we will take the zoning ordinance updates first and before I pass it over to city staff and our zoning consultant.

20
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:27,715
just to quickly run through the top lines of what we'll be discussing tonight.

21
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:51,268
Um, at our last planning and permitting committee meeting where we were discussing the zoning ordinance updates, we looked at the memo that is kind of an evolving document seeking to capture everything that we are trying to do in this zoning amendment process, pulling together recommendations from city councilors and from city staff and pulling in discrete policy recommendations from

22
00:01:51,807 --> 00:02:09,604
comprehensive plan, housing production plan, climate action and adaptation plan from the ZBA and the CDB and trying to put that into a document and schedule out over the course of the next 18 months how to group these various policies and projects into kind of topically batched projects.

23
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:14,149
So we took a look at that we're still adding to that menu to that memo and that will continue to

24
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:17,538
evolve and change in the statuses for the various policies.

25
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:19,119
We'll get updated as we go along.

26
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:27,380
What we have on deck for tonight is reviewing definitions and definitional changes recommended by city staff.

27
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,341
And as associates, we're going to look at site plan review, as well as mapping framework.

28
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:41,963
And at the end of the meeting, I think we can also just do a quick overview of kind of what we're currently planning for, you know, the next step after this one.

29
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,043
This process has been one of

30
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,154
trying to plan a couple steps out even as we're working through current steps.

31
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:58,503
With that, I'm happy to pass it right over to Emily Innes unless city councilors or city staff have anything they'd like to say first.

32
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:06,470
Seeing none and no hands raised on Zoom, Emily, please go ahead.

33
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,659
Thank you very much, Vice President.

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,341
I am going to share my screen.

35
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,604
For the record, Emily Ennis of Ennis Associates.

36
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:27,095
I'm joined by two of my colleagues, Paola Ramos-Martinez and Jemmy Rocha, and also by Jonathan Silverstein, whom I believe City Council knows and has been working with.

37
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:30,477
He will be providing the legal review throughout this process.

38
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:32,659
It's good to see you all again.

39
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,922
I want to walk you through where we are today.

40
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:40,744
So, you should already have received the updated memorandum.

41
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:46,428
I think as Paula mentioned at our last meeting, our intent is to send you that before every meeting.

42
00:03:46,548 --> 00:03:49,270
So, you know, the status of the things that we're working on.

43
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,113
I've also got a little bit of an update to that.

44
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,458
So, first of all, we are here on April 24th.

45
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:57,439
We've had our kickoff.

46
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:00,363
We've discussed the initial staff status meeting.

47
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,325
So, we're moving forward.

48
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:07,652
I'm going to give you the list of definitions that we're working on pulling actual text together for.

49
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:15,860
And as Vice President Collins said, I talked to you about some of the other issues that were the early identifiers.

50
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:25,491
And then we're going to be moving into a cycle over the next few meetings until we get to the last meeting before June 30th, which is the last meeting.

51
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:42,644
of the fiscal year of reviewing draft text, hearing from you, your comments on it, and then at the meeting after that first review, having you, if you're comfortable with it, obviously recommending that draft text to move forward to city council.

52
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:44,005
for adoption.

53
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:46,246
So that's going to be a continued cycle.

54
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:54,152
In addition, we're going to be looking at the other pieces that are part of this process.

55
00:04:54,592 --> 00:05:00,016
If you remember, we talked about a phase 2 and phase 3 of things that happen after the end of this fiscal year.

56
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:03,698
And that's going to include in looking at specific neighborhoods.

57
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:08,141
So we'll be in a cycle of we're going to be doing mapping and analyses.

58
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:12,184
And I'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the presentation.

59
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:18,548
But as we do that, we're going to keep you updated as to progress and the goal of that.

60
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:32,774
Is to have a full work plan for you to cover the period from June from July 1st through December 31st and then looking at what happens between January and June of next year.

61
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:38,776
So we would anticipate giving you that work plan at the end of at your last meeting in June.

62
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:48,149
So for now, just reviewing the additions to the memo that you received, which were recommendations from Vice President Collins.

63
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:55,937
There was an extensive set of recommendations from the building department, some of which we've incorporated into what we're going to talk about today.

64
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:00,000
and climate brainstorm from PDS.

65
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:07,886
I should note that some of those will be zoning related and others may have implications for zoning, but aren't necessarily directly zoning related.

66
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:14,691
We have brought, as I mentioned earlier, Jonathan Silverstein on board and he will be

67
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:19,893
providing us with his recommendations based on the work that he's done with you to date.

68
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:26,777
And so we'll be incorporating that into either the next iteration of the memo or the one beyond that.

69
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:31,859
And we'd also like to add reviewing and adopting the GIS-based zoning map.

70
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:39,083
I believe you adopted the zoning map or changes to it a couple of years back, but this will be a GIS-based one that

71
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:45,019
the city staff have been working on and that we are going to take and do some of our analyses with.

72
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:52,272
These are the definitions, so I know that Paola presented at your last meeting a series of definitions.

73
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:57,234
We have added to that the definitions from the building department's recommendations.

74
00:06:57,914 --> 00:07:02,456
And so this is the full definitions of this round of the discussion.

75
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:09,860
I would anticipate as we move into phases two and three that we will be adding and clarifying more definitions.

76
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,801
but this at least gets us started.

77
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:21,345
We're just filling this in now and should anticipate having all of those definitions for you for May 8th for your review.

78
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,868
Questions, we'll have them to you before the meeting, so you have a chance to review them.

79
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:31,050
But as you look through this, if you have any questions for tonight, I'm happy to discuss them.

80
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:38,614
There was a little bit of overlap between what the building department had identified and what we already had, so that was good to see.

81
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:40,728
that there was consistency there.

82
00:07:42,109 --> 00:08:00,558
We did also have in our memo, our first memo, the idea of adding a few new uses to the table of uses, but also replacing the parking codes with the rather than having a code for parking and a code for loading, and then somebody has to go to another table to find those.

83
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:05,243
replacing them with the actual square footage requirements in the table of uses.

84
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:08,166
We're not changing those requirements at this point.

85
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:15,735
That may come later in the project, but right now we're just establishing those, just adding the

86
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:22,997
spaces requirement rather than a code and establishing uses allowed on the ground level for mixed use buildings.

87
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:28,398
I do have, so this is your existing table of use and parking regulations.

88
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:34,580
I have already made the change to have the parking code

89
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,362
and the loading code, instead of it being code, being the actual requirement.

90
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,284
So that's what this will look like.

91
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:42,325
So that is the yellow.

92
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,087
The PC is the parking code.

93
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,008
The LC is the loading code.

94
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:51,172
And you can see, for example, detached single-family dwelling instead of it being parking code A.

95
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:59,875
It's two spaces per dwelling unit for attached single-family dwelling to dwelling structure instead of parking code A1.

96
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:04,916
It's 1.5 per dwelling unit and as I go through, you'll see what that looks like.

97
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:14,119
In orange, this orange and white over here, I have identified where we have potential changes and definitions that may change the use table.

98
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:20,401
You see the multiple dwelling class A and class B, that's part of our remit to consolidate those.

99
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:28,066
And as we go through, you can see again the changes for the parking and loading.

100
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:31,689
And we have a couple of other uses coming in.

101
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,454
Doggy daycare, for example, will need to be added to the table of uses once we have a definition for it.

102
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:42,557
Cafe, coffee shop, motor vehicles, class 3 junkyards.

103
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:49,763
We will also propose what those uses should, which districts those uses should be allowed in as they come through.

104
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:53,195
And then we just have one question for city staff.

105
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:59,800
Accessory childcare had a yes in the parking code, so we don't actually know which one that applies to.

106
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,040
So we'll look at that.

107
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:05,884
But that's a first step in the long list for changes.

108
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:10,127
As per usual, I'll have this presentation to you after tonight's meeting.

109
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:13,209
Going forward, you will have the changes prior to the meeting.

110
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,430
We just had a short timeline this time.

111
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:29,809
I didn't want to talk about site plan reviews, so if you remember from the memorandum, we had the possibility of major project, minor project, Dover amendment, and potential municipal site plan.

112
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:43,504
So, I have summarized for you, this is your existing major project review and just some key pieces, not the whole text, but the community development board is the review authority.

113
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:46,386
There are certain thresholds for a major project review.

114
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,668
There's a specific timeline.

115
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:52,951
You also have the existing site plan review for Dover amendments.

116
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:59,536
And the same review authority threshold is a little bit lesser.

117
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:02,358
It doesn't qualify on one of those regulations.

118
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:03,779
The timeline is the same.

119
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:16,848
So we would be looking at whether or not the current process for both of those is consistent with best practices and just calling out that site plan review is the subject of conversation at the state level.

120
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:20,889
right now, so there may be some changes to that.

121
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:22,030
We're keeping an eye on that.

122
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:35,721
And then, should you add a minor plan review process, frequently this is done as an administrative review and allows for site plan review at lower thresholds than what you currently have.

123
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:45,249
Applicants who need a waiver or need something, you know, disagree with the administrative review can always apply upwards, so this is something to consider.

124
00:11:45,896 --> 00:12:00,964
And then adding municipal project review to allow public forum for questions, information about a project, discussion about the project, and maybe even the possibility of tweaking some of the design to address community conversations.

125
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:07,940
Without a municipal project review, sometimes that information cycle and response gets lost.

126
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,400
So that's something to consider.

127
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,322
This is one from Pittsfield.

128
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:20,247
It's an example of an administrative review where there's a checklist for the city staff to go through with the applicant.

129
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:22,588
And then if there's something that doesn't fit.

130
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:27,401
The applicant can, as I said, go to the Community Development Board.

131
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:30,745
It just so happens that in Pittsfield, it's also a Community Development Board.

132
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:38,733
Brookline has municipal review for educational uses, specifically those in a residence district.

133
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:53,287
It can be used to review non-profit educational, but also municipal educational, thinking about expanding this to other municipal uses in Medford and what that would look like.

134
00:12:54,528 --> 00:13:00,774
And then finally, for our mapping analyses, we are going to go back to the comprehensive plan.

135
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,537
This is the future land use map of the comprehensive plan.

136
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:14,854
look at that plan's definition of corridors, squares, and neighborhoods, and start our analyses for what should be addressed in phases 2 and 3 of this project.

137
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:23,261
And this will define the work that we do between now and the end of June and the work plan that we bring forward to you at the end of June.

138
00:13:24,022 --> 00:13:28,004
So with that, that's the basic update that I wanted to give to you.

139
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:31,145
I'm happy to jump back to any of these slides.

140
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:36,067
I'll stop share for now, but I'm happy to jump back anything that you all want to discuss.

141
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:45,230
And then I'd love to get some feedback on your ideas about the definitions, the site plan review, or what you're seeing in terms of the parking.

142
00:13:46,417 --> 00:14:02,653
After we move through to today's, so for the next week, we'll, the next time we meet on May 8th, you will have the draft definitions, you will have the draft language search site plan to review, and then you will also have our proposals for the next stage of things that we bring to you.

143
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:06,297
I know, for example, Councilor Lemming has given us some text.

144
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:08,119
for some changes.

145
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:19,969
We are reviewing that internally and discussing, we'll then discuss with city staff and then yourselves where those fit in the process and excited to hear if others have things that they'd like to bring forward.

146
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:24,352
Thank you so much, Emily.

147
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:26,294
Really appreciate that overview.

148
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:31,178
I know I have a few questions based off the presentation, but we'll go first to city councilors.

149
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,039
I see Councilor Lemming.

150
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:32,539
Go ahead.

151
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:35,447
Two questions.

152
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:44,013
First, so I noticed the change of definition from the SPGA, Special Permit Granting Authority, to just the Community Development Board.

153
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:50,077
I was just wondering what is the, what are sort of the consequences behind that change?

154
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:55,120
So could you just explain a little bit to me about changing from one term to the next?

155
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,962
Because I did notice that when I was going through the ADU ordinance.

156
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:03,066
Yes, so I believe that came from the building department.

157
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:06,030
I'll have to double check the status sheet on that.

158
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:13,520
And I think it was that simply that the community development board needed to be added to the definition and then just confirming it.

159
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,884
I don't think it's necessarily changing any.

160
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:29,336
policies, there were a number of consistency questions that came up and that I believe that was in that category of making sure that the terminology was consistent throughout.

161
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:42,083
But if I think Alicia Hunt is there and Danielle, if you have additional information on that, why that might have come from the building department that I'm happy to cede my time to you all.

162
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:44,754
Thank you.

163
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:48,616
And the second question, which is sort of related.

164
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:59,861
So I noticed the distinction between approval of a project by the community development board and sort of lower threshold for approval by just the planning department, the administrative review.

165
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:11,946
And one proposed change that I'm trying to make to the AD ordinances to sort of reduce that, just for instance, from a community development board

166
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:16,908
review in all cases to just administrate a review by the planning department.

167
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:33,273
I guess, are there other sort of, in your analysis of our ordinances so far, do you sort of notice other cases where something that normally would have a, would need a permit by the community development board would better be suited to just be reviewed at the staff level?

168
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:37,835
I'm just kind of thinking like smaller projects, maybe.

169
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,596
What's your sort of informal take on that so far?

170
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:45,660
I think you're you and I are thinking the same way about that.

171
00:16:45,720 --> 00:17:03,252
Yes, I've seen it in a number of places where it's smaller projects projects that don't necessarily that that are fairly straightforward, you know, a change of use an existing building, but, you know, might have some ramifications that need to be reviewed.

172
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:09,176
Your thresholds for your major plan review are already relatively high.

173
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:13,898
I've seen one with much lower thresholds, so I'm less worried about that.

174
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:18,761
But I think there's 2 reasons to do an administrative review.

175
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:25,705
1 is because the Community Development Board is getting a lot of fairly straightforward things that they really don't need to have.

176
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:36,335
And the other, it's because you're trying to encourage a use that you really want and having administrative review might make the difference between that use coming in or not.

177
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:44,104
I think the key to the administrative review, however, is making it very clear what the review is.

178
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:46,287
And that's where the checklist comes in.

179
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,158
It's like, yes, yes, yes.

180
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:55,100
Oh, wait, this needs to go to the Community Development Board versus yes, yes, yes.

181
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,220
OK, we're good.

182
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,861
You can go ahead and do that.

183
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:59,701
And I think that makes it easier.

184
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:10,805
That type of thinking about how you structure the criteria for a checklist makes it easier for both applicant and the administrative review, the people doing the administrative review.

185
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:13,526
Thank you.

186
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:16,666
Director Hunt.

187
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:42,387
I just wanted to sort of piggyback on that question and sort of make sure that we were, that I'm also understanding what Emily's saying and the use that I was thinking of is a good example of this, Emily, where right now under Dover, anything that is a protected Dover use under our current code has to go to the Community Development Board for site plan review.

188
00:18:43,067 --> 00:19:00,801
and special permit, and there are some cases that are smaller than our standard site plan review threshold that's in the presentation, and that those are ones that maybe would go for administrative review rather than for site plan review.

189
00:19:02,723 --> 00:19:03,604
Absolutely.

190
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:10,489
I think, for example, say you have a child care center in a building and that

191
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:21,820
That use ends because somebody's, you know, decided they're moving their business elsewhere and somebody else comes in for childcare use Dover amendment.

192
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:33,767
It wouldn't normally trigger the CD board because it's less than that 10,000 square feet, but it's the same use.

193
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:38,369
But it still has to go in front of the board because it's a Dover amendment use.

194
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:41,971
I think that would be an ideal situation for administrative review.

195
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:47,494
Same use, going into the same place, just because it's Dover, it shouldn't have to come in front.

196
00:19:47,954 --> 00:20:05,280
Whereas if it were a much larger change, say something from, you know, it might be an educational use that's not childcare that might have a greater intensity of use that might then need to go to the community development board.

197
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,621
So I think we could have a conversation about where those thresholds need to be.

198
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:15,583
You know, we can come up with a structure, but it's what triggers the threshold that I think is critical.

199
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:19,625
And something like a childcare, it's a small business.

200
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:20,906
You want it to be there.

201
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,847
It's an important use in a community.

202
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:26,649
So you don't want to put barriers beyond what's needed for that.

203
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:35,474
And I think that's really where the administrative review can be helpful in reducing barriers for those smaller uses or the less intense uses.

204
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:40,897
Thank you so much, Emily.

205
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:41,738
Thank you for the question.

206
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:45,300
Director Hunt, anything more from yourselves at this point?

207
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,430
One of the questions I think when it comes to site plan review is enforcement.

208
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:59,308
Is this same administrative mechanism going to be available for use for modifications to a site plan that's ongoing?

209
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:04,770
It's not uncommon during the course of a project being instructed on a site plan that things change.

210
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,812
And sometimes you have to determine is it major or minor?

211
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,353
Is it a minor change?

212
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,153
Can it be just administratively handled?

213
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:14,215
Is it a major change that needs to go back to the board for reconsideration?

214
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:18,057
Is that language going to play into that in any way?

215
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,517
Yes, I think it should, for exactly the reasons that you just said.

216
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:27,298
And I think that breakdown is perfect.

217
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:32,739
How do we define what a minor change is that can just be checked off?

218
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:37,481
How do we define what a major change is that needs to go to the board?

219
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:39,541
And the same thing is true for the waivers, right?

220
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:47,023
Because if somebody comes forward and says, I'm this close to administrative review, but I have just one thing,

221
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:51,584
what's the threshold that kicks it up to the Community Development Board.

222
00:21:51,984 --> 00:22:02,326
We could probably make those fairly consistent with each other so it's clear to all what triggers the higher level of review or the more intense level of review.

223
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:14,249
Right, because it's certainly likely in an ongoing project it's going to be the building inspectors can be the first one to pick up on some change that's ongoing that isn't consistent and start kicking it upstairs and need to know

224
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:21,627
who, how, what, and where, or is being told in a sense, when things change, we need to think about these things.

225
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:28,969
And if they have a sense of what constitutes a minor and a major change, they can give some guidance or at least be aware of it as it happens.

226
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:36,450
And it's not uncommon to see during a project, especially a large project ongoing and suddenly they can't do this or they wanna do something differently.

227
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,811
And you're like, oh, should I tell somebody or is this okay?

228
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:45,132
And I just wanna make sure they have some guidelines so they go back in and understand what to do.

229
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:54,978
Absolutely that clarity of guidance is hugely important, especially when somebody's out in the field and they're like, I'm not quite sure what I should do here.

230
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:56,520
So, um, you know, there's.

231
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,991
I think we can build in, again, that checklist.

232
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,612
Does it meet this criteria?

233
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:02,952
Fine, I can deal with it.

234
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,273
Does it go above and beyond that?

235
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:06,894
I've got to kick it up to somebody else.

236
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:14,677
And then the documentation of when it's an administrative decision, that that decision was made within that.

237
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:18,618
We can work on the forms or whatever would be needed to fill that out.

238
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:19,839
We can discuss what those would be.

239
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:29,515
Right, I do it in vain with the idea that technically the building department is the enforcing agent for the planning board, so we just want to have those guidelines, so.

240
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:30,697
Okay, thank you.

241
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,381
Thank you, Commissioner.

242
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:34,961
President Pierce?

243
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:36,924
Thank you.

244
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,613
Chair Collins, thanks for this update and the presentation.

245
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:44,715
Super helpful to see.

246
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:47,017
I just had a couple questions.

247
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:57,165
One, just could you go a little bit more into when you mentioned that as site plan review is being discussed at the state level, could you go a little bit more into what those discussions look like?

248
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:05,452
And, you know, what is, you know, is that a change, a legislative change or something else and what the likelihood of that happening in the near term is?

249
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:09,957
Yes, and I will apologize.

250
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:12,959
I haven't looked at it in about 2 or so weeks.

251
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,000
So there may be a further update to that.

252
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,262
We've got somebody on our staff who's.

253
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,524
Also looking into it, but she and I haven't connected on it.

254
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:25,007
So there has been a proposed legislative change to.

255
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:40,256
So, at the moment, site plan review is not actually covered under the zoning law in Massachusetts 48 the special permit processes, but site plan isn't there's a lot of.

256
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:48,043
case law foresight plan, but every town, as I've found this year, has a slightly different way of doing it.

257
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:50,945
So there's been legislation proposed.

258
00:24:51,005 --> 00:25:03,536
The Mass Municipal Lawyers Association has, this is the last part that I've seen, has come forward with a letter stating some changes that they would like to see made

259
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:10,018
And then my understanding is that there's going to be some discussions on that.

260
00:25:10,138 --> 00:25:22,682
So, I don't know if it's something that's going to happen in this legislative session or if it's going to be put off, but coupled with the discussions about site plan review for the MBTA communities process,

261
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:27,291
I would expect that conversation to be ongoing.

262
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:38,621
Just to give a very brief summary, some of the communities have a site plan review process that's quite close to a special permit process.

263
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:47,189
And the concern is that it should really be, in terms of the MBTA Communities Act, that it should really be an as of right use as required by law.

264
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:58,601
And so site plan review processes that are too close to a special permit may be out of compliance with the idea of an as-of-right use.

265
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:03,967
So it's that threshold of review and what's required is the issue.

266
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:06,870
Site plan review should really be about

267
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:14,376
um, uh, putting modifications or, or, um, controlling the use and not about denying the use.

268
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:21,663
Whereas with a special permit, uh, the planning board or in your case, uh, community development board can actually deny the use.

269
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:24,385
Got it.

270
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:25,266
And thank you.

271
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:31,772
I'm now seeing the, uh, the bill, um, taking a look at it.

272
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:37,213
And we can delve into it more and have an update for you on May 8th.

273
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:44,734
Yeah, it looks like it's been reported favorably, but now it's sitting, so who knows what that means.

274
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:51,495
President Behrs, for the record, what's the bill number?

275
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:51,915
It is H3551.

276
00:26:53,776 --> 00:26:54,096
Thank you.

277
00:26:56,036 --> 00:27:01,117
So at least that's one that the NMLA sent a comment letter in on in December.

278
00:27:02,302 --> 00:27:03,343
That's the one that I have.

279
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:09,126
And I think they reissued the letter, re-sent the letter maybe about a month ago, a little bit less.

280
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:13,848
So I'm happy to provide you all with their public documents.

281
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:16,669
I'm happy to send them over to you if that would be helpful.

282
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,270
Got it.

283
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,551
Yeah, it looks like it's still alive.

284
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:27,095
So that's more than you can say for a lot of bills in the legislature in April of the second year of the term.

285
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:30,136
A couple other questions.

286
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:55,595
So just so I understand the timeline, we are, is it fair to say that mainly what will be being worked on before June 30th are the definition questions, the site plan review questions, the update to the formats of the table of use, and I saw the digital, the GIS zoning map, or is that basically what we're working on between now and June 30th?

287
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:03,676
I anticipate now that we will move forward with more than just that between now and June 30th.

288
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:07,938
What we're looking for is those things that are easiest to address.

289
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:15,801
So, as I said, I hope to bring at least the first round of language on site plan review to you for May 8th.

290
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:22,444
The definitions for May 8th, as you review those, we'll be working on the next stage.

291
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:25,705
So there are in the status memo,

292
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:28,630
I think there are a few more things that we could bring forward.

293
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:42,874
I think based on the schedule that I put out for you today, that we should probably have about three rounds of changes between now and June 30th for you to look at.

294
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:46,935
So we will advance more than just what I've presented today.

295
00:28:46,955 --> 00:28:51,837
I think what we're trying to do is set up the work plan for the more intensive

296
00:28:52,498 --> 00:29:01,845
neighborhood square corridors for happening after June 30th, but otherwise tackling as much as we can between now and then of those known changes.

297
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:03,687
Great.

298
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:04,087
Got it.

299
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:04,867
That's helpful.

300
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:05,808
Thank you.

301
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,191
And last thing is just a

302
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:13,310
On the memo format, I think the memo is great.

303
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,273
I think these presentations are fantastic.

304
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:22,504
I think just a minor thing that might be helpful, at least would be helpful to me on the memo format is on the topics table.

305
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:34,255
If we could split it out so that anything that's being considered in phase one is kind of in its own, or the proposed changes table, sorry.

306
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:40,939
Anything that's being considered in phase one, be it like its own table and then anything that's maybe going after that.

307
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,471
just be in a second table.

308
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:57,537
The formatting could just stay the same, but I just think it's almost, you know, if it was an Excel spreadsheet, I would just sort it, you know, but that would just be helpful for me to kind of see what we're doing sooner rather than later, or at least considering doing sooner rather than later.

309
00:29:57,557 --> 00:30:08,323
And then I think also what might be valuable to include in the status memo and somewhere, you know, I'm not sure as I look through it exactly where maybe it would be,

310
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:19,639
just before the topics table, or maybe just after the topics table, would be pulling out those items that we've already identified as needing further study.

311
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:29,745
I know that that's going to be part of what we're doing in mapping over the next couple months, but I know we had a discussion in a recent meeting about

312
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:35,969
the inclusionary, the transportation demand management, the linkage, and the need for the nexus study.

313
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:46,175
And then we were also talking about, with planning development and sustainability, the neighborhood studies and the various grants that were RFPs put out, grants acquired.

314
00:30:46,195 --> 00:31:00,123
I think it might be useful to have a table that includes those items, just so that we can see how long that list is getting, if it starts to get longer, since those are the few items that

315
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:27,454
will really take you know it's that where we may need to go out and get more funding or find more grants or have a six month or 12 month you know period where a study is happening so um that would just be another minor format change that would be helpful for me to see but otherwise this is uh you know i'm really excited um and i feel like having these memos updated every two weeks is a great way for us to just keep you know chugging and uh checking boxes and getting work done so thank you

316
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:30,296
I'm happy to make those changes.

317
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:39,765
The other thing I was thinking about this afternoon is I really need to number those so we can talk about, hey, look at number five in this table, look at number 32 in that table.

318
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:43,588
Because I was getting frustrated myself with not having the numbers.

319
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,470
So happy to make those changes.

320
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:55,559
And as we continue to use that memo together to review process and where we are and where we're going,

321
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:01,782
any other suggestions that counselors have that will make it more of a workable document and easier to use.

322
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:03,303
Happy to take those on.

323
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:04,144
So thank you for those.

324
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:05,344
I think those are great ideas.

325
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:06,505
Great.

326
00:32:06,545 --> 00:32:07,205
Thank you so much.

327
00:32:07,265 --> 00:32:08,106
I really appreciate it.

328
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:10,407
Great.

329
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:11,608
Thank you so much, President Behrs.

330
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:12,388
Thank you, Emily.

331
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:14,850
Really appreciate this discussion.

332
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,532
Just a couple clarifying questions from me.

333
00:32:19,552 --> 00:32:23,595
I just want to confirm we're talking about

334
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:32,746
this committee reviewing proposed changes to the definitions at our next convening in this committee.

335
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:36,869
That includes the table of uses proposals as well, is that correct?

336
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:38,950
That would be correct, yes.

337
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:40,791
Great, thank you.

338
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:48,736
And just to, my preferred way of taking in information is just to paraphrase and make sure that I'm getting it right.

339
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:49,877
So my understanding is that

340
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:55,208
Um, for example, with the table of use and parking regulations, nothing is actually changing.

341
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:57,049
No regulations requirements are changing.

342
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:59,851
We're just updating the nomenclature to make it consistent.

343
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:00,772
Is that correct?

344
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:03,363
That is correct.

345
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:12,150
Currently, you use letter-based codes, and we're just replacing the letter with what it's actually referring to.

346
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,833
So it may be spaces per unit, per employee, per square foot.

347
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:21,837
We're just moving that into the table to just make it easier to see all at once.

348
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:24,099
Great.

349
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:26,180
Thank you so much for confirming.

350
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,925
And I think that that will be a welcome change, as we've mentioned before.

351
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:44,340
you know, part of our work, you know, in the later half or three quarters of this process, we'll be looking at more substantive, we'll be considering more substantive changes to the neighborhood maps, incorporating stuff from our various plans.

352
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:56,991
And in other cases, we're just trying to make these documents more legible and more useful so that the uses and the development that we already allow and that we want to encourage will just be easier to do from both the business side and from the city side.

353
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:58,593
And I think that certainly falls under this

354
00:33:59,312 --> 00:33:59,832
category.

355
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:05,134
Just jumping ahead really quickly back to the site plan review proposed changes.

356
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:16,196
If you wouldn't mind returning quickly to the recommendations for potentially considering minor plan review, administrative review, municipal.

357
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:20,118
I'm curious, what's the difference between minor and administrative?

358
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:22,338
Are you considering both?

359
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,599
That sounds to me like it might be an either or, but I'm curious the distinction there.

360
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:28,065
I'm actually thinking of it.

361
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:30,647
I'm just pulling up the slide so you can all see it.

362
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:36,491
I'm thinking of minor plan review or administrative review as the same thing.

363
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:37,592
It doesn't have to be.

364
00:34:37,672 --> 00:34:53,884
The CD board can do a minor plan review, but in the interests of thinking about how to streamline things, I'm recommending that your minor plan review be, that you consider that your minor plan review be an administrative review.

365
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:57,585
rather than simply a second level for the CD board.

366
00:34:58,826 --> 00:35:02,307
And that, again, it's twofold.

367
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:06,389
It's to reduce some of the load of the Community Development Board.

368
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:20,894
I've never met an official yet who didn't mind having their workload reduced, but also to make it easier for smaller uses, smaller businesses to navigate the system.

369
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:25,597
and move forward, and that can be done at an administrative level.

370
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:37,105
So when we talk next time, I can present kind of the pros and cons for administrative review versus a minor plan review for a CD board.

371
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:39,867
Great.

372
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,127
Thank you so much for clarifying.

373
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:42,568
I think that makes sense.

374
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:50,634
And again, towards the end of streamlining the processes and making the language really intuitive, I think what we're talking about here is creating

375
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:53,965
a review process for minor plans.

376
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:58,170
So that recommendation makes sense to me.

377
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,452
Any further questions from councilors?

378
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,073
President Behrs.

379
00:36:02,314 --> 00:36:03,996
Thank you, Chair Collins.

380
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:09,522
This may be a left fielder, so take it with what it is.

381
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:25,096
When we talk about site plan review, I know that the 40B process is entirely outside of site plan review, but I just, you know, I see how often the ZBA is meeting on 40Bs and kind of negotiating these different projects.

382
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:34,964
And, you know, some of them have, you know, not speaking to the process or to how the ZBA is handling it, because I'm sure they're doing everything that they need to be doing.

383
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,505
It just does seem to be like it's a time consuming amount of time that the ZBA is spending on it.

384
00:36:41,086 --> 00:36:46,371
And I do know of at least one project where the time may have been determinative in future actions.

385
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:57,963
And I'm just wondering if there's anything, is there anything that we can do in zoning to around the 40B process that isn't good in any way, you know,

386
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:07,777
make that happen in a more timely manner or not have the ZBA having these extended, you know, four, five, six meeting sessions on 40B.

387
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:14,681
And also, I'd be happy if chair or director Hunt or planner Evans has comments on that.

388
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,102
I'm sure they have thoughts on it as well.

389
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:22,646
And I also raise this in the context that we just had another 40B application, so.

390
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:33,363
I don't believe there's anything you can do in zoning for the 40B because the comprehensive permit is its own process under state law.

391
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:49,732
We could look at that process under the comprehensive permit, which as you just noted, goes through the ZBA and just see if there's any recommendations about how the process has been handled at the city level.

392
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:51,373
Is there another best practices?

393
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,194
So I'd be happy to talk over that with

394
00:37:54,475 --> 00:38:18,013
uh director hunt and with mr silverstein to see if there's there's something that can be realigned there but to my knowledge there's nothing in zoning itself that can address it it would have to be a that separate process and i defer to either director hunter or mr silverstein for their comments as well and i'll go to them really in a second but i think maybe i

395
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:23,477
to clarify, is there some way we could create zoning that would encourage people to go a different path?

396
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:31,404
Because I think that the reason for 40B's existence and wanting more affordable housing, all of that's fantastic.

397
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:32,385
Great.

398
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:37,650
But sometimes you have less than ideal outcomes from the 40B process where you can't do the mixed use.

399
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,971
You can't do the larger planning.

400
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:40,373
You can't align it with comp plan.

401
00:38:40,393 --> 00:38:42,114
So that kind of thing, too, I want to throw out there.

402
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:42,815
But I'll stop.

403
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:45,449
since I'm probably the least informed person on this.

404
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:55,614
I will just add a counselor that you could you could do incentive zoning, and that could do that.

405
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:57,455
That could address those issues.

406
00:38:57,515 --> 00:38:59,196
So that might be something to consider.

407
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:13,063
And that would come into our discussions in phase two and phase three for the squares, the corridors and the neighborhoods, particularly, I think, given the comprehensive plan, the squares and the corridors, that would be an appropriate discussion there.

408
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:14,742
great.

409
00:39:14,782 --> 00:39:15,102
Thank you.

410
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:17,363
Madam chair.

411
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:19,545
Um.

412
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:26,968
So I will say that our ZBA is choosing to be very, very thorough on these

413
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:37,680
would have liked to see these buildings go through site plan review.

414
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:46,628
So they are going through all the steps of a site plan review because they want to see these built projects be the best they can be in Medford.

415
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:52,093
But it is the choice of the chair to be so thorough as he is being.

416
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:58,318
It's not actually a requirement that they hold so many meetings and be this thorough.

417
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,079
Just to be.

418
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:02,221
Right.

419
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:06,621
By law, they have to complete the review by 180 days.

420
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:19,090
They are sort of choosing to take that and on the first one actually took longer than that for a variety of reasons, including some delays on the front end by the applicant.

421
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:28,657
So it's, I would just say that it's not the law that's requiring this many meetings or for them to take this long on this project.

422
00:40:30,046 --> 00:40:34,207
Um, I have been actually we've talked to other housing developers that are interested.

423
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:49,731
And in the, the area in general and some of it is that what they want to do really isn't allowed under our current zoning right like a multifamily in this location, or mixed use on the ground floor with housing above it.

424
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:51,932
Like these things aren't currently allowed.

425
00:40:52,092 --> 00:41:01,959
And so some of this review, reviewing, looking at Mystic Ave and some of the other areas to look at changing and zoning, um, would, would help with this.

426
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,540
We do now have Safe Harbor.

427
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,683
So for two years, we can't get any more new 40B applications.

428
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:13,506
The one that was just filed that is in fact opening its public hearing next week.

429
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:20,211
Um, technically filed in 2020, and so, therefore, it's before we had Safe Harbor.

430
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:41,608
Um, so if there were to be other 40Bs come forward, it would be as a friendly 40B because, for example, if there is a location where it actually, we all agree, would be a good location for a multifamily building, um, but it's not allowed under zoning, one route might be a PPD, but another route could be a 40B that they could go through.

431
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:45,671
And if we were to do it in a more streamlined fashion, it would be a little easier.

432
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:51,014
I think some of this is that the zoning board is being very detailed oriented.

433
00:41:51,054 --> 00:41:52,755
Normally, they're a legally driven board.

434
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:58,499
And usually, this piece of it actually happens under site plan review.

435
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:06,505
We've had a number of buildings that will have three or four site plan review meetings to get all the way through the process, at least.

436
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:09,327
I mean, even I think Salem Street's had three or four already.

437
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,156
So we are trying to, yeah, I think that's sufficient.

438
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:17,937
I feel like there was something else you asked about, but.

439
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:23,359
I guess more my point is, it sounds like we could do an overlay or a PDD faster than we could.

440
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:33,163
And it's again, I get why the ZBA is doing this on the 40B side, because it's outside of our zoning entirely, but it just seems like a less than ideal procedural.

441
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:33,743
Yeah.

442
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:35,864
It's really more my fault, throwing it out there.

443
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:44,977
And again, in my experience in other communities, this is sort of the same basic format followed.

444
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:53,189
It is sort of planning department driven in a 40B, but it's still the ZBA because that is essentially what a comprehensive permit is.

445
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:53,770
You're lumping

446
00:42:55,094 --> 00:43:01,958
site plan on top of the ZBA approval process and combining it all, one for theoretically more efficient process.

447
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:05,980
So they sort of become your site plan community development board.

448
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,081
And that's what drags these things out.

449
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:13,224
But the ones I've seen before, this is kind of what happens.

450
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:23,742
Thank you.

451
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:24,804
We were speculating last night.

452
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:26,225
It makes me think of Jaws every time.

453
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:32,613
Thank you, Commissioner.

454
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:36,658
Recognizing Attorney Silverstein.

455
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,903
Oh, thank you, Madam Chair, President.

456
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:52,298
I guess the only thing I would add in following up, I was going to mention the PDD process, which I think really is the incentive zoning that Emily referred to.

457
00:43:53,059 --> 00:44:05,067
And we've seen that it's been working so far because it offers a mechanism that is no not, you know, not without

458
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:16,391
procedural steps, it's less cumbersome than going and getting a project eligibility letter and going through the conference permit process and provides more flexibility.

459
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:26,319
And so I do think that that has shown itself in a pretty short time to be a pretty useful tool and a much more collaborative tool than 40B.

460
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,142
And I guess I'll just throw out the other possibility of 40R zoning, which

461
00:44:36,601 --> 00:44:48,189
provides incentives both to developers and to the city for appropriate circumstances for mixed using or multifamily residential.

462
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,692
And that also is a more collaborative process.

463
00:44:52,712 --> 00:44:56,815
So that is a zoning process as is PDD.

464
00:44:57,576 --> 00:45:00,758
So while I agree with Emily that there's nothing you can really do

465
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:12,064
to affect the 40B process in zoning, there are opportunities to create zoning that maybe gives another path to developers.

466
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:17,805
Thank you so much.

467
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,606
I think that point is well taken.

468
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:30,568
And important to keep in mind as we do progress towards the squares, corridors, and neighborhoods part of this process in phase two and phase three, how we can essentially, I think that a lot of our

469
00:45:31,471 --> 00:45:45,722
shared goal here is to how to create the zoning that aligns with the uses that city, the resident wants, and that makes it easier for us to take developers up on the development that we really want them to be doing in the city.

470
00:45:48,023 --> 00:45:48,364
Thank you.

471
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:54,428
Seeing no other further comments on this time, I'm just going to shift towards kind of summarize.

472
00:45:54,508 --> 00:45:55,269
Oh, Director Hunt.

473
00:45:56,638 --> 00:46:03,171
I just wanted to ask one further question about the items that were on this list just to make sure we were all understanding the same thing.

474
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:07,079
The section on the municipal administrative review language.

475
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:27,549
that I wanted to see is that addressing the recommendation that has come forward around having municipal properties, municipal projects be separate from zoning but need to be reviewed but not subject to the same tests of, you know, variances if they're not meeting zoning.

476
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:29,230
Is that what that section's about?

477
00:46:31,283 --> 00:46:44,012
Yes, my understanding is that the city was looking to have the ability to have a public review and therefore a public forum for municipal projects.

478
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:54,899
But it's not necessarily as you point out, Director Hunt, it's not imposing zoning restrictions that would not otherwise be on a municipal project.

479
00:46:54,959 --> 00:47:01,043
It's more about creating that forum, that opportunity for discussion and that opportunity for information to the public.

480
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:03,789
for those projects.

481
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:13,065
It is our understanding in the planning office that right now, municipal properties, municipal buildings are subject to zoning.

482
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:19,650
And if they, for example, wanted different setbacks, they would have to pass the variance test at the ZBA.

483
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:34,640
So I wanted to make sure that through this language, that it's clear, because it was brought to my attention that that's not actually how it works in most or many municipalities, that municipal buildings are not subject to zoning.

484
00:47:35,460 --> 00:48:02,607
So I just wanted to check that if we needed, perhaps it's a question for Attorney Silverstein to review, that if we need to update any other language just to make sure that it's clear, because until now, like our architects working on the fire headquarters, for example, felt that they were being held to the zoning restrictions of Medford's municipal zoning, because they didn't see anything in the language that said that a new fire headquarters would not be.

485
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,700
I can speak to that.

486
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:18,102
So there are many municipal zoning ordinances and bylaws that have exemption either partial or complete for municipal uses and properties.

487
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:34,826
My memory, and I'm just taking a quick look, is that there is an exemption from some special permit performance standards for municipal uses right now in the Medford ordinance, but there is not a

488
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:53,136
broader uh exemption from um from zoning and you know i so obviously educational um projects have the benefit of the dover amendment but other than that it's completely a matter of

489
00:48:54,390 --> 00:49:01,114
uh, the extent to which, uh, the city wants to exempt its own projects from zoning regulations.

490
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:03,796
So, uh, that's a policy decision.

491
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:06,837
It's easy enough to write a broader exemption.

492
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:10,600
And I would say, let's definitely put that on the list of things to discuss.

493
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:15,683
Thank you.

494
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:16,723
Attorney servicing.

495
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:17,524
Appreciate that.

496
00:49:17,604 --> 00:49:23,007
And I think that, um, we should certainly add that to our list of

497
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:40,450
items to check and double back to either at the May 8th meeting or at the appropriate time to make sure that if this is being addressed through language changes to municipal review, then it's consistent elsewhere throughout our zoning ordinances.

498
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,613
Thank you for taking a first approach at that.

499
00:49:47,682 --> 00:49:57,605
So we have about five minutes until we should take a recess of this committee so that the Public Works Committee can use this space until around 7.30, and then we will reconvene in this committee.

500
00:49:58,225 --> 00:50:03,187
So I just want to try and quickly summarize us towards the end of this topic.

501
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:07,548
We do have a question from a resident.

502
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:09,829
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

503
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,070
I do see that I'll get to him in just a second.

504
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,551
Thank you so much for flagging that.

505
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:34,786
I just want to make sure that we're all clear on what we're preparing for for our next meeting, anticipating the proposed definition change language, as well as table of use proposals, recommended language on site plan review, and then the proposal for mapping and the GIS zoning map.

506
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:41,187
Emily, are we expecting that for next time or just an update to the status memo bringing us closer to those proposals?

507
00:50:42,447 --> 00:50:44,328
Just an update to the status, Madam Chair.

508
00:50:46,138 --> 00:50:46,338
Great.

509
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:47,600
Thank you so much.

510
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:51,365
So we'll go quickly to Gaston.

511
00:50:51,405 --> 00:50:52,967
Just name and address for the record, please.

512
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:54,129
And I've asked you to unmute on Zoom.

513
00:50:57,495 --> 00:50:58,316
Thank you, Madam Chair.

514
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,417
Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Road.

515
00:51:00,717 --> 00:51:15,105
I was just wondering, I know that Somerville has an urban agriculture ordinance where, for example, it regulates, among a bunch of other things, even the keeping of chickens and bees.

516
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:19,988
I know that Medford does not allow the keeping of chickens.

517
00:51:20,568 --> 00:51:25,691
So I was just wondering whether it would make sense, in spite of this ordinance,

518
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:32,476
disowning ordinance revamp to consider something along the lines of what Somerville has.

519
00:51:33,576 --> 00:51:43,744
I think it would be very interesting and desirable to sort of allow some, you know, to some extent, urban agriculture projects.

520
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:53,110
And I just wanted to make sure that if this is the most efficient time to consider something like this, that the city council

521
00:51:54,931 --> 00:52:01,116
takes this into account and consideration so we can have something similar to what Somerville has.

522
00:52:01,176 --> 00:52:02,477
Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

523
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:06,179
Thank you so much for that comment.

524
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:19,669
We appreciate you bringing it up early in the process so that we can make sure that that is something that we do discuss with our zoning consultant, and we'll certainly have a conversation about that and see where it might be deliberated and discussed.

525
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:21,490
I know this is in the interest of Councilor Callahan.

526
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:29,698
Just wanted to thank you for that comment and say that Councilor Tsang and I have been discussing allowing chickens in the city.

527
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,079
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

528
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:45,243
Are there any further comments, questions from this time from members of the public, councilors, city staff, and associates before we take a approximately 30-minute recess?

529
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,287
see and note that that recesses for public work.

530
00:52:53,307 --> 00:52:53,507
Got it.

531
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:54,147
Yep.

532
00:52:55,307 --> 00:53:03,349
And just to restate, we will reconvene after the public works committee, um, has net, um, same zoom, same channel.

533
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:05,529
We're taking a brief recess to allow for that committee.

534
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:12,291
Um, thank you so much, Emily and associates, uh, city staff for being with us tonight.

535
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:19,132
And again, for members of the public, um, we will reconvene after the public works committee to have an affordable housing training from the mass housing partnership.

536
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:20,933
Do I have a motion to recess?

537
00:53:20,953 --> 00:53:23,574
Do I have a second on the motion to recess?

538
00:53:23,594 --> 00:53:25,755
Second.

539
00:53:25,775 --> 00:53:28,716
On the motion to recess by Councilor Callahan, seconded by President Behrs.

540
00:53:28,816 --> 00:53:29,957
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

541
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:44,782
Alicia.

542
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:45,943
On the roll call for the recess.

543
00:53:49,189 --> 00:53:49,850
Councilor Callahan.

544
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,171
Yes.

545
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:51,913
President Ferris.

546
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:52,454
Yes.

547
00:53:52,755 --> 00:53:53,316
Councilor Lemming.

548
00:53:53,516 --> 00:53:53,816
Yes.

549
00:53:54,337 --> 00:53:55,099
Councilor Scarpelli.

550
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:55,920
Yes.

551
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,143
Vice President Collins.

552
00:53:58,364 --> 00:53:58,604
Yes.

553
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:01,990
Five in favor, zero opposed.

554
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,993
The meeting is recessed and will reconvene.

555
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:14,248
All right, the Planning and Permitting Committee is hereby reconvened.

556
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:22,970
Thank you so much for bearing with us during our quick, short recess to take a meeting of the Public Works Committee, and now we're back.

557
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:35,052
We are going to be hearing from the Mass Housing Partnership and housing planner, Aditi, on 24083 and affordable housing training.

558
00:54:35,132 --> 00:54:38,853
I will hand it over to Aditi to introduce our guests, and please feel free to take it away.

559
00:54:43,393 --> 00:54:43,853
Good evening.

560
00:54:45,094 --> 00:54:56,359
This evening we have with us Karsten Snow-Eckelberg and Laura Schufeld from Massachusetts Housing Partnership, which is a public nonprofit affordable housing organization.

561
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:05,444
Karsten and Laura will give us a presentation that covers the need for affordable housing in Medford, the region, and across Massachusetts.

562
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:16,508
The presentation will also include a basic overview of affordable housing development financing and how municipal policies can implement financial feasibility.

563
00:55:17,468 --> 00:55:25,591
Additionally, the presentation will explore what local resources and opportunities exist for communities to encourage productive housing.

564
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:27,591
Over to Karsten and Laura.

565
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,192
And welcome to Medford.

566
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:35,534
Thank you for that terrific introduction.

567
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:38,740
Let's see.

568
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:41,447
Kirsten's going to share her screen.

569
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:56,328
So thank you for having us tonight.

570
00:55:57,108 --> 00:55:58,970
Again, my name is Laura Schufeld.

571
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,473
I'm the Director of Community Assistance at Mass Housing Partnership.

572
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:17,385
Mass Housing Partnership is a quasi-state agency whose mission is to work with communities to create innovative policy and financing solutions that provide affordable homes and better lives for the people of Massachusetts.

573
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:20,890
And we do that in a number of ways.

574
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:34,759
We have our community assistance team, which is our outward facing team that goes into communities and provides technical assistance, strategies for affordable housing and planning.

575
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:41,203
Our lending department is our bread and butter, and they use private sources of

576
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:51,295
of private sources of capital to provide long-term affordable, permanent mortgages for affordable housing.

577
00:56:52,615 --> 00:56:57,396
One Mortgage is our first-time homebuyer program administered through local banks.

578
00:56:58,036 --> 00:57:02,337
That's the most affordable first-time homebuyer program in Massachusetts.

579
00:57:03,017 --> 00:57:10,539
And finally, our Center for Housing Data collects, analyzes, and shares information for effective policy creation.

580
00:57:13,249 --> 00:57:19,391
And just a few of the things that the community assistance team does, workshops and trainings, technical assistance.

581
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:28,934
We assist communities and housing authorities who have surplus land that they want to dispose of for affordable housing.

582
00:57:28,974 --> 00:57:33,215
We help them do pre-development and request for proposals to dispose of it.

583
00:57:33,855 --> 00:57:39,577
And we also have resources and publications on a variety of affordable housing topics.

584
00:57:41,593 --> 00:57:49,135
So today, tonight, I'll say tonight, we're going to talk about the data story.

585
00:57:49,195 --> 00:58:04,439
So what the need for affordable housing is, key players in Massachusetts in affordable housing, sources of funding for affordable housing in Massachusetts, and how that is distributed, the impacts on the cost of delivering housing,

586
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:09,999
roadblocks to housing development and opportunities for housing.

587
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:16,052
We're going to do a little bit of tag team, but not too much, but I'm going to hand it over to Karsten now to

588
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,830
Great, thank you, Laura.

589
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,851
It sounds like I have the mic in the right place.

590
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:26,512
So first, thank you all again for having us here this evening.

591
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:27,812
Once again, my name is Karsten.

592
00:58:27,952 --> 00:58:31,593
I'm a senior real estate development officer on Laura's team at MHP.

593
00:58:32,654 --> 00:58:40,736
To start the conversation, we wanted to talk about how it is that we define affordable and define affordable limits.

594
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:46,197
So we tend to talk about capital A affordable housing versus little a affordable housing.

595
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:52,583
little affordable housing, anyone can live there, it's just a really great deal and it's affordable to the person that lives there.

596
00:58:53,264 --> 00:59:03,453
Capital A affordable housing, as we informally call it, is housing that is funded with certain programs, funding sources, and has particular restrictions and regulations on it.

597
00:59:04,114 --> 00:59:11,561
And in particular, residents that live there must meet certain income limits, and in return, their rent is capped at a certain amount.

598
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:21,103
Medford is in the Boston, Cambridge, Quincy metropolitan statistical area, and the U.S.

599
00:59:21,123 --> 00:59:32,568
Department of Housing and Urban Development sets income limits and rents for statistical areas across the country based on context and characteristics of within those areas.

600
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:45,040
And by comparing these limits and the rent limits to data, housing data on the area as a whole, we can really get a picture of what the affordability issues are.

601
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:52,567
So here you can see the 2024 limits that just came out for the Boston, Cambridge, Quincy metro area.

602
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,555
And the AMI 100% for the area is a little under $150,000.

603
00:59:59,076 --> 01:00:10,552
And going down, you can see various levels of area median income that are rent levels set depending on the affordability of the project, ranging from low income to very low income.

604
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:21,636
And when we talk about the affordable rents, there's two different ways that an affordable rent is both calculated and used in a project.

605
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:31,022
So it can be a percentage of a resident's actual income, which is the formula used when it's a housing voucher subsidy or in public housing programs.

606
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:37,366
So in this instance, they pay a calculated percentage of their actual income, and it is adjusted

607
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:39,405
if their incomes rise.

608
01:00:40,305 --> 01:00:47,908
The subsidy source, typically the government in this instance, will then pay the remainder to make up the rent to make enough to operate that unit.

609
01:00:49,148 --> 01:00:49,528
Excuse me.

610
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:54,130
On the other side, it's calculated as a percentage of theoretical income.

611
01:00:54,290 --> 01:01:02,813
And so this is the case in most housing programs at the state level, as well as the low-income housing tax credit, which I will get into in a few minutes.

612
01:01:04,014 --> 01:01:06,135
This is calculated assuming a

613
01:01:07,435 --> 01:01:13,778
approximate 30% of a typical resident in that unit, and the rent is capped according to that formula.

614
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:21,501
So, a tenant that qualifies may end up paying more than 30%, but their rent is never going to go up if their incomes don't go up.

615
01:01:24,045 --> 01:01:26,887
So now to get a little bit more specific into Medford.

616
01:01:26,947 --> 01:01:34,153
So we saw what the affordable incomes and affordable rents looked like from the calculation for the Boston Cambridge Trinity area.

617
01:01:35,414 --> 01:01:40,758
Taking a look at a quick analysis of home sales, now we're talking about home prices.

618
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:46,603
Over the last year in Medford, 217 approximate homes were sold.

619
01:01:47,683 --> 01:01:48,724
The average sale price was $835,000.

620
01:01:48,764 --> 01:01:49,685
The average price per square foot

621
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:59,031
484, and that translates roughly to a monthly mortgage payment of $4,800 a month.

622
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:09,937
Similarly, if we look at current asking market rents, you can see that one bedroom is around $2,800, all the way up to a three-bedroom for a little more than $5,000.

623
01:02:11,058 --> 01:02:18,162
So, you can see the difference in how they're calculating the rents that would be affordable to lower incomes versus what's on the market now.

624
01:02:20,823 --> 01:02:32,215
As Laura mentioned, the Center for Housing Data and MHP has a ton of really great tools and reports that they have put out looking at housing costs across the Commonwealth, and one in particular is Datatown.

625
01:02:32,696 --> 01:02:35,579
And that is where I have started to pull some information for Medford.

626
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:40,585
So on Datatown, the website at the bottom, or you can go to mhp.net and find Datatown.

627
01:02:41,045 --> 01:02:51,371
you can go in and select any community in the Commonwealth and get a huge variety of very recent demographic and housing data about that community, and it also generates graphics like this one.

628
01:02:52,032 --> 01:03:05,620
So in addition to looking at the actual numbers, you can see here that a comparison of how much renter households and owner households are paying monthly for housing costs.

629
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:12,344
So you can see that in this instance, approximately 50% of renters and 80% of homeowners in Medford are paying more than $2,000 a month for housing costs.

630
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:28,832
And when we think about how much a household is spending per month on housing costs, we then discuss the cost burden to that household.

631
01:03:28,992 --> 01:03:41,042
So a household is considered cost burden if they are spending more than 30% of their income on housing, and they are considered severely cost burdened if they're paying more than 50% of their income on housing.

632
01:03:41,582 --> 01:03:51,429
So as you can see from this graph from Datatown, the renter households typically tend to be more cost burdened than the owner households right now in Medford.

633
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:58,354
And it is worth noting that the cost burden definitions are solely related to housing costs.

634
01:03:58,394 --> 01:04:08,602
So it doesn't take into account other factors such as childcare or food costs or transportation that may also impact a household's ability to pay their bills.

635
01:04:11,092 --> 01:04:19,875
So now we've seen a little picture of the affordability issues, which I'm sure is not a surprise to anyone that lives in Medford or greater Boston.

636
01:04:20,415 --> 01:04:23,476
And a bigger question that we talk about is, how did we get here?

637
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:32,019
There are several factors that have led to the current status of housing in greater Boston.

638
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:40,402
But some key elements of the trends are a lack of overall supply of housing units, prices and rents outpacing incomes,

639
01:04:41,122 --> 01:04:48,637
and an increasing cost to develop housing, and in particular, an increasing cost to develop income-restricted, capital A, affordable housing.

640
01:04:51,600 --> 01:05:04,142
This is a chart from a recent report that Mass Housing Partnership did called Building Momentum, and it shows the trend line of new housing units permitted annually in Massachusetts from the 1960s.

641
01:05:04,723 --> 01:05:14,464
And so you can see as we're getting into the 80s and the 2000s, while there was a little uptick from 2010 up, it is nowhere near where it used to be.

642
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:16,385
And so when we talk about a lack of supply,

643
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:24,867
of housing units combined with what we're expecting in job trends and population increases, it just has not kept pace with where we would expect to be.

644
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:29,322
Similarly, again, a chart from Datatown.

645
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:34,905
This is Medford specific and the dotted lines are the state and blue is Medford.

646
01:05:34,945 --> 01:05:38,686
So you can see Medford's permits have followed a similar trend line.

647
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:46,190
However, in 2014 or later, Medford actually had a jump that outpaced the state a little bit.

648
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,131
So a little bit more happening in Medford.

649
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:56,073
As I mentioned, too, we've seen incomes not keep pace with prices and rents.

650
01:05:56,513 --> 01:06:05,439
So in this chart from the Greater Boston Housing Report Card, it shows the ratio of prices to median incomes in different metropolitan areas.

651
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,482
And Boston is right there in the middle in the blue line.

652
01:06:10,743 --> 01:06:19,690
And right around 2018, which is the last time this was taken, the median house price was approximately five times the median income.

653
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:38,586
So when you consider the fact that that's a significant price, and you need to also have a significant down payment combined with rising interest rates, it's really putting homeownership out of reach for a lot of people in Metro Boston, which also then in turn is going to put pressure on the rental market because they're not able to access homeownership market.

654
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,431
And finally, the last piece.

655
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:46,996
While there's many reasons that it's getting more expensive to develop affordable housing.

656
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:55,344
One of the things that has happened most recently during the pandemic and after is a huge jump in construction costs, and I'm not sure if anyone

657
01:06:56,525 --> 01:07:06,068
had a look at the Globe's recent article in December, and there's a really great tool that shows how construction costs impact how affordable a unit can be and how you can build.

658
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:20,312
But even as we're seeing that blue line of rents go up and up, the construction line is going up even higher, which overall means it takes more resources to build the same unit, which ultimately means less affordable housing.

659
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:22,473
And I'm going to pass it back to Laura.

660
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:35,840
We didn't say at the beginning, but if you have questions as we go along, please feel free to interrupt us or ask.

661
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,126
So I'll pause and just feel free.

662
01:07:40,707 --> 01:07:40,947
Okay.

663
01:07:42,497 --> 01:07:47,081
So who are the key players in affordable housing development in Massachusetts?

664
01:07:48,602 --> 01:07:53,266
First, of course, is the Department of Housing and Urban Development on the federal side.

665
01:07:55,088 --> 01:07:59,692
And then on the state side is the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.

666
01:08:00,232 --> 01:08:07,959
And then all the quasars, Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency that goes by MassHousing, MHP, MassHousing Partnership.

667
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:23,571
Mass Development does some housing and then CDAC, which is the Community Economic Development Assistance Corporation, which primarily does supportive housing, finances supportive housing.

668
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:35,300
And then on the local side, it depends, of course, on the city and town that you're in, but planning and zoning departments certainly help with information and

669
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:38,326
moving some policies along.

670
01:08:39,386 --> 01:08:57,634
The Community Preservation Committees around provide funding for housing, they have to set aside 10% of the annual receipts for affordable housing in their terms, community housing.

671
01:08:58,789 --> 01:09:13,814
Municipal Affordable Housing Trust, which I understand Medford does have, and which our colleague, Shelly Gehring, who's on our team, has assisted in getting things started with them and looking at goals.

672
01:09:15,794 --> 01:09:24,097
Local governments get involved, and local housing authorities are, of course, a player in the local affordable housing,

673
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:26,960
market.

674
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:46,341
And then developers for profit or nonprofit and that includes development sponsors, investors, architects, contractors, and lots of different consultants that all assist in making affordable housing work.

675
01:09:47,898 --> 01:09:59,911
I'm gonna talk a little bit about what subsidy sources are out there so you can get a little flavor of how development projects, affordable housing development projects get put together.

676
01:10:01,132 --> 01:10:17,284
Federal resources, the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit that Karsten spoke about is the biggest source of funds for financing or for developing affordable rental housing.

677
01:10:18,244 --> 01:10:21,647
Home program funds also are federal.

678
01:10:22,127 --> 01:10:27,451
They come through the state and they come through consortiums and individual cities and towns as well.

679
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:34,101
state resources are funded by the state's housing bond bill.

680
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:47,275
You may know that there's a proposed new state housing bond bill of $4.1 billion that is out there waiting for

681
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:50,246
the legislature to pass it, fingers crossed.

682
01:10:52,267 --> 01:11:00,010
So in Massachusetts, we also has state low income housing tax credits that can be back on the federal tax credits.

683
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:10,274
And then all the rest of these are soft debt that can be added to a program to subsidize they all have kind of different

684
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:23,299
criteria in order to use them, in order to get funded by them, and some of them can be added.

685
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:26,901
You typically have more than one source.

686
01:11:28,202 --> 01:11:35,645
Lately, we've been seeing eight, nine, 10 sources in order for our project to get enough funding to move forward.

687
01:11:44,302 --> 01:11:45,303
Yes, thank you.

688
01:11:45,743 --> 01:12:00,906
We have, we recently instituted an affordable housing trust fund last year, which is about 30 years too late to be fair, but is there any, what are the usual sources of income for affordable housing trust funds that you know about so far?

689
01:12:03,807 --> 01:12:13,137
We've identified a few potentially, if the transfer fee goes through, that could be one, also CPA funds, and we were working on linkage fees.

690
01:12:13,177 --> 01:12:16,020
Are there any other common sources of funding that you can think about?

691
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:20,256
I'll say there's uncommon sources.

692
01:12:20,556 --> 01:12:41,990
So this, depending on the region, I'm from the Cape and on the Cape, if a project comes in that has a regional impact, so a large amount of units that are affordable, the surrounding towns, the developer will go to the surrounding towns and will

693
01:12:43,968 --> 01:12:50,216
get resources from those communities as well, usually $100,000 each and they'll go to four or five.

694
01:12:50,336 --> 01:12:51,958
So it makes a difference.

695
01:12:53,840 --> 01:13:02,331
That's atypical, but typical on the Cape and in Western Mass, where there's not many that have CPA there, but for the ones that do.

696
01:13:03,415 --> 01:13:16,785
There are a couple of communities who have cell towers on public land, and the rents or leases, lease revenue from that goes into their housing trust.

697
01:13:18,006 --> 01:13:18,767
Many- Sorry, what?

698
01:13:18,807 --> 01:13:19,507
Cell towers?

699
01:13:19,548 --> 01:13:20,288
Cell towers.

700
01:13:21,249 --> 01:13:22,510
Yeah.

701
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:27,674
Many communities use a portion of the short-term rental fees.

702
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:31,756
revenue for affordable housing.

703
01:13:32,997 --> 01:13:47,531
For the trust, up to 50% of them in some communities, especially coastal communities, that seasonal resort communities, but as much as 10 or 15% makes a difference.

704
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:52,715
Provincetown has 50 and other towns around are at about 10 or 15.

705
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:54,876
You said rental fees?

706
01:13:55,376 --> 01:13:56,297
Short-term rental.

707
01:13:56,597 --> 01:13:57,677
Okay, short-term rental fees.

708
01:13:57,717 --> 01:13:58,957
Yeah, Airbnbs.

709
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:06,158
Okay, so that's something that we're legally able to do is charge Airbnbs like 50% to put into the Affordable Housing Trust.

710
01:14:06,418 --> 01:14:08,059
But we already charge fees.

711
01:14:08,519 --> 01:14:10,759
Yeah, you probably already charged them fees up.

712
01:14:10,819 --> 01:14:13,060
You can charge up, a community can charge up to 6%.

713
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:17,781
That's a local tax on Airbnbs.

714
01:14:18,081 --> 01:14:19,121
We'll use Airbnbs.

715
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:19,961
And

716
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:26,449
and then you can direct a portion or all of those fees to the trust.

717
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:28,291
That's...

718
01:14:36,838 --> 01:14:49,031
There's, there's been several communities who have actually funded the trust with free cash or out of their, their budget.

719
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,774
And then one way that is,

720
01:14:53,816 --> 01:15:07,632
has been used, especially either in small communities who don't get a lot of receipts from CPA, or if there's a new CPA that hasn't accumulated a lot of funds, CPA can be bonded.

721
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:10,381
and then it's paid back with CPA funds.

722
01:15:10,941 --> 01:15:29,177
So if you bond it for a housing project, then the annual fees come out of the housing piece, unless you vote to take it out of undesignated, but that's been used quite a bit to fund larger projects.

723
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:34,221
So I think I've run out of sources.

724
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:35,522
Thank you.

725
01:15:36,423 --> 01:15:36,903
You're welcome.

726
01:15:44,394 --> 01:15:44,834
Where am I?

727
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:45,855
Oh.

728
01:15:47,035 --> 01:15:56,421
So I said that the subsidy sources for the state are kind of cobbled together by developers.

729
01:15:57,181 --> 01:16:02,924
And that happens based on what's called a qualified allocation plan.

730
01:16:03,745 --> 01:16:11,869
And that is, what am I trying to say?

731
01:16:14,184 --> 01:16:22,988
It's required to be published by each state to list the priorities for the low-income housing tax credits.

732
01:16:23,748 --> 01:16:37,715
Massachusetts has the priorities for all the subsidy funds that they use, so it kind of flows into any project that's being funded.

733
01:16:37,735 --> 01:16:38,695
It is,

734
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,592
It's very competitive to get these funds.

735
01:16:44,032 --> 01:17:01,148
There's two kinds of tax credits and the 9% tax credits are the most competitive and the 4%, which is a lesser amount of subsidy, used to be fairly routine to get and now are very competitive as well.

736
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:20,371
The funding priorities for this current year are housing for extremely low income households, that's 30% of area median income or below, investment in distressed and at-risk neighborhoods,

737
01:17:21,132 --> 01:17:35,724
preservation of existing affordable housing, new production for families in high opportunity neighborhoods, and new production, family or seniors in communities that have less than 12% on their subsidized housing inventory.

738
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,966
And the subsidized housing inventory is the count.

739
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:47,954
The state keeps the inventory of all the deed restricted affordable housing that a community has.

740
01:17:48,654 --> 01:17:49,955
And the goal is 10%.

741
01:17:52,993 --> 01:17:59,816
And any project that is below, in a community that's below 12% has a priority.

742
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:04,018
You'll see these priorities don't all mesh together.

743
01:18:04,038 --> 01:18:10,580
They can be competing and conflicting, but they're all scored individually.

744
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:13,602
Quick question on this slide, if you don't mind an interruption.

745
01:18:14,282 --> 01:18:20,045
The recipients for these funding streams under the QAP, can that be communities, local housing authorities,

746
01:18:21,693 --> 01:18:24,036
other quality of?

747
01:18:24,636 --> 01:18:29,201
It's limited for communities and local housing authorities.

748
01:18:30,022 --> 01:18:39,432
The low income housing tax credit has to be a partnership, cannot be housing authorities or a public entity.

749
01:18:39,452 --> 01:18:41,374
Thank you.

750
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:51,609
So this is a little bit deeper on the low income housing tax credit.

751
01:18:53,210 --> 01:19:01,675
So just to give you a little detail, I told you it's the largest funding source.

752
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:12,402
Investors receive a reduction in their tax liability for a period of 10 years in exchange for providing equity into a project.

753
01:19:15,433 --> 01:19:25,237
So it's a project, it's a program that is overseen by the treasury department, not housing, so it follows treasury rules.

754
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:31,179
Projects receiving investments must be affordable for at least 30 years.

755
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,002
And the minimum affordable levels are 40% at 60% area median income, or 20% at 50%

756
01:19:43,837 --> 01:19:46,019
or 30%, 50% AMI.

757
01:19:47,501 --> 01:20:00,435
There are strict reporting and certifications for compliance around it that are done annually in Massachusetts by an outside consulting firm.

758
01:20:04,807 --> 01:20:06,728
Talk a little bit about public housing.

759
01:20:08,148 --> 01:20:14,510
Federal public housing is governed by HUD, the Federal Housing and Urban Development.

760
01:20:16,991 --> 01:20:27,514
Right now, the active programs are for repositioning and redeveloping public housing, and it's 33,000 units of federal public housing in Massachusetts.

761
01:20:29,026 --> 01:20:38,589
What I should note is that neither federal nor state public housing has funded new units since I think about 1989.

762
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:44,891
So there's been no funds for new units since then.

763
01:20:46,335 --> 01:20:51,140
We are, Massachusetts is one of only four states that has state public housing.

764
01:20:52,302 --> 01:21:01,553
Its governing agency is the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, and there's 41,000 units of state public housing.

765
01:21:02,213 --> 01:21:06,058
About three quarters of that are age-restricted senior housing.

766
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:20,427
both both HUD and and I'll just say HLC because it's easier the state agency.

767
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:34,138
They both are finding ways to reposition and redevelop public housing after years and decades of disinvestment by both the state and the federal government.

768
01:21:34,798 --> 01:21:45,861
And when they redevelop them, they take them into more of a private investment, private development scheme or scenario.

769
01:21:46,061 --> 01:21:47,761
I guess scheme is not the right word.

770
01:21:51,122 --> 01:21:57,626
And so the subsidies that I've been talking about have all been on the development side.

771
01:21:57,686 --> 01:22:04,570
So they've all been to reduce the debt on the project so that it can be affordable.

772
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:09,633
So the rents can be affordable or the sales prices can be affordable.

773
01:22:10,474 --> 01:22:19,860
For rental units, there's also housing vouchers which are the other side, look at the revenue side of

774
01:22:21,371 --> 01:22:30,198
of the equation, so they increase the revenue for deeper subsidy or deeper targeted population.

775
01:22:30,818 --> 01:22:46,070
So there's two types of housing vouchers, mobile housing vouchers, stay with the tenant, the tenant goes out and finds a unit that's on the market and the voucher goes with them, they pay 30% of their income,

776
01:22:48,928 --> 01:23:03,600
and whoever's giving the voucher, state or federal, pays the rest up to the asking rent, assuming it's below what, at or below what is allowed under the program.

777
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:17,832
For developers, project-based housing vouchers help make a new project work or a preservation project work, because those vouchers stay with the unit.

778
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:28,267
And tenants come in and qualify for those units based on the eligibility of the vouchers.

779
01:23:29,568 --> 01:23:36,533
But they then have the developer or owner then has a guaranteed income for that unit going forward.

780
01:23:39,218 --> 01:23:48,584
So the different voucher programs, the federal government has a few different, the most well-known is the Section 8, also called the Housing Choice Voucher.

781
01:23:49,845 --> 01:23:54,548
That's for families, seniors, and disabled individuals also.

782
01:23:55,608 --> 01:24:00,992
VASH, which is the veterans-only vouchers.

783
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:02,913
The RAD Section 8,

784
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:15,116
repositioning public housing, the new units get converted to the Section 18 vouchers.

785
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:34,379
And then the state has two different kinds, MRVP, which is Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program, and that can be families, seniors, and the disabled, and the AHVP, which is Affordable Housing Voucher Program, which are for younger disabled folks.

786
01:24:37,796 --> 01:24:40,157
Sorry, I have a really small clarifying question.

787
01:24:40,177 --> 01:24:45,680
For the RADS slash section 18, you mentioned that there isn't new federally funded public housing being built.

788
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,221
So is that when a unit is just moved to a new location?

789
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,102
So it's when the

790
01:24:55,509 --> 01:25:00,714
the public housing is being repositioned and redeveloped.

791
01:25:01,395 --> 01:25:06,640
And so it's in the same, sometimes it's a raise and replace redevelopment.

792
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:18,171
And instead of having federal government subsidizing through the public housing program, they have vouchers instead.

793
01:25:20,342 --> 01:25:23,405
So there's no net increase in the number of units.

794
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,468
It's a change in the voucher method?

795
01:25:25,648 --> 01:25:26,529
It's a change, right.

796
01:25:27,009 --> 01:25:27,550
Thank you.

797
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,171
There are ways to do.

798
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:32,035
Well, I won't go into that.

799
01:25:32,075 --> 01:25:33,917
That's too technical, but yeah.

800
01:25:34,077 --> 01:25:34,337
Thank you.

801
01:25:37,774 --> 01:25:38,114
still me.

802
01:25:40,475 --> 01:25:44,537
So the funding assembly process.

803
01:25:45,718 --> 01:25:51,400
First up, developers, this is what a developer, developers timeline looks like.

804
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:55,982
They apply for city, state and state funds kind of at the same time.

805
01:25:56,002 --> 01:25:58,884
They have different funding rounds.

806
01:25:59,004 --> 01:26:04,146
So if it's CPA, you know, you're a city, so the city council gets to

807
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,510
vote on it.

808
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:12,554
Towns that have to wait for town meetings, so developers juggle to try and get on the schedule.

809
01:26:14,015 --> 01:26:27,082
The state funds, like I said, they are all funding around that's annual, and it's typically in late fall for pre-applications around November or December.

810
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:32,645
Then the town or city commits

811
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:35,490
the funds.

812
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:48,999
It's needed to be committed before you can apply for state funds because some of the programs require that there be local support in order to get the funding.

813
01:26:50,444 --> 01:26:54,567
And the state funding typically needs to cycle through several rounds.

814
01:26:55,408 --> 01:27:02,353
So developer will go in year one and may or may not get to a full application.

815
01:27:02,473 --> 01:27:06,476
Year two, they may get to a full application, but not get funded.

816
01:27:07,217 --> 01:27:11,540
And then year three, fingers crossed, they finally made it to the top.

817
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:12,861
Mm-hmm.

818
01:27:17,134 --> 01:27:26,418
Uh, yes, so question, so I saw I saw some of this happen when I was on the CPA and we're funding the walk link court redevelopment.

819
01:27:26,678 --> 01:27:34,081
So, you know, the CPA funds were a necessary requisite to get state and federal funding is there, but.

820
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:50,850
Part of my concern with funding affordable housing this way is it does sort of mean that somebody trying to put together a funding package is just putting up a lot of overhead, keeping up with these different applications and the requirement of all these applications.

821
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:57,372
Is there any way, just at the local level, like possibly dispersing funds from an affordable housing trust that you can

822
01:27:58,092 --> 01:28:06,696
feasibly and without breaking the system, reduce the burden for people that are trying to apply for all these different grants just to fund the project.

823
01:28:08,157 --> 01:28:10,298
Just your thoughts on that in general, I'd appreciate.

824
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:13,962
Yeah, for the state funding, it's one application.

825
01:28:13,982 --> 01:28:15,402
It's called a one-stop.

826
01:28:16,002 --> 01:28:35,748
So for all the different sources, some communities will accept that the one-stop is really comprehensive, but will accept the forms and the attachments from the one-stop as their application.

827
01:28:36,564 --> 01:28:38,325
And that's probably the easiest way to do it.

828
01:28:38,365 --> 01:29:02,098
They typically applying for both, not always the same time, but that's probably the best way to reduce the locally at least is to say, use the form from the one stop for your development budget and your operating budget and some of the attachments that you need to have.

829
01:29:11,185 --> 01:29:12,786
No, no, thank you.

830
01:29:13,406 --> 01:29:13,726
Thank you.

831
01:29:14,526 --> 01:29:16,247
You're welcome.

832
01:29:16,627 --> 01:29:30,812
So after the state funding is awarded, then the developers have to look for financing partners, their lenders and investors if they have low income housing tax credits.

833
01:29:34,637 --> 01:29:37,138
What are the typical roadblocks to new housing?

834
01:29:37,798 --> 01:29:52,381
Obviously, the increasing construction costs have taken predictability and planning away from developers, especially from pre-pandemic to now.

835
01:29:52,441 --> 01:30:03,004
I think costs are stabilizing, not lowering, and it's still going to take a lot of subsidy to make the projects work.

836
01:30:04,568 --> 01:30:14,691
increasing land costs, you know, the land is being developed at an increasing rate, so land costs are going up.

837
01:30:15,731 --> 01:30:24,393
Zoning, if you have predictive zoning that is either by right or, you know,

838
01:30:25,137 --> 01:30:29,260
Site plan review makes it a lot easier and predictable for a developer.

839
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:32,162
It reduces the time, and time is money.

840
01:30:33,843 --> 01:30:40,807
And then community opposition, there's misinformation or apprehension about the impacts.

841
01:30:42,408 --> 01:30:49,653
And so having some resources and answers for the community.

842
01:30:53,441 --> 01:30:56,043
is important to get projects moving forward.

843
01:30:57,843 --> 01:31:14,312
Local housing opportunities and resources, town on land, city on land, even municipal buildings that are no longer being used for their uses that they were built for.

844
01:31:15,372 --> 01:31:20,275
We do a lot of redevelopment of schools into housing.

845
01:31:21,694 --> 01:31:25,716
Local funds, we talked about the CPA and trust funds.

846
01:31:26,276 --> 01:31:28,217
Any local home or CDBG.

847
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,538
Flexible, predictable zoning.

848
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:39,781
And advocates, local advocates for housing is important to get projects across the finish line.

849
01:31:43,942 --> 01:31:45,303
Overcoming opposition.

850
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:49,592
We talked about how, I just said how important that can be.

851
01:31:51,233 --> 01:31:53,714
Balancing people with places and systems.

852
01:31:53,834 --> 01:31:56,555
Telling the story of us, not the story of them.

853
01:31:57,776 --> 01:32:01,778
Connecting housing to other social issues and outcomes.

854
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:09,762
Acknowledging and celebrating that where you live affects you and affects your family.

855
01:32:11,343 --> 01:32:15,545
And consider using language like home versus housing.

856
01:32:19,716 --> 01:32:24,958
And lastly, for me, leveraging is so important in affordable housing development.

857
01:32:25,978 --> 01:32:41,543
Commitments at the local level help get state funding and a committed community means a project's more likely to be completed and completed on time.

858
01:32:42,623 --> 01:32:49,385
And local funding commitments make a project more attractive for other funding awards and certainly for the state.

859
01:32:53,615 --> 01:33:10,051
And then to round out the final presentation, since one of the things we are talking about is impacts from the community on a development and just how sensitive development feasibility can be, I'm going to walk through a project example.

860
01:33:10,291 --> 01:33:14,155
And I call it a typical project, but there is actually no such thing as a typical project.

861
01:33:14,315 --> 01:33:16,076
So I will put that caveat out there.

862
01:33:17,057 --> 01:33:22,921
But obviously, in general, if you are putting together a development project, your uses and sources have to match.

863
01:33:22,961 --> 01:33:26,042
So everything that you're going to spend, you have to have enough to pay for it.

864
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:35,028
Typical uses in a project, depending on how you're getting the land, you probably have to pay for acquisition, a lot of construction costs.

865
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:42,713
And then affordable housing in particular has a lot of soft costs because there's additional legal fees, financing fees to make it work.

866
01:33:42,993 --> 01:33:44,194
understand all the restrictions.

867
01:33:44,714 --> 01:33:55,282
As Laura mentioned, now we are seeing projects with upwards of eight different kinds of sources just to make the deal work, which means you could potentially have eight different requirements.

868
01:33:55,322 --> 01:33:57,003
You have eight different reporting requirements.

869
01:33:57,063 --> 01:34:02,067
You have eight different application requirements for income restrictions.

870
01:34:03,048 --> 01:34:11,134
And then part of it to keep the developer going and creating affordable housing, you do have developer fees, and then you do need to put aside reserves.

871
01:34:13,829 --> 01:34:23,632
Similarly, once you build the project, you have an operating budget, you need to make sure that your income coming in is more than your expenses going out to make sure that that project keeps going.

872
01:34:24,493 --> 01:34:27,034
And specifically your net operating income.

873
01:34:27,154 --> 01:34:33,856
So after you pay for all the things you need to pay for administrative costs, maintenance, utilities, taxes, insurance,

874
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:38,198
resident services, keeping reserves to make sure you have money for projects.

875
01:34:38,818 --> 01:34:45,021
You then can figure out how much debt your project can support because that is what's left to make your mortgage debt payments.

876
01:34:46,482 --> 01:34:57,168
A lot of these things, I will say, if we're talking about things that are impacting how affordable housing is getting built lately, a lot of these were pretty predictable in terms of a formula, an estimated percentage over time.

877
01:34:57,348 --> 01:34:59,569
And one of the things that's happened during

878
01:35:00,109 --> 01:35:04,810
the pandemic and since is that insurance costs specifically have gone way, way up.

879
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:19,853
And I think a lot of people, not just in affordable housing are seeing this, but that's an example of something as an affordable housing developer, you're trying to manage predictability and all of a sudden you get to your end of the project and the number that you're carrying for insurance blows the project up.

880
01:35:19,873 --> 01:35:22,294
Why are insurance costs going up?

881
01:35:29,505 --> 01:35:47,793
Insurance companies, it's really the reinsurance that's making it, the reinsurance market that's making it go up based on the increasing storms and damage across the country from flooding and storms.

882
01:35:48,414 --> 01:35:52,896
And, you know, the fact that Massachusetts is

883
01:35:53,843 --> 01:36:01,289
you know, hasn't had a storm for a while, but they are, you know, basically they're looking at predictions saying that we're going to get hit.

884
01:36:01,929 --> 01:36:04,852
So that's what my insurance company told me.

885
01:36:06,373 --> 01:36:13,659
So it is a lot to to climate change and expected impacts from climate change that's reverberating across the whole industry.

886
01:36:16,196 --> 01:36:27,759
So in my example of Anytown Project USA, this is a 100% affordable private nonprofit developer.

887
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:29,039
It is new construction.

888
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:35,261
We'll assume that it's donated land, so there's a minimal acquisition cost, which is very nice.

889
01:36:36,881 --> 01:36:38,403
But maybe the land needs some work.

890
01:36:38,463 --> 01:36:41,245
You can see there's some site costs in there for about $800,000.

891
01:36:41,805 --> 01:36:46,149
Perhaps there's some environmental remediation, perhaps some ledge that needs to get addressed.

892
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:50,893
And the project has been awarded 9% tax credits.

893
01:36:51,954 --> 01:36:56,138
And they have put together a project that is a total of 60 units.

894
01:36:56,538 --> 01:37:03,184
Some are at 30% of AMI, so extremely low income, and some are at 60% of AMI to meet the tax credits.

895
01:37:05,626 --> 01:37:12,692
Here's what the project is assuming for an annual operating expenses based on other projects and comps.

896
01:37:13,212 --> 01:37:22,500
So you can see they expect a little bit more than $9,000 per unit annually for all of the various costs it's going to take to operate.

897
01:37:24,798 --> 01:37:32,903
So next, in the very long permitting process in this town, a group of abutters has said, this project is absolutely too big.

898
01:37:32,944 --> 01:37:34,445
There's no way we can do anything with this.

899
01:37:34,525 --> 01:37:36,706
Please make it 40 units instead of 60 units.

900
01:37:37,286 --> 01:37:39,888
Well, can we still make the project work with 40 units?

901
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:40,629
Let's see.

902
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:43,451
So now we're down to 40 units.

903
01:37:43,831 --> 01:37:44,691
We've taken out by 20.

904
01:37:45,812 --> 01:37:48,294
I've included here, you can see what the rents were expecting.

905
01:37:48,374 --> 01:37:52,276
So now you're down to seven three bedrooms, 22 two bedrooms and 11 ones.

906
01:37:55,040 --> 01:38:02,285
So originally, we were expecting a little more than a million dollars of net income every year for those expenses of $567,000.

907
01:38:02,586 --> 01:38:03,827
But after we go down to 40 units, it drops down to $725,000.

908
01:38:11,332 --> 01:38:22,415
And one of the key things that happens is if you just decrease the number of units, not all of the expenses are going to decrease as well.

909
01:38:22,935 --> 01:38:28,957
So, you're still going to pay salaries, you're still going to pay property managers, you're still going to carry those costs.

910
01:38:28,977 --> 01:38:34,458
So, your operating expenses were reduced by... Sorry, the Zoom window is in my way.

911
01:38:36,979 --> 01:38:41,280
$89,000, but your net operating income is reduced by $367,000 approximately.

912
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:53,605
Similarly, if you're building less, your federal LIHTC equity is going to be decreased, so your investor is getting less tax credits in the long run, so they're going to be giving less money to the project.

913
01:38:55,929 --> 01:39:07,395
And because you are pulling in less of your residential rent revenue, you can support almost $4 million less in debt, which means you have to find other sources.

914
01:39:08,715 --> 01:39:15,459
Another thing to note with these sorts of projects as well is when there's a decrease in units, a lot of times there's not

915
01:39:16,084 --> 01:39:18,525
a decrease in certain development costs.

916
01:39:18,585 --> 01:39:24,546
So site costs, for example, you're still going to have to do the same to the site that you were doing, whether it's 40 units or 60 units.

917
01:39:25,207 --> 01:39:33,489
And soft costs might decrease slightly, but you're still going to be paying attorneys, and you're still going to be paying your consultants, and you're still going to be paying similar financing fees.

918
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:41,902
So now you can see, although the total costs went down to less than $20 million, the per unit cost is now actually higher.

919
01:39:42,962 --> 01:39:45,863
And there's now another gap in the project of over $1 million.

920
01:39:46,463 --> 01:39:51,864
So this particular community has already contributed $871,000.

921
01:39:52,925 --> 01:39:58,226
If you really wanted 40 units to work, you could go back to the community and see if they're willing to have any more.

922
01:39:59,066 --> 01:40:21,341
uh funding but overall it seems fairly simple to say well just make it a smaller project but really these little levers in a development when you're talking about putting additional requests or even concessions on a developer can really have a huge impact and so it's sometimes a really good exercise for communities to just see how that change can reverberate throughout the project.

923
01:40:23,038 --> 01:40:39,278
So, overall, the site concept, the unit mixes, the costs have really gone through a fairly complicated process before they come in for that proposal, and any additional restrictions or design requests, decreases in units, as I talked about, can impact feasibility.

924
01:40:39,378 --> 01:40:40,539
This can also go into

925
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:57,335
climate and sustainability requirements, so those are really important as we move forward in developing affordable housing, but ensuring that those are predictable and also as cost effective as possible and not necessarily put on a project later can help a project stay balanced.

926
01:40:59,064 --> 01:41:15,337
Similarly, a mixed income project, so a project where some of the units are market rate and some of them are income restricted, also have a very careful balance in place because in order to make sure that those affordable units can stay income restricted and stay affordable, the revenue from the market rate

927
01:41:15,777 --> 01:41:18,539
That's what we call a cross-subsidy.

928
01:41:18,919 --> 01:41:26,784
So any decrease in market rate, a request to make it 100% affordable in that instance, it may make the project infeasible.

929
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:39,331
So overall, it's really important for communities to work really thoughtfully with the developer on project concessions, and again, consider really carefully the local resources, because the local resources are what can really have an impact on getting a project done.

930
01:41:41,372 --> 01:41:45,275
And with that, we have finished, and we will open it up to any more questions.

931
01:41:46,581 --> 01:41:47,501
Thank you both so much.

932
01:41:47,921 --> 01:41:50,302
I personally found this very helpful.

933
01:41:50,362 --> 01:42:03,746
I'm already thinking this is something we should do every term, because this is such a table-setting overview of the local context of why trainings like this work, like this is so relevant to our work here in Medford, in that regional context.

934
01:42:05,127 --> 01:42:11,849
And I think it provides a lot of color for a lot of the work that we're doing here in Medford.

935
01:42:11,989 --> 01:42:15,730
And not just the city council, of course, but our local housing authority are

936
01:42:16,626 --> 01:42:40,421
fledgling Affordable Housing Trust city staff, a lot of the decision points and situations that come across the various groups in our city that are contending with these questions at various phases in the process of going from the acknowledgement of our local status of affordable housing and everything that is proposed to do about it.

937
01:42:40,941 --> 01:42:41,702
So thank you so much.

938
01:42:42,522 --> 01:42:43,403
I see Councilor Lemmick.

939
01:42:44,332 --> 01:42:45,093
Two questions.

940
01:42:45,133 --> 01:43:05,930
The first, what are recommendations that you would have for both making projects more predictable for developers, which is something you've touched on a few times in the presentation, and second, to decrease timelines, which is these delays can oftentimes disincentivize development completely.

941
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:08,753
So I'd love to hear your thoughts on those two items.

942
01:43:09,215 --> 01:43:11,756
sure, I'll go first and feel free to add on.

943
01:43:12,797 --> 01:43:29,486
I think the main one as Laura had touched on is when it comes to zoning approvals and permitting, having a very predictable process there, you know, when that's, you're not necessarily going to come back for multiple meetings, you're not carrying the land for an extra

944
01:43:30,106 --> 01:43:30,667
six months.

945
01:43:32,428 --> 01:43:43,918
And in general, having multifamily housing as a right, if that's what you're going for, making sure that there's a diverse allowance of housing.

946
01:43:45,139 --> 01:43:48,382
Just anything that helps a development team

947
01:43:49,724 --> 01:43:57,206
be very accurate in their understanding of their milestones is going to make a difference.

948
01:43:57,286 --> 01:44:11,871
So if you know that you have the parameters for your zoning, you know what's allowed, you know it's allowed as a right, you know you can go in as long as the project meets the requirements and you're going to get the permitting, you'll be able to move on to the next step.

949
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:20,601
Um, I think Laura, you know, as Laura also touched upon, obviously, uh, community opposition can also, uh, play a big role.

950
01:44:20,761 --> 01:44:28,302
Obviously, if people are concerned about the impacts from a project and they're going to push back, that will delay anything getting permitted.

951
01:44:28,402 --> 01:44:33,203
They may, you know, depending on the project and how extreme it is, there may be legal action.

952
01:44:33,223 --> 01:44:36,204
Um, so I think any

953
01:44:37,564 --> 01:44:55,749
utilizing local advocates and local advocacy groups even well ahead of projects getting proposed and making sure that those conversations are happening, not necessarily when there's a project proposed on the table that might be a little bit more inflammatory because everyone is reacting to that project, but having those conversations

954
01:44:56,209 --> 01:44:58,730
in the context of some of the things that Laura mentioned.

955
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:01,992
So who lives here and what kind of community do we want to be?

956
01:45:02,712 --> 01:45:07,755
And I think a lot of those conversations happen with housing production plans and those sorts of things.

957
01:45:07,855 --> 01:45:20,681
But a lot of times, taking it maybe one step further, I'm thinking a little bit more outside of the box of how you talk to residents and help them see the positive benefits of being a community for everyone.

958
01:45:26,803 --> 01:45:27,543
Thank you.

959
01:45:28,664 --> 01:45:36,508
Second question, this is a little bit more big picture, but I would be interested to hear the thoughts of experts on it.

960
01:45:36,528 --> 01:45:45,192
So I did read the Boston Globe Spotlight series on the fact that in greater Boston, one unit of housing costs between $500,000 and $600,000 to build.

961
01:45:47,913 --> 01:45:55,179
I have a blog, and I ended up quoting that article on that, and it was, you know, the reasons, of course, were very complicated.

962
01:45:55,579 --> 01:45:57,741
Fewer people are going into construction.

963
01:45:57,761 --> 01:46:01,284
The overseas cost of copper goes up.

964
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,506
Zoning is too restrictive on the local level.

965
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:13,814
And in general, the picture it seemed to be painting was that more and more developers are just having trouble making the equations work, which you sort of touched on here, I guess.

966
01:46:15,636 --> 01:46:19,919
What is just your picture on how that's going to evolve?

967
01:46:19,939 --> 01:46:28,225
Do you think that it's going to hit the point where it's not going to be feasible at all to sort of

968
01:46:29,212 --> 01:46:32,514
build any sort of affordable housing on the private market?

969
01:46:32,654 --> 01:46:36,677
What factors do you see that could potentially improve that?

970
01:46:36,737 --> 01:46:47,325
I know you mentioned greater, like the federal government taking this a bit more seriously than they have in the last 20 years, but just your thoughts on the feasibility of it.

971
01:46:47,665 --> 01:46:48,265
I'd like to hear.

972
01:46:48,285 --> 01:46:51,347
Do you want to take on that?

973
01:46:55,856 --> 01:47:02,236
I think some of the construction costs is really going to be, you know,

974
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:15,311
increasing, this is big picture, so increasing manufacturing so we're not relying on shipping something in.

975
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:26,562
That certainly was an issue during the pandemic, but it's still an issue for certain switches in HVAC systems that's holding things up.

976
01:47:27,703 --> 01:47:28,764
And so that's a time

977
01:47:29,662 --> 01:47:36,206
Um, you know, that increases the costs because it's, everything's waiting for one thing to come in.

978
01:47:37,026 --> 01:47:44,710
Um, I think that, that where, um, the country as a whole is, is trying to, uh, you know, answer that question.

979
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:51,214
So the fact that a lot of companies have kind of made, put manufacturing overseas, which just makes things harder to help.

980
01:47:51,574 --> 01:48:00,859
makes things harder to, you know, to get, especially when there's something like, you know, disruption in shipping or so.

981
01:48:01,419 --> 01:48:07,242
So that has been, I know, a couple of projects that we've worked on that's been an issue.

982
01:48:08,822 --> 01:48:09,123
And then

983
01:48:10,123 --> 01:48:21,528
So that's kind of an in the cost again, you know, predictability the cost is, is, I think it's also looking at alternate construction.

984
01:48:26,118 --> 01:48:27,519
ways of constructing.

985
01:48:27,659 --> 01:48:45,870
So Massachusetts has not been keeping up with the modular construction business that was big about 20 years ago and kind of a lot of them got

986
01:48:47,931 --> 01:48:55,758
you know, didn't make it through recessions and they're starting to come back to Massachusetts, but that's a way to

987
01:48:58,172 --> 01:49:03,294
more predictably and less costly than having stick built on the site.

988
01:49:05,434 --> 01:49:18,018
So I think looking at bringing modular into especially multifamily development will reduce some of the cost.

989
01:49:18,478 --> 01:49:23,580
It at least reduces time, as long as you have somewhere to stage.

990
01:49:25,575 --> 01:49:28,417
What areas has that been the most successful in the United States?

991
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:34,481
Let's see, for modular?

992
01:49:36,342 --> 01:49:38,464
Upstate New York is big.

993
01:49:39,965 --> 01:49:46,409
California, Oregon, some of those areas.

994
01:49:46,669 --> 01:49:49,291
I'm trying to think, Minnesota has a big modular.

995
01:49:52,432 --> 01:49:57,420
Every so often I'll read about like 3D printed apartments and whatnot on the news.

996
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:05,011
I think that's probably a bit more of an extreme example of what you're talking about, but things like that I haven't seen quite as much around in the greater Boston area.

997
01:50:06,314 --> 01:50:10,897
I think the other, so that's sort of on the production side and materials side.

998
01:50:10,917 --> 01:50:22,485
I think from sort of the how we pay for it side, as we discussed, the low income housing tax credit has been just, it's been huge in the United States to actually get affordable units built.

999
01:50:23,766 --> 01:50:30,170
But there's certainly some drawbacks that I would see as contributing to feasibility and cost.

1000
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:33,112
So one is that generally speaking,

1001
01:50:34,906 --> 01:50:37,687
You can't really do less than 20 units with a tax credit deal.

1002
01:50:37,807 --> 01:50:39,468
The numbers just don't pencil out.

1003
01:50:40,148 --> 01:50:41,188
You won't get an investor.

1004
01:50:41,288 --> 01:50:44,709
So you're already looking at at least a 20-unit project.

1005
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:50,451
And really, developers that I've talked to around 60 units is a sweet spot.

1006
01:50:51,091 --> 01:50:52,892
Certainly, there's bigger ones.

1007
01:50:52,952 --> 01:50:59,374
But I think for most developers and most investors with how much they have to invest, that's about how much you can do.

1008
01:50:59,534 --> 01:51:01,375
And as we mentioned, the

1009
01:51:02,635 --> 01:51:23,116
allocations for these are getting more and more competitive and developers are waiting longer and longer for this one resource that is really only building one kind of housing and so I think communities and states and even the federal government looking at re-looking at how they're allocating resources obviously more money would solve all the problems but

1010
01:51:24,897 --> 01:51:33,199
things like considering accessory dwelling units and not only allowing accessory dwelling units, but looking at are there small funding programs that we can then incentivize.

1011
01:51:33,259 --> 01:51:43,062
So we're doing more of these infill projects that don't have the scale of a large apartment complex, but they also don't have the complexity.

1012
01:51:43,102 --> 01:51:46,663
They don't have all the attorneys that you need for the low-income housing tax credit project.

1013
01:51:46,703 --> 01:51:51,144
So you can maybe ultimately build a few more units for cheaper while you're waiting.

1014
01:51:51,684 --> 01:51:52,605
for the tax credits.

1015
01:51:53,345 --> 01:52:07,071
So I think there's more conversations happening around how do we do things next to the big tax credit program and how can we effectively allocate resources that then also utilize smaller sites that wouldn't be good for a tax credit.

1016
01:52:07,271 --> 01:52:12,674
Laura mentioned that some town on land sites right now with our current sources, it just doesn't work.

1017
01:52:12,774 --> 01:52:15,395
But if there was other ways to allocate it, that it could work.

1018
01:52:15,615 --> 01:52:20,738
I think thinking creatively will also help bring down the cost for some of it.

1019
01:52:22,009 --> 01:52:23,430
And one final question.

1020
01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:38,455
I think one issue that we've been seeing in Medford, I know, but also pretty much like a lot of other areas of the United States is a large amount of investor capital going into the housing market and generally speaking, private

1021
01:52:41,478 --> 01:52:45,441
private equity seeing real estate as a return on investment more than anything else.

1022
01:52:46,261 --> 01:53:04,193
And one thing that I would like as a local politician as a way to sort of distinguish between people who actually live in their houses and even people who maybe live locally and own as opposed to a company out of New York that's making like a shell

1023
01:53:04,873 --> 01:53:17,589
that's the company buying up a bunch of apartments and kicking out all the tenants, flipping them and jacking up the rents, which is something that is happening more and more regularly in Medford.

1024
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:23,796
Do you know of any strategies that other communities have had this kind of like

1025
01:53:24,657 --> 01:53:47,030
fight that general problem or any strategies of distinguishing between one kind of buyer that actually does plan to live in the home or at least will have a face-to-face relationship with the people that live in their homes as opposed to those who mainly just see it as an investment.

1026
01:53:48,789 --> 01:53:50,912
Since Laura lives on the Cape, I'm going to let her take that.

1027
01:53:50,933 --> 01:53:51,934
She's from vacation land.

1028
01:53:56,545 --> 01:54:17,281
Obviously, there's been a lot of recent studies around, you know, what that market looks like, you know, how many we, you know, there's a lot of anecdotal about how much our investors actually buying up.

1029
01:54:17,481 --> 01:54:23,325
And it is a concern, the reports are coming in that it's, you know, it's a,

1030
01:54:24,506 --> 01:54:29,388
a large percentage are investor owners.

1031
01:54:31,429 --> 01:54:39,613
One way that has been successful is through restrictions on short-term rentals.

1032
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:49,797
So the Airbnbs of the world making a restriction of either number or percentage can't be investor owned.

1033
01:54:51,318 --> 01:55:13,591
I don't know legally where that stands, except that I know that it has been done and it's being implemented in some communities, especially on the islands and the Cape, because there is such a large percentage of the properties being bought by private capital investors.

1034
01:55:16,292 --> 01:55:28,113
And so there, but there's, that seems to be the way that it's being approached right now, that it's through the short-term rental regulations.

1035
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:46,100
There's short term rentals are a big part of the problem, but it's also generally an investment, even in longer term luxury housing, as opposed to focus on affordable housing, mainly because luxury housing is seen as being more profitable.

1036
01:55:46,661 --> 01:55:47,641
So is there?

1037
01:55:50,083 --> 01:55:56,687
There's some investigation now about whether or not

1038
01:55:58,934 --> 01:56:08,018
someone could put a, or a town could put a year-round residency restriction on property.

1039
01:56:08,038 --> 01:56:20,744
I think it's problematic from a number of different legalities, but I know that it's one of the proposals in some legislation.

1040
01:56:23,407 --> 01:56:27,728
I'd appreciate seeing that legislation and knowing a bit more about it if it's available later.

1041
01:56:27,748 --> 01:56:29,288
That's all the questions I have.

1042
01:56:29,308 --> 01:56:29,648
Thank you.

1043
01:56:31,649 --> 01:56:32,709
Thank you so much, Councilor Lemming.

1044
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:37,290
Any further questions from members of the Council, members of the public?

1045
01:56:38,811 --> 01:56:39,771
President Behrs.

1046
01:56:40,371 --> 01:56:40,751
Thank you.

1047
01:56:40,791 --> 01:56:41,711
Thank you guys for being here.

1048
01:56:42,932 --> 01:56:48,313
So one of the issues that we have, I think, in our community is we have

1049
01:56:49,434 --> 01:56:53,484
We have a local Chodo, and it's meant for community housing, but they're really small.

1050
01:56:53,504 --> 01:56:55,729
They're doing, you know, a few units here, a few units there.

1051
01:56:57,549 --> 01:57:06,037
So I think we have a hard time accessing home funds and then none of the really none of the bigger nonprofit, you know, affordable housing folks are focused on the city.

1052
01:57:06,077 --> 01:57:07,398
So we don't have those partnerships.

1053
01:57:07,979 --> 01:57:16,447
Do you guys have suggestions as to how we can build stronger partnerships or convince one of these larger groups to say that they want to add Metro to their catchment area?

1054
01:57:16,467 --> 01:57:20,851
Because I think those are really some of the key missing links that we have to

1055
01:57:22,092 --> 01:57:27,838
to accessing the funds and getting the project experience to coordinate the projects here in the city.

1056
01:57:32,663 --> 01:57:37,008
I think the affordable housing trust is a great start to that.

1057
01:57:39,938 --> 01:57:50,249
Again, going back to the number of sources you need to get a project done, if a developer knows that there's local funds that they can commit, that's going to be one of the attractive.

1058
01:57:51,651 --> 01:57:58,478
And once I think, and I'm not sure I haven't talked to Shelly how far along the trust is, but I think once the trust is.

1059
01:57:59,795 --> 01:58:09,511
confident in understanding what their revenue is, putting out notice of funding availabilities, putting out the information, that would be my initial first step.

1060
01:58:14,338 --> 01:58:32,459
I think also both, you know, your neighboring communities have pretty active Choteaus and try, you know, starting conversations with them, either Somerville or Arlington.

1061
01:58:33,099 --> 01:59:02,079
around or anyone, those two come to mind because I know how active they are about either how you can increase the capacity of your chodo and it could be just getting the right technical assistance for them to build capacity, board capacity and staff capacity, if they have staff, I'm not sure they do.

1062
01:59:03,681 --> 01:59:11,356
One staff right so it's building that that staff capacity and in board capacity.

1063
01:59:11,437 --> 01:59:12,258
That's something that.

1064
01:59:14,241 --> 01:59:34,166
our team does and would certainly help and could coordinate conversations with Somerville and Arlington and how they started and how they've been able to grow and then to be successful and not take more than they can chew.

1065
01:59:35,486 --> 01:59:38,487
Yeah, and have you seen any communities

1066
01:59:39,693 --> 01:59:48,702
recently that you've been able to work with, that people at MHP have been able to work with, that have grown a Chodo like that, that have been able to see some of that success.

1067
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:57,446
Sure, I mean, when I started, both Arlington and Somerville were in infancy stage.

1068
01:59:58,306 --> 02:00:07,572
And Brookline has a, you know, kind of, it's been around for a while, but they've just had like one six-unit development.

1069
02:00:07,632 --> 02:00:12,335
And now they've built a couple of things and they've, and they've got the,

1070
02:00:14,096 --> 02:00:20,297
you have the confidence and the correct staff and built the capacity, both board and staff.

1071
02:00:21,318 --> 02:00:21,538
Great.

1072
02:00:21,718 --> 02:00:22,118
Thank you.

1073
02:00:22,298 --> 02:00:22,698
You're welcome.

1074
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:28,659
Any further questions from members of the council?

1075
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:31,000
Members of the public?

1076
02:00:34,361 --> 02:00:36,421
Seeing none, I want to thank you again.

1077
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:39,322
So this meeting, like all of our meetings, will be recorded.

1078
02:00:39,342 --> 02:00:40,562
It's on Medford Community Media.

1079
02:00:41,195 --> 02:00:48,816
I don't know if this was already planned or if it's possible, but I think these slides could be really useful for us to have to put on our city council website as an ongoing resource, if it's possible to convey those.

1080
02:00:49,336 --> 02:00:52,317
I'd really love to have them be published and shareable and preferable.

1081
02:00:53,497 --> 02:00:55,458
As this does come up over and over again.

1082
02:00:58,218 --> 02:00:59,058
Thank you for having us.

1083
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:02,439
Thank you so much for being here.

1084
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:03,899
We really appreciate your time.

1085
02:01:03,939 --> 02:01:05,059
We appreciate your expertise.

1086
02:01:05,779 --> 02:01:09,280
And I'm sure that this information will continue to guide us as we

1087
02:01:09,929 --> 02:01:18,034
we're going to work through a term full of housing priorities of zoning and determine which are very quite new.

1088
02:01:18,334 --> 02:01:21,096
Affordable Housing Trust is really just getting its legs under it for the first time.

1089
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:26,859
So this information will continue to stay relevant top of mind.

1090
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:33,203
Thank you and feel free to call or contact us if there's anything that we can do to help.

1091
02:01:34,524 --> 02:01:35,084
Thank you so much.

1092
02:01:38,891 --> 02:01:40,832
Any further comments from councilors?

1093
02:01:42,293 --> 02:01:46,735
Oh, before we do that, I also want to thank the planning department for setting up this presentation tonight.

1094
02:01:47,135 --> 02:01:47,755
Really appreciate it.

1095
02:01:47,795 --> 02:01:48,836
I think this is very valuable.

1096
02:01:48,916 --> 02:01:51,817
Thank you so much, Housing Planner Aditi, and thank you, Director Hunt.

1097
02:01:52,978 --> 02:01:53,678
Motion to adjourn?

1098
02:01:54,358 --> 02:01:55,159
Motion to adjourn.

1099
02:01:55,579 --> 02:01:56,900
Seconded by President Behrs.

1100
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,541
I think we can do a voice vote at this point.

1101
02:02:00,601 --> 02:02:03,983
Just that we should receive the presentation and place it on file.

1102
02:02:04,043 --> 02:02:04,583
Oh, thanks.

1103
02:02:07,332 --> 02:02:07,792
Withdrawal.

1104
02:02:07,812 --> 02:02:11,934
Were there any motions out of the zoning in the first half of the meeting?

1105
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:12,535
No.

1106
02:02:12,555 --> 02:02:12,815
Okay.

1107
02:02:13,095 --> 02:02:13,675
I couldn't remember.

1108
02:02:13,695 --> 02:02:20,259
Um, yes, a motion to receive in place the training and presentation from Mass Housing Partnership on file.

1109
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:20,579
Great.

1110
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:20,999
Thank you.

1111
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:23,240
On the motion of President Beers, seconded by Councilor Lundin.

1112
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:23,541
Second.

1113
02:02:24,821 --> 02:02:25,242
And adjourned.

1114
02:02:26,782 --> 02:02:27,363
Make it all one.

1115
02:02:27,603 --> 02:02:27,863
Sure.

1116
02:02:51,229 --> 02:02:54,412
On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by President Behrs.

1117
02:02:54,492 --> 02:02:55,192
All those in favor?

1118
02:02:55,873 --> 02:02:55,993
Aye.

1119
02:02:56,454 --> 02:02:59,816
And this is the vote to receive and place in file and adjourn.

1120
02:03:01,578 --> 02:03:08,704
Councilor Lemming, do you accept the amendment to your motion?

1121
02:03:10,526 --> 02:03:10,946
Is that okay?

1122
02:03:12,968 --> 02:03:17,832
So it's Lemming's motion to receive and place in file and adjourn.

1123
02:03:39,338 --> 02:03:44,947
8.15.

1124
02:03:43,705 --> 02:03:44,947
Do we need to recheck that?

1125
02:03:46,249 --> 02:03:46,469
Okay.

1126
02:03:47,871 --> 02:03:48,472
Meeting is adjourned.

1127
02:03:48,492 --> 02:03:48,953
Thank you so much.
