00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:24,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I call the next agenda item, I think we just want to acknowledge, do we have the Medford Boy Scouts on the call?

18
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:25,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.

19
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:30,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna acknowledge them in the remarks, but I will say thank you.

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Boy Scout Troop 416, who's joining us tonight.

21
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:37,916
[SPEAKER_02]: They are working on their communication merit badge.

22
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:43,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna thank member McLaughlin for inviting them this evening as well.

23
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,604
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a big part of, or a major part of being a scout is learning about how government works.

24
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:59,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, Troop 416 is running the micro pantry in Haines Square and working with the city to produce some fitness videos.

25
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say welcome to Boy Scout Troop 416.

26
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so happy to have you with us this evening.

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, great job.

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for all your volunteerism.

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

30
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:18,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, we have number six, community participation by Brian Buck.

31
00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:21,254
[SPEAKER_06]: president of the Medford Educational Foundation.

32
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:28,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I send a very warm welcome to Mr. Brian Buck.

33
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:39,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna thank member Van der Kloot as well for her introduction and letting us have this great opportunity.

34
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:44,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Public Schools will be benefiting greatly, but I want you to do your presentation this evening, Mr. Buck.

35
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for joining us this evening.

36
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:48,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for having me.

37
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:54,596
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to share my screen for a minute, if that's OK, just so folks can sort of see.

38
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:56,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me minimize here.

39
00:01:58,915 --> 00:01:59,275
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

40
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:01,356
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to put this on.

41
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:09,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I know some people are visual, some people are verbal, so I thought it would just help folks to know who we are and kind of what we're doing and what we hope to do in Medford.

42
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:26,624
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to start with a thank you to the wonderful teachers, staff, students, and administrative team at MPS, to the school committee for allowing us to present tonight, and to Anne and James Froningkusse for all their work at MEF and co-founding it, creating it, and moving it to this point.

43
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,788
[SPEAKER_16]: included this photo of them.

44
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:32,510
[SPEAKER_16]: They're actually in Norway, but it looks like they're in Maine because they've moved to sort of Maine.

45
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,170
[SPEAKER_16]: So this was the most Maine-like photo I found.

46
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,412
[SPEAKER_16]: So I decided to include that.

47
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:42,133
[SPEAKER_16]: I should also say that I jumped in on the ugly sweater theme.

48
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:47,154
[SPEAKER_16]: My wife determined this sweater was too ugly for an ugly sweater, but I thought it was just right.

49
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,262
[SPEAKER_16]: So a few updates and announcements.

50
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:56,604
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some new officers and new roles at the Medford Educational Foundation.

51
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,445
[SPEAKER_16]: We have an updated mission statement.

52
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:12,692
[SPEAKER_16]: We just went through and actually just sent out letters around our sentences for fall 2020 micro grants and then talk a little bit about the spring of 2021 and what we're hoping to do.

53
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:21,046
[SPEAKER_16]: EMAF officers are, I've been vice president for the last four years, I am now, was elected and chaired president.

54
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:28,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris D'Evada is the vice president, director of grants, David Sayers, who's here tonight with us.

55
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:29,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi David.

56
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:43,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Our clerk is Gail Ariesian, treasurer is Steve Hayes, and our founding member and the one who makes all of it work and all of our communication go is Paulette Van der Kloot, so thank you to Paulette.

57
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:46,637
[SPEAKER_16]: This is myself and my family.

58
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:47,997
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, I like sharing pictures.

59
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:49,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a visual guy.

60
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:50,619
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thought I'd share this out.

61
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,240
[SPEAKER_16]: We always look like that.

62
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,881
[SPEAKER_16]: We're always dressed that way.

63
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,622
[SPEAKER_16]: There's always leaves wherever we go.

64
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:59,045
[SPEAKER_16]: So very representative of us as a family.

65
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:00,606
[SPEAKER_16]: My children always look at the camera.

66
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,980
[SPEAKER_16]: And then who, who we are.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,905
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is just our mission statement and kind of what we do.

68
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,027
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been a little bit updated.

69
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:11,969
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to share it.

70
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:18,040
[SPEAKER_16]: We support the Medford public schools through grants that fund innovative teaching and professional development.

71
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:23,775
[SPEAKER_16]: We enhance educational opportunities for all Medford students by giving them access to new ways of learning.

72
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:33,117
[SPEAKER_16]: We support innovative teaching of all types, including those focused on anti-racism, anti-bias and social emotional learning, both in the classroom and at the building level.

73
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:37,558
[SPEAKER_16]: So one of the goals are here tonight is to say who we are and what we're doing.

74
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:43,139
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also to say most recently, how we switched it up in the era of COVID and digital teaching.

75
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Historically, we have a application, it's physical, people fill it in.

76
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,282
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually a teacher, I teach at Arlington High School.

77
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:54,564
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know where teachers are at right now.

78
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:59,948
[SPEAKER_16]: And we decided as a committee and sort of approved that we wanted to make sure teachers had easy access to a form.

79
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:04,451
[SPEAKER_16]: So we made a digital form for what we called micro grants, which were grants up to $200.

80
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:11,796
[SPEAKER_16]: We asked teachers what they needed to improve student learning in their digital classrooms.

81
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,737
[SPEAKER_16]: We got 17 applications.

82
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,839
[SPEAKER_16]: They were from the elementary, middle and high school.

83
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,820
[SPEAKER_16]: They were all represented.

84
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,184
[SPEAKER_16]: They included innovative software and equipment to increase student engagement during remote learning.

85
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:42,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything from the tech school getting a lathe that makes it so they can demonstrate easier on the camera, to document cameras, to a lot of teachers requesting full privileges for Pear Deck and Zoom Pro as well, which I know have been approved through the school, which is great.

86
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:50,325
[SPEAKER_16]: And then purchasing books and exercise equipment, training and mindfulness and whole child initiatives, which has been really great.

87
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,807
[SPEAKER_16]: David, do you want to say anything else about the specific grants or anything like that?

88
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:58,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Or maybe just say hello?

89
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Is David unmuted?

90
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:13,970
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, David, if you want to add anything, feel free to jump on and say hello.

91
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,192
[SPEAKER_16]: David is awesome.

92
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:17,294
[SPEAKER_15]: There he is.

93
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,037
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, so I was having trouble unmuting.

94
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,000
[SPEAKER_15]: But hello.

95
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you to the school committee for welcoming us.

96
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:28,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I can certainly go through all the grants, but there are a lot and I don't think I have too much to add.

97
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:42,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I will add there was other specific software for English language learners and for math that we funded in addition to the school funding, Pear Deck and Zoom.

98
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess the only other thing, I just want a personal note.

99
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:52,572
[SPEAKER_15]: I have two kids in the school system and I just wanted to thank the school committee and the administration and especially the teachers

100
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:54,593
[SPEAKER_15]: for all their hard work.

101
00:06:54,733 --> 00:07:04,538
[SPEAKER_15]: I know what a crazy year it is to try to teach, and I just think they're doing a fabulous job making this work for all our kids.

102
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:05,678
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to say thank you.

103
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, David.

104
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:17,558
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have two, not quite yet in the Medford Public Schools, but will be starting next year, little ones.

105
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,464
[SPEAKER_16]: And so if anyone needs to contact us, one thing we would really like, we need to start fundraising.

106
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,506
[SPEAKER_16]: So we want to kind of replenish, build up and look at that.

107
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,187
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're looking at opportunities around that.

108
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:35,832
[SPEAKER_16]: We would also, if anyone is interested at all in sort of helping out in a number of areas, we could use more people.

109
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:39,135
[SPEAKER_16]: We would really love some more volunteers.

110
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:39,895
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be great.

111
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:41,437
[SPEAKER_16]: So reach out to us.

112
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,700
[SPEAKER_16]: MedfordEdFund.org is our website.

113
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,641
[SPEAKER_16]: MedfordEdFund at gmail.com.

114
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,464
[SPEAKER_16]: We're on Facebook at Medford Educational Foundation.

115
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:55,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford, Oregon took Medford Education Foundation, by the way, which is a little smoother.

116
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:56,909
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had to add the AL on.

117
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Just want to throw that out.

118
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,681
[SPEAKER_16]: But thank you to everyone for spending time with us tonight.

119
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:15,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Our goal is to do another round of funding in the spring to look at maybe some larger grants to work with administration around what some building-wide grants or what some district-wide grants might look like and areas we can chip in.

120
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:23,685
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you are a student in Medford Public Schools, if you're a graduate, if you're a teacher, if you're an administrator, if you're just a lover of education,

121
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Please let teachers know about us.

122
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:40,117
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a few teacher friends in Medford I always reach out to we reach out to administration, but if you have teachers who have innovative ideas that want to get students working with their hands that want to present, you know,

123
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,654
[SPEAKER_16]: things that they just don't quite have the resources to do.

124
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:46,617
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why we're here, right?

125
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:50,622
[SPEAKER_16]: We're here to bridge that gap, to make sure those resources are available.

126
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:54,727
[SPEAKER_16]: And the more requests we get, the better.

127
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:57,150
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you so much for letting me take this time.

128
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:02,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Brian.

129
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Brianna, can I jump in for a second?

130
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:05,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

131
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:05,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

132
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Member van de Kloot.

133
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:17,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see, we have some terrific leadership in Brian Buck, who's joined us as president this year, and David in his continuing role as the grants chair.

134
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:21,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Diane Caldwell is going to join our little group.

135
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:29,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we are really in need of is we are in need of some fundraising people because that's a major piece of what we need to do.

136
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:40,528
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's exciting, it's fun work, it's fun to be able to give out money, and we really appreciate the teachers who take the time to put in a grant because there's no guarantee.

137
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:48,930
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things though that happened on this is that because of the number of, you know, we saw a good number of requests for Pear Deck,

138
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:58,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was able to go follow up and have a discussion about that and find out that, yes, the district is in fact going to supply that to our teachers.

139
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:04,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we saw such interest coming in from teachers, that was just a really great thing to know.

140
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:07,609
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of people I'd like to thank specifically.

141
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I had long talks with Molly Layden, our

142
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:18,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Director of Technology, with Bernadette Riccadeli, with Chad Fallon.

143
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:25,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm afraid I'm going to leave some people out, but I was very, very appreciative to get their expertise.

144
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:31,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we were following up on these grant proposals, we were doing it wisely.

145
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, thanks.

146
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,228
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the good news.

147
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member van de Kloot, much appreciated.

148
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:43,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We know you're a founding member of, how many years ago, Member van de Kloot?

149
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:45,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really remember, four?

150
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:47,764
[SPEAKER_06]: At least four, yeah, at least four.

151
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:48,425
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple.

152
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:49,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Five.

153
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're claiming five, we're claiming five here.

154
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Five, yeah, I'd say.

155
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:56,168
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, time flies when you're having fun, so.

156
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you all for being here, and we appreciate the presentation.

157
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:11,558
[SPEAKER_06]: We have public participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

158
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:17,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

159
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau, do we have any emails?

160
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you, Mayor.

161
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:23,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

162
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:26,943
[SPEAKER_13]: We have, let's see.

163
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:31,545
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one email dated

164
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,186
[SPEAKER_13]: The 16th, there were a couple I think that came in after our last meeting.

165
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:41,046
[SPEAKER_13]: This is from Maureen Ronin of Winter Street.

166
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:51,768
[SPEAKER_13]: According to the last available MCAS results, only 35% of third grade students are meeting or exceeding in English language arts at the Columbus Elementary School.

167
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:56,789
[SPEAKER_13]: With the exception of the Brooks, the other school's scores are not much better.

168
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:01,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Students should be taught to read in school with evidence-based reading instruction.

169
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:07,480
[SPEAKER_13]: private and experienced Orton-Gillingham tutors charge between $100 and $230 per hour.

170
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:14,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Diagnostic testing is between $3,000 and $7,500 and it should be done frequently.

171
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:16,766
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not affordable for many families.

172
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:20,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Literacy should not be reserved for students that have families with resources.

173
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Literacy is a right.

174
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:22,529
[SPEAKER_13]: I am asking

175
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:26,663
[SPEAKER_13]: you to make literacy a priority for Metropolitan School students.

176
00:12:27,023 --> 00:12:31,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I am requesting that the superintendent have a literacy outcome goal on her evaluation.

177
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:35,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Evidence-based reading instruction harms no one and is mandatory for some.

178
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:48,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Megan McLiman, not clear on her address.

179
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,758
[SPEAKER_13]: She actually submitted the same language, so I won't repeat it.

180
00:12:52,518 --> 00:13:05,385
[SPEAKER_13]: but she did start her message with, as a parent of a second grader with a learning disability, I am quite disappointed with the poor support my child has received from the Columbus School.

181
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:09,648
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been forced to resort to outside tutoring at my own expense.

182
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:16,472
[SPEAKER_13]: The challenges of COVID have put new financial stress on my family and I fear I can no longer afford this critical tutoring.

183
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,371
[SPEAKER_13]: She deserves every opportunity to learn to read.

184
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:22,473
[SPEAKER_13]: The school is not educating her in the ways she needs.

185
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:25,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I fear she will fall further behind.

186
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:31,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is all I have.

187
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just check messages before I say that.

188
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,160
[SPEAKER_13]: That is all I have tonight.

189
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

190
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

191
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:54,224
[SPEAKER_06]: We have number seven reports of superintendent, superintendent's updates and comments.

192
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:55,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

193
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:56,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

194
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

195
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:05,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just like to once again, thank our Boy Scout Troop 416 for being with us this evening.

196
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:14,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight is the winter solstice, which means it is our shortest day and our longest night.

197
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:21,103
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it also means that going forward, the days will begin to grow longer.

198
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:25,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Our winter solstice.

199
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:40,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to all of our MPS staff members who have responded so well to our latest weather related challenges.

200
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:57,558
[SPEAKER_02]: On Friday, our educators pivoted to remote only instruction in yet another example of the flexibility we are capable of showing when our children's education is dependent upon it.

201
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:13,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, our custodians, along with our partners in the city's Department of Public Works, worked around the clock to make sure our school buildings were ready for students and staff to return today.

202
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:25,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to our Mustang Nation, our staff, and all the hard work and our partners at the city with DPW helping us to get ready for school today.

203
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:37,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I do wanna announce that this week we have school today, tomorrow, and we will have a half day of remote instruction on Wednesday.

204
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:46,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, after our half day on Wednesday, we will begin our much, much needed rest and holiday recess.

205
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:51,046
[SPEAKER_02]: The holiday break will last until Monday, January 4th,

206
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:55,935
[SPEAKER_02]: when instruction begins anew.

207
00:15:56,735 --> 00:16:05,259
[SPEAKER_02]: As we announced on Friday, when school resumes for all MPS students on January 4th, it will be by remote instruction.

208
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to many other districts, we are beginning the new year in full remote mode in anticipation of additional surges in virus transmission, as we have seen both locally and nationally coming out of other holidays.

209
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:30,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We will resume in-person instruction for all students on Thursday, January 14th.

210
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:45,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier that week, most likely on January 12th, we will hold COVID-19 testing for students in cohorts A and C and all MPS staff.

211
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:51,007
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this will be detailed in our public health update later tonight.

212
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:59,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working to ensure that all students and staff have the opportunity to get tested prior to returning to school buildings.

213
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:06,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And a more detailed testing schedule will come out as we get closer to the exact dates.

214
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:22,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Please note that due to public health considerations that led to this decision to push back in-person instruction, this slight delay does include cohort A students, our high need, most vulnerable students.

215
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to be clear about that piece.

216
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a recap, school will resume after the holiday recess on Monday, January 4th for all students.

217
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:46,818
[SPEAKER_02]: On January 12th, we will hold testing for students in cohorts A and C, as well as all staff.

218
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,442
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be additional testing days as well.

219
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:58,950
[SPEAKER_02]: In-person instruction will begin on Thursday, January 14th for cohorts A and C and

220
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:08,527
[SPEAKER_02]: On January 15, we will have testing for cohort B students who will resume in-person instruction on January 19.

221
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:26,442
[SPEAKER_02]: We also will be sending an update out a little later that we will be holding freshmen orientation that week as well, so that freshmen will have an opportunity to be introduced to the building and get acclimated.

222
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:32,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So that date is to be determined, but we will send out a communication regarding that.

223
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:40,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So as of now, when in-person instruction begins on January 14th, it will be for students in all grades.

224
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:51,717
[SPEAKER_02]: That includes ninth grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade of Medford High School, who have been waiting so patiently to return to school all year.

225
00:18:53,538 --> 00:19:00,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I just talked about, or as I just mentioned, we have been working very, very diligently on safety.

226
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:09,045
[SPEAKER_02]: When we began this journey, we talked about our three guiding pillars of safety, equity, and consistency.

227
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to address how some of those guiding pillars have been met to date.

228
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:23,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So under the area of safety, we have upgraded our HVAC systems.

229
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,691
[SPEAKER_02]: We've socially distanced our classrooms.

230
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:32,877
[SPEAKER_02]: We've provided hand sanitizer throughout our buildings and required that all students and staff wear masks.

231
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:42,850
[SPEAKER_02]: These safety measures allowed us to welcome our students and teachers back, but we did so gradually following the health metrics.

232
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:52,236
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been consistent in our messaging to our families and in providing education to our students, whether remote or hybrid.

233
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:58,261
[SPEAKER_02]: As for equity, this is an extremely important part of our goals.

234
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:08,920
[SPEAKER_02]: With assistance from the grants and the CARES monies, we were able to purchase enough Chromebooks and hotspots so all students had access.

235
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:22,328
[SPEAKER_02]: However, during this pandemic, we also witnessed the tragic death of George Floyd, which spurred some peaceful protests and also some rioting.

236
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:34,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite pledges of reform, incidents similar to what happened to Mr. Floyd continues, continue to happen, and this is quite shocking.

237
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:52,698
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford Public Schools, we are committed to racial equity, and to that end, we established the Racial Equity Task Force, made up of students, staff, teachers, parents, administrators, community,

238
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:02,201
[SPEAKER_02]: The racial equity task force has been meeting consistently every other week.

239
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:14,555
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a goal of wanting to improve culture and climate and race, bring about racial awareness in the Medford public schools throughout the entire district.

240
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:29,927
[SPEAKER_02]: The task force is looking to partner with members of our community, agencies and nonprofit organizations to help offer professional development for teachers, for staff, and eventually for community.

241
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:34,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And things for our students as well.

242
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:37,709
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our larger overarching goals.

243
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:53,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, a few task force members are also serving on Middlesex District Attorney Marion Ryan's Anti-Racial Antibias Task Force, which she established in October of this year.

244
00:21:54,575 --> 00:22:05,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in 1965, Dr. King stated, our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.

245
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:11,942
[SPEAKER_02]: 55 years have passed since then, and our country continues to grapple with these issues.

246
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:18,988
[SPEAKER_02]: People of color need to feel welcomed, considered, and cared for in our district.

247
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: This is difficult and uncomfortable work, but it is work that needs to be done.

248
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:32,300
[SPEAKER_02]: For change to happen, we all must be committed to it.

249
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:43,787
[SPEAKER_02]: In the new year, I will discuss more in depth about the Racial Equity Task Force, the members that are on it, but I wanted to just give you a brief overview tonight.

250
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:51,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna thank all of the members of the Racial Equity Task Force that have been meeting every other week consistently.

251
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:57,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you for your sacrifice of time and your commitment to helping us improve the Medford Public Schools.

252
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:01,158
[SPEAKER_02]: On a different note now,

253
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:06,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to just highlight some other pieces of things that are happening within the district.

254
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:21,675
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you who are getting ready for the holiday season, tomorrow, between the hours of 11 and 2 p.m., our school store at the high school will be open

255
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Medford Vocational Technical High School's marketing program will be open.

256
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:31,002
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mustang Mall is open tomorrow between 11 and two.

257
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:39,824
[SPEAKER_02]: For any of you who wanna come by the school, pop in to just grab a holiday item, 11 and two o'clock tomorrow.

258
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:46,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We will monitor closely how many people want to come in at the same time.

259
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,926
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need to wait in the lobby, but we will do it safely.

260
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:52,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm extending that invitation.

261
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:53,814
[SPEAKER_02]: to all of you.

262
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:57,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I wanted to share some very, very good news.

263
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:12,623
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Principal Paul DeLeva and Assistant Principal David Blauk, over $550 was raised for gift cards for our most vulnerable students and our students in need during this holiday season.

264
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:21,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It started with a random donation forwarded to Mr. Blauk, and he contacted the PTO to see if they wanted to assist.

265
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:28,051
[SPEAKER_02]: President Celia Lee donated funds and looked to the community for donations.

266
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:35,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Within two days, the PTO had over $400 in gift cards and donations towards gift cards.

267
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:45,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So altogether, Mr. Blouk will be able to distribute $550 in gift cards to those in need.

268
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, I wanna highlight our Medford Family Network,

269
00:24:51,781 --> 00:25:14,329
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford Family Network, if you weren't aware, today they were highlighted on the news, but our director, Marie Cassidy, she is coordinating along with her entire team, donations, which included clothing, gift certificates, toys, books, toiletries, and so much more.

270
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:18,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that are needed for the cold weather, hats, mittens, boots.

271
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:32,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the support, all of these people that I'm gonna mention who have supported our Medford Family Network, Mayor Lungo-Koehn and the Wonder Fund, the community at large, Ms.

272
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:44,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Hennessey from the McGlynn School, the Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis, the Firefighters Union, Gilbane Architects, Greenline Extension,

273
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:58,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Former Mayor McGlynn, Six Acres Preschool, Grace Works Daycare Center, Sanctuary UCC Church, Teamsters Local 25, Medford Police Department,

274
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:01,543
[SPEAKER_02]: staff and the Medford public schools.

275
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:11,350
[SPEAKER_02]: What really warmed my heart today was hearing that former recipients made donations as well as grandparents of many of the MFN children.

276
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford is truly a very special community that always assists those in need.

277
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:25,803
[SPEAKER_02]: This outpouring of support during a pandemic is just so very special and is really beyond words.

278
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:29,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It exemplifies the true meaning of the holiday season.

279
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to quickly share this picture with you.

280
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:37,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just quickly share it.

281
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:55,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

282
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:01,172
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just two quick shots from the Medford Family Network today.

283
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:10,977
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think this is a lot of toys, this is our wonderful Marie Cassidy with our assistant principal of the high school, a new addition, Ms.

284
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Charose Walker.

285
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:17,419
[SPEAKER_02]: She was downstairs visiting the Medford Family Network.

286
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the room full of donations.

287
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is another picture of just more donations.

288
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:30,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The outpouring from all of our community partners who

289
00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:38,307
[SPEAKER_02]: went above and beyond to try to make this holiday season a special season.

290
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:43,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself had the opportunity to be at the Medford Family Network today.

291
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:47,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was there with Officer Hartnett and his family.

292
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:53,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And many of our police officers donated gifts.

293
00:27:54,317 --> 00:27:59,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanna thank the entire community for their overwhelming support

294
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:01,104
[SPEAKER_02]: in giving back.

295
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:03,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to all of you.

296
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:16,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want anyone who's watching or our listening audience, if you are, if not you or you know a family in need, please have them reach out and call our Medford Family Network.

297
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:26,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of toys that people will be coming in to pick up, but we have toys that range from zero years old, zero to,

298
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:37,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would say elementary age and there are actually a few that that I think could could make it into the middle school range, but if you have a need.

299
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:48,614
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a wonderful, wonderful resource and they will be open all day tomorrow, probably from about eight to four and on Wednesday as well.

300
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're able to

301
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:58,975
[SPEAKER_02]: call the Medford Family Network and go over there and see if you can get something for a family in need.

302
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would like to just take this quick moment to congratulate Patrick Gordon.

303
00:29:05,237 --> 00:29:16,341
[SPEAKER_02]: He is our manager of Medford's Community Media Network, who recently received the overall excellence award for community media for the Northeast region.

304
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:21,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick is so wonderful to work with and is a complete professional.

305
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,882
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a great addition to our community.

306
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work, Patrick.

307
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Your award is well-deserved.

308
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:29,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

309
00:29:30,706 --> 00:29:37,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say, in 1850, Jingle Bells was written in Medford by Mr. James Pierpont.

310
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:44,895
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote the song based on the slave races he witnessed that took place on Salem Street in the early 1800s.

311
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:52,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It remains one of the most popular Christmas songs in the country.

312
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:58,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would venture to say nationally and internationally because it is such a great song.

313
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:00,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am wearing my bells today.

314
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:10,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So yesterday was National Wreaths Across America Day, a day to remember and honor our fallen veterans during the holiday season.

315
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, this annual effort was canceled due to COVID.

316
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:27,983
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the Army Secretary reversed that order and the wreaths were able to be laid at Arlington National Cemetery and numerous other national cemeteries across the country.

317
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:47,513
[SPEAKER_02]: In closing, with this being our last school committee meeting prior to the holiday break, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere best wishes to all of you who celebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, and a happy new year.

318
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:56,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Kwanzaa is not a religious holiday, but an ethnic and cultural event that is celebrated December 26th through January 1st.

319
00:30:57,318 --> 00:31:00,101
[SPEAKER_02]: It is based on African Harvest Festival traditions.

320
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:03,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Although our celebrations will not look like years past.

321
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:11,631
[SPEAKER_02]: My hope is that you can enjoy it with your immediate household, as well as celebrated virtually with family and friends.

322
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:13,974
[SPEAKER_02]: As the new year begins.

323
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:25,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings with it the realization that a vaccine is going to be coming in the future, and that will help all of us eventually get back to our normal lives.

324
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:31,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Until then, please be well, stay safe, and don't gather in large groups.

325
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:38,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Wear your mask, and in the words of Tiny Tim from Dickens, A Christmas Carol, God bless us, everyone.

326
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:48,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to just share those are my remarks and I have a very, very special presentation for the school committee and for the listening audience.

327
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:59,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, under normal conditions, we would have been in for a special, special musical treat from our high school orchestra.

328
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: However,

329
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:09,723
[SPEAKER_02]: However, with COVID, we're on a slightly different schedule.

330
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:19,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're on a slightly different schedule, we have no choice but to listen to a very, very short clip.

331
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:22,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only six minutes and 42 seconds long.

332
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:26,928
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our Medford High School Orchestra.

333
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:29,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play it for you.

334
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna recognize our teacher, Ms.

335
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Emma Baptist.

336
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:38,194
[SPEAKER_02]: who will be able to speak once the performance plays.

337
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:45,603
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want you to see the hard work of our orchestra students despite the COVID virus.

338
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:51,110
[SPEAKER_02]: It warmed my heart and I want this presentation to warm yours as well.

339
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:16,813
StSq2 2.60

340
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:31,557
StSq2 2.60

341
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:48,640
[SPEAKER_07]: you

342
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:58,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to thank our wonderful orchestra.

343
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:01,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank Ms.

344
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:02,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Emma Baptist.

345
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:03,268
[SPEAKER_02]: She is on.

346
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:09,333
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to pull that off, I mean, it sounds wonderful.

347
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:12,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost felt like I was there.

348
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:21,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But to imagine every student being at their own home, in their own bedroom, or living room, wherever they were at, to combine all of that talent

349
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: was hours and hours and hours of work.

350
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:38,515
[SPEAKER_02]: That short six-minute video clip that we saw, Miss Emma Baptist spent a little over 30 hours to just give us six minutes, a six-minute concert.

351
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:45,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to thank you and thank all of the chorus members and

352
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:48,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

353
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:56,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Baptist, I would love for you to just say a word or two or for us to just be able to thank you for the great work that you're doing with the kids.

354
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:06,091
Okay.

355
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, you're on mute.

356
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can find you.

357
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:11,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying, yep.

358
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:17,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it, there you go.

359
00:41:17,749 --> 00:41:18,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell.

360
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:19,130
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set.

361
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,751
[SPEAKER_06]: You're unmuted.

362
00:41:21,191 --> 00:41:22,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you so much.

363
00:41:23,132 --> 00:41:24,713
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so, so kind.

364
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,794
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for everyone taking the time to watch.

365
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:34,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to just say I had to quickly do some last minute editing for like consent forms and stuff like that.

366
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:35,258
[SPEAKER_00]: So

367
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:41,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of mortified in like the first song with a couple of the kids were like overlapping a little.

368
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,202
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not taking my talents to Hollywood.

369
00:41:44,242 --> 00:41:44,982
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.

370
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:49,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this was all very brand new to me and to the kids.

371
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:54,689
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to, I'm new to the high school orchestra.

372
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,090
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first year with them.

373
00:41:56,951 --> 00:42:00,533
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never even really met any of them in person yet.

374
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:05,037
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them at the meet and greet, but it was really important for me to,

375
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:21,226
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of bring back that sense of ensemble that just hasn't been there since March, not to any of our faults, you know, it's the world and how it is right now and, you know, and for all that is just so uncertain, you know, this is such a

376
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:51,095
[SPEAKER_00]: huge time in for music teachers and you know we're always putting on concerts and shows and performances and I really just wanted to keep that going for the kids and and also for them to have something to look back on that was you know a happy memory from just this whole year in our world and um you know most concerts aren't recorded or or something that you know is filmed or something like that and um so for them to have this and to look back on it um

377
00:42:52,005 --> 00:42:53,827
[SPEAKER_00]: and to recognize all the hard work.

378
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:57,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this was a hundred times harder than putting on a concert in person.

379
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:04,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we're all eager to be able to do that again at some point, but it was a lot of fun.

380
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:10,499
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge learning experience and we all learn new skills from it and there's nothing wrong with that.

381
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,020
[SPEAKER_00]: So just thank you.

382
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for taking the time to air this today.

383
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.

384
00:43:17,564 --> 00:43:20,507
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope everyone has a really nice holiday

385
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:24,650
[SPEAKER_00]: season and winter break and all the good stuff.

386
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:26,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

387
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:26,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Baptiste.

388
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:26,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

389
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Van der Kloot.

390
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

391
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:34,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that wonderful show, Ms.

392
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:36,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Baptiste, and to the students.

393
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:38,440
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really lovely.

394
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Auld Lang Syne.

395
00:43:39,721 --> 00:43:40,662
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my favorite song.

396
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:44,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just so nice to hear and celebrate and be festive.

397
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're right, the ensemble piece is really wonderful.

398
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:48,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And I happen to be at the

399
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,871
[SPEAKER_05]: actually at the McGlynn School today and I was.

400
00:43:51,387 --> 00:44:03,574
[SPEAKER_05]: looking longingly at the auditorium and remembering the days when we were able to go in and watch our students perform and any number of exhibitions and missing that and looking forward very much to when we can do that again.

401
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:06,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that little bit of that tonight.

402
00:44:07,196 --> 00:44:19,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also wanted to say to the superintendent's point regarding the Medford Family Network and all their hard work around this, the toy collection and the community members who have contributed from

403
00:44:20,054 --> 00:44:31,925
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the firefighters to local Union 25 and police and Kiwanis and all the folks that the superintendent mentioned, you know, going over to the metric family network today was really remarkable.

404
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:35,448
[SPEAKER_05]: You could see the toys were literally from floor to ceiling.

405
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:37,084
[SPEAKER_05]: in each of the rooms.

406
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:48,790
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just so overwhelming and so moving and just made me feel so proud to be a part of Medford and also made me realize just how much work really Marie Cassidy puts into this.

407
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:57,816
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just collecting the toys from a number of different very willing contributors, but matching families to those toys, delivering those toys.

408
00:44:58,556 --> 00:45:00,237
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a huge, huge undertaking.

409
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:18,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would also just like to add that if there are folks who are available and interested and willing tomorrow, who might be able to help with any distribution, I'm sure Medford Family Network would welcome the help for any of the toy distribution for folks who are not able to come and pick up the toys.

410
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way to reach them is 781-393-2106.

411
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:24,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, 781-393-2106.

412
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:33,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And Heather and Marie have just been doing such a remarkable job with everybody there and just makes you proud to be from Medford.

413
00:45:33,123 --> 00:45:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you to them.

414
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:36,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

415
00:45:36,886 --> 00:45:37,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot?

416
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:48,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

417
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry I didn't realize it was muted.

418
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:53,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't unmute myself but thank you.

419
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:58,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to thank Miss Baptiste and the students for bringing us that lovely presentation tonight.

420
00:45:59,117 --> 00:46:05,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier I was thinking about how much I missed all the holiday concerts that they, for I've gone

421
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:11,888
[SPEAKER_04]: for many years, and they've just always added that certain sense of time and celebration.

422
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:13,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really felt funny.

423
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:20,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked into the high school this morning for another reason and saw the empty auditorium and wished I was going there.

424
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:23,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really appreciate that this was brought to us.

425
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I was speaking to a friend who is a member of the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

426
00:46:28,363 --> 00:46:36,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had done a piece, and he was explaining the process of how difficult it was to get everybody coordinated.

427
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:49,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And hearing our teacher doing this work with our students is particularly heartwarming to know that they've gone through the same process and all the labor, a labor of love, and thank you for it.

428
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:50,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

429
00:46:52,721 --> 00:46:53,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz?

430
00:46:56,745 --> 00:46:59,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and I just wanted to say thank you to Ms.

431
00:46:59,287 --> 00:47:00,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Baptiste and the students.

432
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:02,489
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful performance.

433
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:04,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.

434
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:19,500
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my fellow committee members, we've sat through many live orchestra performances the winter season, and this has just been amazing and wonderful, and it sounded absolutely beautiful and flawless.

435
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.

436
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:21,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

437
00:47:21,701 --> 00:47:22,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy holidays.

438
00:47:24,323 --> 00:47:25,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, great job.

439
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:25,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

440
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:36,911
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update offered by Ms.

441
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:37,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Toni Rae, Ms.

442
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Marianne O'Connor, and Mr. David Murphy.

443
00:47:47,515 --> 00:47:48,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

444
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:50,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Marianne, are you starting off?

445
00:47:50,177 --> 00:47:51,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know.

446
00:47:51,297 --> 00:47:52,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you want, Toni.

447
00:47:52,758 --> 00:47:53,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

448
00:47:53,178 --> 00:47:54,158
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

449
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:57,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So hi, all.

450
00:47:58,507 --> 00:47:59,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.

451
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:00,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

452
00:48:02,689 --> 00:48:21,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll just give the community update, but as we continue through this holiday season, it's more important than ever that we heed the guidance of the experts in our State Department of Public Health and CDC that we're all asking Massachusetts residents to follow.

453
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,082
[SPEAKER_03]: The spike in cases and hospitalizations we saw following the Thanksgiving holiday

454
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:46,391
[SPEAKER_03]: should serve as a sobering reminder of the stakes of this pandemic, as difficult as it may be to make the decisions we need to make around this Christmas holiday that'll keep all of our families safe.

455
00:48:47,912 --> 00:48:57,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier this month, DPH did release updated holiday guidance, which can be found at mass.gov slash holidays.

456
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:12,635
[SPEAKER_03]: The lowest risk recommendation is to only celebrate in person with members of your immediate household and to hold virtual celebrations if possible with friends and family out of state.

457
00:49:13,896 --> 00:49:26,002
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do celebrate in person, please utilize proven COVID-19 prevention methods, such as mask wearing indoors, staying six feet apart from individuals outside of your household,

458
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:31,547
[SPEAKER_03]: and celebrating outdoors if needed in a well-ventilated space.

459
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:42,933
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, please remember the gathering size restrictions, face covering requirements and the travel testing requirements remain in effect.

460
00:49:45,154 --> 00:49:51,138
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, as you've probably all seen the last state report which was released on 12-17 from Medford

461
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,871
[SPEAKER_03]: included data from 11-29 to 12-12.

462
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:03,252
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, our total caseload since the beginning was 2,480.

463
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Our total positive cases in the last, those last 14 days was 635.

464
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:09,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And our positivity rate was 2.73.

465
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:11,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Since that report was released,

466
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:29,464
[SPEAKER_03]: from 12-12 till today, we've had an additional 234 cases.

467
00:50:34,505 --> 00:50:47,608
[SPEAKER_03]: From Thanksgiving, from 11-27, which would be the Friday after Thanksgiving till today, we've had an additional 862 cases.

468
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really asking people to heed

469
00:50:54,249 --> 00:51:00,613
[SPEAKER_03]: the warnings and the guidelines and the recommendations not to gather, not to travel.

470
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:21,344
[SPEAKER_03]: If Thanksgiving is any kind of a indication as to what the holidays could bring and the surge that we have and we are experiencing right now, I really hope that people have learned from that and that Christmas and New Year's will be different.

471
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:24,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

472
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:26,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

473
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:26,920
[SPEAKER_06]: O'Connor.

474
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:33,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, this is Toni Ray, the supervisor of health services for Medford Public Schools.

475
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:38,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll give a snapshot of what we've been seeing in the school community.

476
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:44,635
[SPEAKER_09]: In December, we saw a steady increase in the number of positive tests for both students and staff.

477
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:50,760
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was in alignment with the public health expectations and the warnings following the Thanksgiving holiday.

478
00:51:52,175 --> 00:52:04,525
[SPEAKER_09]: For students, the positive cases were scattered amongst many classrooms across the district, and the contact tracing identified household transmission as the most frequent mode of transmission.

479
00:52:06,147 --> 00:52:10,911
[SPEAKER_09]: For staff members, the number of positive cases doubled between November and December.

480
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:19,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And the contact tracing, again, identified community and household transmission as the most frequent modes of transmission during this timeframe.

481
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:32,000
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to our district metrics, we made a decision to place the Brooks Elementary School on remote learning for the few days leading into the holiday recess.

482
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:39,607
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a few variables that went into this decision that I just wanted to state tonight.

483
00:52:40,654 --> 00:52:44,737
[SPEAKER_09]: We had seven staff members who tested positive over a 12 day period.

484
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:54,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a result of our contact tracing, we seriously considered whether this was an in-school link amongst the staff.

485
00:52:55,746 --> 00:53:01,271
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, it was a very unique situation that we had not experienced in the community to date.

486
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:08,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So we made the very cautious decision to put the school into remote learning for the few days.

487
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:25,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I stress the same words that Mary Ann O'Connor says, you know, make sure you heed Governor Baker's safer at home warnings and his recommendations for holiday celebrations.

488
00:53:25,613 --> 00:53:32,959
[SPEAKER_09]: We also ask if you are feeling ill, please quarantine at home and arrange to get a COVID test at a stop the spread site.

489
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:40,965
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find a list of multitude of sites at stop the, mass.gov, stop the spread.

490
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:50,710
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a number of new testing sites in Cambridge where we have heard that the lines have been on the shorter side compared to other sites.

491
00:53:52,311 --> 00:53:56,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wish everyone a happy, healthy, and safe holiday.

492
00:53:57,672 --> 00:53:58,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

493
00:53:58,273 --> 00:53:58,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray.

494
00:53:58,913 --> 00:53:59,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Murphy?

495
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:00,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

496
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:11,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to share my screen, but I promise this is a brief presentation and no one should lose faith in the pace at which this meeting is

497
00:54:12,143 --> 00:54:21,607
[SPEAKER_11]: moving along, but there are some facts and figures that we'll be sharing that we wanted to make sure that you had this in writing and it was presented to the community as such.

498
00:54:21,707 --> 00:54:36,412
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm gonna be just providing some background on the COVID-19 testing program that we have administered in the Medford Public Schools through our partnership with Tufts University, the Broad Institute and Armstrong Ambulance.

499
00:54:37,212 --> 00:54:41,434
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked in this forum in the past about the gratitude we feel toward those partners

500
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,879
[SPEAKER_11]: in making this testing program available.

501
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:49,581
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's certainly our hope that this program is going to continue through the remainder of the school year.

502
00:54:50,301 --> 00:54:59,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And just because I don't know that we've actually fully articulated in the past, we wanted to make clear that the goals of this program are obviously to keep the school communities safe.

503
00:55:00,404 --> 00:55:10,208
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also to instill confidence and so that people can have the peace of mind knowing that they're entering an environment in which there is this type of robust testing program.

504
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:11,468
[SPEAKER_11]: And then importantly,

505
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:14,424
[SPEAKER_11]: something that's been very important to us.

506
00:55:14,484 --> 00:55:25,289
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a goal that we've largely achieved is to minimize the instructional disruption that takes place when you are administering hundreds of tests a day on multiple times a week.

507
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:32,513
[SPEAKER_11]: So our staff testing began on September 24th and our student testing began on November 30th.

508
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,855
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we move through this,

509
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:45,757
[SPEAKER_11]: We've said before, this is the non-invasive testing that we've been doing through the PCR tests.

510
00:55:46,338 --> 00:55:52,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Of our staff testing, we've administered 4,100 COVID-19 tests to Medford Public Schools employees.

511
00:55:53,365 --> 00:55:55,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Of that, there have been 18 positive results.

512
00:55:56,748 --> 00:56:00,352
[SPEAKER_11]: The larger numbers in this presentation are approximations.

513
00:56:00,812 --> 00:56:02,414
[SPEAKER_11]: You should be mindful of that, but also

514
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:04,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the numbers that Ms.

515
00:56:04,345 --> 00:56:09,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Freire was just referencing encompass some of the outside testing that's taking place as well.

516
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:13,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this deck is specific to the Medford Public Schools testing.

517
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:24,359
[SPEAKER_11]: We did reach an agreement with the Teachers Union earlier this year for mandatory COVID-19 testing prior to a resumption of in-person duties.

518
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:29,662
[SPEAKER_11]: That agreement has now been extended through our tentative agreement to include mandatory testing.

519
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:38,657
[SPEAKER_11]: on a weekly basis, subject to funding availability, and that is a position that the district will be taking with our other bargaining units in the coming weeks.

520
00:56:40,378 --> 00:56:52,144
[SPEAKER_11]: With regard to student tests, there have been close to 3,000 student tests, COVID-19 tests administered to students, and there will be several hundred more administered tomorrow.

521
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:52,224
[SPEAKER_11]: The

522
00:56:53,532 --> 00:56:57,054
[SPEAKER_11]: testing takes place in each school site on Tuesdays and Fridays.

523
00:56:57,655 --> 00:57:11,383
[SPEAKER_11]: And that structure that we've established is anticipation of our hope to move toward pool testing, which I can talk a little bit about momentarily during the winter and spring months.

524
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:14,665
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen marked improvement with regard to our consent forms.

525
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:22,050
[SPEAKER_11]: We have close to 1,700 consent forms have been submitted now from Medford public schools, students, families,

526
00:57:22,591 --> 00:57:28,373
[SPEAKER_11]: we still have a bit of a gap that we need to bridge and we'll be working with school leaders to do that in the coming weeks.

527
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:47,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Anecdotally, I expect within the coming weeks we'll have exact data on this, but anecdotally at the elementary level where students are coming down as part of a class and the class is traipsing down to the testing station, we're seeing about a four to five minute disruption in the class, which again is sort of a point of pride that we've been able to

528
00:57:48,834 --> 00:58:02,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the work of the principals and the teachers who are helping to facilitate this, along with Tony's staff and some of the outside partners, we've been able to minimize the amount of time that students are out of class and doing this.

529
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:07,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the secondary students are self swabbing, it's taking place during the lunch block.

530
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:13,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And as proud as we are that the instructional time at the elementary level is being minimized, we're also proud that

531
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:23,262
[SPEAKER_11]: We have not heard a wave of complaints of middle school students that were disrupting their lunch so that's that's more evidence that it's running relatively efficiently and smoothly.

532
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:45,408
[SPEAKER_11]: With regard to what you can expect, and there's a couple of tweaks to some of these numbers, I think in the deck that you received earlier today, it said that there were 2,200 students that are currently comprised of cohorts A, B, and C. Looking at the data, it looks like there might have been some double counting there amongst cohort A, so I think it's closer to 1,900, which is obviously a larger percentage of the consent forms.

533
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:48,109
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of what we're looking at going forward,

534
00:58:49,520 --> 00:59:01,544
[SPEAKER_11]: We, our expectation right now, and there's still questions that have to be answered and we're still actively engaged in conversations to try to make sure that this program continues to be a reality in the months ahead.

535
00:59:02,244 --> 00:59:13,628
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we are confident of right now is that we'll do baseline testing for all students and staff returning in person on January 12th and January 15th, respectively.

536
00:59:14,248 --> 00:59:25,636
[SPEAKER_11]: As Dr. Edouard-Vincent mentioned earlier, cohorts A and B along, excuse me, A and C, along with staff will test on January 12th prior to returning to in-person instruction on January 14th.

537
00:59:26,276 --> 00:59:32,600
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do cohort B testing on January 15th prior to that cohort starting in person on January 19th.

538
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:43,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And because we do anticipate a transition to pool testing on January 19th, there'll be a significant amount of communication that we will be engaged in in the coming weeks to make sure everyone is

539
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:50,811
[SPEAKER_11]: up-to-date as to what changes when we move to individual testing to pool testing.

540
00:59:51,192 --> 01:00:02,658
[SPEAKER_11]: The short version of that is the only thing that changes is there's a obligation on the part of those participating to participate in the follow-up test if a pool tests positive.

541
01:00:03,238 --> 01:00:06,780
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, there's going to be a lot of communication about that and a lot more information about that.

542
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to answer questions tonight, but

543
01:00:09,382 --> 01:00:16,065
[SPEAKER_11]: The short version is we'll be sharing a lot of information in the coming weeks with families and staff so that they understand what that means.

544
01:00:17,946 --> 01:00:22,868
[SPEAKER_11]: There won't be testing the first week back for instruction.

545
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:27,510
[SPEAKER_11]: For the remote week on January 4th, there won't be testing in the Medford Public Schools.

546
01:00:28,051 --> 01:00:37,655
[SPEAKER_11]: And so for that reason, we wanted to reaffirm and reiterate the responsibility that all members of the Medford Public Schools community have

547
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:44,940
[SPEAKER_11]: to adhere to the public health guidance with regard to traveling and congregating in groups over the holiday period.

548
01:00:45,540 --> 01:01:05,767
[SPEAKER_11]: And while it is our hope and expectation that everyone will adhere to that public health guidance in the event a staff member does not, the expectation is that that person will avail themselves of the Stop the Spread program prior to continuing any type of in-person work or responsibilities on the week of the 4th.

549
01:01:06,884 --> 01:01:23,870
[SPEAKER_11]: This last bullet point is sort of forecasting potentially for a future discussion, but there was a change in the guidance that the CDC provided and was then related through DPH and DESI with regard to quarantine periods.

550
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:34,634
[SPEAKER_11]: That change is essentially that up until, I believe it was last week, it may have been the end of the week before, the guidance was that a 14-day quarantine period

551
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:50,998
[SPEAKER_11]: that is the result of a close contact could be shortened to 10 days if an individual tests negative after the eighth day and has not and does not present with any symptoms.

552
01:01:52,179 --> 01:02:06,282
[SPEAKER_11]: That has been shortened to ending a quarantine period after day seven if the person tests negative after day five and does not and has not presented with any symptoms.

553
01:02:07,085 --> 01:02:30,438
[SPEAKER_11]: As of this time, our standard operating procedure is to maintain the more conservative approach within the Medford public schools, which is that a quarantine period would not be reduced below 10 days and to essentially not take the more liberal approach that is the current CDC guidance.

554
01:02:30,878 --> 01:02:33,980
[SPEAKER_11]: That does pose an operational challenge, but

555
01:02:34,528 --> 01:02:36,929
[SPEAKER_11]: all of this poses an operational challenge.

556
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:45,711
[SPEAKER_11]: And in our discussions with the Board of Health, that is our current position that is to maintain that status quo.

557
01:02:46,572 --> 01:02:52,453
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's essentially not relevant right now because we're gonna be remote after tomorrow for the next three weeks.

558
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:59,055
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is something that we wanted to make sure that the committee was aware of and the position that we're currently taking with regard to that.

559
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:04,257
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm happy to answer any questions and I will keep my responses as brief as possible.

560
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:06,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

561
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:14,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau, do you have a comment from the email?

562
01:03:15,696 --> 01:03:17,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you very much, Mayor.

563
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,963
[SPEAKER_13]: This is from Leticia Rocha of Mystic Valley Parkway.

564
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:30,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the following questions and a comment.

565
01:03:30,945 --> 01:03:33,327
[SPEAKER_13]: In a recent communication, the superintendent mentioned

566
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:40,891
[SPEAKER_13]: They were forced to transition the Brooks School building to full remote mode due to circumstances that were specific and unique to that building.

567
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:46,676
[SPEAKER_13]: What exactly are those circumstances that led to the Brooks School to go full remote?

568
01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:51,480
[SPEAKER_13]: It is important that the community at large is aware as cases continue to rise in the city.

569
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,402
[SPEAKER_13]: There actually are four questions.

570
01:03:53,422 --> 01:03:56,324
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I should just take the questions and get the answers.

571
01:03:56,925 --> 01:03:59,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Rousseau, would you mind if I just answered that one really quickly?

572
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:01,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Ms.

573
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:15,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray may have mentioned it, but there are two variables where the suspected in-school transmission amongst staff and the total number of quarantining amongst staff that was posing an additional operational challenge.

574
01:04:15,711 --> 01:04:26,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Those, while we had not seen the in-person transmission in any school community, but we had certainly seen operational challenges in every school, frankly, but the,

575
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:38,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Severity of the operational challenges due to the number of individuals quarantining and the suspected in-school transmission were the unique variables at the Brooks.

576
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

577
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:54,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Question number two is, in the state as a whole, a total of 591 students learning in-person or in a hybrid plan tested positive in less than a week, from December 10th through the 16th, as did 418 school district staffers.

578
01:04:57,515 --> 01:05:02,639
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the second week in a row where these numbers rise dramatically.

579
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Science has proven across various studies that community transmission rates influence school transmission rates.

580
01:05:09,565 --> 01:05:23,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Since the city of Medford has had 571 cases and counting in the last two weeks, how will the district keep up with these rates when rates that we all know will only rise as the winter continues?

581
01:05:27,492 --> 01:05:39,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I was just going to say we we have built in many layers of prevention and protection for our students and our staff.

582
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:46,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean we're, we, from the beginning we've been expecting everyone to wear masks to maintain the six feet social distancing.

583
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:49,227
[SPEAKER_09]: to engage in frequent hand washing.

584
01:05:49,627 --> 01:05:56,572
[SPEAKER_09]: We've added on the additional layers of testing of the staff weekly and now biweekly and students as well.

585
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:10,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we finally appeal to everybody in the community to be following the very clear public health guidance that the Medford Board of Health puts out and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health puts out.

586
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:26,246
[SPEAKER_09]: So we engage in diligent contact tracing, which includes extensive conversations with teachers and teaching staff and administrators in the building when we identify a positive case.

587
01:06:26,787 --> 01:06:33,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So we see that as steps to minimizing in-school transmission.

588
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:48,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just add to that that I think if you look at the numbers that we shared tonight that we've administered 2900 student tests over the last three weeks, and have had five 15 positive test results.

589
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:51,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think the peace of mind comes with one.

590
01:06:52,845 --> 01:06:54,346
[SPEAKER_11]: that the number is as low as it is.

591
01:06:54,466 --> 01:07:04,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's a testament to the enforcement of the protocols that have taken place within each school community with regard to distancing, mask wearing, and so on and so forth.

592
01:07:05,072 --> 01:07:19,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I also think the piece of mind comes with the fact that we know that when individuals do test positive, they are separated from the school community for a period of time to ensure that there isn't the type of in-school transmission that we're trying to avoid.

593
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:26,950
[SPEAKER_11]: That being said, there are risks involved here, which is why all of these efforts and this vigilance is on a continuous basis.

594
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:35,814
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've made some of the strategic decisions that we have that we've talked about tonight, both with regard to the BRICS and with regard to the resumption of in-person instruction in January.

595
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:37,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

596
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:38,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Colin?

597
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:49,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would add that I am in the remote cohort D, and in cohort B and C.

598
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:58,563
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to give the school committee and the members a big pat on the back as the students are saying the school is very safe.

599
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:01,744
[SPEAKER_12]: They feel very comfortable there.

600
01:08:02,025 --> 01:08:08,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Every single one of them that I've talked to has said how strictly social distancing has been enforced, hand sanitization.

601
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:13,409
[SPEAKER_12]: They've all been very comfortable with the situation.

602
01:08:13,629 --> 01:08:16,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just like to add that from a student's perspective.

603
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:19,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Colin.

604
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:20,452
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate that.

605
01:08:22,107 --> 01:08:23,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Mayor, shall I continue?

606
01:08:24,108 --> 01:08:25,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

607
01:08:25,389 --> 01:08:26,430
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just two more questions.

608
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:28,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sorry.

609
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:37,377
[SPEAKER_13]: The superintendent spoke about all students coming back in January, which is an incorrect framing that does not reflect the families who have chosen fully remote education.

610
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:46,662
[SPEAKER_13]: This framing sends a clear message to families that are already apprehensive about the quality of remote education decreasing once all grades are in the building.

611
01:08:46,802 --> 01:08:49,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Remote students are simply not the administration's priority.

612
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:56,614
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll just add the last part of the email real quick.

613
01:09:01,358 --> 01:09:04,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I follow up with regards to the Brooks after Ms.

614
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:11,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Ray's statement that the seven staff members at the Brooks who tested positive over a 12-day period could be school transmission.

615
01:09:11,587 --> 01:09:14,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Can she clarify whether it was school transmission or not?

616
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, how is

617
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:22,265
[SPEAKER_13]: is specific to the Brooks building, is this not something that can occur in other district buildings as well?

618
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:23,406
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the end.

619
01:09:24,746 --> 01:09:25,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

620
01:09:26,267 --> 01:09:37,754
[SPEAKER_06]: We have recommendation to approve donation to robotics department of Medford Vocational Technical High School, Mr. Chad Fallon.

621
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, may I comment on the last?

622
01:09:42,871 --> 01:09:43,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Member McLaughlin.

623
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:44,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

624
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:45,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

625
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:52,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, before we moved on, I wanted to comment on the last question slash comments.

626
01:09:52,875 --> 01:10:00,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I first wanted to just start out with really thanking Toni Wray and Marianne O'Connor.

627
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:05,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been a long road for everyone, and I think

628
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:11,634
[SPEAKER_05]: The two of you have just been standouts in the work and really appreciate all of your hard work.

629
01:10:11,654 --> 01:10:16,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coming up to mid-year now and it's been a lot.

630
01:10:16,537 --> 01:10:19,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say thank you to the two of you.

631
01:10:20,459 --> 01:10:28,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Then also, we had office hours recently where we spoke with families who were in the remote cohort.

632
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:37,129
[SPEAKER_05]: who are in the remote cohort and who expressed similar sentiment as the letter writer in the email.

633
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:44,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, there was some brainstorming around, you know, how to help individuals in the remote cohort feel

634
01:10:45,220 --> 01:11:01,521
[SPEAKER_05]: more included and more welcome and I would like to explore that on Superintendent Edward said if we could a little bit and and one of the suggestions was, you know, perhaps creating even just sort of, you know, either support groups at the school grade at the school level.

635
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:18,845
[SPEAKER_05]: You know at each of the school levels elementary, middle and high school, whether it be through you know a closed and private Facebook group or some other avenue but being able to connect families to each other I think that we've heard over and over that, particularly the remote

636
01:11:19,285 --> 01:11:23,147
[SPEAKER_05]: cohort is feeling really left out and isolated.

637
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:24,727
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're all feeling isolated.

638
01:11:24,767 --> 01:11:40,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can imagine what it feels like to not be in a setting where you're getting to see your colleagues, as some of us are at work every day, or talk to people outside of your home, as many of us may be, how isolating that can be.

639
01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:45,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just would like to consider ways that we might think about that and help

640
01:11:46,496 --> 01:11:48,160
[SPEAKER_05]: alleviate that situation.

641
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:56,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just wanted to end with to the superintendent, my senior went back last week.

642
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:02,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And was so, I've never seen a 17 year old so grateful to be in school again in my life.

643
01:12:02,994 --> 01:12:06,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really remarkable to see for someone who had struggled with school before.

644
01:12:06,777 --> 01:12:17,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was, it was remarkable, but also that, you know, there was, there was commentary made about how much students can see how much you care to the superintendent at Wedminsent.

645
01:12:17,164 --> 01:12:21,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to let you know that that had been reflected and you don't often hear that from teenage boys.

646
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:24,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought it was remarkable and something that I wanted to share with you.

647
01:12:24,989 --> 01:12:25,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

648
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:40,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin, and I am definitely open to trying to put up a structure, whether it's a support group or something more formal for remote families.

649
01:12:40,415 --> 01:12:46,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want the Medford Public Schools community to feel that whether you're in Cohort D,

650
01:12:47,557 --> 01:12:51,500
[SPEAKER_02]: and that you're not part of the Medford Public Schools community.

651
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I see us as one large community.

652
01:12:53,902 --> 01:13:09,933
[SPEAKER_02]: My own family, my sister, my niece and nephew, they are part of the remote cohort, Cohort D. Yes, they do have access to Auntie, so they get to talk to me in person, but I am saying that I do not

653
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not intentionally trying to have anyone feel excluded or not valued.

654
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:19,980
[SPEAKER_02]: That definitely is not my intention.

655
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:32,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm definitely open to trying to come up with intentional ways to have remote families connect or feel connected somehow.

656
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm definitely willing to work on that.

657
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:38,934
[SPEAKER_02]: To your other comment,

658
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:49,120
[SPEAKER_02]: about the seniors being back and just seeing more bodies at the high school and just seeing their happiness.

659
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:52,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I, you know, interacted with them.

660
01:13:52,203 --> 01:13:55,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They truly are appreciative of being back on campus.

661
01:13:55,925 --> 01:14:00,108
[SPEAKER_02]: They know they're graduating at the end of the year and this is their last

662
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:08,088
[SPEAKER_02]: their last hurrah before they go out into the big bad world, whether it's college or career or military.

663
01:14:09,628 --> 01:14:12,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I appreciate that feedback.

664
01:14:12,969 --> 01:14:24,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I'm not going to be able to please everyone, but I will just know that I'm going to continue to try my best for all, you know, for all of Medford public schools.

665
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:28,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will make, definitely make an intentional,

666
01:14:31,627 --> 01:14:34,049
[SPEAKER_02]: an intentional reach out to our remote families.

667
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:36,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you for the feedback.

668
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:37,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

669
01:14:37,771 --> 01:14:52,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it's something that, you know, Stacey Shulman can also just sort of offer some feedback on or, you know, Mia and I did office hours together and there was some parents there that had some suggestions and we can check with them and see if they're okay with us forwarding their names along to you too.

670
01:14:53,019 --> 01:14:54,599
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that would be really helpful.

671
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Superintendent.

672
01:14:58,522 --> 01:14:59,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you both.

673
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:10,313
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendation to approve donation to robotics department, Medford Vocational Technical High School, Mr. Chad Fallon.

674
01:15:18,795 --> 01:15:22,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I acknowledge Little Graham's on the phone, on the call too?

675
01:15:22,136 --> 01:15:29,577
[SPEAKER_06]: We can hear you now.

676
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:32,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we can hear me now.

677
01:15:33,638 --> 01:15:34,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Little Graham.

678
01:15:38,596 --> 01:15:39,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope Santa's good to you.

679
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:42,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have Mr. Fallon on the line?

680
01:15:43,017 --> 01:15:44,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

681
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see him on the call.

682
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing, do you see him on the call?

683
01:15:58,701 --> 01:15:59,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not.

684
01:15:59,641 --> 01:16:02,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to reach out to him right now to see if he can jump on quickly.

685
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:07,363
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, anybody motion to table that one until we can try to get Mr. Fallon?

686
01:16:07,383 --> 01:16:07,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table.

687
01:16:08,212 --> 01:16:10,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table by Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

688
01:16:10,414 --> 01:16:10,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

689
01:16:11,555 --> 01:16:12,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz, roll call.

690
01:16:20,602 --> 01:16:20,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Graham?

691
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:21,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

692
01:16:22,864 --> 01:16:23,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Kreatz?

693
01:16:23,765 --> 01:16:23,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

694
01:16:24,445 --> 01:16:25,026
[SPEAKER_04]: McLaughlin?

695
01:16:25,686 --> 01:16:26,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

696
01:16:26,327 --> 01:16:26,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

697
01:16:26,507 --> 01:16:26,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Stone?

698
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:27,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

699
01:16:27,868 --> 01:16:28,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Russo?

700
01:16:29,409 --> 01:16:29,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

701
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Van der Kloot?

702
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:30,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

703
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:31,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor?

704
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:32,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

705
01:16:32,151 --> 01:16:33,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

706
01:16:33,552 --> 01:16:34,533
[SPEAKER_06]: The paper is tabled.

707
01:16:34,573 --> 01:16:36,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four, recommendation to approve donation

708
01:16:37,341 --> 01:16:39,287
[SPEAKER_06]: from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

709
01:16:41,112 --> 01:16:42,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli.

710
01:16:51,518 --> 01:16:52,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, good evening.

711
01:16:53,879 --> 01:17:04,141
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am here tonight to deliver a report on an award that the Metropolitan Public Schools received from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

712
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:08,942
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to give you a little bit of a background to funding for our Italian program.

713
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:14,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was last year that we found out that our partner group, CACET,

714
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:27,667
[SPEAKER_10]: lost their funding, the funding was significantly decreased, and as a result, their support for our elementary Italian program ended unexpectedly.

715
01:17:28,628 --> 01:17:37,315
[SPEAKER_10]: CASSID had been supporting our Italian program for about the past 20 years by contributing approximately 50,000 a year for that program.

716
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:50,119
[SPEAKER_10]: In late May, early June of 2020, my lead teacher, Vilma Bibo, and I applied for a direct grant through the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

717
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember it vividly because we needed to apply in Italian, and I don't speak or write Italian, and she does.

718
01:17:56,064 --> 01:17:58,626
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was very helpful to have her assistance.

719
01:17:59,547 --> 01:18:13,851
[SPEAKER_10]: We were informed in early fall that we were probably going to get the grant, and it adds up to 27,000 euros, which when the conversion takes place, that comes out to about 32,000 U.S.

720
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:14,612
[SPEAKER_10]: dollars.

721
01:18:15,592 --> 01:18:25,975
[SPEAKER_10]: We were also told that Medford had been the highest awarded, received the highest funding of any school in the United States that is supported by the Italian Ministry

722
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:30,357
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just, I thought that was something special.

723
01:18:31,118 --> 01:18:38,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we applied for this grant, we needed to put down, we needed to identify the number of students who were taking Italian in the district.

724
01:18:38,842 --> 01:18:45,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And during the 2019-2020 school year, that number was significantly higher than it is now.

725
01:18:46,507 --> 01:18:52,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, our elementary Italian program enrolled about 900 students in total.

726
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:59,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that program has ended, we – this year, we're down 900 students.

727
01:18:59,853 --> 01:19:03,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Our middle school program and our high school programs are still very strong.

728
01:19:04,374 --> 01:19:15,417
[SPEAKER_10]: We have told the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the consulate that that elementary program does – no longer exists, and they are willing to continue the funding

729
01:19:16,012 --> 01:19:18,914
[SPEAKER_10]: even though that program does not exist.

730
01:19:19,474 --> 01:19:27,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be using the funds to defray the cost of our advanced placement program of the high school for the 2021 school year.

731
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:39,927
[SPEAKER_10]: And tonight we do respectfully ask to approve the acceptance of this gracious gift of approximately $32,000 from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

732
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:43,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, that is to support our advanced placement program.

733
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:56,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to extend my big thank you to Federica Serrini, who's the Consul General of Italy, and Adamo Castelnuovo, who's the Director of the Education Office at the Consul.

734
01:19:57,277 --> 01:20:02,680
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the gracious support of our program.

735
01:20:03,441 --> 01:20:08,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Both Federica Serrini and Adamo Castelnuovo have been to Medford High School.

736
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:10,225
[SPEAKER_10]: They came two years ago.

737
01:20:10,365 --> 01:20:14,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember we had a nice lunch in the bistro.

738
01:20:15,328 --> 01:20:17,890
[SPEAKER_10]: They met the superintendent.

739
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:24,153
[SPEAKER_10]: They are very gracious, and they really expressed an interest in supporting our program.

740
01:20:24,394 --> 01:20:26,575
[SPEAKER_10]: And we hope this continues beyond this year.

741
01:20:27,884 --> 01:20:28,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

742
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:28,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

743
01:20:29,545 --> 01:20:31,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Second motion to have questions, Mayor.

744
01:20:33,007 --> 01:20:33,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

745
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:35,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

746
01:20:35,108 --> 01:20:40,211
[SPEAKER_13]: This is always exciting to get money, and I appreciate that Cassett has and, um.

747
01:20:40,972 --> 01:20:48,536
[SPEAKER_13]: The Italian consulate has has been able to help us out, especially since the ending of the funding earlier in the year was a bit of a

748
01:20:54,863 --> 01:21:06,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I just feel it's necessary to ask, are there any stipulations other than that this is spent on AP, there's no year two expectations or any reporting requirements?

749
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:13,532
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of money and I just want to understand that it truly is, there's no strings at all.

750
01:21:15,463 --> 01:21:19,906
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are allowed to spend it on AP testing.

751
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:24,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So any of the students who are taking the AP Italian test can take it for free.

752
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:36,857
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be used to defray the cost of the salary for our AP Italian teacher, just as the other funding could be used to defray the cost of our staff to teach in the elementary program.

753
01:21:37,377 --> 01:21:40,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this one can defray the cost of the high school teacher.

754
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:48,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure I will need to report out, but it's not a US government grant program, so the reporting is a little different.

755
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:50,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll probably have to reach out to VILMA again.

756
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,610
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably going to be in Italian.

757
01:21:53,431 --> 01:21:59,917
[SPEAKER_10]: But beyond that, they give us a lot of discretion on how we spend it as long as it's for that AP Italian program.

758
01:22:01,038 --> 01:22:01,658
[SPEAKER_13]: That's wonderful.

759
01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:02,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

760
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:03,660
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

761
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:08,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you both for filling out that grant.

762
01:22:09,353 --> 01:22:12,633

[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, good evening.

802
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:20,287
[SPEAKER_14]: We recently had a donation from Sam Christie, who's one of the teachers in the robotics and engineering program.

803
01:23:20,307 --> 01:23:24,969
[SPEAKER_14]: He was part of a nonprofit that he belonged to, and he wanted to take the proceeds of the company.

804
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:29,792
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been dissolved, and he wanted to take the proceeds and donate them to Medford Vocational Technical High School.

805
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:32,431
[SPEAKER_14]: to be used in any program, not just his.

806
01:23:33,812 --> 01:23:34,392
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wonderful.

807
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:35,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how much that totaled?

808
01:23:36,613 --> 01:23:36,853
[SPEAKER_14]: It was 4,000.

809
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:39,654
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have the figure in front of me, but it was just over 4,000.

810
01:23:41,774 --> 01:23:42,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

811
01:23:42,674 --> 01:23:43,355

[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, Jenny.

867
01:26:13,132 --> 01:26:15,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I was complimenting Jenny on her sweater.

868
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:18,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I said it wasn't too ugly, and then I didn't know they had flashing lights, so.

869
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:19,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's ugly.

870
01:26:20,688 --> 01:26:21,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I take it back.

871
01:26:21,829 --> 01:26:22,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Melanie, what's yours?

872
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:30,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine was actually loaned to me, given to me by the superintendent today because I didn't get one, but gifted.

01:26:30,096 --> 01:26:32,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a present, see?

01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:47,550
