1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:07,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Dial in number is 1-301-715-8592.

2
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:21,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing shays, that's s-h-a-y-s, at medford.k12.ma.us.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Those submitting questions or comments must include the following information.

4
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Your first and last name.

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,751
[SPEAKER_04]: your Medford Street address, and your question or comment.

6
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:45,413
[SPEAKER_04]: As approved by the committee on February 1st, 2023, the evaluation subcommittee will meet to review and develop the process for the 2022-23 superintendent evaluation.

7
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:57,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's agenda, as approved by the evaluation subcommittee on Thursday, February 16th, 2023, the evaluation subcommittee will meet to finalize the template design and instructions.

8
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:13,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So at our last meeting, we determined that we would, this year anyway, try using the evaluation tool that DESE provides.

9
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:15,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And we looked through it.

10
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the concerns was that on some of the pages, the information is kind of wordy and knowing for the members to know specifically on the standards which

11
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:35,663
[SPEAKER_04]: indicators we've chosen as the focus indicators, and I will share my screen in a minute to show everyone.

12
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:50,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a question of whether that might be difficult to see, so that we wanted to look at highlighting those, the focus indicators that we've selected this year, so that it was just really clear which ones people should be rating.

13
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:56,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did that, and I will attempt to share my screen.

14
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,327
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, can everyone see that?

15
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:16,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it's further down.

16
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:22,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I did fill in also, just so we could see what it would look like when we actually send it to the members.

17
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:27,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I filled in the superintendent's goals on this page here.

18
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,842
[SPEAKER_04]: and the focus indicators that went, that we selected to go with each of those goals.

19
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the, there's the highlighting.

20
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So I highlighted on these pages the selected indicators.

21
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the ones for instructional leadership.

22
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the one for management and operations.

23
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:01,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And family and community engagement, there were three.

24
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:08,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And professional culture, three more.

25
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

26
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's enough.

27
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

28
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:21,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had just emailed these to everyone last, just last night, I think.

29
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:24,414
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if anyone has any thoughts, comments.

30
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that seem to work better?

31
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,850
[SPEAKER_04]: to have them highlighted.

32
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:34,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Melanie, member McLaughlin, sorry.

33
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, member McLaughlin.

34
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:51,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the highlights are super helpful, thank you, but I wanted to know if you could go back up to the top and show me, I wasn't quite getting where you were saying you would put in the superintendent's information on the indicators, so if maybe you could.

35
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:54,497
[SPEAKER_01]: On the goals, I filled in the goals here.

36
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:55,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

37
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:55,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

38
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:59,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of that information there is from the superintendent is what you're saying.

39
00:03:59,627 --> 00:03:59,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

40
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:01,908
[SPEAKER_01]: From her goals that she gave us.

41
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:02,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

42
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:03,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

43
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:15,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think, I mean, I don't know what it looks like printed out, but is there a way to potentially make the text bigger in the early literacy and leading now sections or is it just not going to happen?

44
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:18,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what, it automatically makes it smaller to fit in the box.

45
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:19,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

46
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:19,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

47
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:20,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

48
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:25,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering, I guess we'll just, some of us anyway, probably not all of us will have to get our magnifying glasses out.

49
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too, too bad.

50
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have it in front of me.

51
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's good.

52
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:33,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe, and you're not able to add, oh, you are able to add text.

53
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you were able to add it in the boxes.

54
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:35,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

55
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:37,048
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um,

56
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:42,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevermind, I guess this could be part of our instructional sheet.

57
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:53,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, I think it'd be helpful for folks to know that, you know, following our goals identified by, you know, Medford Superintendent Maurice Edward, whatever.

58
00:04:53,902 --> 00:05:00,364
[SPEAKER_01]: So people aren't thinking that this is like part of the basic form, if you understand what I'm saying.

59
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:15,189
[SPEAKER_01]: But that could be in a sheet sharing a member Hayes, where it's the instruction piece so like if we, if we have a sheet that's just giving our colleagues instruction and it's just under superintendents performance goals.

60
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:24,252
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if we want to just let folks know that these are goals that have been previously identified by the superintendent and so that folks are not thinking that

61
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:28,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I could just interrupt, I think, you know, up here, it says it right down.

62
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it does say, I'm reading that.

63
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's only so many ways we can really kind of hammer it home.

64
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is.

65
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:39,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, is there anything that identifies this as Medford, though?

66
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:40,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's what I'm wondering.

67
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:46,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this could be anybody's, I mean- No, we do put the name of the superintendent.

68
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:46,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

69
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,653
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

70
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:48,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

71
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:48,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

72
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

73
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:50,594
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

74
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe Medford Public Schools or something.

75
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So, cause you know- I can't change the form itself.

76
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:58,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't put in a line that says Medford Public Schools.

77
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:05,539
[SPEAKER_01]: After Dr. Edward Vincent, that next line there, can you put, nope, up top, go back up where it said Dr. Edward Vincent.

78
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,420
[SPEAKER_01]: After her, the next line, can you put Medford Public Schools?

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,521
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way to add to the form.

80
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:16,796
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way to add that kind of stuff to the basic form.

81
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Hayes, I'm not asking you to add something.

82
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:21,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking you to put text in the box.

83
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:28,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So after where it says superintendent, there's another line, not under evaluator, but to the right.

84
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:28,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

85
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:29,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you add text there yet?

86
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:30,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you put Medford public schools in there?

87
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:31,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

88
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that is supposed to be the space for her to sign.

89
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,520
[SPEAKER_01]: That's signature.

90
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's her.

91
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:37,761
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I didn't need this.

92
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, why is it going to need might be signature.

93
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:54,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm just, it's probably just, I'm just picking on little things but I think it's important, and one of the things I try to do best practice and my own stuff at work that I always try to use page numbers and identify what the document actually is and where it's from so that

94
00:06:54,748 --> 00:07:07,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Should somebody have to look at this later and not know was this one Dr. Edwin Vincent was the superintendent of this school district or another school district or what have you so I just like to make it as basic as possible but maybe I'm just being a little too.

95
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:13,380
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something I'm thinking about that, but let me let the superintendent speak.

96
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: She has her hand raised.

97
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:27,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was going to suggest maybe just after my name, if you're able to put a comma, I know it will make the font get smaller, but maybe if Medford could fit right there, comma Medford, if that could be a compromise.

98
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:30,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We can.

99
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, absolutely, we can.

100
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,513
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason not to.

101
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:35,254
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't going to go.

102
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:39,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the thing is this is going to be live on our website.

103
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:43,706
[SPEAKER_04]: and go to the DESI from us.

104
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:48,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if there's anywhere else it's going to be that people wouldn't know what it's for.

105
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:49,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure it's letting me go any further.

106
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not letting me go any further.

107
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:53,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a suggestion.

108
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:53,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

109
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:54,514
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

110
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:59,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can look and see if there's something.

111
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:06,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a tech wizard with this, but it doesn't look like you can add that much to it.

112
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:09,267
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, the next step for us, of course,

113
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:20,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, to identify, after all of this is said and done, how it lives on our website, on the Medford Public Schools website, so that the community has access to it.

114
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:25,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other?

115
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:29,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, two participants raising their hand.

116
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:33,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my hand raised.

117
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:34,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that's it.

118
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's both you and the superintendent.

119
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

120
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:38,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

121
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another question.

122
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Superintendent, did you have a question as well or do you need to learn.

123
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was lowering my hand right now.

124
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:52,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so no member he's just going back to the highlighted pieces, so thank you for entertaining the Medford piece and I do think that

125
00:08:52,782 --> 00:09:06,565
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, yeah, this form's not necessarily going anywhere other than our website, but it will go into a DESI file somewhere and who knows, you know, some time from now, you know, Dr. Edward Vincent gets famous or something and people are trying to figure out when, you know, this evaluation was or where it was or whatever.

126
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:12,727
[SPEAKER_01]: People know that it's Medford, just a, again, a little picky thing for me, but I like page numbers and as much explained as possible.

127
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,488
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do like the fact that these are highlighted.

128
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:16,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.

129
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:17,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's great.

130
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that will be helpful.

131
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:35,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if we're just doing after this, I'm assuming a one-page sheet of instruction for our colleagues, although I think it's pretty self-explanatory, but I think it would be helpful to have just a brief explanation as well.

132
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:35,953
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?

133
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I had sent that piece with this too last night when I sent

134
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:53,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I did make some instructions which I can show, I can share that screen too, or I don't know if anyone else has any comments on the actual form, the highlighting, or anything else.

135
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

136
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:56,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

137
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:58,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any comments.

138
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:58,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Thumbs up.

139
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:02,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got and reviewed the instructions as well.

140
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:03,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I did get them.

141
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,508
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so let me share that then.

142
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can take a look at that if there's no other.

143
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did it come right, is it already up?

144
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:12,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that work?

145
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,578
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're still looking at the evaluation.

146
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:16,718
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still looking, okay.

147
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:24,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you share the screen, if you only share the one, yeah, there you go.

148
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:26,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop sharing on that one and then open another one.

149
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, that's still in.

150
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:33,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, technical issues.

151
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, take your time.

152
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:36,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

153
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,253
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there we go.

154
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:54,955
[SPEAKER_03]: There, did that work?

155
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:55,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

156
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:57,496
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

157
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:05,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can scroll down after you read.

158
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,300
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember Graham said she already got a chance to look at them.

159
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,081
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if she already has some thoughts.

160
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:15,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Tried to be as specific as I could, but it's hard to always anticipate.

161
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it looked great.

162
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:17,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any questions.

163
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:17,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

164
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:26,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were some places just so where I mentioned the materials they would need.

165
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:35,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have those all in a folder, so I figured I could send them so everybody has everything they need in hand.

166
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:47,365
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have, of course, the self-evaluation yet, but I can take that and make sure that gets attached to the email too, just so people aren't trying to look around for the things they need to be able to fill out the evaluation.

167
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the materials needed added.

168
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:50,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

169
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:58,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just again at the heading member Hayes, I would recommend having it as superintendent summit of evaluation.

170
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:09,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Spell it right.

171
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:19,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it looks good.

172
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:20,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

173
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:23,255
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

174
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:29,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't scroll all the way down, Melanie, for you to see.

175
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:40,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know when to scroll.

176
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:42,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, scroll again, please.

177
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:53,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going back up to the, I just wanted to make a, on the comments, comments are required further up.

178
00:12:54,351 --> 00:13:03,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I think where it said comments, every, you know, the evaluation process is really helpful when we have comments, each member should be putting in comments or whatever.

179
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we talked about how those comments are going to be conveyed or is that part of what we're going to talk about next?

180
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:15,348
[SPEAKER_04]: When we do the, you mean when we create the compiled?

181
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:15,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

182
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an explanation in here about what happens with those?

183
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:23,496
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because we haven't actually talked about that as a group yet.

184
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:24,258
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

185
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:26,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that on the agenda for today, or is that another meeting?

186
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, we didn't really put that in as a specific topic.

187
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:32,526
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not on for today.

188
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:37,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have evaluation subcommittee compiles individual ratings and draft summative evaluation.

189
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,213
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so it's number five, we draft something.

190
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not specific.

191
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:41,615
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.

192
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:43,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I think maybe I would add.

193
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:49,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So my suggestion to the to the subcommittee would be to add

194
00:13:51,008 --> 00:14:05,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can come up with some process now is like either five day or something like that, that says, you know, how will we, how are we going to condense comments that are inclusive.

195
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:13,764
[SPEAKER_01]: and a narrative, what that process will be, or are we just gonna dump comments?

196
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are we just gonna cut and paste comments?

197
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:18,186
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I guess I'm asking, what folks think.

198
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that can be 5A of this so that people know.

199
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:29,810
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the other thing about the comments is that one of the things that we talked about is that this is an overall committee evaluation.

200
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people, one of the other instructions we might wanna include is that when people are putting comments in,

201
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,395
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps to not make them personal and not use first person.

202
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:45,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, I really think Maurice did, you know, Dr. Edwin Vincent did this right or whatever.

203
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:55,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that like that was problematic, particularly in the past, because when you are marrying those comments, like one member may feel that way, but another one may not.

204
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we addressing that?

205
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:00,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, there are definitely pieces of that.

206
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.

207
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you guys want to, I just am raising it.

208
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:08,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to hear some feedback about it.

209
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:19,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that it is part of the agenda today because it is number five, but essentially it's a 5A that we're adding, we would be adding to this process of what, how are we drafting the summative evaluation?

210
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:25,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly, drafting ratings are not difficult, right?

211
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we're doing,

212
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:52,910
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever, you know, exemplary needs improvement, whatever, in each of those items, we already have categories that are not subjective, but the comment piece is going to be potentially more so and might need to be, I don't think curated is the right word, but wordsmithed or something.

213
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,672
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I defer to you, to the rest of the subcommittee to see what you guys have to say.

214
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:11,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So my one thought would be in terms of the one piece you said about talking about how to word, not using the I statements.

215
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:31,250
[SPEAKER_04]: While I agree with that, I think at some point, I guess personally I feel like if we start getting too directive about how you should word your comments, there's a part of me that feels like we're, you know, being a little, not trusting the professionalism of our colleagues in a way.

216
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:33,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

217
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recall there being specific I statements or I don't.

218
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

219
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:44,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's just my feeling is I feel like at some point we start to get a little too.

220
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:51,957
[SPEAKER_04]: intervening too much, maybe, in how a particular member chooses to word their comments?

221
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:53,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

222
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:54,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

223
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:01,103
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, I was just going to say, it's not so much how a particular member chooses to word their comments.

224
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,646
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that when we're doing the summative, you cannot use the I statements, right?

225
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,248
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're doing summative comments, right,

226
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:13,618
[SPEAKER_01]: how are we summarizing comments on all of the different categories?

227
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:37,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if a school committee member says, you know, you know, did great with instructional leadership or whatever, and another school committee member says, or writes in comments, you know, I think, you know, instructional leadership needs improvement and, you know, here's why and whatever, we're not necessarily gonna use the I think piece in there, but we're gonna have to, you know,

228
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:43,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume include those comments in some narrative that is cohesive.

229
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm asking what that process is going to be.

230
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:51,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not typically writing in the first person when we're doing it as a whole committee in terms of comments.

231
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about that, how are we doing this?

232
00:17:54,928 --> 00:18:03,431
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was an issue last time because I remember clearly that was a discussion that we had because when we were seeing the summary narrative, when we were seeing

233
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:18,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Qualitative data, it wasn't cohesive and it wasn't a narrative because it was littered with individual statements instead of an overall comment.

234
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:31,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the question is, how does the whole committee summarize or does the subcommittee summarize the comments giving the whole committee copies of the individual comments?

235
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:32,635
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm asking.

236
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:40,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So in looking at other cities and towns, I've seen it done any number of ways.

237
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:50,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen ones where they just dumped members' comments in, obviously not all of them, but they dumped some comments in.

238
00:18:50,544 --> 00:19:04,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Other ones where they created, and it was whoever, whether it was the chairperson of the committee who was the one doing the final composite, or whether it was a subcommittee like us that we're doing,

239
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:11,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen ones where they did create just a narrative based on the comments.

240
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:13,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So really we could go either way.

241
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:19,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the intention is that the subcommittee is going to do that, that we're going to be the ones to create the composite.

242
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:34,468
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, then we take it back to the full committee and they have their opportunity to comment on and change any, if they feel like we've miscommunicated something or if we use their comments and they felt like, well, that wasn't a comment that

243
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:55,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to put in, I don't know, I was trying to think at one point whether we could put in the instructions somewhere in here that if there's a particular comment that someone feels is, one of their comments that they feel is most important, that they'd like to have included, that we could put in there that they should highlight that for us somehow.

244
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know how do others feel about that.

245
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:01,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out.

246
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Or may I, member?

247
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:03,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

248
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:17,183
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm trying to figure out is like, are we doing a, you know, a total text dump where everybody's comments get put in to the overall evaluation or are we summarizing the comments?

249
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:24,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we're summarizing the comments, you know, I think the subcommittee has the, you know, can do that.

250
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:27,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's part of what, you know, has been suggested.

251
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the overall committee obviously reviews and approves, but,

252
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:52,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that we need to be clear on what that process is as a subcommittee before we do it and then we also need to schedule time to be able to do that because I did feel like, and especially for asking people to make comments explicitly which is what this form is doing to please add comments which you know in the past some people have and some

253
00:20:52,707 --> 00:21:18,434
[SPEAKER_01]: more people some people did more and other people did less and some people may have done little or none so um which doesn't i guess doesn't matter either way but just knowing that we have a process and so i guess i'm leaning towards i would be leaning towards creating a narrative um that would be inclusive um where we can refer and we already said that we were going to have the original individual

254
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,343
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluations as part of the packet as well.

255
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:27,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So people could refer to it, but I think that we're entirely capable of making a narrative of the comments.

256
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:36,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to be clear that that's what we're doing, or if that's not what we're doing, that we're explicitly cutting and pasting.

257
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:37,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

258
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham?

259
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:47,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should take the approach of, for each of the, whatever it is, like three or four things, say,

260
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:51,819
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, representative comments include.

261
00:21:52,059 --> 00:22:02,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just a couple of bullets where we're taking like verbatim what various members said, because we're going to send everybody, everybody's like detailed comments.

262
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:16,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if we did that, we would have an opportunity to like, you know, truly like pick like the gamut of feedback without saying the same thing three times.

263
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:18,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So if three people say,

264
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:22,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that the superintendent did this very specific thing.

265
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:25,968
[SPEAKER_02]: We just put that once and move on.

266
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:39,918
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think maybe a little bit of culling that we would do, but otherwise, I would frame it as comments from the committee include and just leave that like that.

267
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:43,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying a narrative plus the comments, so we would do the narrative?

268
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:44,061
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

269
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:45,802
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just the comments?

270
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: That is how I would frame the narrative.

271
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:50,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Is my audio better?

272
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,028
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a little echoey.

273
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:55,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

274
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,410
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

275
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable, though.

276
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:58,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the same thing as the other night.

277
00:22:58,712 --> 00:22:59,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's going on.

278
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's a speaker or something else, a phone or something in your room.

279
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:05,078
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely echoey.

280
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It only happens in full committee meetings.

281
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:10,242
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

282
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:17,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we're looking at just including, saying we'll include representative comments.

283
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, superintendent.

284
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:37,070
[SPEAKER_01]: If I understood correctly, member Hayes, what I heard member Graham say was that following our representative comments of the evaluation or whatever, and then I think being as inclusive as possible.

285
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:45,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm OK with sort of it's like an in-between for both and not necessarily having to create a narrative.

286
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:50,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And like member Graham was saying, there are a lot of times when the same comment is repeated throughout.

287
00:23:50,780 --> 00:24:02,466
[SPEAKER_01]: several members, I just, I think that it's going to be a little bit more challenging if there are very disparate comments, but we can still say like what member Graham was saying, these are representative comments.

288
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So one might be this and the other might be that.

289
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're representing both.

290
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:17,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the value of, of not trying to create something completely independent of

291
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:23,200
[SPEAKER_02]: What the comments are, because then you can say, you know, these are representative comments.

292
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, maybe each of us can take.

293
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:33,685
[SPEAKER_02]: 1, 1 or 2 or whatever, and, you know, when we have a meeting schedule, so we can each take 1 or 2.

294
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:37,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what we think is the consolidation and then we have something to review.

295
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a good plan superintendent.

296
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,371
[SPEAKER_04]: You had your hand raised at 1 point.

297
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:43,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you.

298
00:24:44,217 --> 00:25:01,521
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just was gonna agree and say that I thought that that was a very beautiful compromise to everyone's gonna submit their individual evaluations and just to compile it, the representative comments and just have it bulleted.

299
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:09,743
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's whoever the final person is, it makes it a lot simpler and then it's just bulleted.

300
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So it represents what everyone said.

301
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:14,887
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

302
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:18,009
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's, that's all I was agreeing there.

303
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:20,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you needed to type that.

304
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking maybe put it in here.

305
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:28,572
[SPEAKER_04]: The subcommittee.

306
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say select representative comments for the final evaluation.

307
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:45,997
[SPEAKER_01]: That works for me.

308
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:48,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to double check on the next meeting to make sure it's in my calendar.

309
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it is.

310
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,320
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is the date?

311
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys know?

312
00:25:52,822 --> 00:26:01,107
[SPEAKER_00]: May 8 is the subcommittee where I'll be presenting with with artifacts and links.

313
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be presenting to you.

314
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:05,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean this that that's the cow?

315
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,311
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cow.

316
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:07,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?

317
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:10,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there another I don't think there's another subcommittee on the 22nd.

318
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:10,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

319
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:13,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

320
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:19,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So the members are, the deadline for them to return to us, which, oh, I'll have to put that in there too.

321
00:26:19,272 --> 00:26:20,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it in my calendar, it's good.

322
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the deadline should be on there for when they return it, that's right.

323
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thinking, Member Hayes.

324
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

325
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:33,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting this to them for this Monday, or are we waiting until the Monday of the 8th?

326
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:40,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we had it that we would give it to them and talk about it on the 8th as part of that meeting.

327
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense, okay.

328
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:46,282
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I will add individuals rate.

329
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:55,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to think of the best place to add that date.

330
00:26:58,348 --> 00:26:59,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put it right there.

331
00:26:59,149 --> 00:26:59,909
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

332
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,631
[SPEAKER_02]: They rate individual overall performance by the state.

333
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:08,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put it right in the header of number four.

334
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:09,814
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

335
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also highlight it.

336
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,462
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, make it really clear.

337
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Individual.

338
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:17,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

339
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:26,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Evaluations.

340
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:34,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll fix the spelling are due to the subcommittee

341
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:41,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think they should send it to this subcommittee I would say to member Hayes.

342
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:41,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

343
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:46,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sending it to all three of us could be an issue.

344
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:51,110
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody responds so by May 21.

345
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there we go.

346
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:11,044
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

347
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:17,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's what we have on the agenda.

348
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:24,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else, any other comments on either the form or the instructions?

349
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you for doing this.

350
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:39,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was really helpful and I think sets out a good process moving forward and is pretty self-explanatory and appreciate the work that you did on that.

351
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:39,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

352
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:40,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

353
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll see.

354
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:44,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

355
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:49,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve and place this on the May 15th agenda.

356
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:50,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

357
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:51,274
[SPEAKER_02]: For school committee approval.

358
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:54,155
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

359
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:54,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

360
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll call, member Hayes.

361
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:56,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, okay.

362
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:57,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so.

363
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:58,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Question.

364
00:28:58,877 --> 00:28:59,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Since.

365
00:28:59,717 --> 00:28:59,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

366
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:01,398
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

367
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,800
[SPEAKER_00]: On the May 1st agenda, we do have the minutes.

368
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:15,113
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, we have it because on May 8th is the meeting that I'll be presenting to you.

369
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:25,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think May 8th is where if the committee approves this, they would need to approve it by the 1st in order for you to use it on the 8th.

370
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct or not correct?

371
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:30,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it?

372
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:31,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

373
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:38,869
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's already on the agenda for Monday at the minutes to be approved for this meeting is listed.

374
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd be able to report out on it on Monday.

375
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:49,674
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will have to, we will have to make a motion to approve this process on Monday as well.

376
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:55,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you can you make an update to the agenda to put a motion to approve?

377
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,910
[SPEAKER_02]: under the subcommittee report.

378
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:01,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

379
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,531
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can make motions on the floor.

380
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what you're saying, that it is a motion.

381
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:12,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it should be noticed that we are going to vote on this.

382
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it's on the agenda.

383
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Approving the minutes is on the agenda.

384
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:24,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, approving the minutes.

385
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's different.

386
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:32,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Voting on the evaluation process could be part, yeah, would need to be part of the agenda.

387
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So motion to approve the- Motion to amend.

388
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:42,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sure.

389
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:46,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we didn't vote on it, so I'm withdrawing my motion.

390
00:30:46,422 --> 00:30:47,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, motion to approve.

391
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So- Second.

392
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:50,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

393
00:30:54,968 --> 00:31:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: the evaluation process and instructions and place on the May 1st school committee agenda for committee approval.

394
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:09,354
[SPEAKER_01]: For committee consideration, right?

395
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:10,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they can't approve.

396
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:14,556
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't say, yeah, they're either gonna approve or disapprove, but for yeah, committee vote.

397
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for committee vote, not approval.

398
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I would second that with the amendment.

399
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,783
[SPEAKER_01]: for committee consideration.

400
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:28,307
[SPEAKER_00]: So under new business, or would you like it under the approval of the minutes?

401
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:33,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you like me to have it added so we can work on that immediately?

402
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put it under the minutes.

403
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:41,095
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, motion to approve superintendent evaluation instructions and process.

404
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:42,055
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

405
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, Member Graham.

406
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you're right.

407
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they approving the template too?

408
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So template, instructions, and process.

409
00:31:52,372 --> 00:31:53,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Instructions and process, yeah.

410
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:54,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

411
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:57,514
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I should take a roll call vote just to make it official.

412
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:02,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say again what you're, just so we have it out there, Jenny?

413

[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve the template and process and place on the May 1st school committee agenda for consideration.
