00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:07,654
Dial in number is 1-301-715-8592.

2
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:21,739
Additionally, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing shays, that's s-h-a-y-s, at medford.k12.ma.us.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,221
Those submitting questions or comments must include the following information.

4
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,582
Your first and last name.

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,751
your Medford Street address, and your question or comment.

6
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:45,413
As approved by the committee on February 1st, 2023, the evaluation subcommittee will meet to review and develop the process for the 2022-23 superintendent evaluation.

7
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:57,356
Today's agenda, as approved by the evaluation subcommittee on Thursday, February 16th, 2023, the evaluation subcommittee will meet to finalize the template design and instructions.

8
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:13,822
So at our last meeting, we determined that we would, this year anyway, try using the evaluation tool that DESE provides.

9
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:15,563
And we looked through it.

10
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:29,752
And one of the concerns was that on some of the pages, the information is kind of wordy and knowing for the members to know specifically on the standards which

11
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:35,663
indicators we've chosen as the focus indicators, and I will share my screen in a minute to show everyone.

12
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:50,956
But there was a question of whether that might be difficult to see, so that we wanted to look at highlighting those, the focus indicators that we've selected this year, so that it was just really clear which ones people should be rating.

13
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:56,922
So I did that, and I will attempt to share my screen.

14
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,327
All right, can everyone see that?

15
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:16,869
Okay, so it's further down.

16
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:22,251
I did fill in also, just so we could see what it would look like when we actually send it to the members.

17
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:27,953
I filled in the superintendent's goals on this page here.

18
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,842
and the focus indicators that went, that we selected to go with each of those goals.

19
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,985
And then the, there's the highlighting.

20
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,748
So I highlighted on these pages the selected indicators.

21
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,369
So there's the ones for instructional leadership.

22
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,753
And then the one for management and operations.

23
00:02:57,963 --> 00:03:01,425
And family and community engagement, there were three.

24
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:08,027
And professional culture, three more.

25
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:10,268
I think that's it.

26
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,709
Yes, that's enough.

27
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,509
That's it.

28
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:21,113
So I had just emailed these to everyone last, just last night, I think.

29
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:24,414
So I don't know if anyone has any thoughts, comments.

30
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,375
Does that seem to work better?

31
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,850
to have them highlighted.

32
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:34,552
Melanie, member McLaughlin, sorry.

33
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,252
Excuse me, member McLaughlin.

34
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:51,836
I think the highlights are super helpful, thank you, but I wanted to know if you could go back up to the top and show me, I wasn't quite getting where you were saying you would put in the superintendent's information on the indicators, so if maybe you could.

35
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:54,497
On the goals, I filled in the goals here.

36
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:55,605
Okay.

37
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:55,965
Oh yeah.

38
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:59,407
So all of that information there is from the superintendent is what you're saying.

39
00:03:59,627 --> 00:03:59,887
Yes.

40
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:01,908
From her goals that she gave us.

41
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:02,248
Yep.

42
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:03,068
Okay.

43
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:15,253
And do you think, I mean, I don't know what it looks like printed out, but is there a way to potentially make the text bigger in the early literacy and leading now sections or is it just not going to happen?

44
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:18,534
Do you know what, it automatically makes it smaller to fit in the box.

45
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:19,174
Yeah.

46
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:19,955
Okay.

47
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:20,515
Yeah.

48
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:25,379
I was just wondering, I guess we'll just, some of us anyway, probably not all of us will have to get our magnifying glasses out.

49
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,720
It's not too, too bad.

50
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,961
I do have it in front of me.

51
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,142
Yeah, no, that's good.

52
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:33,685
And then maybe, and you're not able to add, oh, you are able to add text.

53
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,326
Cause you were able to add it in the boxes.

54
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:35,707
Right.

55
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:37,048
So, um,

56
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:42,237
Nevermind, I guess this could be part of our instructional sheet.

57
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:53,882
I was just going to say, I think it'd be helpful for folks to know that, you know, following our goals identified by, you know, Medford Superintendent Maurice Edward, whatever.

58
00:04:53,902 --> 00:05:00,364
So people aren't thinking that this is like part of the basic form, if you understand what I'm saying.

59
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:15,189
But that could be in a sheet sharing a member Hayes, where it's the instruction piece so like if we, if we have a sheet that's just giving our colleagues instruction and it's just under superintendents performance goals.

60
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:24,252
You know if we want to just let folks know that these are goals that have been previously identified by the superintendent and so that folks are not thinking that

61
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:28,296
So if I could just interrupt, I think, you know, up here, it says it right down.

62
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,059
I know, it does say, I'm reading that.

63
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,424
I mean, I think there's only so many ways we can really kind of hammer it home.

64
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,405
I mean, this is.

65
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:39,372
Yeah, I mean, is there anything that identifies this as Medford, though?

66
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:40,594
Like, that's what I'm wondering.

67
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:46,632
Cause this could be anybody's, I mean- No, we do put the name of the superintendent.

68
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:46,912
Okay.

69
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,653
All right.

70
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:48,313
Yeah.

71
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:48,913
Yeah.

72
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,153
Good.

73
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:50,594
All right.

74
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,635
And maybe Medford Public Schools or something.

75
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,736
So, cause you know- I can't change the form itself.

76
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:58,797
So I can't put in a line that says Medford Public Schools.

77
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:05,539
After Dr. Edward Vincent, that next line there, can you put, nope, up top, go back up where it said Dr. Edward Vincent.

78
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,420
After her, the next line, can you put Medford Public Schools?

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,521
There's no way to add to the form.

80
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:16,796
There's no way to add that kind of stuff to the basic form.

81
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,378
Member Hayes, I'm not asking you to add something.

82
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:21,959
I'm asking you to put text in the box.

83
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:28,083
So after where it says superintendent, there's another line, not under evaluator, but to the right.

84
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:28,363
Yeah.

85
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:29,324
Can you add text there yet?

86
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:30,825
Could you put Medford public schools in there?

87
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:31,726
Yeah.

88
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,727
I mean, that is supposed to be the space for her to sign.

89
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,520
That's signature.

90
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,061
Oh, that's her.

91
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:37,761
No, I think I didn't need this.

92
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,862
Okay, why is it going to need might be signature.

93
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:54,168
Anyway, I'm just, it's probably just, I'm just picking on little things but I think it's important, and one of the things I try to do best practice and my own stuff at work that I always try to use page numbers and identify what the document actually is and where it's from so that

94
00:06:54,748 --> 00:07:07,066
Should somebody have to look at this later and not know was this one Dr. Edwin Vincent was the superintendent of this school district or another school district or what have you so I just like to make it as basic as possible but maybe I'm just being a little too.

95
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:13,380
There's something I'm thinking about that, but let me let the superintendent speak.

96
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,381
She has her hand raised.

97
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:27,829
I just was going to suggest maybe just after my name, if you're able to put a comma, I know it will make the font get smaller, but maybe if Medford could fit right there, comma Medford, if that could be a compromise.

98
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:30,531
We can.

99
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,352
I mean, absolutely, we can.

100
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,513
There's no reason not to.

101
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:35,254
This isn't going to go.

102
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:39,717
I think the thing is this is going to be live on our website.

103
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:43,706
and go to the DESI from us.

104
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:48,209
So I don't know if there's anywhere else it's going to be that people wouldn't know what it's for.

105
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:49,871
I'm not sure it's letting me go any further.

106
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,452
It's not letting me go any further.

107
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:53,233
Just a suggestion.

108
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:53,914
Yeah.

109
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:54,514
No, thank you.

110
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:59,138
I mean, I can look and see if there's something.

111
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:06,044
I'm not a tech wizard with this, but it doesn't look like you can add that much to it.

112
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:09,267
But I mean, the next step for us, of course,

113
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:20,268
I guess, to identify, after all of this is said and done, how it lives on our website, on the Medford Public Schools website, so that the community has access to it.

114
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:25,812
Any other?

115
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:29,094
Let's see, two participants raising their hand.

116
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:33,824
I have my hand raised.

117
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:34,545
I don't know that's it.

118
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,327
I think it's both you and the superintendent.

119
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,608
Yeah.

120
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:38,449
I do.

121
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,169
I had another question.

122
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,272
Superintendent, did you have a question as well or do you need to learn.

123
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,214
I just was lowering my hand right now.

124
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:52,402
Okay, so no member he's just going back to the highlighted pieces, so thank you for entertaining the Medford piece and I do think that

125
00:08:52,782 --> 00:09:06,565
you know, yeah, this form's not necessarily going anywhere other than our website, but it will go into a DESI file somewhere and who knows, you know, some time from now, you know, Dr. Edward Vincent gets famous or something and people are trying to figure out when, you know, this evaluation was or where it was or whatever.

126
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:12,727
People know that it's Medford, just a, again, a little picky thing for me, but I like page numbers and as much explained as possible.

127
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,488
But I do like the fact that these are highlighted.

128
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:16,648
So thank you very much.

129
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:17,808
I think that's great.

130
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,029
And I think that will be helpful.

131
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:35,352
And I think that if we're just doing after this, I'm assuming a one-page sheet of instruction for our colleagues, although I think it's pretty self-explanatory, but I think it would be helpful to have just a brief explanation as well.

132
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:35,953
What do you think?

133
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,474
I had sent that piece with this too last night when I sent

134
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:53,540
I did make some instructions which I can show, I can share that screen too, or I don't know if anyone else has any comments on the actual form, the highlighting, or anything else.

135
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,361
Member Graham?

136
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:56,982
Oh.

137
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:58,082
I don't have any comments.

138
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:58,503
Thumbs up.

139
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:02,385
Yeah, I got and reviewed the instructions as well.

140
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:03,385
So yeah, I did get them.

141
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,508
OK, so let me share that then.

142
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,629
And we can take a look at that if there's no other.

143
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,875
Oh, did it come right, is it already up?

144
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:12,476
Did that work?

145
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:15,578
No, we're still looking at the evaluation.

146
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:16,718
You're still looking, okay.

147
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:24,264
Sometimes when you share the screen, if you only share the one, yeah, there you go.

148
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:26,065
Stop sharing on that one and then open another one.

149
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,146
Wait a minute, that's still in.

150
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:33,310
Sorry, technical issues.

151
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,851
Fine, take your time.

152
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:36,712
Thank you.

153
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,253
All right, there we go.

154
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:54,955
There, did that work?

155
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:55,916
Yes.

156
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:57,496
OK.

157
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:05,179
So I can scroll down after you read.

158
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,300
And I remember Graham said she already got a chance to look at them.

159
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,081
So I don't know if she already has some thoughts.

160
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:15,363
Tried to be as specific as I could, but it's hard to always anticipate.

161
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,003
I thought it looked great.

162
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:17,044
I don't have any questions.

163
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:17,704
Oh, OK.

164
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:26,136
And there were some places just so where I mentioned the materials they would need.

165
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:35,220
And I have those all in a folder, so I figured I could send them so everybody has everything they need in hand.

166
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:47,365
We don't have, of course, the self-evaluation yet, but I can take that and make sure that gets attached to the email too, just so people aren't trying to look around for the things they need to be able to fill out the evaluation.

167
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,091
Yeah, I love the materials needed added.

168
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:50,472
Thank you.

169
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:58,018
I would just again at the heading member Hayes, I would recommend having it as superintendent summit of evaluation.

170
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:09,947
Spell it right.

171
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:19,993
Yeah, I think it looks good.

172
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:20,434
Thank you.

173
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:23,255
All right.

174
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:29,497
Oh, I didn't scroll all the way down, Melanie, for you to see.

175
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:40,402
Let me know when to scroll.

176
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:42,403
Yeah, scroll again, please.

177
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:53,370
Just going back up to the, I just wanted to make a, on the comments, comments are required further up.

178
00:12:54,351 --> 00:13:03,098
I think where it said comments, every, you know, the evaluation process is really helpful when we have comments, each member should be putting in comments or whatever.

179
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,924
Have we talked about how those comments are going to be conveyed or is that part of what we're going to talk about next?

180
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:15,348
When we do the, you mean when we create the compiled?

181
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:15,949
Yeah.

182
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,190
Is there an explanation in here about what happens with those?

183
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:23,496
No, because we haven't actually talked about that as a group yet.

184
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:24,258
OK.

185
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:26,603
And is that on the agenda for today, or is that another meeting?

186
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,305
Oh, you know, we didn't really put that in as a specific topic.

187
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:32,526
It's not on for today.

188
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:37,131
So we have evaluation subcommittee compiles individual ratings and draft summative evaluation.

189
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,213
No, so it's number five, we draft something.

190
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,614
Yeah, it's not specific.

191
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:41,615
It's not.

192
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:43,837
Yeah, but I think maybe I would add.

193
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:49,203
So my suggestion to the to the subcommittee would be to add

194
00:13:51,008 --> 00:14:05,662
Maybe we can come up with some process now is like either five day or something like that, that says, you know, how will we, how are we going to condense comments that are inclusive.

195
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:13,764
and a narrative, what that process will be, or are we just gonna dump comments?

196
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,005
Like, are we just gonna cut and paste comments?

197
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:18,186
That's what I guess I'm asking, what folks think.

198
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,367
Maybe that can be 5A of this so that people know.

199
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:29,810
You know, the other thing about the comments is that one of the things that we talked about is that this is an overall committee evaluation.

200
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,312
So when people, one of the other instructions we might wanna include is that when people are putting comments in,

201
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,395
perhaps to not make them personal and not use first person.

202
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:45,318
So in other words, I really think Maurice did, you know, Dr. Edwin Vincent did this right or whatever.

203
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:55,983
I'm not sure that like that was problematic, particularly in the past, because when you are marrying those comments, like one member may feel that way, but another one may not.

204
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,044
So how are we addressing that?

205
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:00,065
Like there's, there are definitely pieces of that.

206
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,246
So I don't know.

207
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,773
I don't know how you guys want to, I just am raising it.

208
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:08,094
So I would like to hear some feedback about it.

209
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:19,818
And I do think that it is part of the agenda today because it is number five, but essentially it's a 5A that we're adding, we would be adding to this process of what, how are we drafting the summative evaluation?

210
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:25,500
So clearly, drafting ratings are not difficult, right?

211
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,381
Because if we're doing,

212
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:52,910
you know, whatever, you know, exemplary needs improvement, whatever, in each of those items, we already have categories that are not subjective, but the comment piece is going to be potentially more so and might need to be, I don't think curated is the right word, but wordsmithed or something.

213
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,672
But again, I defer to you, to the rest of the subcommittee to see what you guys have to say.

214
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:11,920
So my one thought would be in terms of the one piece you said about talking about how to word, not using the I statements.

215
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:31,250
While I agree with that, I think at some point, I guess personally I feel like if we start getting too directive about how you should word your comments, there's a part of me that feels like we're, you know, being a little, not trusting the professionalism of our colleagues in a way.

216
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:33,790
I don't know.

217
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,657
I don't recall there being specific I statements or I don't.

218
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,961
I don't know.

219
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:44,366
I guess that's just my feeling is I feel like at some point we start to get a little too.

220
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:51,957
intervening too much, maybe, in how a particular member chooses to word their comments?

221
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:53,098
Yeah.

222
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:54,099
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:01,103
If I may, I was just going to say, it's not so much how a particular member chooses to word their comments.

224
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,646
It's that when we're doing the summative, you cannot use the I statements, right?

225
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,248
If we're doing summative comments, right,

226
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:13,618
how are we summarizing comments on all of the different categories?

227
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:37,842
And so if a school committee member says, you know, you know, did great with instructional leadership or whatever, and another school committee member says, or writes in comments, you know, I think, you know, instructional leadership needs improvement and, you know, here's why and whatever, we're not necessarily gonna use the I think piece in there, but we're gonna have to, you know,

228
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:43,545
I would assume include those comments in some narrative that is cohesive.

229
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,646
And so I'm asking what that process is going to be.

230
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:51,868
And so we're not typically writing in the first person when we're doing it as a whole committee in terms of comments.

231
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,888
So thinking about that, how are we doing this?

232
00:17:54,928 --> 00:18:03,431
And this was an issue last time because I remember clearly that was a discussion that we had because when we were seeing the summary narrative, when we were seeing

233
00:18:05,802 --> 00:18:18,808
Qualitative data, it wasn't cohesive and it wasn't a narrative because it was littered with individual statements instead of an overall comment.

234
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:31,314
So I guess the question is, how does the whole committee summarize or does the subcommittee summarize the comments giving the whole committee copies of the individual comments?

235
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:32,635
That's what I'm asking.

236
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:40,959
So in looking at other cities and towns, I've seen it done any number of ways.

237
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:50,183
I have seen ones where they just dumped members' comments in, obviously not all of them, but they dumped some comments in.

238
00:18:50,544 --> 00:19:04,230
Other ones where they created, and it was whoever, whether it was the chairperson of the committee who was the one doing the final composite, or whether it was a subcommittee like us that we're doing,

239
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:11,172
I've seen ones where they did create just a narrative based on the comments.

240
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:13,173
So really we could go either way.

241
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:19,377
And I think the intention is that the subcommittee is going to do that, that we're going to be the ones to create the composite.

242
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:34,468
But of course, then we take it back to the full committee and they have their opportunity to comment on and change any, if they feel like we've miscommunicated something or if we use their comments and they felt like, well, that wasn't a comment that

243
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:55,469
I wanted to put in, I don't know, I was trying to think at one point whether we could put in the instructions somewhere in here that if there's a particular comment that someone feels is, one of their comments that they feel is most important, that they'd like to have included, that we could put in there that they should highlight that for us somehow.

244
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,210
But I don't know how do others feel about that.

245
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:01,971
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out.

246
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,271
Or may I, member?

247
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:03,351
Yes.

248
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:17,183
So that's what I'm trying to figure out is like, are we doing a, you know, a total text dump where everybody's comments get put in to the overall evaluation or are we summarizing the comments?

249
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:24,748
And so if we're summarizing the comments, you know, I think the subcommittee has the, you know, can do that.

250
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:27,150
I think that's part of what, you know, has been suggested.

251
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,332
And I think the overall committee obviously reviews and approves, but,

252
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:52,287
I just think that we need to be clear on what that process is as a subcommittee before we do it and then we also need to schedule time to be able to do that because I did feel like, and especially for asking people to make comments explicitly which is what this form is doing to please add comments which you know in the past some people have and some

253
00:20:52,707 --> 00:21:18,434
more people some people did more and other people did less and some people may have done little or none so um which doesn't i guess doesn't matter either way but just knowing that we have a process and so i guess i'm leaning towards i would be leaning towards creating a narrative um that would be inclusive um where we can refer and we already said that we were going to have the original individual

254
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,343
evaluations as part of the packet as well.

255
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:27,525
So people could refer to it, but I think that we're entirely capable of making a narrative of the comments.

256
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:36,267
I just want to be clear that that's what we're doing, or if that's not what we're doing, that we're explicitly cutting and pasting.

257
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:37,627
Okay.

258
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,928
Member Graham?

259
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:47,970
I think we should take the approach of, for each of the, whatever it is, like three or four things, say,

260
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:51,819
you know, representative comments include.

261
00:21:52,059 --> 00:22:02,626
And then just a couple of bullets where we're taking like verbatim what various members said, because we're going to send everybody, everybody's like detailed comments.

262
00:22:03,026 --> 00:22:16,355
And I think if we did that, we would have an opportunity to like, you know, truly like pick like the gamut of feedback without saying the same thing three times.

263
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:18,677
So if three people say,

264
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:22,946
I really like that the superintendent did this very specific thing.

265
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:25,968
We just put that once and move on.

266
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:39,918
But I think maybe a little bit of culling that we would do, but otherwise, I would frame it as comments from the committee include and just leave that like that.

267
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:43,881
Are you saying a narrative plus the comments, so we would do the narrative?

268
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:44,061
No.

269
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:45,802
No, just the comments?

270
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,564
That is how I would frame the narrative.

271
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:50,566
Is my audio better?

272
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,028
You're a little echoey.

273
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:55,290
Oh.

274
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,410
OK.

275
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,210
Understandable, though.

276
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:58,632
I think it was the same thing as the other night.

277
00:22:58,712 --> 00:22:59,693
I don't know what's going on.

278
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,076
I don't know if it's a speaker or something else, a phone or something in your room.

279
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:05,078
But it's definitely echoey.

280
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,599
It only happens in full committee meetings.

281
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:10,242
All right.

282
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:17,868
So then we're looking at just including, saying we'll include representative comments.

283
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,641
Oh, superintendent.

284
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:37,070
If I understood correctly, member Hayes, what I heard member Graham say was that following our representative comments of the evaluation or whatever, and then I think being as inclusive as possible.

285
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:45,176
So yeah, I'm OK with sort of it's like an in-between for both and not necessarily having to create a narrative.

286
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:50,100
And like member Graham was saying, there are a lot of times when the same comment is repeated throughout.

287
00:23:50,780 --> 00:24:02,466
several members, I just, I think that it's going to be a little bit more challenging if there are very disparate comments, but we can still say like what member Graham was saying, these are representative comments.

288
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,928
So one might be this and the other might be that.

289
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,309
And so they're representing both.

290
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:17,955
I think that's the value of, of not trying to create something completely independent of

291
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:23,200
What the comments are, because then you can say, you know, these are representative comments.

292
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,141
And, you know, maybe each of us can take.

293
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:33,685
1, 1 or 2 or whatever, and, you know, when we have a meeting schedule, so we can each take 1 or 2.

294
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:37,788
Do what we think is the consolidation and then we have something to review.

295
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,890
Sounds like a good plan superintendent.

296
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,371
You had your hand raised at 1 point.

297
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:43,611
Are you.

298
00:24:44,217 --> 00:25:01,521
No, I just was gonna agree and say that I thought that that was a very beautiful compromise to everyone's gonna submit their individual evaluations and just to compile it, the representative comments and just have it bulleted.

299
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:09,743
So it's whoever the final person is, it makes it a lot simpler and then it's just bulleted.

300
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,723
So it represents what everyone said.

301
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:14,887
All right.

302
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:18,009
So that's, that's, that's all I was agreeing there.

303
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:20,089
I don't know if you needed to type that.

304
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,791
I'm thinking maybe put it in here.

305
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:28,572
The subcommittee.

306
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:38,256
Well, I would say select representative comments for the final evaluation.

307
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:45,997
That works for me.

308
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:48,739
I just want to double check on the next meeting to make sure it's in my calendar.

309
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,319
I'm sure it is.

310
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,320
But what is the date?

311
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,920
Do you guys know?

312
00:25:52,822 --> 00:26:01,107
May 8 is the subcommittee where I'll be presenting with with artifacts and links.

313
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,728
I'll be presenting to you.

314
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:05,070
Do you mean this that that's the cow?

315
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,311
That's the cow.

316
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:07,972
Right?

317
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:10,614
Is there another I don't think there's another subcommittee on the 22nd.

318
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:10,754
Yes.

319
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:13,451
Thank you.

320
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:19,252
So the members are, the deadline for them to return to us, which, oh, I'll have to put that in there too.

321
00:26:19,272 --> 00:26:20,433
I have it in my calendar, it's good.

322
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,293
Yeah, the deadline should be on there for when they return it, that's right.

323
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,954
Good thinking, Member Hayes.

324
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,274
Yeah.

325
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:33,876
And we're getting this to them for this Monday, or are we waiting until the Monday of the 8th?

326
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:40,357
I think we had it that we would give it to them and talk about it on the 8th as part of that meeting.

327
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,178
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense, okay.

328
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:46,282
All right, so I will add individuals rate.

329
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:55,287
Trying to think of the best place to add that date.

330
00:26:58,348 --> 00:26:59,129
I would put it right there.

331
00:26:59,149 --> 00:26:59,909
OK.

332
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,631
They rate individual overall performance by the state.

333
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:08,894
I would put it right in the header of number four.

334
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:09,814
OK.

335
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,475
I would also highlight it.

336
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,462
you know, make it really clear.

337
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,844
Individual.

338
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:17,145
Sorry.

339
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:26,053
Evaluations.

340
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:34,320
I'll fix the spelling are due to the subcommittee

341
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:41,020
Well, I don't think they should send it to this subcommittee I would say to member Hayes.

342
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:41,641
Okay.

343
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:46,265
Because sending it to all three of us could be an issue.

344
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:51,110
If anybody responds so by May 21.

345
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,570
Well, there we go.

346
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:11,044
All right.

347
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:17,210
So I think that's what we have on the agenda.

348
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:24,475
Is there anything else, any other comments on either the form or the instructions?

349
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,318
I just want to say thank you for doing this.

350
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:39,128
I thought this was really helpful and I think sets out a good process moving forward and is pretty self-explanatory and appreciate the work that you did on that.

351
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:39,528
Thank you.

352
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:40,770
Thank you.

353
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,151
Yeah, we'll see.

354
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:44,131
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

355
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:49,413
Motion to approve and place this on the May 15th agenda.

356
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:50,214
Second.

357
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:51,274
For school committee approval.

358
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:54,155
All right.

359
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:54,475
Second.

360
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,016
Roll call, member Hayes.

361
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:56,896
Yep, okay.

362
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:57,716
I mean, so.

363
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:58,017
Question.

364
00:28:58,877 --> 00:28:59,097
Since.

365
00:28:59,717 --> 00:28:59,977
Yes.

366
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:01,398
I apologize.

367
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,800
On the May 1st agenda, we do have the minutes.

368
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:15,113
For this, we have it because on May 8th is the meeting that I'll be presenting to you.

369
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:25,040
And I think May 8th is where if the committee approves this, they would need to approve it by the 1st in order for you to use it on the 8th.

370
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,542
Is that correct or not correct?

371
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:30,525
Was it?

372
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:31,446
Yes.

373
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:38,869
So it's it's already on the agenda for Monday at the minutes to be approved for this meeting is listed.

374
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,311
So you'd be able to report out on it on Monday.

375
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:49,674
But we will have to, we will have to make a motion to approve this process on Monday as well.

376
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:55,537
Can you can you make an update to the agenda to put a motion to approve?

377
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,910
under the subcommittee report.

378
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:01,530
Okay.

379
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,531
But we can make motions on the floor.

380
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,954
I'm not sure what you're saying, that it is a motion.

381
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:12,836
I just think it should be noticed that we are going to vote on this.

382
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,679
You said it's on the agenda.

383
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,021
Approving the minutes is on the agenda.

384
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:24,021
Oh, approving the minutes.

385
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,062
Yeah, no, that's different.

386
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:32,438
Voting on the evaluation process could be part, yeah, would need to be part of the agenda.

387
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,140
So motion to approve the- Motion to amend.

388
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:42,641
Well, sure.

389
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:46,062
Well, we didn't vote on it, so I'm withdrawing my motion.

390
00:30:46,422 --> 00:30:47,883
Okay, motion to approve.

391
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:49,123
So- Second.

392
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:50,203
Motion to approve.

393
00:30:54,968 --> 00:31:06,193
the evaluation process and instructions and place on the May 1st school committee agenda for committee approval.

394
00:31:06,793 --> 00:31:09,354
For committee consideration, right?

395
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:10,194
Because they can't approve.

396
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:14,556
We can't say, yeah, they're either gonna approve or disapprove, but for yeah, committee vote.

397
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,657
Yeah, for committee vote, not approval.

398
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,818
I would second that with the amendment.

399
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,783
for committee consideration.

400
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:28,307
So under new business, or would you like it under the approval of the minutes?

401
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:33,130
Where would you like me to have it added so we can work on that immediately?

402
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,191
I would put it under the minutes.

403
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:41,095
OK, motion to approve superintendent evaluation instructions and process.

404
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:42,055
OK.

405
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,077
I'm sorry, Member Graham.

406
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,818
Yes, you're right.

407
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,591
Are they approving the template too?

408
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,072
So template, instructions, and process.

409
00:31:52,372 --> 00:31:53,452
Instructions and process, yeah.

410
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:54,113
Okay.

411
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:57,514
All right, I should take a roll call vote just to make it official.

412
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:02,596
Can you say again what you're, just so we have it out there, Jenny?

413
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:15,162

Excellent, thank you.

Motion to adjourn.

Yes.
