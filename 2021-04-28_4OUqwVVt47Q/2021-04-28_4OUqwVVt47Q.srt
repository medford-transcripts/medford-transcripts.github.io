1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,489
[SPEAKER_05]: She did email the team, I believe.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,430
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just didn't see it.

4
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:08,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I've not been looking at my phone for that reason.

5
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:20,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Paulette, I just sent Paul a message to see if he happens to be available.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, because he might be particularly interested in this one.

7
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:23,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jenny.

8
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:24,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see here.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody else who needs to be here is here though.

11
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:35,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can at least begin by reading our general script.

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So please be advised that on Wednesday, April 28th,

13
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:49,413
[SPEAKER_05]: From four to 530 there will be a curriculum subcommittee meeting, which we held through remote participation via zoom.

14
00:00:50,133 --> 00:01:00,822
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of this meeting is to review science and fine arts curriculum in the Medford public schools pursuant to Governor bakers March 12 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law.

15
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:25,908
[SPEAKER_05]: chapter 30a paragraph 18 in the governor's march 15th 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place this meeting of the medford school committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible specific information in the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with the right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found in the city of medford

16
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,360
[SPEAKER_05]: website www.medfordmass.org.

17
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:36,224
[SPEAKER_05]: For this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by assessing the meeting length contained herein.

18
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:43,348
[SPEAKER_05]: No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately

19
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,318
[SPEAKER_05]: access the meetings in real time via technological means.

20
00:01:47,898 --> 00:02:00,861
[SPEAKER_05]: In the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

21
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:07,622
[SPEAKER_05]: The meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast Channel 22 and Verizon Channel 43 at 4 p.m.

22
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:14,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Using Zoom, the meeting ID number is 988-447-42816.

23
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,762
[SPEAKER_05]: A mobile number is 1-929-205-0699.

24
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:22,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Our agenda today is that we're going to begin with a review

25
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:39,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, today we're discussing both the science curriculum and the curriculum Fine Arts.

26
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:43,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know, perhaps Superintendent, would you like to start us off?

27
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:43,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

28
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:50,194
[SPEAKER_04]: So to start us off, we're going to start with Mr. Rocco Sieri, our Director of Science, who is going to

29
00:02:52,156 --> 00:03:02,746
[SPEAKER_04]: present what's happening in science K through 12 throughout the district and then following him, Dr. Riccadeli is going to present on fine arts.

30
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:10,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad to see we have some of our fine arts staff on the board at the meeting today as well.

31
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:12,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for joining both of you.

32
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to ask

33
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:25,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Seary to start his presentation, and I'll be monitoring the time so we can try to give equal time to each presentation.

34
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:26,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

35
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:33,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Superintendent, and good evening to everybody.

36
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:33,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Seary,

37
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:42,294
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am the director of science for our schools.

38
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:52,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I just want to conduct a review of where we are in the science curriculum at this point.

39
00:03:52,678 --> 00:04:01,681
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of predates the pandemic, but also goes through the pandemic and hopefully beyond the pandemic as we go through this information.

40
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:06,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it's informative and gives you a sense of where we're going to be.

41
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:12,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to attempt to screen share my presentation, the slide deck.

42
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:17,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have the power to do that, but if I have any particular problems.

43
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it looks like it shares, so I should be okay.

44
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

45
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

46
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be sharing a screen.

47
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:31,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

48
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,732
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up a presentation, which I'm hoping everyone can see.

49
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:40,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

50
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:46,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now just, okay, great.

51
00:04:48,839 --> 00:05:03,308
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outline of this presentation is to go very briefly and quickly through how the state organizes the frameworks and then how our district curriculum and district programs are selected.

52
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:18,988
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look specifically at our elementary and secondary grades and in some detail about how these different components take place and how they sort of dovetail with one another.

53
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:30,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I will review what we do for equity in science and then talk a little bit about the future goals and our next steps as we move forward into the upcoming school year.

54
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:49,086
[SPEAKER_00]: So without holding any additional pieces, the mass curriculum frameworks are based on the next generation science standards, which were devised by a group called Achieve Inc.

55
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:57,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And these standards were, I believe, developed in the, I would say, 2013.

56
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,851
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the mass framework was,

57
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,293
[SPEAKER_00]: it approved in 2016.

58
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:10,818
[SPEAKER_00]: That then became part of our district approved science curriculum.

59
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:18,944
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we work to adopt science programs from that particular document.

60
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:25,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the flow in which all the different district programs get selected.

61
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,674
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to sort of abide by the frameworks at the state level.

62
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:36,798
[SPEAKER_00]: and then incorporate those components into our district curriculum.

63
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:49,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So really quickly, a couple of things that you might want to know about the curriculum frameworks in Massachusetts for Science is that the content will vary by grade.

64
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:55,839
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the science and engineering technology practices stay the same for each grade band.

65
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:02,371
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you a little bit about what those are and how they stay sort of consistent.

66
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:13,877
[SPEAKER_00]: They are based, as I said, on the Next Generation Science Standards Initiative that was put together by a consortium of states several years ago.

67
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:20,242
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Massachusetts made their own version of it, and that was adopted in April of 2016.

68
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:25,366
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not tied to any particular science program.

69
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:27,507
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of there as a document

70
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:36,586
[SPEAKER_00]: support what we do in the classroom and hopefully as outcomes for our students across the state.

71
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:48,641
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things that changed from the previous framework to this framework is that there was a clear integration of science and engineering practices

72
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:55,328
[SPEAKER_00]: that the standards were written in grade by grade, K-8, rather than by grade bands.

73
00:07:55,929 --> 00:08:06,091
[SPEAKER_00]: You may recall in old standards, if you were looking at the documents, that they were written in grade bands K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and then 9-12.

74
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:07,471
[SPEAKER_00]: That has changed.

75
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:08,852
[SPEAKER_00]: They go grade by grade.

76
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:11,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So K has its specific standards.

77
00:08:11,953 --> 00:08:16,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade 1 has its specific standards, and all the way up through grade 8.

78
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:27,988
[SPEAKER_00]: At the high school level, they offer specific grade, sorry, specific subjects, and they give you the standards for each subject.

79
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:35,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that changed is that there is the application of science to engineering context.

80
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:38,694
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more around the design-based thinking.

81
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:50,879
[SPEAKER_00]: So once a student goes through some science content and what we'd like to see as the outcome is that they apply the science content to an engineering context.

82
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,202
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it runs through the entire curriculum framework.

83
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:00,176
[SPEAKER_00]: for all grade levels and all subject areas.

84
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:12,801
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth difference that is unique to Massachusetts is that technology engineering is a discipline equivalent to the traditional sciences.

85
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:13,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four

86
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:24,241
[SPEAKER_00]: disciplines, whereas across the, in the NGSS, you won't find that distinction.

87
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:28,083
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have technology engineering as a separate discipline.

88
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:41,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a sense of what that looks like, the four disciplines are earth and space science, physical science, life science, and technology engineering.

89
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:50,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And the highlight is really just to bring your attention to the fact that technology engineering is specific to Massachusetts.

90
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:54,798
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not found in the NGSS as a separate unit.

91
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,959
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unique to our state.

92
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:14,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an example of what technology engineering might look like, we've recently revived and rehabbed an area of the high school.

93
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:22,261
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the engineering lab, CTE program at the MHS, MVTHS complex.

94
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,147
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of is front-facing.

95
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:31,089
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a garage door that you might notice to the right of our building if you were looking at it.

96
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,170
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the engineering lab is located.

97
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,211
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the tools that are found in that lab.

98
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,511
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, they are completely updated.

99
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:47,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is a pretty unique program at the high school level that we have right in-house.

100
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:51,714
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they really mean when we talk about technology engineering.

101
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,500
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very hands-on kind of place.

102
00:10:57,301 --> 00:11:18,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And we certainly are meeting the expectations of the state in that particular area, both by combining it for the vocational technical school and the students that pursue CTE, but also for the kids K to eight that will eventually want to choose something like this.

103
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:21,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kinds of things that they,

104
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,371
[SPEAKER_00]: envision in the framework.

105
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:36,156
[SPEAKER_00]: So the science and engineering technology practices that I had spoken about, these are weaved throughout the document, K to 12 essentially.

106
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:46,720
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that these practices involve some basic things that you do in science, asking questions, or in engineering, you're defining a problem.

107
00:11:47,553 --> 00:12:01,252
[SPEAKER_00]: You're developing and using models, you're planning and carrying out investigations, you're analyzing and interpreting data using math and computational thinking, constructing explanations for science and designing solutions for engineering.

108
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:06,968
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging in argument from evidence and obtaining and evaluating and communicating information.

109
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:13,973
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really critical skills that we believe, you know, have an integral part in our curriculum program.

110
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:25,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at what we seek to offer to students, we really have to be very mindful of including these particular practices as we work through with our youngsters.

111
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:31,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna, you know,

112
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:39,048
[SPEAKER_00]: share with you what the MCAS science and technology engineering standards do.

113
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:44,249
[SPEAKER_00]: We administer the MCAS at grades five, eight, and the high school.

114
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:53,431
[SPEAKER_00]: At grade five, it's an integrated exam for all the science domains, earth, life, physical, and technology engineering.

115
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:54,791
[SPEAKER_00]: At grade eight, it's the same.

116
00:12:55,011 --> 00:13:00,912
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an integrated exam for all the science domains, earth, life, physical, and tech engineering.

117
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:10,556
[SPEAKER_00]: At the high school level, the exams become more high stakes for the students because the exam counts towards their competency determination for high school.

118
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,880
[SPEAKER_00]: It is subject specific.

119
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:17,584
[SPEAKER_00]: In years past, we've offered introductory physics and biology as an exam.

120
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:23,208
[SPEAKER_00]: We have moved to offering biology as the ninth grade course.

121
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:36,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all students at Medford High School and the vocational kids that choose the vocational CTE track start with biology in grade nine that began this year.

122
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students that are in ninth grade will take

123
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,228
[SPEAKER_00]: the biology MCAS in the spring.

124
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,472
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is for their competency determination for a high school diploma.

125
00:13:49,632 --> 00:14:01,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna make sure that we understand why that exists and how these exams play a part in the curriculum and what choices we're making moving forward.

126
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:08,883
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other reasons why biology was placed as the first year course that I'll describe a little bit later on.

127
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:19,038
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to access our courses, course syllabi, these have been all updated for our high school.

128
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,921
[SPEAKER_00]: They're subject-specific, biology, chemistry, and physics.

129
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:27,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Physics is still offered as an elective at the upper level.

130
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:34,891
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen our engineering, tech engineering lab as a CTE program at the high school at the CTE side.

131
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,233
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other options as well.

132
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:45,541
[SPEAKER_00]: such as environmental science, anatomy and physiology, exploring forensics, and the AP courses.

133
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:52,825
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I want to highlight the AP Physics C class, which is a calculus-based physics class.

134
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:59,169
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly rigorous class and it's worth two semesters of college credit.

135
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an eight credit

136
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:10,310
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to, you know, receive a qualifying score from university, you'd be getting two semesters worth of physics credit from that class.

137
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,893
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really unusual.

138
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,924
[SPEAKER_00]: a course to offer at the high school level.

139
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:24,526
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk to other directors in the state, usually they will offer just one part of the Physics C, which is the mechanics.

140
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:28,607
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe that's all they can get done in the year with a high school student.

141
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:34,449
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually offer the mechanics side and the E&M, which are two exams.

142
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:42,751
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students who take AP Physics C are really getting literally two college courses from participation.

143
00:15:43,551 --> 00:16:04,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but students who enjoy physics are getting a real boost and end up doing quite well as they move forward from our programs into either engineering courses or physics majors or science majors because of the course sequence that we offer there.

144
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:10,889
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, the other elective courses are equivalently robust.

145
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Anatomy and physiology is a wonderful option.

146
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:22,540
[SPEAKER_00]: The students that are in the CTE nursing assistant program participate in the anatomy and physiology as a full-time course.

147
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Students who are interested in environmental science,

148
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:35,723
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're interested in taking the AP exam, the environmental science honors course prepares them for that.

149
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:39,605
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't have the AP designation for that course.

150
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:48,312
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that sometimes students, sometimes so many courses with the cost, you know, it comes with a large cost, a large price tag.

151
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:54,121
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small number of students who want to take the exam to prove their proficiency.

152
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:57,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have the designation for that course.

153
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:59,848
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we've thought about for a few years.

154
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:06,275
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, we're still sticking with environmental science honors as our curriculum elective.

155
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:10,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we can put through committee as a

156
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:17,652
[SPEAKER_00]: as a community to think about whether we want to put in environmental science as an AP course.

157
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there isn't strong demand for it.

158
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,095
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very low demand.

159
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:28,500
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the other APs, we've got strong demand and students do enroll in it.

160
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:37,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And CP, sorry, Physics I and CP Physics Honors is an 11th and 12th grade class offered to students.

161
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:39,327
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a more,

162
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:45,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call it traditional because it isn't taught in the way some of us might remember physics being taught.

163
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,337
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely hands-on.

164
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:54,323
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all of the latest tools to be able to teach that effectively.

165
00:17:54,984 --> 00:18:00,929
[SPEAKER_00]: We use all Vernier probes and use all kinds of hands-on activities for these courses.

166
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:09,380
[SPEAKER_00]: It is taught algebraically rather than with calculus.

167
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:23,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the difference between the Physics I-CP, Physics I-Honors, and AP Physics C. In addition, we've considered AP Physics I and II, which is a different course than the one we offer.

168
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:28,390
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lower level algebra trig-based physics.

169
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some,

170
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:36,272
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting perspectives on that particular course.

171
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:55,227
[SPEAKER_00]: We think our course, as it stands, is almost better, just given the type of content we can go through in Physics I. The demands and the types of topics that are covered in the AP algebra-based course don't really

172
00:18:57,243 --> 00:19:07,287
[SPEAKER_00]: don't necessarily help all students be successful at the upper level once you're looking at college level sciences.

173
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:13,009
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sort of looking at it, but often our course seems to be better.

174
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:22,472
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little wider and we can do more with it than narrowing our focus on test prep for AP in physics one.

175
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to give you an overview of those courses.

176
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:41,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Access to this particular presentation allows you to click the hot button link and get to the description, the course description, so that you can see what kinds of topics we cover in each one.

177
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:53,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I'll just look at the initiatives pre-pandemic and through pandemic, and then talk a little bit about where we're going.

178
00:19:55,077 --> 00:20:00,622
[SPEAKER_00]: At the K-8 level, we've revamped all the curriculum resources.

179
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:01,382
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all new.

180
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:06,826
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, K-5, we've adopted FOSS.

181
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,227
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a couple of years ago.

182
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:14,152
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming into the third year of implementation this year, and the final payment for that

183
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,923
[SPEAKER_00]: for that particular program last year during the pandemic.

184
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,392
[SPEAKER_00]: We adopted STEM scopes that has had good success.

185
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:26,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great program.

186
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:31,493
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers seem to be responding well to it as well as the students.

187
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:35,755
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for a lot of resources.

188
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:44,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are being changed into different formats for the teachers given the reality that we have right now.

189
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,538
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had to sort of digitize the entire program.

190
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,513
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that students have access to it when they're learning remotely.

191
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:59,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been not perfectly seamless, but as seamless as one would hope.

192
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:07,902
[SPEAKER_00]: We can integrate it into our Google Classroom, but it also has its own platform.

193
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:17,168
[SPEAKER_00]: It has hands-on components, which we purchased, and to the extent possible, when we are in school, we're trying to implement that, as you know,

194
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:27,210
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the pandemic has really sort of restricted our ability to offer hands-on given the restrictions on everything.

195
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to do our best in that area.

196
00:21:31,653 --> 00:21:34,255
[SPEAKER_00]: But K-8, everything is new up to this point.

197
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:46,466
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really want to thank the committee on being able to support that financially and move forward and get the professional development for both programs in place.

198
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:51,750
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, although it has been largely digital for STEM scopes,

199
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:57,393
[SPEAKER_00]: The outlook for that as we move into more in-person is great.

200
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:06,996
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all the materials we need for it, so it should be pretty robust and hands-on more than it is at the moment.

201
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:12,318
[SPEAKER_00]: At the high school level, as I had mentioned, we revised the course sequence.

202
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:16,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you a little bit about why we wanted to do that.

203
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,881
[SPEAKER_00]: At grade nine, we currently offer biology.

204
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:23,585
[SPEAKER_00]: at grade 10 chemistry and then electives.

205
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:39,654
[SPEAKER_00]: We really wanted to align the requirements for the CTE and students who choose CTE and students who are in a traditional high school track.

206
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:48,740
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sort of misaligned because students who went to the CTE programs would have to take chemistry their senior year.

207
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:52,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do that, it's a different course.

208
00:22:53,737 --> 00:23:14,148
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really needed to have students meet the requirements as sort of in our school policy, that they have biology and chemistry completed by the time they graduate, at least biology and chemistry, and then a third year of elective science.

209
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:34,211
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, we've placed biology first, which I think makes a lot of sense and seems to have given a great advantage and has allowed the students to be able, at least this year and into the future, the opportunity to still take the MCAS in biology.

210
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:42,677
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take chemistry in grade 10, and the faculty is working really hard at making sure that the

211
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:56,150
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemistry we offer at grade 10 is appropriate to grade 10 students of very, you know, of a wide and diverse learning.

212
00:23:57,598 --> 00:24:02,401
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, group, and so that it's a really big tent.

213
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:12,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that all of our students, regardless of what track they've decided to take, will have access to our electives moving forward.

214
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:21,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these already exist, but some we may want to, you know, revise and find some new electives.

215
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:26,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Computer science, for example, does count as a STEM elective.

216
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:45,649
[SPEAKER_00]: The student has to choose computer science as their elective, and then it goes through the Councilor-administrator review to make sure that, you know, it's the appropriate computer science course to make that choice, but it does count as, it could count as your third year of science.

217
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,572
[SPEAKER_00]: The biotechnology CTE program

218
00:24:49,434 --> 00:25:00,264
[SPEAKER_00]: at grade 11 or 12 can count as a STE or science technology engineering elective via student selection and Councilor and administrative review.

219
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:02,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true for engineering.

220
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:12,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So this opens up a huge number of possibilities for our students because now we are recognizing the work that's being done at the CTE programs

221
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:26,146
[SPEAKER_00]: as robust and rigorous and also allowing students to take additional science courses as they move through our course sequence, which is ultimately what we want.

222
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:35,054
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to emphasize as much as possible the course taking in science and the course taking of elective sciences.

223
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:45,837
[SPEAKER_00]: All that this means ultimately is that all the high school and CTE science core sequences are now aligned with this current grade nine class.

224
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:58,407
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to work out the sophomores and the juniors so that their core sequences will align moving forward.

225
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:06,374
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we are in a good place moving forward that we can do this with everything that we have in place.

226
00:26:07,387 --> 00:26:11,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of our initiatives.

227
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:17,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of already mentioned that FOSS is

228
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,025
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the second year slash year three of adoption.

229
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:27,989
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the cost was about $285,000.

230
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:39,541
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to purchase additional kits this year for a couple of classrooms just to make sure that everybody had an individual set in each classroom that we were offering.

231
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:47,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move forward, we will still need to purchase some living organisms and consumables.

232
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:49,213
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still okay.

233
00:26:49,353 --> 00:27:02,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I think not this year's budget cycle, but next year's will be one in which we need to start considering whether we need a sort of an injection of money to purchase more consumables.

234
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:11,929
[SPEAKER_00]: The yearly expenses for living organisms will occur starting next year, not this year, because we still have that.

235
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,791
[SPEAKER_00]: We have coupons for the living things.

236
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:27,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also some things we've done creatively around living things that may make sense for elementary school students that really emphasizes

237
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:39,303
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation and ecological sort of responsibility, ethical responsibility in our local environment.

238
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:43,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may be able to do some cost savings there.

239
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:54,310
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue, we did start learning walks K to five, however, those were paused, we started in January, those were paused because of the pandemic.

240
00:27:55,451 --> 00:28:01,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are still looking at trying to find some benchmarks and interim assessments.

241
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:03,374
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward.

242
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's unique to science.

243
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:10,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's unique to all the disciplines, the academic disciplines.

244
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:17,848
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start considering how to move so that we can find some clear data on where students are.

245
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:23,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's to be determined, but something that we are keenly aware we need to work on.

246
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:38,669
[SPEAKER_00]: For STEM scopes, the current total cost of the program was about $60,000 to get the consumables for this year, which obviously were not used.

247
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not completely used.

248
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:43,634
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have little to replace for next year.

249
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:47,738
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of things available for the upcoming year.

250
00:28:49,697 --> 00:28:54,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Some consumable and living organisms will need to be replaced each year over multiple years.

251
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the ongoing costs.

252
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:02,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you adopt, it's $60,000 the first year, and then the ongoing costs.

253
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:12,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we project it'll be about $8,000 a year for consumables and about $10,000 a year for the online subscription for content.

254
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:20,740
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10,000 a year is the equivalent of a textbook subscription.

255
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:28,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never asked about bundling it for multiple years, but it's something that might be something we want to consider.

256
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:31,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Professional development was begun this year.

257
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,203
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ongoing.

258
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:42,166
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two full sessions, one at the beginning of the school year, one in the middle of the year, to go over how to use STEM scopes, all of the tools it has.

259
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:47,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to personally use it myself and found it pretty intuitive.

260
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:59,788
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of components that I feel are very beneficial for both the enrichment side and the scaffolding side, which has been very useful to teachers.

261
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:08,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And teachers have been able to integrate it into other Google Suite tools to be able to make things much more user-friendly for the students.

262
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,091
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that we've done that we noticed is

263
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:20,898
[SPEAKER_00]: The program now integrates into the Google Waffle, where you would click in and go direct to a program.

264
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:30,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than going through Clever, you can actually just click the link and it will directly have students go into their own personal portal.

265
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,245
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really helpful for STEM scopes.

266
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:40,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, we did start learning walks for grades six through eight as well, and they went on pause and we will resume in September.

267
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:43,415
[SPEAKER_00]: once school is in session again.

268
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:51,919
[SPEAKER_00]: At the high school is where the bulk of our attention will be in the coming years.

269
00:30:53,100 --> 00:31:05,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Our current program for biology has a copyright of 2001, which was probably when the last set of frameworks were approved and rolled out.

270
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:11,090
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to consider, strongly consider adopting a new program.

271
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,530
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my recommendation that the Pearson Biology Program, you see the cost there, is a good program.

272
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,833
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the book we've used in the previous.

273
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:25,196
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Miller and Levine Biology.

274
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:28,840
[SPEAKER_00]: This one happens to be, I believe it has a honeycomb cover on it.

275
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,183
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most recent edition of the book.

276
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,266
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a national version textbook.

277
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:42,555
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a six-year digital license and textbooks for every student.

278
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:48,140
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cost for textbooks for every student and the six-year digital license.

279
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:58,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the process is for the school committee to recommend adoption, but I certainly would advocate in this meeting that you do so.

280
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:02,995
[SPEAKER_00]: take this and do that as soon as possible.

281
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be really important to put that in place.

282
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:12,622
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we had placed funding available last year as earmarked for this.

283
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:13,723
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the

284
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:34,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Vendor was generous enough to give us a free year this year, because we weren't able to pilot last year due to the pandemic, we were set to pilot in the spring, and we were unable to, so they let us pilot for this entire year and we're pretty satisfied with what that.

285
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:44,571
[SPEAKER_00]: program has offered us, we think it will satisfy the needs and make sure that the kids have a robust program.

286
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:51,775
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, they've offered to give us a smaller, slimmer book called Biology the Core.

287
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:53,476
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really written for

288
00:32:55,705 --> 00:33:10,529
[SPEAKER_00]: for undergraduates that go to community colleges, but the quality of the text, it is free of jargon and very thin and easy to read where the picture and the content matches.

289
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:14,229
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just going to give that to us for free, the books themselves.

290
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:21,691
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already started sending those, and they really can be beneficial to our EL and special education populations.

291
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are already there.

292
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:52,908
[SPEAKER_00]: for our students they sort of match up in terms of they will everybody will get the the biology Pearson biology program but these unique texts for special populations are really very supportive to our students with with learning needs of any kind whether it's language based or or other based so I'm sort of sticking on this program because I think

293
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:54,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to hear me.

294
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:58,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm making it clear that we really need to make a decision here.

295
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:06,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemistry is pretty old, a copyright of 1997, which predates even the frameworks.

296
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:10,289
[SPEAKER_00]: A review is underway for a new program there.

297
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:15,052
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at SAVAS is experience chemistry program.

298
00:34:15,072 --> 00:34:22,338
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been lucky enough to pick up that as well under the umbrella of SAVAS or Pearson.

299
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:27,125
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've also provided us with hard copies of the book.

300
00:34:27,206 --> 00:34:28,346
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a soft cover book.

301
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:30,087
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a hard cover book.

302
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:34,529
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a consumable book, which is new for chemistry.

303
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:41,652
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like many vendors are stepping away from a chemistry textbook in the traditional sense.

304
00:34:42,232 --> 00:34:47,854
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're going to offer a textbook, it's going to be the soft cover version so that students can write in it.

305
00:34:49,857 --> 00:35:02,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the students that have them and the teachers that have seen them get somewhat excited about it because having something in your hand that you can write in given

306
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:10,172
[SPEAKER_00]: the preponderance of online instruction we've had has actually been a little bit of a relief for the kids.

307
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:13,595
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something different.

308
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:23,662
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some really unique units, things on climate change, where they connect chemistry to climate change, material science to chemistry.

309
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:25,063
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unique and different.

310
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:30,867
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a significant shift away from what we're used to in chemistry.

311
00:35:31,387 --> 00:35:48,853
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think given that we're moving to tech chemistry at a 10th grade for everyone and the topics that they're covering that are so important to sort of like science citizenship, it would be a really wonderful thing to look at.

312
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:50,293
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna continue to pilot.

313
00:35:50,533 --> 00:36:00,417
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna continue to pilot next year as well with this, because we really wanna see that this particular program, chemistry is kind of a difficult subject for anyone who,

314
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:06,375
[SPEAKER_00]: has any mathematical weaknesses or learning weaknesses.

315
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:10,677
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't wanna really make a huge mistake on looking at programs that might miss something.

316
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:12,358
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're vetting it pretty carefully.

317
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:20,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The other program is- Siri, I just wanna say we have like a five minute warning to leave time for questions.

318
00:36:20,884 --> 00:36:21,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

319
00:36:21,104 --> 00:36:21,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

320
00:36:22,184 --> 00:36:23,545
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just go really quick.

321
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:27,588
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, AP courses will need new textbooks.

322
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:31,390
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the priorities, anatomy and physiology as well.

323
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:35,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I've priced out what is there.

324
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,266
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cover the cost.

325
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:42,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point we will want to do some new electives.

326
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:52,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Given that we're opening up electives, we really want to be mindful and careful about what we choose and be creative about it.

327
00:36:54,023 --> 00:37:03,944
[SPEAKER_00]: We will start that committee next year to start looking at new curriculum electives, it won't just include this is a community wide committee, so that's going to be formed.

328
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:12,645
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I just wanna say that we are fully compliant with the Office of Civil Rights regulations.

329
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:21,412
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk annually, especially recently, of the unconscious bias in our programs and through our practices.

330
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:28,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to make sure that teachers hear about the different perspectives.

331
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:34,262
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a commitment to an assumptions-free, all-inclusive teaching and learning model.

332
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:40,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We also promote the co-teaching model with our EL programs.

333
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:55,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are looking at making sure that our professional development and programs with Tufts University and other programs are aligned to provide more equity when the classroom is not enough.

334
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:00,267
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we have some work to do.

335
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:12,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna make sure that we continue to emphasize hands-on teaching and learning and to integrate technology as we work, move forward.

336
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:17,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna stop there so that questions can be asked and answered if possible.

337
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I went really long, I apologize.

338
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:25,487
[SPEAKER_00]: It always, if you give me the floor, unfortunately, sometimes I can talk a lot, so.

339
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:27,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

340
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:27,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoops.

341
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

342
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, maybe we could stop screens sharing right now.

343
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:36,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

344
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:38,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can figure that out.

345
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:44,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the meantime, I'm just going to ask my committee members to do a housekeeping.

346
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:46,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not take the role.

347
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:49,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I could just call attendance, Jenny Graham.

348
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

349
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Mia is unable to come, so she's absent.

350
00:38:55,842 --> 00:39:03,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paul Russo is here sitting in her place for as long as he can stay.

351
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:04,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

352
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:07,426
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

353
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Paul, go ahead.

354
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:10,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

355
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:21,086
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody with a computer science degree, when I see computer science as a course, I feel like that'd be offering a course called science, which I know we don't offer a science course.

356
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:26,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just a little, I mean, curious, what do we mean by a computer science?

357
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:27,272
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just seems

358
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:32,750
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of as like, it's like offering a math course and calling it the math course.

359
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,110
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we mean?

360
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:37,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are particular courses offered.

361
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:41,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look back and find out in our course sequence, which ones are offered.

362
00:39:42,874 --> 00:39:53,718
[SPEAKER_00]: They really come out of the math department, the courses that are there, but they would qualify like the student would be able to choose whether they want it to count for math or science as credits.

363
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,019
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm sorry.

364
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:56,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Rocco.

365
00:39:57,134 --> 00:39:59,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that the course is called Computer Science.

366
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:00,575
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a set of courses.

367
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:02,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I misunderstood you.

368
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:05,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were saying there was literally a course called Computer Science.

369
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:07,057
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very confusing to me.

370
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:11,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

371
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:13,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a couple of questions.

372
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:14,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Jenny.

373
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:24,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Seery, I remember when the selection of the K to five curriculum was happening.

374
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:43,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sort of noted at the time that the engineering STEM part of the curriculum was like not the biggest strength of FOSS and that we would have to supplement the curriculum in some way, shape or form to like kind of cover those bases.

375
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we done that or do we still need to do that?

376
00:40:48,178 --> 00:40:56,664
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need to do that, however, FOSS themselves are working on curricula that align to their units to make that happen.

377
00:40:56,784 --> 00:41:08,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I think it has more to do with the pandemic than anything else, but as students proceed through the lessons in the FOSS unit,

378
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:14,726
[SPEAKER_00]: it will come to an end point where they have an engineering design challenge that goes along with what they learned.

379
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:17,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really ultimately what we wanted anyway.

380
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,009
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, it's already there.

381
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:25,553
[SPEAKER_00]: So like composting is one of the ones that are highlighted in the framework and it's already found in

382
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:29,947
[SPEAKER_00]: the units for the appropriate grades.

383
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:42,197
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not something we would have to redo, but there are some units that do not have it that BOSS is working on pretty rigorously right now, because they know that that was a weakness.

384
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:54,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I will look back and see what they've created, but I think the pandemic and creating an adequate course sequence for digital learning has been their priority, and they had to kind of drop

385
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,679
[SPEAKER_00]: the engineering for a bit.

386
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,280
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is they'll pick it up again over the summer.

387
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:14,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And in terms of like Medford filling the gap that exists, do we think that we will be filling that gap in this upcoming school year or are we some number of years away from addressing that gap?

388
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:23,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I think next year we would probably see what they developed and then the following year we would probably be more

389
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:28,284
[SPEAKER_00]: more forceful about our needs to be able to fill the gap.

390
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:39,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it means purchasing additional components for the FOSS program that they've provided, or we go and find something on our own because we don't have something, it's something we'll have to consider.

391
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:45,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this coming school year, but the year after for certain, we'll have to address that.

392
00:42:46,077 --> 00:43:13,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so as we think about that overall curriculum catalog that kicked off a lot of these discussions, I think it would just be important for that to land there as a need for FY23 so that as a committee, we can be planning for that need proactively and really not find ourselves in the high school position that science finds itself in needing to replace literally everything.

393
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:21,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should go on the, just on the catalog as such so we can plan accordingly.

394
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you also mentioned about FOSS, that we were being creative.

395
00:43:27,006 --> 00:43:31,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we being creative to save money or are we being creative because it's in the best interest of the curriculum?

396
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:38,533
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to remember and recall what the context of that comment was.

397
00:43:39,393 --> 00:43:40,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to remember.

398
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:41,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You were talking about,

399
00:43:44,078 --> 00:43:45,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, some of the consumables.

400
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:46,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

401
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:53,325
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it had nothing to do with our, our needs for, um, for, uh, a financial resource.

402
00:43:53,365 --> 00:44:02,452
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more about, uh, preservation of, um, the organisms because once the organisms are used in a classroom, we have to dispose of them somehow.

403
00:44:02,992 --> 00:44:06,455
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really can't release them into the environment, not all of them anyway.

404
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,578
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to find some creative way of making sure that we don't

405
00:44:11,724 --> 00:44:14,387
[SPEAKER_00]: make an ecological imprint that's inappropriate.

406
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:15,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

407
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:17,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?

408
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:18,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

409
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:27,398
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to do that and, you know, look at the local environment, get our experiences, but also not make an impact environmentally.

410
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:29,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Got any gypsy moths?

411
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that kind of thing.

412
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:40,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say thank you to Mr. Seary for presenting the science presentation.

413
00:44:40,557 --> 00:44:42,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been closely monitoring the time.

414
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,340
[SPEAKER_04]: My little went off.

415
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to just alert you that we're at the halfway point.

416
00:44:50,283 --> 00:45:00,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know if there were any other lingering questions, but just to be able to allow time for the next presentation and more questions, I just wanted to

417
00:45:01,247 --> 00:45:02,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had a question, Maurice.

418
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

419
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can email you on some of the follow-ups, but I'm surprised that you said the demand for AP environmental is low.

420
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:15,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you poll the kids periodically?

421
00:45:15,096 --> 00:45:16,156
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you know it's low?

422
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:24,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So we often communicate with the guidance teachers, guidance Councilors to find out whether there's any demand for it.

423
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:34,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers that are in the classroom and are making recommendations to the students for their future courses will also ask.

424
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:41,211
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a formal way of doing it, but informally there hasn't been a huge demand for AP environmental.

425
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:46,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm just thinking that a student might even know, how would a student know that it's potential?

426
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:57,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So some students will ask, and the thing that we've offered, Ms.

427
00:45:57,542 --> 00:45:58,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Vador is the teacher of it.

428
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:04,125
[SPEAKER_00]: She will prepare the student for an AP exam if they choose to do so.

429
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:08,327
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't recognize it as an AP course.

430
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:11,409
[SPEAKER_00]: But the student can still get the credit.

431
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:16,631
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted to go in that direction, we certainly could consider it and move forward with it.

432
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:18,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can roll it into the committee

433
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:21,783
[SPEAKER_00]: next year of elective courses.

434
00:46:22,244 --> 00:46:41,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so in the interest of time, I'll just say it was very clear that there's substantial textbook needs in a variety of not only the ninth grade biology, but which I was very happy to hear that there was a supplement that would be good for our special populations, but also across the board.

435
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess unless there's any other thing pressing from Paul or Jenny,

436
00:46:47,202 --> 00:46:47,902
[SPEAKER_05]: We should move on.

437
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:48,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny?

438
00:46:49,703 --> 00:46:52,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some additional questions, but I will send them to you via email.

439
00:46:52,664 --> 00:46:52,904
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

440
00:46:54,284 --> 00:46:54,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

441
00:46:55,645 --> 00:47:01,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And Paulette, I have to pop up at exactly 5 o'clock, so forgive my just vanishing.

442
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:02,026
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

443
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:03,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for attending, Paul.

444
00:47:04,367 --> 00:47:04,667
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

445
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:06,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Riccadeli, thank you.

446
00:47:07,688 --> 00:47:08,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rocco.

447
00:47:09,129 --> 00:47:09,389
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

448
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:10,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to share my screen.

449
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:38,006
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I've never shared my screen on this computer, so it's not allowing me to do it.

450
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:39,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just try one more thing.

451
00:47:40,688 --> 00:47:44,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I can screen share for you if you'd like me to.

452
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,071
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

453
00:47:46,551 --> 00:47:49,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think I've ever screen shared on this Mac before.

454
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:54,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize it was gonna ask me to open system preferences.

455
00:47:56,497 --> 00:47:57,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Maurice.

456
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

457
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:10,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

458
00:48:10,842 --> 00:48:12,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just bring it to the top.

459
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:12,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

460
00:48:40,695 --> 00:48:40,835
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

461
00:48:42,137 --> 00:48:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so.

462
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:49,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, it is still afternoon, it's 4.50 to everyone.

463
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm here this afternoon to present an overview of the fine arts curriculum.

464
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:58,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And joining me this afternoon are the lead teacher for music.

465
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:05,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So Haley Rallo is here and the lead teacher for arts, Suzanne Fee is here.

466
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:12,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate them being here to support this presentation.

467
00:49:13,014 --> 00:49:14,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the next slide.

468
00:49:20,003 --> 00:49:25,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the presentation is broken up into five major topics.

469
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:28,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna take a look at the new curriculum frameworks for art.

470
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:33,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They were adopted in 2019, so they are new.

471
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:41,224
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna take a look at the elementary music, excuse me, the elementary, middle and high school music program.

472
00:49:42,865 --> 00:49:46,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the elementary, middle and high school art program.

473
00:49:46,868 --> 00:49:52,753
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna briefly look at some of the professional development offerings that have been offered this year specific to fine arts.

474
00:49:53,473 --> 00:50:04,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are going to end with a look forward, not only for this year, 2021, but beyond things that we're looking to do beyond this year.

475
00:50:06,217 --> 00:50:07,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, thank you.

476
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:17,305
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the fine arts, I should say the arts curriculum frameworks were adopted in 2019.

477
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:32,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the pandemic beginning last spring, there was a delay in actually formally doing the work to incorporate them into our district curriculum.

478
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So that work began this year.

479
00:50:35,997 --> 00:50:48,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And that work has been led by our lead teachers, along with our teachers in our department so I appreciate their work in this area.

480
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:54,232
[SPEAKER_02]: The new arts framework is focused on four strands.

481
00:50:55,133 --> 00:51:03,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at both the music curriculum and the art curriculum, we see components of creating, presenting, responding, and connecting.

482
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:10,479
[SPEAKER_02]: So this framework is an improvement upon the previous one, which was a 1999 framework.

483
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this new one, there's an increased emphasis on the importance of creating original work.

484
00:51:16,562 --> 00:51:27,512
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an increased emphasis on responding to the work of other students and the work from masters with a focus on understanding the context in which artworks were created.

485
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:34,998
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's an alignment to a consistent structure organized around a common set of artistic practices.

486
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:45,995
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ambitious standards that highlight the importance of the arts as part of a well rounded education that prepares students for college careers and civic participation.

487
00:51:48,325 --> 00:51:54,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll see the second bullet here is that there is a focus on social-emotional learning and development.

488
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not just true with the arts curriculum frameworks.

489
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:11,382
[SPEAKER_02]: We see this in other frameworks, that that component of social-emotional learning and sharing with other students, presenting, responding is really an important part of the arts education for our students.

490
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:17,827
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a focus on cultural proficiency and of course, meeting the needs of all learners.

491
00:52:19,378 --> 00:52:31,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I mentioned, our district is in the process of revising the both the art curriculum and the music curriculum so they are they're separate because they're separate topics within the fine arts framework.

492
00:52:32,976 --> 00:52:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: The work that goes into revising a curriculum is is immense.

493
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:51,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And it involves unpacking the standards, which is really just a fancy word for taking apart those standards, deconstructing them so that they're in a very clear statement format.

494
00:52:52,312 --> 00:52:57,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there you create essential questions, which is what the team is working on now.

495
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Both teams are working on now.

496
00:52:59,674 --> 00:53:03,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after the essential questions, the unpacking is done.

497
00:53:03,337 --> 00:53:08,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you go in and you create activities and lessons.

498
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:13,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look for identification of support materials.

499
00:53:13,546 --> 00:53:23,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would imagine that this work is going to continue probably for maybe the next six months or so in order for it to be where it is.

500
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:26,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started this in December.

501
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:32,414
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm thinking by the fall, mid to late fall, it will be done.

502
00:53:33,215 --> 00:53:48,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we are presenting tonight is, it's kind of, it's a combination of what the old standards were with some best practices that are in the new standards that we've just, we've brought in.

503
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:53,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But a formal introduction of the new curriculum will be done later in the fall.

504
00:53:54,694 --> 00:53:55,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

505
00:53:57,357 --> 00:54:01,058
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so this is the music portion of the fine arts curriculum.

506
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:02,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

507
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:12,860
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we have our picture here of three elementary students and it's what you would expect when you see an elementary general music class.

508
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:20,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the students, I think they look happy, they are moving, it looks like they might be singing.

509
00:54:21,165 --> 00:54:29,948
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a general picture, they're not actually our students, but these students are engaged in what students in the music class typically would engage in.

510
00:54:30,688 --> 00:54:36,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you that because of COVID, we really had to pull back on what our students were able to do in the class.

511
00:54:38,571 --> 00:54:43,633
[SPEAKER_02]: With regard to singing, students really couldn't sing.

512
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:52,375
[SPEAKER_02]: For safety concerns, I mean, they were wearing a mask, but in terms of expelling air, we really needed to be careful.

513
00:54:52,735 --> 00:54:54,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some humming that went along.

514
00:54:55,215 --> 00:55:01,837
[SPEAKER_02]: With regard to movement, limited movement because the students could not exert.

515
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:05,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we lose Maurice?

516
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:11,301
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't lose me, I tried to do a screen share, so don't mind me.

517
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no, I'm sorry.

518
00:55:13,302 --> 00:55:16,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I couldn't do the screen share.

519
00:55:16,722 --> 00:55:17,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just pulling it back up.

520
00:55:18,303 --> 00:55:23,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

521
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:26,664
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to talk through this part.

522
00:55:26,684 --> 00:55:29,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see the picture of the students, you know, happy.

523
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:43,392
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we, we brought into the district and we started a review of this in the summer was a program that was going to make a remote instruction with students this fall and on into the winter.

524
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:49,200
[SPEAKER_02]: and spring, fruitful and doable for what we were faced with.

525
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:57,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember, the kids were home, then they were hybrid, so you had half the kids in, half the kids at home, and now they're all in.

526
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:02,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to take in mind that they couldn't sing, their movement had to be limited.

527
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:09,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at a program that one of our newer teachers had used in a different district, in a different state.

528
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:13,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So we brought in Quaver Music after checking out a few of them.

529
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:22,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And this program, I think, really helped our students, helped our teachers engage in music in a way that was safe and was entertaining.

530
00:56:23,774 --> 00:56:25,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like Quaver Music.

531
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:31,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a lot of time in music classrooms, actually for six months, between October and April.

532
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there monitoring the class along with

533
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:44,667
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the online teach the teacher, our teacher who was projecting from her home.

534
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:52,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was a really it was a really nice program this great music, it's, it's, you know, culturally attentive.

535
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice, fun program.

536
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:08,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see at the end of this presentation, the recommendation is that we continue with this program, even though the hope is that we're going to be in school full time next year.

537
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are a lot of great things that we can continue with this program.

538
00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:16,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I've identified some of the major topics in each one of the grades.

539
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:20,412
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna see that there are a lot of commonalities.

540
00:57:20,552 --> 00:57:33,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the singing, the performing, the choreography, the percussion instruments, the movement activities, all are really important to a music education on the elementary level.

541
00:57:35,177 --> 00:57:36,618
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can go to the next slide.

542
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:46,688
[SPEAKER_02]: if you can go to the next slide, what I've identified is some of the instrument exposure that the students have on the elementary level.

543
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:52,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see grades K through five, they are experimenting with percussion instruments.

544
00:57:52,351 --> 00:58:02,296
[SPEAKER_02]: They're tapping, they're using the xylophone, they're using instruments in which there is motion, mostly with their hands.

545
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:06,518
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get up to grade three, they have the recorder.

546
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:15,260
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually engaged in recorder activity this year, even though there were safety concerns with air.

547
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:22,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was in the classroom when the students at home were actually playing the recorder.

548
00:58:22,322 --> 00:58:29,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And the expectation in the classroom with the kids that weren't at home is that they actually were fingering the instrument and not blowing into it.

549
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:34,024
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a highlight of grade three.

550
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:39,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the students really appreciated that they were able to continue that and not lose that experience.

551
00:58:40,086 --> 00:58:48,629
[SPEAKER_02]: With regard to the strings, that occurs in grades four and five, and then they have the opportunity to do band in grade five.

552
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Our ability to engage in a lot of instrument work this year has been very limited.

553
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:03,693
[SPEAKER_02]: There were guidelines from the Department of Education with regard to the sharing of instruments, the cleaning of instruments.

554
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:09,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if they were not instruments that you blow into, there still were concerns about handling.

555
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:18,237
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, moving forward, our intent is to go with what we have done in the past and perhaps enhance that.

556
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:25,944
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year was an anomaly and it was so in the interest of safety, health and safety.

557
00:59:26,885 --> 00:59:27,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

558
00:59:29,157 --> 00:59:31,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Themes in middle school general music.

559
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:42,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you're seeing some of the same themes, the singing, the playing of instruments, competitive games to develop rhythmic skills.

560
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:47,753
[SPEAKER_02]: They study melody, rhythm patterns, they use drumsticks.

561
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:52,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Grade seven, again, you see some of the same things.

562
00:59:52,077 --> 00:59:55,139
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the introduction of guitar playing in grade seven and eight.

563
00:59:56,038 --> 00:59:58,821
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really an exciting thing.

564
00:59:58,901 --> 01:00:10,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Even before COVID, I remember going into middle school music classes and before I was overseeing the department and just being on at the at the level of

565
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:18,829
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously it wasn't mastery, but the level that they were able to play the guitar with the instruction that they had.

566
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:28,416
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna see a little bit later on that we are recommending the purchase of some more guitars and ukuleles, and that is specific to middle school music.

567
01:00:28,836 --> 01:00:41,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We have them, but we think, not that we think, we need more instruments to make it a more fruitful and complete experience for all students instead of having to share.

568
01:00:44,315 --> 01:00:45,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we can move on.

569
01:00:45,697 --> 01:00:59,572
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so just identifying what's available to middle school students with regard to instruments, band, chorus, and orchestra are open and available to grades six, seven, and eight students.

570
01:01:03,867 --> 01:01:08,388
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get to high school, we have several opportunities for students.

571
01:01:08,488 --> 01:01:13,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So the students in the access program engage in the adaptive music class.

572
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:21,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Our music teacher is highly skilled and is licensed in special education.

573
01:01:22,031 --> 01:01:33,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So she not only has the content knowledge, but she has the skills, the great skills to work with the students that need the adaptive music and the special attention.

574
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:39,848
[SPEAKER_02]: We have option, a band option, chorus option, guitar one and two.

575
01:01:40,228 --> 01:01:45,892
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to buy some guitars this year for our students who were remote on the high school level.

576
01:01:47,313 --> 01:01:55,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And I vividly remember the teacher standing down at the corner waiting for parents and students to come pick up their guitars in September.

577
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was a,

578
01:01:58,868 --> 01:02:02,650
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a great thing that we were able to option, that we were able to offer students.

579
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:09,155
[SPEAKER_02]: The kids really look forward to playing instruments, and in this case, guitar.

580
01:02:09,495 --> 01:02:15,619
[SPEAKER_02]: With the music technology class, percussion, orchestra, and theater options open to students.

581
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you can see that these are open to all grades.

582
01:02:20,022 --> 01:02:21,823
[SPEAKER_02]: This year we had to pull back a little bit.

583
01:02:23,017 --> 01:02:33,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a little bit, we had to pull back a lot because of the safety concerns around the sharing of instruments and the wind, the blowing into instruments.

584
01:02:37,686 --> 01:02:40,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we can go on to our next slide.

585
01:02:43,713 --> 01:02:46,155
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we have our art curriculum.

586
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:51,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, our art curriculum is part of that, the new arts framework.

587
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:59,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're remembering that much of art is creating, it's presenting, it's responding, and it's connecting.

588
01:03:00,169 --> 01:03:07,876
[SPEAKER_02]: It has that social emotional component that is so important to learning and functioning as a,

589
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:17,208
[SPEAKER_02]: as an adult eventually, and just becoming a good citizen, someone who can communicate.

590
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:25,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our K-5 elementary art curriculum, actually, if you can go back a little bit,

591
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:31,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably don't need to go over all of these, but you can see that there are a variety of materials that they use.

592
01:03:32,092 --> 01:03:43,327
[SPEAKER_02]: They use crayons, they use paint, they use colored pencils, they make two-dimensional, three-dimensional artwork, they create different types of landscapes, portraits.

593
01:03:45,427 --> 01:03:48,489
[SPEAKER_02]: They learn about artists, so they learn about art history.

594
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,751
[SPEAKER_02]: They learn to talk about their art, that's really important.

595
01:03:54,152 --> 01:04:01,515
[SPEAKER_02]: They learn proper use of supplies and tools, and they develop criteria, language, and behavior for informal class discussion.

596
01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:07,558
[SPEAKER_02]: They learn to be good citizens in the classroom, and they learn to care and to clean their supplies in the art room.

597
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:11,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So like music, the sharing of materials was,

598
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:14,862
[SPEAKER_02]: was a safety concern this year.

599
01:04:15,442 --> 01:04:20,264
[SPEAKER_02]: For the materials that were shared, there was a cleaning protocol.

600
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:29,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So our teachers, both in art and music, between sections, there was an immense amount of cleaning that needed to take place.

601
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:31,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll speak for myself.

602
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:37,371
[SPEAKER_02]: In between music classes, each time, those chairs that the students were sitting in needed to be cleaned.

603
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:39,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And that took time.

604
01:04:39,872 --> 01:04:41,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were three minutes between class.

605
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:50,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, for art, it was even more involved than it was for the general music in terms of cleaning.

606
01:04:53,187 --> 01:04:54,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, next slide.

607
01:04:55,749 --> 01:05:00,152
[SPEAKER_02]: With regard to the middle school, and again, Suzanne Fee is a middle school art teacher.

608
01:05:00,212 --> 01:05:06,437
[SPEAKER_02]: She is here, so when it comes time to questions, she might be able to answer some of the more specific questions.

609
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:17,045
[SPEAKER_02]: In all three grades, the principles of design and elements of art and art cultures and color theory are really, excuse me, sorry.

610
01:05:17,245 --> 01:05:19,286
[SPEAKER_02]: The principles of design and elements of art

611
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:23,733
[SPEAKER_02]: are embedded in each one of the grade levels.

612
01:05:24,614 --> 01:05:36,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So color theory is important in grade six, developing basic drawing skills in grade seven, and the role of visual arts play in our lives and careers is a focus of the grade eight curriculum.

613
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:47,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we have the 1999 frameworks, we had our existing curriculum with the new frameworks that we are in the process of embedding,

614
01:05:48,332 --> 01:05:52,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't anticipate major changes, but more tweaks to what we're doing.

615
01:05:52,855 --> 01:05:56,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, focused on creating, presenting, responding, and connecting.

616
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

617
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:04,784
[SPEAKER_02]: On the high school level, we have various courses.

618
01:06:04,844 --> 01:06:11,850
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Art and Ideas, which is actually an interdisciplinary course that is taught with one of our social studies teachers.

619
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:17,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of philosophy that goes along with that art history and philosophy.

620
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:27,984
[SPEAKER_02]: We have AP Studio Art, Art Appreciation and Practice, Comprehensive Art 1 through 4, Drawing, Design, Ceramics, and Sculpture.

621
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:39,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a nice selection of art options on the high school level, again, including the AP Studio Art class.

622
01:06:42,717 --> 01:06:43,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide.

623
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So segwaying over to professional development.

624
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:52,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we were able to accomplish this year involves Quaver Music.

625
01:06:52,145 --> 01:07:01,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only did we adopt this program that helped our students learn and feel like they were really enmeshed in the music and the videos that had this

626
01:07:02,813 --> 01:07:06,115
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice dancing and music.

627
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:11,737
[SPEAKER_02]: But the program also provided us with some professional development.

628
01:07:11,797 --> 01:07:16,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had the representative from Quaver work with our teachers on a couple of occasions.

629
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're able to continue with this program, that PD will continue also.

630
01:07:23,422 --> 01:07:27,624
[SPEAKER_02]: We also use the art of education program.

631
01:07:27,704 --> 01:07:40,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't put this in the art part of the presentation, but we also brought in this year an art online program to help support our teachers and our students in the classroom.

632
01:07:42,269 --> 01:07:47,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So that included a curriculum component that they used and it also included a PD component.

633
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:52,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they really liked this program.

634
01:07:52,663 --> 01:07:56,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it when I sat through the session.

635
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's high quality PD.

636
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:09,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The request came from a teacher who had experienced it through a professional development opportunity that she had, and she had colleagues, so she highly recommended it.

637
01:08:09,613 --> 01:08:16,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's been really helpful, not only for in the classroom, but also for teachers to continue with their own learning.

638
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:29,485
[SPEAKER_02]: The Music Curriculum Review and the Art Curriculum Review are those committees that are engaged in the review of the new frameworks.

639
01:08:30,746 --> 01:08:36,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever you adopt a new curriculum, it's important that PD come with it.

640
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:45,092
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no better way of people learning about a curriculum than by them engaging in the creation of it by

641
01:08:46,862 --> 01:08:51,012
[SPEAKER_02]: unpacking the standards, creating those essential questions and creating the activities.

642
01:08:52,421 --> 01:09:07,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the new curriculum is formally adopted, we will need to continue with the PD, but I'm very happy to say that most of the teachers in the department have engaged in these curriculum review committees.

643
01:09:07,953 --> 01:09:09,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're a step ahead.

644
01:09:10,474 --> 01:09:16,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lastly, a course that's not solely open to arts teachers, but it is an arts course.

645
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a culturally responsive teaching through the arts through Lesley University.

646
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:33,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of our fine arts teachers are engaged in that course, it is a, as the title indicates it's a culturally responsive course so it's, it's about being, you know,

647
01:09:34,632 --> 01:09:41,573
[SPEAKER_02]: equity aware, and there's a good anti-racist component to it, but it focuses around the arts.

648
01:09:42,574 --> 01:09:59,357
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a course that, as you probably know, each year we need to offer a one credit course for our entire faculty so that they can earn, if they want, one increment towards salary, to increase their salary.

649
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:00,717
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that course.

650
01:10:01,217 --> 01:10:03,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this year, it focused around the arts.

651
01:10:04,425 --> 01:10:07,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the last class is actually tomorrow.

652
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,169
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a series of classes.

653
01:10:09,629 --> 01:10:11,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it was through Lesley University.

654
01:10:12,111 --> 01:10:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really trying to solidify that partnership with Lesley.

655
01:10:15,433 --> 01:10:19,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was one of the two courses through Lesley that we're offering this year.

656
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:24,099
[SPEAKER_02]: The other course doesn't have anything to do with art.

657
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:25,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an EL course.

658
01:10:27,615 --> 01:10:34,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And okay, so with regard to our needs and what we're thinking of, right?

659
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:37,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're thinking about 2021, we're thinking about the fall.

660
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:44,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're thinking about the art that our students create.

661
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:51,167
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be displayed, it needs to be highlighted, it needs to be celebrated, right?

662
01:10:51,227 --> 01:11:07,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we go back to those strands in the frameworks, again, creating, presenting, responding, connecting, being able to display this art allows kids to do that, allows their artwork to be displayed, to be presented.

663
01:11:08,759 --> 01:11:10,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Other kids can look at it, it can be responded to.

664
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:10,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So

665
01:11:14,151 --> 01:11:15,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Those cases would be for all schools.

666
01:11:15,832 --> 01:11:18,353
[SPEAKER_02]: The collective cost is approximately $10,000.

667
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:33,919
[SPEAKER_02]: The second item, the art of education, which is what I just described to you, that is the program that we adopted for online learning and also for professional development for our art teachers.

668
01:11:35,326 --> 01:11:36,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That collectively is 7,000.

669
01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:40,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a little bit less than 7,000 this year.

670
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:48,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 6,800, but the rough estimate is 7,000 for that program.

671
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:58,301
[SPEAKER_02]: The Quaver program, which I described to you that we use for online learning and also has a PD component to it that I'd like to continue with is also 7,000.

672
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:09,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with regard to an instrument inventory replacement, we've identified some areas that we think would be really helpful.

673
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,442
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talked about middle school, I talked about ukuleles and guitars.

674
01:12:13,942 --> 01:12:16,123
[SPEAKER_02]: We do need to increase the supply.

675
01:12:16,683 --> 01:12:31,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple of years ago the director at the time did buy some, we would like to, to add more so that teachers can do a whole class of ukulele instruction instead of having half the class do it.

676
01:12:32,136 --> 01:12:56,013
[SPEAKER_02]: um so collectively that court that that cost would be about seven thousand dollars for the ukuleles and the guitars sound systems for all schools is roughly six thousand dollars so that would be for all of of our schools in the district so right now there are a couple of sound systems and there is sharing that is occurring so if there is a

677
01:12:56,794 --> 01:13:03,238
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a need at one school, as I understand, Mr. Zigney would run down to one school and then bring it to another school.

678
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:12,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to see all schools to have the same options and not have it housed at one school and then have to borrow.

679
01:13:15,284 --> 01:13:21,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We've identified the need for amps and microphones at a cost of 2,000 and bases for 1,000.

680
01:13:27,456 --> 01:13:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's in a nutshell, I tried to keep it short and relatively broad, but at this point, if you have comments or questions, I certainly will answer.

681
01:13:41,524 --> 01:13:47,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can't answer them, our two lead teachers, I'm sure we'll be able to help.

682
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:56,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me start off with one Bernadette typically in the music program we start our fifth graders with violin.

683
01:13:56,882 --> 01:14:02,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell us what What ability did we have to start kids on violin.

684
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't this year and also

685
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:08,569
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning instruments in the sixth grade?

686
01:14:08,669 --> 01:14:15,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And what impact is that going to have on our future band and orchestra programs?

687
01:14:16,013 --> 01:14:19,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to recoup.

688
01:14:19,554 --> 01:14:22,656
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about this, how we need to reach out.

689
01:14:22,716 --> 01:14:24,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have a plan to reach out.

690
01:14:24,196 --> 01:14:27,138
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a presentation that was created.

691
01:14:27,678 --> 01:14:30,219
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to reach out to the students to get them back on track.

692
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:35,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now, because of safety concerns, we were not able to safely offer

693
01:14:36,657 --> 01:14:44,843
[SPEAKER_02]: an extensive instrument program because of the issue of sharing, I will say because of health concerns.

694
01:14:47,344 --> 01:14:50,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So did fifth graders start violins at all or no?

695
01:14:53,268 --> 01:14:55,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Haley, I do not believe that they did.

696
01:14:56,728 --> 01:14:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Bella.

697
01:14:57,569 --> 01:14:57,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

698
01:14:58,350 --> 01:14:59,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you, Hayley.

699
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you too.

700
01:15:00,532 --> 01:15:04,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was at a concert, but... Me too.

701
01:15:04,655 --> 01:15:11,041
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not do fourth grade strings this year, or fifth grade band.

702
01:15:11,101 --> 01:15:17,246
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the schedule worked out, they were only available to fit it in the schedule on the Wednesday, which was our remote day.

703
01:15:18,187 --> 01:15:24,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of parents working from home, a lot of siblings working in their homes on Zoom remotely.

704
01:15:24,348 --> 01:15:31,190
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't a good environment to set students up to be successful in order to move on.

705
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:34,010
[SPEAKER_03]: We just, there was a lot of frustration.

706
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:38,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be missing two grades of students.

707
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:43,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So we won't really have a lot of incoming sixth grade band students this year, or a lot of incoming

708
01:15:44,512 --> 01:15:57,238
[SPEAKER_03]: fourth or fifth grade strings, but the Department of Instrumental Teachers has gotten together and we are going to make a series of videos and we're gonna do some outreach in May and June in order to rebuild those programs and get students back on board.

709
01:15:57,258 --> 01:15:58,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

710
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:10,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, we are hoping that we will be able to provide some opportunities for the kids who missed out, if you would, in the fourth and fifth grade.

711
01:16:11,626 --> 01:16:11,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

712
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:22,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah, I believe, I don't, I have to check the Department of Education site, but they have lifted some of the restrictions.

713
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:35,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless there is a restriction, our intent is to move on and to grow that program, to try to recoup what we lost, but it's gonna be a lot of work.

714
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:39,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, because right now you're gonna have in essence two years of beginning strings.

715
01:16:39,965 --> 01:16:40,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

716
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:48,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that we've always kept some instruments aside or some violins for students who can't afford it.

717
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:58,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as the committee as a whole has been addressing some of the needs of transportation throughout the city, the rental program becomes a question too.

718
01:16:59,288 --> 01:17:02,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think I don't expect you to have all the answers for this right now.

719
01:17:03,392 --> 01:17:07,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly know that there was Mr. Zigny in the past had done everything he can

720
01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:14,700
[SPEAKER_05]: to provide instruments to students who wanted to continue but couldn't necessarily afford it.

721
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:30,405
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, I'd really like you to be looking at that question saying, you know, are we able to provide students with the instruments so that we're not losing students who might be talented musicians, but simply because they can't afford it.

722
01:17:32,329 --> 01:17:34,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, next question, just one more.

723
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:39,672
[SPEAKER_05]: The Quaver Ed that you mentioned, is that a series of lessons?

724
01:17:39,892 --> 01:17:44,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I went online as you were speaking to take a look, but I just wanted to know what we were using it for.

725
01:17:45,475 --> 01:17:46,975
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a series of lessons.

726
01:17:47,015 --> 01:17:48,796
[SPEAKER_02]: There are resources.

727
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:50,017
[SPEAKER_02]: There's PD.

728
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:54,959
[SPEAKER_02]: There are about 10,000 schools in the country that are using it.

729
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:56,740
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very popular program.

730
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:07,505
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the ability to even get students signed up with an individual account, which we did not do this year.

731
01:18:08,065 --> 01:18:13,168
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of options that we can use with that program.

732
01:18:13,788 --> 01:18:14,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So you think it's $7,000 for K-8?

733
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a K-8 program, however,

734
01:18:23,133 --> 01:18:31,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The professional opinion of the music department is that it's most appropriate for K to five.

735
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the activities are really kind of young and that, you know, maybe in some areas of the kind of some schools it is appropriate K to eight, but we thought K to five, it was most appropriate.

736
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cost of this year, I believe was $6,720.

737
01:18:46,151 --> 01:18:47,211
[SPEAKER_02]: For all of our K to eight.

738
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:54,830
[SPEAKER_02]: K-5.

739
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,331
[SPEAKER_02]: We used it for K-5.

740
01:18:56,892 --> 01:18:57,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

741
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:02,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it would have been more money if we said K-8 because they charge per school.

742
01:19:03,278 --> 01:19:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did our four elementary schools.

743
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

744
01:19:09,225 --> 01:19:10,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, do you have some questions?

745
01:19:11,298 --> 01:19:11,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

746
01:19:11,618 --> 01:19:14,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought so.

747
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:21,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we asked the students if they prefer Quaver to what has happened in music at the K to five level in the past?

748
01:19:22,122 --> 01:19:24,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we know how students feel about it?

749
01:19:24,463 --> 01:19:29,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be really interested to know if they prefer this.

750
01:19:31,026 --> 01:19:33,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have not, I will tell you my,

751
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:49,973
[SPEAKER_02]: My observation, my anecdotal collection of data, having been in an elementary music class from again, April to, excuse me, from October to April, is that the kids really enjoyed the music.

752
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,913
[SPEAKER_02]: They enjoyed the lessons.

753
01:19:53,113 --> 01:19:55,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun and it was exciting.

754
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:58,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not scientific, it's not a survey.

755
01:19:59,234 --> 01:20:01,575
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I think, you know, observation is,

756
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one data point, it is my data point.

757
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:19,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly can reach out and try to construct a simple enough survey, depending on surveys, depending on age level for that.

758
01:20:20,175 --> 01:20:21,737
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a supplement, right?

759
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Not- It's a supplement, yes.

760
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so a teacher would use it now and then, not every lesson.

761
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:33,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we used it a lot this year because of the remote instruction.

762
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,752
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the point.

763
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:41,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So in July or June, when I found out that I was

764
01:20:43,754 --> 01:20:56,762
[SPEAKER_02]: When I would be overseeing this department, and we convened a number of meetings over the summer, the thought was we need we need a resource right they the music teachers really wanted to be.

765
01:20:59,089 --> 01:21:01,210
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted people to see their work.

766
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:05,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Last spring, they didn't have the option because of scheduling.

767
01:21:05,553 --> 01:21:11,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they felt, we want people to see our work and we need a tool.

768
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So we investigated tool.

769
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:21,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, there was a teacher, a newer teacher in the department who had used this program previously and thought it was a good program.

770
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:26,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we'll have to look it up to learn more about it.

771
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:31,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the reason, Bernadette, the reason I was asking is because when I think about

772
01:21:33,245 --> 01:21:39,688
[SPEAKER_06]: The feedback I get in my household about music, I haven't received nearly as many complaints this year as I have in past years.

773
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:45,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just gonna be really honest.

774
01:21:45,231 --> 01:21:56,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So having said that, like, I just don't know if that's just because in the pandemic, like it just hasn't floated to the top of our conversation or if the students are enjoying it more.

775
01:21:56,435 --> 01:21:59,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, so I just, I do feel like

776
01:22:00,077 --> 01:22:07,782
[SPEAKER_06]: From my own personal experience, we have opportunity to engage and pull more students into music at the elementary level.

777
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:27,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we talk about the pipeline that grows into the middle school band and the high school band, I think there's a lot of opportunity to make sure that the elementary school kids really love it because it should be a topic that they love and look forward to.

778
01:22:28,313 --> 01:22:36,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I think there, at least in my experience, there's a lot of untapped opportunity there for us.

779
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:54,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the other couple of questions I had around the rental program, like do we have the same rules in place for instrument rentals as we do for athletic user fees?

780
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:59,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm on free and reduced lunch, do I get an instrument rental for free?

781
01:22:59,943 --> 01:23:03,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if I'm on free lunch, do I get instrument rentals for free?

782
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:07,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is that just an atlas?

783
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think so.

784
01:23:08,769 --> 01:23:11,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But because we didn't rent instruments this year, I don't know.

785
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:12,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Haley, do you?

786
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:13,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think.

787
01:23:15,305 --> 01:23:16,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that would be the case.

788
01:23:17,346 --> 01:23:20,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way, it's yes and no.

789
01:23:20,087 --> 01:23:41,577
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that it works, so like for fourth grade, we own violins, the school owns them, and we are able to rent them to the fourth graders for a fee of $25, and that allows fourth graders to try the instruments, and if anyone is on free and reduced lunch, they can fill out a waiver, and we can waive that fee and give them a violin to use for the year for free.

790
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:46,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And they give those back after fourth grade.

791
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:51,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And for fifth grade, we do offer multiple rental options for strings.

792
01:23:52,342 --> 01:23:57,987
[SPEAKER_03]: For fifth grade band, we do not, it's all outsourced through David French Music.

793
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:02,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a company that we provide.

794
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,812
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any real connection to it.

795
01:24:05,232 --> 01:24:10,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the students are given a link, they go online, they provide a credit card, they work it out with the company.

796
01:24:11,117 --> 01:24:11,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is no,

797
01:24:12,618 --> 01:24:14,419
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no program there.

798
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:18,962
[SPEAKER_03]: We have looked in the past at purchasing instruments and trying to set something up.

799
01:24:20,123 --> 01:24:24,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, band instruments are significantly more expensive than string instruments.

800
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,268
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we do have a lot of donations.

801
01:24:28,348 --> 01:24:34,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people will be like cleaning out their attic and say, you know, oh, my son played clarinet and we still have it.

802
01:24:34,692 --> 01:24:35,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you take it?

803
01:24:35,793 --> 01:24:38,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do take a lot of donations and I do fix them up.

804
01:24:39,235 --> 01:24:58,561
[SPEAKER_03]: and we do have a very small amount, so if a student is really interested, I will talk to the teachers, and if they can't afford it, we do, we so far have been pretty successful with being able to hook them up with an instrument so they can at least participate for the year, and if they would like to do more than that, we usually can make it possible, but there really isn't like a formal program in place.

805
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, so I'm just, that's good to know, I'm just thinking about our guitars, so our high school guitars that we bought this this year,

806
01:25:08,198 --> 01:25:11,679
[SPEAKER_02]: We did rent them out, I believe it was the $25.

807
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:16,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there may have been one or two students who couldn't afford it and we just, we let it go.

808
01:25:17,361 --> 01:25:18,022
[SPEAKER_02]: We just let it go.

809
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:20,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

810
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:35,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have seen a good number of, a good amount of chatter among school committee members across the state who are pursuing, you know, parity between fine arts programs and other student,

811
01:25:35,835 --> 01:25:41,039
[SPEAKER_06]: extracurricular activities like athletics, which is why that was sort of top of mind for me.

812
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:56,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And just, you know, I just wanted to make sure I understood what our current program looked like right now so that I could think about, you know, how that fits into our overall goals of equity and accessibility and all that stuff.

813
01:25:57,451 --> 01:26:00,593
[SPEAKER_05]: My personal experience has been that it's,

814
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:10,055
[SPEAKER_05]: been something that if anybody knew of a student and it was brought to Mr. Zigney's attention, magically it happened.

815
01:26:12,116 --> 01:26:14,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been an informal rather than a formal.

816
01:26:15,278 --> 01:26:21,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think kids were cut out, but it was never formalized.

817
01:26:21,122 --> 01:26:21,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay, it is 529.

818
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:31,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, do you have any more questions that you can do in 30 seconds?

819
01:26:31,889 --> 01:26:32,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, that was my last question.

820
01:26:33,009 --> 01:26:33,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

821
01:26:33,509 --> 01:26:34,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to make it?

822
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:35,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody.

823
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:36,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

824
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you being here.

825
01:26:38,712 --> 01:26:39,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call the roll.

826
01:26:39,592 --> 01:26:39,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny?

827
01:26:40,372 --> 01:26:40,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

828
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:41,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let, yes.

829
01:26:41,953 --> 01:26:42,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

830
01:26:42,653 --> 01:26:43,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Right under the wire.

831
01:26:44,094 --> 01:26:51,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny and Superintendent, and if Susie is still on, just if you guys could stay on for a second.

832
01:26:51,677 --> 01:26:51,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

833
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, just so we can talk about the next meeting.

834
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:55,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everyone.

835
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:58,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

836
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,820

837
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:03,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I'm right here.

838
01:27:03,661 --> 01:27:04,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

839
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:04,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

840
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:08,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jenny, just while you're here, so at least there's two.

841
01:27:09,063 --> 01:27:12,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we ask Dr. Cushing to stop the recording?

842
01:27:13,265 --> 01:27:13,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

843
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:14,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
