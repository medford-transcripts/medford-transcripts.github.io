00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:33,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Method Happenings.

2
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:51,870
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I'm your host, John Petrella, and today's show is part of our web-only series where we ask candidates for city council just a couple of questions around the most important issues leading up to the elections.

3
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:58,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, important to know, early voting is now going on

4
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:06,068
[SPEAKER_01]: for the city of Method, so please get out there and elect all our independent candidates.

5
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,151
[SPEAKER_01]: We feature them on our website, which is methodhappenings.com.

6
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:16,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's get to our guest today, a very special guest.

7
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:20,954
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on the show before, long time city councilor.

8
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:24,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go on forever and ever about everything he's done.

9
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:29,938
[SPEAKER_01]: for people and for this city, a really, a really dedicated guy.

10
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick Caviello.

11
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick, thanks for joining us.

12
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,780
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate it.

13
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me on again.

14
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

15
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:43,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I can get into going into like real quickly, your background and everything.

16
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:47,584
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to just give us a few, you know, a couple of minutes, Rick, that's all.

17
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:54,446
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not one to talk in my own home, but, you know, I was 12 years as a city councilor.

18
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:57,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, three terms as a council president.

19
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:04,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, I serve, um, on the library's, um, foundation as a, is as vice president and treasurer.

20
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:11,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've been the former, uh, president and executive director of the chamber of commerce.

21
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:20,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I am twice president of the Meffitt Kiwanis, uh, and one time, uh, earning a distinguished, uh, president award.

22
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also president, uh, former president of

23
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:25,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Method Youth Hockey?

24
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:27,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a bit.

25
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:29,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot more, but we don't have time.

26
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:30,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we did.

27
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:36,506
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so the purpose tonight, Rick, we're trying to focus in on some issues.

28
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,287
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the talk of the town.

29
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:40,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's talking about it.

30
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,630
[SPEAKER_01]: It is affecting everybody in this city, whether they want it to or not.

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,910
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way around this.

32
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:52,092
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'd like to ask, Rick, your opinions

33
00:02:53,574 --> 00:03:06,044
[SPEAKER_01]: what you feel and what do you believe about all the zoning that's going on in this city or is supposed to be going on or that's being pushed, however you want to get into it.

34
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,745
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you give us your opinion?

35
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:09,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

36
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:15,511
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously, the zoning issue is what's driving this year's election.

37
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,835
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the number one question and concern of the MFID.

38
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:21,213
[SPEAKER_00]: voters.

39
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:32,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So, personally, you know, my opinion on this is, yes, there's definitely some zoning changes, most certainly we do.

40
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:43,300
[SPEAKER_00]: All communities go through zoning changes, but to do a whole quick zoning change from commercial to residential,

41
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:48,855
[SPEAKER_00]: in a short period of time is obviously irresponsible.

42
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:55,217
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see what other cities have done, it's taken them four and five years to get this done.

43
00:03:55,917 --> 00:04:05,480
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably do it quicker, but this isn't something that you should be rushing through, maybe because it's an election year.

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,041
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason, it needs to be thought and thought properly.

45
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I think

46
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:17,467
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Medford should be concerned more with our commercial base.

47
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:20,069
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where our tax revenue comes from.

48
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the commercial.

49
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:29,654
[SPEAKER_00]: We've sat back for a while and our commercial has dropped from when I got on the council in 2011, it was at 22%.

50
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:33,436
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down to somewhere nine to 10% commercial base.

51
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So that obviously has to come up.

52
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:43,081
[SPEAKER_00]: We maybe missed the building boom of the last four or five years.

53
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,093
[SPEAKER_00]: when people could have been borrowing money at 2% and 3%.

54
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,095
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much harder now, much higher.

55
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:55,459
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mystic Avenue should be the gateway to the city.

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,620
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the gateway to nothing.

57
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,023
[SPEAKER_00]: John, you and I have lived in this community our whole life.

58
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing on that avenue was changed for as long as we can remember.

59
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:09,188
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say you've got the highway, you have a major highway that runs behind it.

60
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:14,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to a taller building going on the highway side, on the other side of the street.

61
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:19,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Something much smaller than what's been proposed.

62
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:25,329
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Method Square vastly underused.

63
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:32,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we have an opportunity to redo the square with the Hamilton property

64
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:35,218
[SPEAKER_00]: having to come down and that whole block have to come down.

65
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And the city is proposing putting up two other buildings.

66
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:40,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop, take a look.

67
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:43,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this once and do it once right.

68
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:45,088
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the water.

69
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:50,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody talked about the water in any of the proposals.

70
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:52,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Communities die to have a river running through it.

71
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:53,336
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

72
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:54,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Never talked about.

73
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,559
[SPEAKER_00]: We have met we have a square square.

74
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,526
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these small squares that are right for some small smart developments.

75
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:08,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this not the intense story buildings that people are proposing.

76
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,394
[SPEAKER_00]: address each square as needed.

77
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:13,514
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the needs are.

78
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overgrow them.

79
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,557
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the infrastructure to carry them.

80
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:24,279
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't wanna overgrow those communities that are there either, John.

81
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do some smart growth.

82
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading has developed what they call smart growth areas.

83
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:31,903
[SPEAKER_00]: They identify it.

84
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:33,744
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never done anything like that.

85
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's something we should look into.

86
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:41,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are concerned with their neighborhoods too, Rick.

87
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we haven't even got into the neighborhoods.

88
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:50,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, the residential neighborhoods, should they be looked at?

89
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:50,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

90
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:55,354
[SPEAKER_00]: But the changes that are being proposed are just utterly ridiculous now.

91
00:06:56,934 --> 00:07:01,535
[SPEAKER_00]: People purchase single family homes for a reason, because they wanted that small backyard.

92
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:05,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, we have two family areas, we have three, we have mixed areas.

93
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:13,899
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many different types of neighborhoods that aren't bothering anybody and don't really need any major rezoning or any major regrowth either.

94
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody talks about affordable housing.

95
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that gets built now isn't affordable.

96
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:24,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be overpriced.

97
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:28,885
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a city five miles outside of Boston.

98
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:36,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got discovered probably in maybe eight years ago, people found out, I found out, we found Medford.

99
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:39,974
[SPEAKER_00]: We were a quiet, sleepy town and we got discovered.

100
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:44,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happened in Woburn, it's happened in Malden.

101
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:52,584
[SPEAKER_00]: People are discovering these little towns right outside of Boston because of the proximity to the Boston's workplace.

102
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,406
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think you covered it all.

103
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:58,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

104
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate your honesty and the answers.

105
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good to me.

106
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:09,048
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want to bring up one more thing, Rick, before we let you go tonight.

107
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:16,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other big thing coming, we all know what's coming.

108
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,310
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no avoiding it.

109
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the school, New Medford High School.

110
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:25,760
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we go from not hearing anything.

111
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it seems like, you know, we were getting a lot of information.

112
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:33,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's back down to all is quiet.

113
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:36,848
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do know something's got to be done with the school.

114
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,530
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you feel about the school?

115
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you stand on that?

116
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:44,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, John, you know, the school's 55 years old now.

117
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:49,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the second graduating class out of that then new building.

118
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there had been issues.

119
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,329
[SPEAKER_00]: from way back then.

120
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:05,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I do support putting up a new high school or maybe rebuilding that building with Chapter 70 money drying up.

121
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:11,742
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and there's other cities in front of us looking for money for schools too.

122
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:21,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to have to take a look at what direction to go and see what type of reimbursement we'll be getting from the state, which is also a key thing.

123
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:27,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we do another two and a half override or do we do a debt exclusion?

124
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:40,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, talk to people who live in Stoneham and Arlington, who just had just built brand new high schools, the effect on their tax bills.

125
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:50,380
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happened is, is that I think we wasted our two and a half override for $7 million.

126
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:55,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been very vocal on that point.

127
00:09:55,523 --> 00:10:05,891
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the money, we should have, because now it may be two or three years, the city is going to say to the residents again, hey, we want to do another override.

128
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:10,194
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to say, hey, you just did one two years ago.

129
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing coming down the road is the potential, we need to do a fire station.

130
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:19,880
[SPEAKER_00]: How many overrides can the city keep on doing?

131
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:29,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we have a lot of Asian people here who want to live in their houses and can't afford the tax rate.

132
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:35,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind hitting them with another $1,500 to $2,000 a year tax increase.

133
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,213
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do support doing something.

134
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:43,275
[SPEAKER_00]: The students deserve it, and the residents deserve it.

135
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, that enhances your tax base.

136
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:46,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

137
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:46,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

138
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:47,897
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree with you.

139
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:55,820
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's you're talking no matter what we do, you're looking at a lot of money.

140
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:06,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we don't have that industrial commercial base, like you said, it's going to come basically from property owners to homeowners.

141
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a big hit.

142
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:17,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what we can do for creative funding or how you go about doing things, but it's going to be tough, Rick, on a lot of people, that's for sure.

143
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:18,910
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is.

144
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:27,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I mean, John, unfortunately, there is no, the creative funding is either help from the state, which is Chapter 70 in my name.

145
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:36,315
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you know, Representative Donato spoke today on how the federal money coming into the state is drying up.

146
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:40,635
[SPEAKER_00]: which hurts our Chapter 70 funding.

147
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:44,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So where else do we have to go is but to the taxpayer again.

148
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:46,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:49,000
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I hear you.

150
00:11:49,080 --> 00:12:00,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, I know you know what you're talking about, you know, but the school is going to be a big number.

151
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:05,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, we've got to figure out something, either a new one, refurbish, whatever it's going to be.

152
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's all I really got for you, Rick.

153
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:12,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you want to finish up with?

154
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:16,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this, you know, early voting started on Saturday.

155
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:18,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out there and vote this week.

156
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:23,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get out to vote on November 4th.

157
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,434
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask for one of your seven votes.

158
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,957
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask that you also support our independent candidates running.

159
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:35,161
[SPEAKER_00]: People who aren't in lockstep, who aren't being told what to vote for.

160
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:36,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Disagreement is good.

161
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

162
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:37,791
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

163
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:38,271
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

164
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:38,772
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

165
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:39,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

166
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,413
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that anymore.

167
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,595
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lock, stock and barrel done.

168
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:43,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

169
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:43,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

170
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:46,519
[SPEAKER_01]: People of method don't have a voice anymore.

171
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:47,520
[SPEAKER_01]: But all right.

172
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to really thank you, Rick, for coming on.

173

176
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,902
[SPEAKER_01]: help get this city back on the right foot, so to speak.
