00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:11,645
Back to you, Linda.

33
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,450
Thank you, Joe.

34
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:18,912
Again, my name is Linda Walsh, and I am the MassDOT project manager for this project.

35
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:25,935
I'm also joined by several panelists to help with this evening's presentation that I would like to introduce.

36
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:30,616
We have Daniel Flory from our District 4 office in Arlington.

37
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:35,298
We also have Angela Schofield from our right-of-way bureau.

38
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:41,820
And we have our producers, Joe Yu and Christopher Clem, who will be producing this evening's hearing.

39
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:54,231
We also have Amber Christopherson from the Trails and Greenway Program at the Department of Conservation and Recreation, along with Alicia Hunt and Tim McGivern from the City of Medford.

40
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:58,992
Both DCR and the City of Medford are partners with MassDOT on this project.

41
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:03,934
Most of tonight's presentation will be presented to you by Niche Engineering.

42
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:08,055
the design firm hired by the city of Medford.

43
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:14,880
John Michalak is a lead project manager from Niche Engineering, and he will be presenting with me this evening.

44
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:25,108
Last of all, we have David Frazier from Arlington Typing and Mailing, who will be the stenographer, taking a verbatim transcript of this evening's hearing.

45
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:33,114
Throughout the design of this project, the project team listed on this slide will work closely to fulfill all of the requirements needed

46
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:36,020
to advertise and construct this project.

47
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:47,227
Tonight's virtual design public hearing was advertised in several ways.

48
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:55,993
The design public hearing has been advertised in two local newspapers, the Transcript and the Journal and the Everett Independent.

49
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:05,965
Notification of this virtual design public hearing was also posted on MassDOT's and the City of Medford's websites, Facebook, and Twitter accounts.

50
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:23,355
This hearing notice has also been sent to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, known as MAPC, the Medford Council on Aging, the Partners for Youth with Disabilities, the Welcome Project, the Center for Citizens and Social Responsibility, and WAC Medford.

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:47,594
The hearing notice has also been sent to the Mystic River Watershed Association, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, Somerville Bicycle Safety, the Friends of the Mystic to Charles, Our Revolution Medford, the Environmental Business Council, the Friends of the Malden River, and the Gentle Giant Rowing Club.

52
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:55,880
I want to give a special thanks to the Mystic River Watershed Association and the Gaming Commission for being active partners in this project as well.

53
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:04,369
For tonight's presentation, we will begin with a project overview.

54
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:10,730
Explore existing conditions, discuss project goals, and the proposed design.

55
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:20,572
Impacts to the environment, right-of-way impacts, and the next steps before we open the hearing to questions and answers and feedback from the public.

56
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:27,594
It is normal practice to ask elected officials to speak first and then open the hearing to the general public.

57
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:34,810
That will be your opportunity to ask questions, provide feedback, or look for clarification on any of the presentation materials.

58
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,292
Your feedback is important to us, and we certainly encourage and appreciate your participation.

59
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:46,835
I am now going to turn the presentation over to John Michalak from Niche Engineering.

60
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:50,676
Thank you, Linda.

61
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:55,278
I'm John Michalak, the project manager for this project with Niche Engineering.

62
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:15,325
As Linda mentioned, Niche Engineering has been retained by the City of Medford to perform engineering design for the proposed shared-use path connection and timber boardwalk to provide a safe and accessible connection between McDonald Park on the north side of Route 28 and Station Landing located to the south.

63
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:22,471
I would first like to provide a history of the project and how we got to this point in the project design process.

64
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:32,739
The City of Medford received a Massachusetts Gaming Commission Transportation Planning Grant to initiate the design of the proposed project in July of 2019.

65
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:42,286
In March of 2020, the City of Medford initiated the design process with Niche Engineering as their design consultant.

66
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:51,332
Niche Engineering prepared a preliminary design and submitted plans to the DCR and the City of Medford for review in September of 2020.

67
00:08:53,335 --> 00:09:03,621
The project was approved by the Project Review Committee in January of 2021, which made the project eligible for Transportation Improvement Program funding.

68
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:12,787
Niche Engineering prepared 25% design plans and submitted plans to MassDOT for review in February of 2022.

69
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:22,533
The project was initiated by the City of Medford,

70
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:35,898
with assistance from the Mystic River Watershed Association and the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to provide a safe and accessible connection between existing paths on the north and south sides of Route 28.

71
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:42,160
The proposed connection had been previously identified on several regional plans.

72
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:51,984
The Metropolitan Area Planning Council Regional Greenway Network, the Mystic Greenways Initiative by the Mystic River Watershed Association,

73
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:59,745
and the 2009 Mystic River Master Plan created by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.

74
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:12,953
Project stakeholders have identified several objectives that we want to accomplish through the development of this important project.

75
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:16,795
The following goals have been established for the project.

76
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:20,017
Improve bicycle and pedestrian safety,

77
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:38,356
provide a safer connection between McDonald Park to station landing, minimize environmental impacts, create an accessible shared-use path connection, and connect the shared-use path to the new bike lanes recently installed along Route 28.

78
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:50,045
During the early stages of the design process, several alternatives were considered and presented to the project stakeholders.

79
00:10:51,483 --> 00:11:08,272
Alternatives were developed to review various path alignments in order to evaluate impacts to existing trees and vegetation along the Mystic River and determine potential increases to impervious area that would be created through the construction of new asphalt path connections.

80
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:19,058
Through close coordination with the various project stakeholders, a preferred alternative was determined

81
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:22,096
to be advanced to the 25% design level.

82
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:35,704
The preferred alternative was selected to provide path connections for pedestrians and bicyclists to McDonald Park, Station Landing, the new bike lanes on Route 28, and existing sidewalks.

83
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:45,390
A new timber boardwalk is proposed to connect points north and south beneath the existing Felsway Route 28 bridge over the Mystic River.

84
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:55,397
It was also determined that there's a desire to provide two overlooks along the new boardwalk, one looking south along the river and the other looking to the north.

85
00:11:56,338 --> 00:11:59,758
The sketch presented shows the preferred circulation plan.

86
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:07,501
The orange lines represent the new shared use path alignment designed to accommodate both bicycles and pedestrians.

87
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:13,102
The blue lines show proposed connections for pedestrians to McDonald Park

88
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:16,849
and the sidewalks along the Mystic River Bridge and Route 28.

89
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:26,156
Red lines identify the proposed bicycle connections to and from the new bike lanes along 28 and the shared use path connections.

90
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:42,710
The design has progressed from the conceptual design phase where the preferred alternative was selected and the preliminary design has advanced to the plans that we are sharing this evening.

91
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:47,074
The project design is currently at the 25% design level.

92
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:54,355
Several tasks have been completed in order to get to an approved 25% design.

93
00:12:55,236 --> 00:13:01,317
Niche engineering began the design process by conducting on-the-ground topographic survey of the project area.

94
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:10,299
Once the project concepts were evaluated and a preferred alignment selected, niche engineering conducted soil borings along the shore

95
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:15,262
and in the river in order to design the structural elements of the timber boardwalk.

96
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:24,343
We also coordinated with the various public and private utility companies to develop a design that minimizes impacts to adjacent utilities.

97
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:31,905
We conducted a permitting analysis to identify environmental permits that will be required to construct the project.

98
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:39,706
All of these elements were incorporated in the development of the 25% design plans that were submitted to MassDOT.

99
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:54,418
The new shared-use path connection is designed to accommodate both bicycles and pedestrians and is proposed to be 12 feet wide with grassed shoulders on each side.

100
00:13:55,738 --> 00:14:10,027
One-way bicycle connections to and from the new bike lanes on Route 28 will be six feet wide and pedestrian paths connecting to existing sidewalks will be a minimum of six feet wide and will transition to meet existing sidewalk widths.

101
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:23,487
The proposed timber boardwalk is designed to mimic the existing boardwalk on the south side of the river in Somerville, and will provide a 12-foot clear width between timber railings on each side.

102
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:33,975
The timber boardwalk will be supported on structural helical piles, which are installed into the riverbed, which eliminates the need for excavation within the river.

103
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:39,600
Path lighting is proposed along the new boardwalk and shared-use path connections.

104
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:50,373
This plan shows the proposed project area and path alignment as submitted on the 25% design plans.

105
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:55,836
The timber boardwalk is shown in brown and new path connections in gray.

106
00:14:56,677 --> 00:15:05,423
The dark green shows the areas that will be reseeded during construction and the light green represents existing grassed areas that will be maintained.

107
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:08,005
Now I'll turn it back to Linda.

108
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:12,248
Thank you, John.

109
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:25,270
I am now going to turn the presentation over to Angela Schofield from our right-of-way bureau to discuss the procedures that will be used in securing the necessary right-of-way for this project.

110
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:29,532
Thank you, Linda.

111
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:46,277
When the Commonwealth acting through its Massachusetts Department of Transportation Highway Division indicated it would accept this $4.7 million project for funding, the city of Medford and the Department of Conservation and Recreation accepted certain responsibilities.

112
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:55,383
One of these responsibilities is acquiring the necessary rights and private and public lands for the design, construction, and implementation of this project.

113
00:15:56,282 --> 00:16:03,405
My function is to review and recommend procedures that the city of Medford and or DCR will use in acquiring these rights.

114
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:08,148
The procedures used must comply with both federal and state regulations.

115
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:14,591
Affected property owners' rights are protected under our Massachusetts general laws, primarily Chapter 79.

116
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:23,975
And because this project is receiving federal funds, the property owners' rights are further defined under Title III of the Real Property Act of 1970 as amended.

117
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:30,407
At this time, the only needed right-of-way parcels are owned by DCR.

118
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:36,969
DCR will be issuing permits, license, and other agreements as needed for the protection of the federal investment.

119
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:45,212
As the design progresses, if other property owners are impacted by this project, they will be contacted by the City of Medford's municipal officials.

120
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:52,855
They will present the proposed impacts to each owner and discuss the methods with which they may acquire the needed rights for the project.

121
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:59,157
Frequently, municipalities will appeal for donations to minimize the acquisition costs for your community.

122
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:06,600
However, donations are not required, and property owners are entitled to appraisal, review appraisal, and just compensation.

123
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,443
Right-of-way documents will be provided to each owner to help them understand the acquisition process and how the project affects their property.

124
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:20,305
I will be available after the presentation to answer any questions you may have regarding the right-of-way acquisition.

125
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:24,921
I will now turn the presentation back to John from Niche Engineering.

126
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,844
Thank you, Angela.

127
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:40,934
As I previously mentioned, during the development of the 25% design, Niche Engineering identified several environmental permits that will be required to be filed in order to construct the project.

128
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:47,399
The proposed project is within one mile of an environmental justice community

129
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:55,548
and will require filing of an expanded environmental notification form with MEPA, the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act.

130
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:00,491
The work will also require filing with the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

131
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:13,400
As required by the Wetlands Protection Act and City of Medford's Wetlands Ordinance, we will submit a notice of intent to the Medford Conservation Commission and Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.

132
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:21,308
We will also prepare and submit a Chapter 91 water-dependent license to the Department of Environmental Protection.

133
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:31,895
Since the proposed construction will occur on land owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, a construction access permit is required.

134
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:41,322
Proposed construction will occur primarily on the land adjacent to Route 28 and within the Mystic River.

135
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:45,188
Therefore, no roadway closures are proposed during construction.

136
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,550
The proposed work zone is highlighted in red on this plan.

137
00:18:52,150 --> 00:19:04,133
Temporary traffic construction signs will be installed along Route 28 and temporary shoulder or temporary lane impacts may be required in order to construct new ramps and sidewalks along the roadway.

138
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:14,824
The proposed construction will require the temporary closure of sidewalks and paths in order to construct the project.

139
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:24,246
Advanced construction signs will be installed to alert pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles about temporary impacts and sidewalk closures.

140
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:37,870
Once the project is complete, the new paths and timber boardwalk will provide a safe and accessible connection that will allow pedestrians and bicyclists to travel

141
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:45,336
between the north side and the south side of Route 28 without needing to use the signalized crossing at President's Landing.

142
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,580
I will now turn the presentation back over to Linda.

143
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:54,705
Thank you, John, and thank you, Angela.

144
00:19:55,543 --> 00:20:07,534
The next steps will be to address comments that are received at this hearing, and any written comments that are received within 10 calendar days of the hearing will be made part of the public record.

145
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:11,618
The project will then move on to the 75% design stage on or around spring of 2023.

146
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:43,036
Following the advancement of the design in the spring of 2023, the next steps will be to file and complete all environmental permitting in the fall of 23 while moving the design forward to 100% design around the fall winter of 2023 or 2024 with the goal to advertise the project for construction bids in the summer or fall of 2024.

147
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:43,477
Construction

148
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:50,059
will begin in the spring or the summer of 2024.

149
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:59,583
The total project cost is estimated to cost roughly $4.5 million.

150
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:04,885
The Federal Highway Administration will fund up to 80% of the construction cost

151
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:11,186
and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation will fund the remaining 20% of construction costs.

152
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:19,250
The City of Medford and the Department of Conservation and Recreation will be responsible for any right-of-way related costs.

153
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:26,173
There are several ways to reach MassDOT going forward on this project.

154
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,655
You can email comments to the email address on the screen.

155
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:43,386
Mass DOT project management at dot.state.ma.us.

156
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:54,529
You could also submit comments by mail to the address shown on the screen with attention to project management and the project file number 611982.

157
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:03,272
That would be to Carrie E. Lavallee, P.E., Chief Engineer, Mass DOT Highway Division, 10 Park Plaza,

158
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:07,669
Suite 6340, Boston, Mass 02116.

159
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:20,059
You can also visit the MassDOT Design Public Hearing website or simply scan the QR code shown on the screen and send your comments electronically.

160
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,865
You can also mail your written comments to MassDOT using the form included in the handout packet.

161
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:38,613
All of this must be done or postmarked within 10 business days of the hearing to become part of the official record.

162
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:46,020
I want to thank you for your attention to this presentation.

163
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:56,802
I would now like to turn it back over to Joe Yu and Chris Clem, our producers, to inform you of the hearing procedures so we can begin the question and answer session this evening.

164
00:22:57,562 --> 00:23:02,203
It is standard practice to invite elected officials to have the opportunity to speak first.

165
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:05,284
This hearing will remain open until 8 p.m.

166
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,985
or until everyone has had an opportunity to ask their question.

167
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:15,067
Now I'd like to turn it back to our producers and open the hearing up to the public.

168
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:22,216
Thank you very much, Linda.

169
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:29,323
To ask a question verbally, use the raised hand icon and we will give you access to unmute your microphone.

170
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:35,628
If you prefer to type your questions, please use the Q&A box and we will read your questions out loud.

171
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:42,835
Please state your name for your questions and try to ask only one at a time so everyone has the opportunity to participate.

172
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:44,977
To ask a question on the phone,

173
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:50,743
dial star nine and we will call out the last four digits of your number and unmute your audio.

174
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:57,047
Lastly, please take a few minutes to complete a brief survey that will appear after you exit the meeting.

175
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,188
Your feedback is greatly appreciated.

176
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:10,716
First, I would like to welcome Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability from the City of Medford to read a statement from Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

177
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,067
Thank you very much.

178
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,890
Thank you for having us this evening.

179
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:33,805
Mayor Brianna is very sorry she couldn't be here this evening, but she wanted me to convey to you that she's deeply appreciative of MassDOT and DCR of moving this important project forward, and she provided me with this statement to read from her.

180
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:43,640
As we all know, Route 28 is a difficult road for pedestrians and bicyclists to cross, particularly along the stretch between Wellington Circle and the Mystic River.

181
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:53,486
Having this underpass to allow people to connect between the apartment buildings, hotels, and businesses at Station Landing and the T Station to McDonald Park

182
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:56,628
will make visiting this large park easier and more inviting.

183
00:24:57,328 --> 00:25:05,152
Additionally, we really like the inclusion of the overlooks that will allow people to enjoy the river and get a closer look at some of our beautiful wildlife.

184
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:18,099
Thank you to the staff at MassDOT, DCR, the Mystic River Watershed Association, and of course, the City of Medford staff and our consultants at Niche Engineering for all of the work on this important project.

185
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,820
Thank you.

186
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:22,742
Thank you very much, Alicia.

187
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,830
We are now open for questions.

188
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,112
I will start with the raised hands.

189
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:33,557
I see Christopher, you can unmute yourself and ask your question.

190
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:43,846
Hi there, I'm sorry, I had a hard time understanding like what is the surface of the path going to look like as it approaches the part that stretches around the water?

191
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:50,332
And then as the kind of the part that is the deep loop, what will the path surface be made of?

192
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,086
John.

193
00:25:56,147 --> 00:26:15,134
Sure, so the proposed path surface is going to be asphalt and the timber boardwalk is proposed to be constructed of Ipe decking, which is the same hardwood that was used by the DCR on the timber boardwalk on the Somerville side.

194
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:23,497
So the intent was for this this path and boardwalk to mimic what was built on the South side of the river in Somerville.

195
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,970
Thank you, John, and thank you for your question, Christopher.

196
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:35,013
I'll move to the questions in the written box.

197
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:38,875
I do want to acknowledge a question that was somewhat answered.

198
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:43,457
From Lynn asks if we can please show relevant plans during the Q&A.

199
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:49,800
So I will ask the project team if there's a specific slide you'd like to return to, please just ask.

200
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:57,504
Next, from Sharman, during construction, will temporary walkways be maintained?

201
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:02,036
Don?

202
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:03,957
Yes, thanks for the question.

203
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:10,642
We will maintain temporary access for pedestrians and along the paths.

204
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:27,455
We'll be developing more detailed construction phasing plans and detailing how those temporary paths will be maintained during construction during the next design phase, and they'll be included in the final design plans that will be submitted to MassDOT.

205
00:27:31,678 --> 00:27:33,118
Thank you, John, and thank you for your question.

206
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:38,240
We have another question in the Q&A box, actually, from Charmin again.

207
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,722
The question is, what entity is responsible for maintaining the pedestrian and bicycle paths?

208
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:50,864
When there is snow, the Route 28 bridge never gets plowed and becomes treacherous.

209
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:55,685
Any consideration to include the maintenance of the sidewalk on the bridge?

210
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:08,255
I'm happy to take a stab at this and I'd like to, I may be calling on some of my panelists to also help out to answer your question about maintaining the pedestrian and bicycle paths.

211
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:14,457
The paths themselves that are going to be on DCR property will be maintained by DCR.

212
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:21,180
The roadway, which is under the jurisdiction of the state, MassDOT would be controlled in

213
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:23,139
maintained by the state.

214
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:31,162
So when there is snow on Route 28 bridge, if it's on the bridge structure itself, the roadway, that is under the control of MassDOT.

215
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:39,866
If you have any questions or concerns during snow emergencies, please reach out to our District 4 office in Arlington.

216
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:43,347
So any considerations?

217
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:53,910
DCR will not be maintaining the sidewalk on the bridge or neither will the city of Medford.

218
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,452
If Medford has anything to add to this, Tim, or anybody from DCR, please feel free to jump in.

219
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,453
But this is a state infrastructure and the state will be handling that.

220
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:09,735
Linda, you have that correct.

221
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:10,895
Right.

222
00:29:12,013 --> 00:29:13,194
Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing.

223
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:21,041
DCR will plow the boardwalk structure that goes over the river and the paths around it, but not the bridge itself, the vehicular bridge.

224
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:24,404
Great, thank you.

225
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:25,445
Thanks for your question.

226
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:28,888
Thank you everyone.

227
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,531
We have another raised hand from the crowd.

228
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:36,415
Zachary, you can unmute yourself and ask your question.

229
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:42,799
Hi there, I just have a question about where the path meets the Felsway.

230
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,560
Can we go back to that slide for a minute?

231
00:29:50,104 --> 00:30:02,233
So, I mean, from my experience of being on a bike and getting onto there, so right now you have to get onto the sidewalk and then basically dumped out onto a highway right there.

232
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:04,429
with very little protection.

233
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:11,751
Is there any, is it within the scope of this project to add like Jersey barriers right there to protect the bike lane a bit?

234
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:18,454
I mean, I feel like there should be Jersey barriers the entire way on Route 28 to protect the cyclists.

235
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:28,558
But I mean, especially where the bikes are coming out onto that path, seems like a potential area where a car doesn't see you right away and then now you're there.

236
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,680
John, do you want to add anything?

237
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:34,517
answer that question.

238
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:42,981
I know that the bike lanes were installed as part of a separate project that was funded.

239
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:46,662
I believe it was initiated by the city of Somerville.

240
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:58,227
I'm not sure if they've installed yet, but I believe they're supposed to be those plastic stanchions that separate the bike lane from the travel lane.

241
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:01,728
I'm not sure if Tim's

242
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:05,849
more up to speed on the status of that project being completed.

243
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,350
Yeah.

244
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:14,355
So it sounds like it's outside the scope of our project, but there is another project that potentially could be addressing this concern.

245
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:17,778
So I'm going to actually let Tim answer and see if he has anything to add.

246
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:27,745
I don't have much to add other than we, Medford is advocating to try to keep the bike lanes there and improve these.

247
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,287
This is outside of Medford's jurisdiction, so we're advocating for that.

248
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:42,656
The engineering division has been working closely with Somerville on that particular project and we continue to do that and continue to take feedback and make improvements.

249
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:50,263
Thanks, everyone, and thank you, Zachary.

250
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:54,679
And we do have another comment in the Q&A box.

251
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:55,740
This is again from Charmin.

252
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,420
Keep them coming.

253
00:31:57,842 --> 00:32:01,486
They say, I have lived in the 10 Hills neighborhood for close to 40 years.

254
00:32:02,107 --> 00:32:04,349
Route 28 bridge has never been cleared from snow.

255
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:08,253
Thank you for your comment.

256
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:23,301
Unfortunately, that's outside the purview of this evening's hearing, but I will ask the District 4 staff that's on the call this evening to relay that information back to District 4 snow and ice engineer.

257
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:32,263
And again, if you, you know, if there are issues during a snow emergency or even before the snow emergency, please reach out to District 4.

258
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:39,239
I'm not sure if anybody, I'm not sure who the snow and ice engineer is in district four.

259
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,240
Dan, do you, do you happen to know who that is?

260
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,941
So we can relate, give that name to Charmin.

261
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:51,446
Hey Linda, this is Dan here.

262
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:57,850
Actually, Brett Lushen is a good person to contact and also

263
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:09,449
I can also take, I can take information from that person and reach out directly to them so I can give them not only email, also a telephone number to contact.

264
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:10,570
Okay, great.

265
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,430
Thank you, Dan.

266
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,131
And again, I apologize.

267
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:23,376
This is, it's just, it's not, it's not really a part of the discussion this evening, but you know, obviously we want to help you and help alleviate some of your concerns if we can.

268
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:28,418
So please reach out to the District 4 in Arlington office, like Dan had suggested.

269
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:31,832
Thank you, Dan.

270
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:32,393
Thank you, Linda.

271
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,474
And thank you, Sharman, for your comments.

272
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:38,497
We appreciate the perspective from someone who has lived in the area for so long.

273
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:48,064
I don't see any raised hands or questions at this time, but please don't be shy.

274
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:50,046
The project team is eager to help.

275
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:51,167
Oh, right on cue.

276
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:54,669
Ryan, you may unmute yourself and ask a question.

277
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,091
Hey, everyone.

278
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:58,532
My name is Ryan O'Malley.

279
00:33:58,552 --> 00:33:59,673
I'm with the Malden City Council.

280
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:07,202
I just want to thank the project team for making this project come to fruition and really looking forward to it.

281
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:07,822
Thank you.

282
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:13,145
Thank you, Councillor.

283
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:14,906
We appreciate your support.

284
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,229
Thank you for the comment, Ryan.

285
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,251
We have another raised hand from Lynn.

286
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:25,512
Oops, I clicked on the wrong person.

287
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:26,693
Sorry about that.

288
00:34:26,793 --> 00:34:27,133
One second.

289
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:29,915
Lynn, you may unmute yourself.

290
00:34:31,495 --> 00:34:32,035
Thank you.

291
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:36,316
This is Lynn Weissman with the Friends of the Community Path.

292
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:41,237
So it's super exciting to see this project being designed.

293
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:51,620
You know, even though the community path is kind of on the other side, somewhere, we're always looking for regional path connections.

294
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,240
And this is a pretty key node.

295
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,321
I was wondering, I had a few kind of questions.

296
00:34:58,361 --> 00:34:59,882
I mean, one is I'm wondering if

297
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:25,887
you know, in terms of people being able to cross Route 28, what the walkability options will be during the construction, just so that people aren't kind of walking on the highway or biking on the highway, and if there'll be adequate, some way of adequately crossing so that people aren't just deciding to

298
00:35:26,473 --> 00:35:29,755
to walk along Route 28 unprotected.

299
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:35,119
I'm wondering if the width is 12 feet on the other side as well.

300
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:39,462
And I'm really glad to see you added overlooks in the design.

301
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:40,843
That's pretty key.

302
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:51,770
And I wanted to note that, you know, I think there was supposed to be like a Jersey barrier project.

303
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,451
I thought over Route 28,

304
00:35:55,052 --> 00:36:04,616
um and that you know bicycle bollards really aren't enough to protect cyclists along that area.

305
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:16,600
People go very fast and there's a lot of traffic and you know a bollard might alert some drivers but it is it is not ample protection and so we would ask

306
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:34,327
I guess, mass DOT and the city of Somerville to kind of coordinate a little bit on this to potentially save some lives and use Jersey barriers there and not just simply bicycle bollards.

307
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:43,731
I wasn't sure if that was only on the Somerville side or if it was both on the Somerville Medford side too, that some sort of protection was going to happen.

308
00:36:44,672 --> 00:37:03,902
My three questions are about width, what are the ways pedestrians and cyclists can get across during construction, and just sort of taking another look at Jersey barriers for bike protection there.

309
00:37:05,582 --> 00:37:05,923
Thank you.

310
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,242
Well, thank you, Lynn, for your comments.

311
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:28,363
Before I ask John from NICH to respond to some of those questions, and maybe, Tim, given anybody else to jump in, I did want to remind you that you can write in and send your comments, questions, or concerns to us within 10 business days, and we'll be also happy to respond to them.

312
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:33,726
You did have a lot of questions there, so I'm going to ask John to try to answer them.

313
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:39,268
You talked about width, you talked about crossing Route 28, and you talked about Jersey barriers.

314
00:37:39,328 --> 00:37:46,612
So, John, if you could maybe try to address Lynn's concerns, and also Tim, if you have anything to add, please feel free to jump in.

315
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:48,092
Sure.

316
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:56,196
The first question regarding the width, yes, this is going to be the same width as the boardwalk and the path approaches on the Somerville side.

317
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,388
So that was 12 feet, and this is going to be 12 feet.

318
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:04,332
So that gives you an idea of the width that this is going to provide.

319
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:13,841
As far as the crossing, right now, in order to cross 28, people have to cross at the crosswalk across from President's Landing.

320
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:19,467
So that would still be in effect for people to cross.

321
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:23,643
Oh, I actually been crossing from Assembly Square over.

322
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:40,889
I didn't know where you were saying there would be, will there be disruption crossing Route 28 from Assembly Square to the Wellington area or something else?

323
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:48,332
There might be while we're working on the sidewalk, but as I'd mentioned, we'll make sure that there's a temporary

324
00:38:49,545 --> 00:38:52,586
access to get around any sidewalk work.

325
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:57,869
But most of the work is going to be occurring on new path alignments.

326
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,330
And as I said, we'll maintain pedestrian access.

327
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:14,656
So they may need to go around or have a temporary bypass of that portion of the sidewalk when we're tying the path into the existing sidewalk, because they'll have to pour some new concrete panels along the sidewalk.

328
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:18,738
And then they usually take a day or two to dry before people can walk on them.

329
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:34,480
And as far as protection more than the plastic bollards, I'm not aware of what that project entails or whether they are doing something in Somerville.

330
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:42,446
So I'm sorry, I don't know if anybody else on the panel knows more about the progress of that project.

331
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:47,010
I know that that project had minimal funding and it was really just to get the bike lanes

332
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:58,587
try to get that space for bicyclists to be able to use traveling over the bridge, but I'm not sure of any other major safety improvements.

333
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:01,189
That's correct, John.

334
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:08,753
I was just going to chime in to say I wasn't aware of any additional improvements like Jersey barriers, but that is excellent feedback.

335
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,355
I've rode my bike over this bridge as well.

336
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:13,340
So I know what you're talking about.

337
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:22,175
And as I stated before, we're always interested in hearing feedback and seeing if we can make improvements and advocate for solutions.

338
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:33,810
Thanks john and Tim I just wanted to add as well so you know I'm your concerns about you know sidewalks being open and access during construction.

339
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:44,053
You know we are, we are required by law to provide access and accessibility to the public during construction on any of our projects.

340
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:54,138
There will be a resident engineer assigned to the project when the construction begins from MassDOT and that person will always be available to address any of those concerns.

341
00:40:54,979 --> 00:41:05,485
Also, a lot of that will be worked out when we bid the project for construction and whoever the contractor is that receives the bid, they have a responsibility to provide the means and methods.

342
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:07,846
to construct any project.

343
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:19,973
So you can rest assured that a lot of time, thought, and effort will be given to making sure that it's accessible at all times and open to the public and safely as well.

344
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:21,815
So thank you for your comments.

345
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:24,136
I hope that answered all of them.

346
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:27,278
I'm not sure if anybody else has anything to add, but

347
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:35,723
You can always, after, reach out to the appropriate city or town that you may have concerns with.

348
00:41:35,783 --> 00:41:46,589
I know that this project borders several cities and their hair being represented, and we've been working with them in partnership.

349
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:54,173
But again, this particular project is in Medfit, so Medfit can really only answer for what they're doing in their own city.

350
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:55,894
But thank you.

351
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,295
I think we have a couple more questions, Chris.

352
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:00,176
We do.

353
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:01,217
Thank you, everyone, for answering.

354
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:03,058
And thank you, Lynn, for your comments.

355
00:42:03,198 --> 00:42:07,481
And we encourage you to submit those in writing as well, using the information on the screen.

356
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:14,625
Next, we have another comment from Charmin, who says, the boardwalk on the south side of the bridge is great.

357
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:16,487
Thanks for doing it on the north side.

358
00:42:18,487 --> 00:42:19,408
We appreciate that.

359
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:21,770
I think it's going to be a great, great addition.

360
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,313
I've been out there several times myself and I'm really impressed.

361
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:34,820
And then I do think by adding the outlooks, it's really adding an additional great feature to, you know, this particular, this boardwalk as well.

362
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,481
So, but thank you for your comments.

363
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,865
We have another comment from Chris.

364
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:52,897
They say, just as an aside, I'm so glad it's an asphalt and wood surface on the boardwalk structure, as opposed to the softer material closer to the Alfred Bridge on the Somerville side.

365
00:42:53,597 --> 00:42:56,378
That softer rubber material is really hard to bike on.

366
00:42:56,878 --> 00:43:00,119
My tires cut into it, and it's already degrading, unfortunately.

367
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,320
Thanks, Chris, for your comments.

368
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,260
We appreciate it.

369
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:07,701
Thank you, Chris.

370
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:20,991
Lynn asks if she can see the plan again, please.

371
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:28,895
I'm not sure what plan she's referring to.

372
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:34,898
One second.

373
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:40,100
Lynn, if you'd like to specify, I can give you access to unmute your mic again.

374
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:47,044
Hi, I'm just the one you showed just before with the overlooks.

375
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:48,725
I think it's just helpful.

376
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:52,908
Yeah, thank you.

377
00:43:52,928 --> 00:43:58,792
I think that.

378
00:43:58,812 --> 00:43:59,152
Thank you.

379
00:44:04,336 --> 00:44:06,917
So we will keep it on the slide for as long as you all like.

380
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:09,539
We have another question in the chat.

381
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,561
Karen says,

382
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:18,200
Permeable services are important, but the technology and costs are not quite accessible.

383
00:44:27,227 --> 00:44:31,070
I'm a little unclear on what, if it's a question or just a comment.

384
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,531
I think it's just a comment.

385
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:35,273
Yes, so thank you.

386
00:44:37,182 --> 00:44:38,223
Thank you for your comment, Karen.

387
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:40,586
Feel free to keep them coming, folks.

388
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:43,189
We appreciate all of your feedback, all your participation.

389
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:07,274
As a reminder, you do have 10 business days to submit written comments and questions via email or via snail mail.

390
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:18,718
You can go to our website, mass.highwaysdesignpublichearings, and find the design public hearing page for this particular project.

391
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,280
So we do have another question from Charmin.

392
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:27,362
They ask, what is the timeframe for construction?

393
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:39,858
There is a slide as far as, I guess I'll defer to John as far as how many construction seasons do you expect that this is going to take?

394
00:45:39,878 --> 00:45:46,583
I would think it depends on what time of year it gets advertised.

395
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:58,392
Typically, a project like this could be done in one year, but there have been supply chain shortages, and I'm not sure what the construction

396
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:05,079
environment is going to be like when we try to start construction in 2024.

397
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,541
Hopefully, there are no issues.

398
00:46:09,202 --> 00:46:16,208
Ideally, we advertise it in the winter, give the contractor enough time to order his materials so that he can get started right in the spring.

399
00:46:16,928 --> 00:46:21,392
And if that's the case, then I would anticipate it could be done in one construction season.

400
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:24,795
Thank you, John.

401
00:46:28,797 --> 00:46:29,917
Thank you for your question, Sharman.

402
00:46:30,598 --> 00:46:31,698
Appreciate your participation.

403
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:41,462
I just wanted to remind everyone that it is 748 and we will be here until at least eight o'clock to answer your questions.

404
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:47,945
We're obligated to stay on until at least eight o'clock, so please feel free to ask any additional questions.

405
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:51,847
We'd really like to help you understand the project and

406
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:56,110
answer any questions, receive any feedback, comments.

407
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:03,954
Again, if you have any, you know, if you don't feel comfortable tonight speaking, feel free to send in your written comments to us.

408
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:08,937
If they come in within 10 business days, they become part of the record.

409
00:47:09,717 --> 00:47:11,959
But that doesn't mean that, you know, you can't send them.

410
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:18,222
I mean, we're here, we're available, we're willing to answer any of your questions as things come along.

411
00:47:19,057 --> 00:47:22,239
Like I mentioned, I'm the project manager on this project.

412
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:27,501
I will be involved in this project from this point forward and even through construction.

413
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:47,892
But District 4 in Arlington is the district that oversees this area, and they will have a resident engineer on site during the construction who's a person who's going to be there to answer any residents' concerns or questions during the construction of the project.

414
00:47:54,845 --> 00:48:02,290
Hearing no questions, I just didn't know, does the city or DCR have anything that they want to add tonight?

415
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:12,196
I'd like to add one comment.

416
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,037
Again, this is Amber from DCR.

417
00:48:14,077 --> 00:48:16,559
I just saw the question about the path by Alford Street.

418
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:19,441
We are aware of the condition of that path and working on it.

419
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,063
It's a partnership with the T.

420
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:25,937
we understand that there are challenges on that path.

421
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:36,458
Thanks, Linda.

422
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:49,001
I know I read the statement from the mayor, but Amber and I started this project together several years ago with the Gaming Commission grant, and we've had a MassTrails grant to advance the design work on this.

423
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:58,662
So I personally am very excited to see this actually moving into the MassDOT stream and seeing it move into the construction phases.

424
00:48:59,242 --> 00:49:01,343
It's very rewarding to see a project

425
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:09,511
That we've thought for a long time should exist and then on grant funding to get design going to actually seeing it move forward.

426
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:11,814
So we're really excited about this.

427
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:14,076
We appreciate it.

428
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:21,504
Now we'll continue to be around as far as long as people, you know, mass stop whatever you need for to move this forward.

429
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,020
Thank you for your comments, Alicia and Amber.

430
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:30,702
We do have one more question in the chat.

431
00:49:31,183 --> 00:49:32,123
It is, again, from Lynn.

432
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:44,933
Lynn asks, please describe any directionality of the lighting over the boardwalk at the river, in parentheses, or beyond, so as to minimize impacts on wildlife in the area.

433
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:47,935
Great question.

434
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:53,459
I'm actually going to ask John to pick up on that, and I think that also is going to come into play with our environmental permitting as well.

435
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:55,167
Correct.

436
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:59,269
We haven't decided on the actual light fixtures yet.

437
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:02,190
That happens during the final design phase.

438
00:50:03,171 --> 00:50:09,874
Since this is a DCR structure and it's going to be on DCR property, we're going to work closely with the DCR.

439
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:18,317
But questions about the lighting and reduction and uplighting have been brought up by the stakeholders.

440
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:21,999
So that's something that will be considered when we choose the fixtures.

441
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:27,197
But I'm sorry, at this stage in the design, we haven't chosen the fixtures yet.

442
00:50:27,217 --> 00:50:30,780
So that's a good question.

443
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:40,368
I can just add on behalf of DCR, we are committed to dark sky principles when we can and reducing the impact of lighting while maintaining safety.

444
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:43,771
So as John said, we'll work through those details in the coming year.

445
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,594
Thank you, John and Amber.

446
00:50:50,096 --> 00:50:51,497
Thank you very much for your question, Lynn.

447
00:50:56,859 --> 00:50:58,860
We have another question from Joan.

448
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,943
Joan asks, will there be trash receptacles so folks don't toss trash in the water?

449
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,446
I'm going to guess yes.

450
00:51:12,126 --> 00:51:19,330
But I'm going to ask maybe Amber to speak to that as far as what DCR's policies and procedures usually are on trash receptacles.

451
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:25,024
Yeah, we have had an evolving policy on trash receptacles.

452
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:28,365
So as of now, they are not provided on projects like this.

453
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:35,987
It's a carry in carry out, which I know can be challenging in urban environments, but there will not be any in this vicinity.

454
00:51:39,668 --> 00:51:40,008
Lamber.

455
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,812
Thank you, and that is a great question john Thank you.

456
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:56,720
We have a question from counselor Winslow in Malden welcome counselor Thank you for joining us i'm very excited to this long expected connection.

457
00:51:58,341 --> 00:52:03,625
At one point, I thought presidents landing in Medford was contributing are they contributing question mark.

458
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:17,574
I'm actually answer that because I saw an initial design from 2005 that was funded by national development and it didn't go further than that.

459
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:23,477
So they're not now, but there is a reason why you think that.

460
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:26,599
Thank you, Amber.

461
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:26,919
Yeah.

462
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:31,361
As far as I know, there's no, there's no money involved in it that I'm aware of.

463
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,943
So this is.

464
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:40,844
This is 80% federal funded and 20% state funded.

465
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:47,586
And then there's a lot of grants to pay for the design as we indicated throughout the presentation.

466
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:50,546
And Steve, I'm happy to see you.

467
00:52:50,606 --> 00:52:52,667
I've known Steve for a really long time.

468
00:52:52,827 --> 00:52:57,288
So happy to see you're still around and very involved in the bike community.

469
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:58,829
You've been a great advocate.

470
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,370
Thank you very much for your question, Councillor.

471
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:06,586
We have another question in the chat from Joan.

472
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:16,728
Joan asks, will Medford or the nearby property owners provide some trash receptacles outside the DCR property before and after the pathway?

473
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:23,870
Joan, I don't think we're in a position to answer what other property owners will do, unfortunately.

474
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:33,032
I think that's something you should follow up with the city of Medford and see if they can maybe help broker a discussion regarding that.

475
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:40,588
Thank you, Linda.

476
00:53:42,588 --> 00:53:44,209
We have another question from Charmin.

477
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:47,489
I thought I was done asking questions.

478
00:53:47,709 --> 00:53:48,530
Keep them coming, please.

479
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:53,710
The engineers might want to take a look at the south boardwalk where it runs under 28.

480
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:59,171
Pigeons roost on the bridge beams, and there's always poop on the walkway and railings.

481
00:53:59,812 --> 00:54:02,812
Can screenings be installed to deter pigeons?

482
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:07,333
John, I'm going to defer to you on that.

483
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:13,939
I would say that's a good comment.

484
00:54:14,479 --> 00:54:18,022
We haven't discussed that yet, but we can talk to MassDOT.

485
00:54:18,203 --> 00:54:31,594
It is their bridge, and if there's something that can be done and what recommendations either they would have or our structure engineers would have to try to address that problem.

486
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:33,436
But thanks for bringing that up.

487
00:54:33,476 --> 00:54:35,518
That's not something that had been mentioned before.

488
00:54:42,168 --> 00:54:44,189
Thank you, John, and thank you for your comment, Sharmin.

489
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:48,432
We have another comment in the chat from Lynn.

490
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:53,135
They ask, any solar-powered lighting in this project?

491
00:54:53,796 --> 00:55:00,520
Also agree on the need for recycling and trash receptacles that are regularly emptied, better that than in the river.

492
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:07,409
I'm not sure on the solar powered lighting.

493
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:13,033
I'm not sure if we've gotten that far in the design, but John, do you have anything to add or Amber?

494
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:21,200
And again, I'll defer you back to the city on the trash receptacles and the emptying of those.

495
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,964
I think that you could reach out to the city regarding that, but John, do you mind answering?

496
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:32,809
There are existing electrical connections already for

497
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:39,488
like poles one or two on the north side and there was one on the south side at one point.

498
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:46,735
So the plan right now is to use the existing electrical connections and we've coordinated with the utility companies.

499
00:55:47,796 --> 00:55:52,080
But we can talk to the DCR if there's a desire to go solar.

500
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:54,842
We have done that before on other projects.

501
00:55:56,364 --> 00:55:59,967
Yeah, I think that's something that could be explored and fits in with our

502
00:56:00,545 --> 00:56:07,208
climate mitigation goals and we're trying to pilot more solar lighting, particularly in places without electrical conduits already.

503
00:56:07,408 --> 00:56:09,068
But you're right, there already are some here.

504
00:56:09,088 --> 00:56:12,270
So I think we'll just have to kind of weigh the cost benefit on that.

505
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:22,574
But it's a great question and something that we're trying to start incorporating into our normal practice where possible based on, you know, relationship to the sun and solar gain and all that.

506
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,736
Thanks, Amber and John.

507
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,133
I'm sorry, thank you for your comment, Lynn.

508
00:56:33,753 --> 00:56:34,294
Thank you.

509
00:56:35,334 --> 00:56:50,761
Chris, I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna, we're gonna definitely leave it open if anybody has any more questions, but I'm going to give everybody maybe another minute, you know, minute or so to ask any questions, hands raised, and then we can begin to close out the hearing if nobody else has any questions.

510
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:55,223
But again, you know, we're here until your questions are answered.

511
00:56:55,403 --> 00:56:55,823
But um,

512
00:56:59,742 --> 00:57:00,482
I see one now.

513
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:03,103
Yep, there's one more from Lynn.

514
00:57:03,744 --> 00:57:07,165
They ask, any wayfinding signage in the project?

515
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:10,627
John, you want to answer that?

516
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:20,751
So we have talked to the DCR, especially the landscaping and parks department about what type of signage.

517
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:22,752
It hasn't been designed yet.

518
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,632
We have talked about

519
00:57:24,587 --> 00:57:34,590
how to tie this in and make people aware of McDonald Park since this is essentially one of the entrances to McDonald Park.

520
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:47,174
But it's a smaller area, so I'm not sure how much signage we'd actually get, but we are working with DCR on any amenities and signage.

521
00:57:48,792 --> 00:58:03,473
Yeah, the thinking right now is maybe a kiosk at the entry into McDonald Park and potentially interpretive signage on the overlooks, we need to figure out what communication, what we would communicate and where it would go, but.

522
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:22,910
If I might add to that, while it's not directly part of this project, Medford has been piloting a wayfinding signage project for bikes and pedestrians, mostly in the area of Medford Square.

523
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:42,524
And we're very much taking feedback on that and we would be very open to receiving input about what sort of wayfinding would be helpful down in this area, because we we are looking to expand pedestrian and bicycle wayfinding, you know, the kind that says how far, how long it'll take to walk and how long

524
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:45,606
it'll take to bicycle to various locations.

525
00:58:46,547 --> 00:58:48,588
So I do actually encourage you to send that.

526
00:58:49,269 --> 00:59:04,880
And if you wanted to send something like that directly to my office, that's not related to this project, my office's email account is the letters OCD, it used to be Office of Community Development, so OCD at medford-ma.gov.

527
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:17,269
And we also have a newsletter that where we put out information about programs like this, and programs like the way finding and other things and this kind of meeting.

528
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:23,373
You're welcome to email us to be added to the newsletter it's the easiest way for me to tell you right now in this meeting.

529
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:24,273
Right.

530
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,436
Thank you, Alicia amber john everyone.

531
00:59:27,456 --> 00:59:29,277
I see another question.

532
00:59:30,143 --> 00:59:31,884
We have one question from Dave.

533
00:59:32,284 --> 00:59:38,646
Dave asks, are there existing or planned water bottle filling stations adjacent to the planned work?

534
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:44,188
I'm not sure if Amber wants to answer this or John.

535
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:57,992
I mean, I could say at this time we haven't discussed what types of amenities, if any, would be installed along this section of path and I'm not sure

536
00:59:58,893 --> 01:00:03,074
the DCR's policy is and how often they install these?

537
01:00:03,094 --> 01:00:06,115
Yeah, it's a good question.

538
01:00:07,195 --> 01:00:15,518
We haven't discussed that yet, but it's not just an initial cost, it's an operations question, so we'll have to look into that.

539
01:00:16,978 --> 01:00:17,158
Great.

540
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:18,221
Thank you.

541
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:29,169
I just want to remind everyone that this plan is at 25% design and a lot of your questions and comments will be considered as the design advances forward.

542
01:00:29,189 --> 01:00:32,551
They're very helpful and useful comments.

543
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:38,155
The purpose of the hearing tonight is to gather all these comments and then take them back and see what can be implemented.

544
01:00:39,216 --> 01:00:41,698
You know, like you said, it's DCR property, a lot of

545
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:51,425
a lot of the policies will be driven by DCR policies in conjunction with MassDOT approvals and federal approvals as well.

546
01:00:51,965 --> 01:01:05,155
So we do really do have a great partnership here of working together with many groups, the city, DCR, MassDOT, and we really appreciate your comments this evening and

547
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:13,030
Sorry, we can't give you definitives on some of them, but they're definitely good comments and the design is at 25%.

548
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:23,533
We still need to go to 75%, then 100%, and then what we call PS&E, which is plan, specs, and estimates, and that's when we advertise the project for construction bids.

549
01:01:29,654 --> 01:01:30,114
Thanks, Linda.

550
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:31,815
That's all excellent information.

551
01:01:33,154 --> 01:01:45,062
We do have one final comment from Lynn, says signage to the Northern Strand Path and Assembly Square slash Darrell 7 will be great.

552
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:47,604
Path etiquette signage would be good too.

553
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:50,906
Thank you, Lynn, for your comment.

554
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:55,849
I think that that's a question and a comment to be sent to Alicia.

555
01:01:55,869 --> 01:02:01,733
I encourage you to reach out to her after this hearing and provide her with, you know, your

556
01:02:02,257 --> 01:02:12,897
Your comments regarding signage and way findings and hopefully that you can work into her program sounds like an exciting opportunity and something that would really be beneficial.

557
01:02:28,242 --> 01:02:30,844
I want to thank everyone once more for their questions and comments.

558
01:02:31,945 --> 01:02:34,067
All been great participating this evening.

559
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:36,249
We are past eight o'clock.

560
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:46,498
So at this time, unless there are any last second questions, I will pass it back to Linda to finish with our closing remarks.

561
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:47,339
Great.

562
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:50,182
Seeing none.

563
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:52,515
Thank you, Chris.

564
01:02:52,655 --> 01:02:54,016
Thank you, everyone, this evening.

565
01:02:54,716 --> 01:02:59,277
Since there are no further questions, we'd like to thank you for your time and interest in this project.

566
01:02:59,937 --> 01:03:03,018
When the hearing closes this evening, you will receive a survey.

567
01:03:03,038 --> 01:03:06,679
It would be very helpful if you could complete that survey.

568
01:03:07,299 --> 01:03:14,941
As previously mentioned, we encourage you to submit any feedback or comments in writing or by using the email address previously provided.

569
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:17,661
This concludes our hearing for the evening.

570
01:03:18,342 --> 01:03:20,042
I hereby declare this evening

571
01:03:20,382 --> 01:03:22,773
hearing closed at 8 0 5 p.m.

572
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:25,385
Thank you and have a wonderful evening.
