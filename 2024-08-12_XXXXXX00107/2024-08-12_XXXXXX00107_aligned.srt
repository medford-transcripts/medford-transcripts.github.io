1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,491
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:11,372
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,755
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:17,817
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,139
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,326
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,210
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,712
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:45,644
Thanks so much for meeting with me today.

10
00:00:45,964 --> 00:00:49,385
If you don't mind just by introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

11
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:51,146
Sure.

12
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:53,446
I'm Jenny Graham, she, her pronouns.

13
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:57,907
I am the vice chair of the school committee.

14
00:00:57,947 --> 00:00:59,968
This is my third term on the school committee.

15
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:08,490
And I am also the chair of our Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee that will manage

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:22,260
our end of the process to, you know, ultimately navigate our way toward rebuilding or revising or renovating, depending on which R word you want to use, our high school campus.

17
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:28,265
And so that I've been the chair of that committee since it formed earlier this year.

18
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:29,827
Thank you.

19
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:34,951
And yeah, I hope to get into more depth about some of those things in today's conversation.

20
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:41,335
But before I do that, I just want to ask you the question that we ask everyone and which you've answered before, but maybe you have some updates.

21
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,877
But what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

22
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:58,469
You know, I, like most of Medford, was super excited when AltaCuba opened its doors and it does not disappoint.

23
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,790
I've been like excited to go in there each and every time.

24
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,471
Like I love chips.

25
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:10,894
So clearly like any chip oriented items are like definitely a fan favorite and I,

26
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:14,676
I haven't been in, you know, maybe like a month or so.

27
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:23,382
And I drove by the other day and I was like, oh, they have outdoor seating, which is like one of my favorite things that has come out of the pandemic is more outdoor seating.

28
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,425
Because I think like summer here is so short.

29
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,706
It's just nice when the weather is nice.

30
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:35,991
It hasn't been lately, but when it is to be able to like sit outside and enjoy like whatever you're doing outside.

31
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:40,194
And I just, as I was driving by, I was like, oh, their little patio that they've created is super cute.

32
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:44,537
it's on our list to swing in and check out the patio soon.

33
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,581
And I haven't been for brunch yet, but that's also on my list.

34
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,752
Yeah, we're planning to go on in a couple of days.

35
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:52,652
Maybe we'll eat outside.

36
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,192
That'll be nice.

37
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:54,652
Awesome.

38
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,193
Yeah.

39
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:56,713
Cool.

40
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:59,893
So yeah, so I think we're meeting in the summer.

41
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:08,475
It's like we're mid-summer right now, which I think most people don't want to think about school in the summer, but that is your job.

42
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:13,677
So I think maybe I'm hoping we can spend a little time today reflecting on budget season.

43
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:20,880
You know, we've heard like I've heard some information, but I'm hoping to hear kind of from you any reflection.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,302
So kind of what went well, what you're happy about, things that you want to like take away for next year.

45
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,663
Sure.

46
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:40,569
You know, since I've been on the school committee, like I've been on a sort of a quest to make sure that we are describing like what we need in an

47
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:46,071
optimal scenario to fund our schools.

48
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:59,939
And five years ago, when I started on the committee, that was a really like foreign question to many of the people who we who we asked it of, like, what would you do

49
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:03,866
how much money would it cost to improve out student outcomes?

50
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:04,186
Right?

51
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:09,789
Like that's, it's sort of a simple question, but it's just not how the budget was ever created before.

52
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:19,515
So over the course of the last five budget cycles, we've taken like a couple of different tacts at that question.

53
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:21,276
And, um,

54
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:48,940
you know from like asking everybody to tell us their sort of wish list and it sort of became known as a wish list which implies that like the stuff isn't needed but we're talking about like literacy coaches and that's needed right so it felt like the wrong thing to say that that was a wish list so over time we sort of have shifted that process in a in a whole variety of ways but one of the things that has stuck around is that we really

55
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,503
endeavor to produce two budgets.

56
00:04:52,783 --> 00:05:01,268
The first budget is what answers the question, what do we think we need to responsibly operate the district and improve student outcomes?

57
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,749
And that's a number.

58
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:17,297
And ideally, that would be used as input into ultimately what the mayor does on her side and what the council has to approve in terms of what the allocation to us is.

59
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:30,027
And then once that allocation is finalized, then we would come back and do budget number two, which is, okay, like, this is the reality, this is how much money we have to spend, and this is how we're going to spend it, right?

60
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:34,190
So ideally, there's really two budgets that get talked about.

61
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:38,834
One is like, what do we, what do, what are we asking for?

62
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:42,037
And then the other is like, how are we going to spend the money that we have?

63
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,879
And since I've been here, there's always a gap between those two numbers.

64
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,401
Now, if there wasn't a gap, that would make it super simple, right?

65
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:56,763
But there often is, because as you know,

66
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:08,825
the expense and the cost of operating the district is accelerating at a pace that's greater than how our tax revenue is increasing.

67
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:20,753
And in Medford, our school budget is largely comprised of tax revenue from our local city and not as much from like this from state, right?

68
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,755
So not every community sits like that, but we do.

69
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:24,816
So,

70
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:35,414
And in thinking about all of that, it's like, okay, like there is this like continual mismatch that we're always trying to manage.

71
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,535
And it's reasonable to do that in lots of cases, right?

72
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,115
Like there's lots of ways you can do that.

73
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,535
Like you don't always have to buy a new math curriculum.

74
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:49,597
So sometimes you have those big expenses and then sometimes you don't and you can like shift that money.

75
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:56,398
But when you talk about big things like pay equity for some of our lowest paid staff,

76
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:09,535
That is not something you do by like squeezing a couple of pennies out of a math curriculum somewhere else right like those are big big numbers and they add up like 85% of our budget is staff.

77
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:13,381
So when you think about like increasing staff wages.

78
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:36,083
that is exponentially different than like buying a math curriculum and it lasts for like those changes last forever you buy a math curriculum and presumably at some point you're done paying for it right so that is always sort of a challenge but this process that we've gone through to say like there's two budgets one is like what we need and the other is how we're going to spend the money that we have

79
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:42,147
I think really has started to work like it has taken some time but it is working.

80
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:52,755
And one thing that we did this year in the budget process that didn't get a lot of airtime but I think was really important is we, we went further.

81
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,316
to codify our process.

82
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:59,038
And we passed a policy that said, here is how we will do our budget.

83
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,319
And it backs everything way up.

84
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,481
Our budget was done earlier this year than really it ever has been.

85
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,142
But that still is not early.

86
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:11,484
There are many, many, many communities who are done with their school budgets in January.

87
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,565
And we're not even starting.

88
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:17,327
So we did pass a policy that lays out

89
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:22,671
exactly how to do our budget and when different things are happening.

90
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,153
So that passed, that's a really big deal.

91
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:37,844
It was like one of those things that probably didn't mean much to most people who might have been watching, but it's really important because it provides that roadmap going forward for like how are we going to do this in the future and how are we going to do it in a way that does not like

92
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:42,491
obliterate the finance office for three months, all at once right.

93
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:53,247
And the other thing that we did in a very related way is we passed a similar policy about capital planning, and how we will like

94
00:08:53,707 --> 00:09:01,712
view and review our capital projects, like a school that needs a new roof or a new water heater, those kinds of things.

95
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:11,218
And those two processes now are codified into policy, which I think is important because it lays out that roadmap, but they also work together hand in hand.

96
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:17,082
So there's some sanity to this process that's very complicated.

97
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:22,674
And the goal of all of it is to be ahead of it, right?

98
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:31,609
Like to not be at a place where we are at sort of the 11th hour in making decisions about like,

99
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:37,917
pink slipping teachers by the statutory deadline because we are uncertain what the budget will be.

100
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:50,640
We never wanna be in a position where we have to tell teachers we don't intend to see go, like we're giving you a pink slip because the deadline is here and we don't have enough answers to know that we can fund you.

101
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:59,923
And that's happened a lot over the years and all of this work that we've done process wise, hopefully we'll fix that and at least

102
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:06,308
sort of back the process up so there's some clarity and we're not in those like 11th hour positions.

103
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:10,552
And we're not trying to jam a meeting into the end of June to pass a budget, right?

104
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:14,176
That all of that can happen in a little bit more of a proactive way.

105
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:24,345
And ideally on the front of that process, when we're saying this is what we need, that it actually can arrive at the mayor's office

106
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:29,932
in time to be actual input to the work she's going to do.

107
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:40,626
This past year that didn't go great because she and her team knew that it was not going to be a great budget and so

108
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:48,069
what ends up happening because our process is so late is the city starts to get some feedback about like where it sits.

109
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:51,690
And then the two things get kind of get mushed together and it gets real murky.

110
00:10:52,170 --> 00:11:00,513
And so the early presentations that we got, they were not that purist point of view of what do we need?

111
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,854
It was like, how are we going to survive this?

112
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:03,334
So we were

113
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:19,236
We were sort of answering a different question this year than we might want to and hopefully we can return to answering that like what do we need to operate a district and improve student outcomes question in a little bit more of a consistent way going forward so that definitely was.

114
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,525
Not ideal.

115
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:32,753
Also, we were not alone because every district is rolling off of significant support from ESSER that wraps up this summer.

116
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,976
And our ESSER funding is spent and complete.

117
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:41,700
The city still has some ARPA money, I believe, and theirs lasts a little bit longer than ours.

118
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:49,045
So just like as everybody prepares to not have this infusion of cash,

119
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,608
To do pandemic recovery.

120
00:11:51,628 --> 00:12:00,419
It, it had forced sort of everybody through what really was, you know, like a pretty ugly process.

121
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:23,777
Maybe created like some anxiety along the way is like the administration and under the finance director Jerry McHugh felt strongly that if we're going to put something in a budget document that says like we're going to eliminate a position.

122
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:34,498
And there's a person in that position that they deserve to know that that's about to be in the public purview before it happens.

123
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:40,281
And I'm not sure we've ever been so crisp about that in the past.

124
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,462
So it did happen this time.

125
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:50,607
Jerry did proactively talk to our union partners and to the individuals who would be like directly impacted.

126
00:12:52,388 --> 00:13:00,312
I think that made for like a really uncomfortable time for them because they knew like that their job was potentially being eliminated.

127
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:14,520
And I, I feel like really terrible that people had to sort of live through that because that uncertainty is not, you know, it's not, that's not easy to navigate while you're still having to do your job and you're having to think about like, what do I do for next year?

128
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:19,823
But I think the alternative of like being surprised

129
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:26,282
Because we didn't have the courtesy to tell you in advance would feel a lot worse for me.

130
00:13:26,402 --> 00:13:29,464
So I think it's like one of those double-edged swords.

131
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:35,968
Like I think what Jerry and his team tried to do was the right thing to do.

132
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:41,211
I'm not saying it was like fun or easy because it definitely wasn't.

133
00:13:42,990 --> 00:14:00,233
In the end, I think we were able to get enough of an increase to the budget to like stave off many, many slash most of the things that were being actively discussed as being cut.

134
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:06,794
And we were able to avoid the conversation about where does the other $2.7 million in cuts come from, right?

135
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:09,955
So there was always this other pile of money that

136
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:32,615
We didn't have an answer for like where would it come from, but if that original estimate had been held like we would have had to come up with those cuts to and we already like we're cutting pretty deep so I'm really glad that we didn't have to do that because that is what like kept me up at night through the budget season was like not.

137
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:53,477
what you what you knew was bad enough, but like how to cancel the part that you could describe yet was the thing that was like worrying me is like I don't know how you do that without sort of drastic changes to our staffing and that just felt like that would have been much, much, much worse.

138
00:14:55,701 --> 00:15:14,828
I'm hopeful that with these new budget processes that line up with the city's budget ordinance, we can get to a place where this is much more like a process that happens and people know what to expect and when to expect it.

139
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:22,071
And that we will not continue to be in a situation of having conversations about what to cut.

140
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:36,378
You know, and obviously the override questions that and debt exclusion questions that will be on the ballot in November will be a big part of that, of whether things get better or not, for sure.

141
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:44,943
even just the, you know, having some more systems and structures in place to navigate this process, I think is really important.

142
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:52,888
Like our financial software is really archaic, just like across the board.

143
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:56,450
And, you know, the schools are no exception.

144
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,553
So all of this stuff that comes out and looks great, like is a Herculean effort.

145
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:04,697
for the staff that do it.

146
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:16,765
And then the last thing that I think went really well is that the budget actually is a readable document this year without having to really be on the inside of what's going on to know what's happening.

147
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,486
And it's the first time that's the case.

148
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,849
It's like a third of the size it usually is.

149
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:33,859
But there's an actual narrative there that describes what the process was and what happened in various meetings and, you know, really sort of looked at everything from beginning to end.

150
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,582
So all that was like great news, actually.

151
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:37,463
Wow.

152
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:39,785
Yeah, that's, that's interesting to hear.

153
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,147
It is surprising that like

154
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:47,450
There wasn't like a process that lined up with the city's process for the budget to but that's it sounds good.

155
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,233
How did you recover like how did they bridge that gap between the, what do you say $2.7 million.

156
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:53,813
Yeah.

157
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:59,596
So, the, the mayor's team provided an estimate to the schools.

158
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:11,474
Back in March, I want to say, which is when the ordinance says that she has to tell us something about like where this initial like number is going to be.

159
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:13,995
And she did that.

160
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:17,017
And then like through.

161
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:22,164
know, what happens when you build a budget of this size, right?

162
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,464
You have to start somewhere.

163
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:35,768
As they combed and groomed and did all the things to the budget on the city side, they were able to increase our allocation substantially.

164
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,768
And then they also

165
00:17:40,449 --> 00:18:07,582
in the end committed to using some one-time funds to get us to a number that actually allowed us to not have to talk about that 2.7 that I was referring to, but also allowed us to add back some of the things that were on the chopping block, like some of the department heads, like the assistant athletic director, for example, and

166
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:15,722
the head of world language, there were four or five positions that we were able to reinstate.

167
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:36,276
We also were able to instate one or two literacy coaches, which was never a part of the conversation about like the budget, they didn't exist and they weren't initially being proposed to be added, but we were able to add two back as part of all of this.

168
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:37,537
So that was important as well.

169
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:47,816
And, you know, all of that is, you know, is good and important.

170
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:54,220
And we were, you know, we were able to sort of recover because I'm just looking for the actual numbers here.

171
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,903
So the city's original allocation, I believe was 73.5.

172
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:01,505
And the year prior, so in FY24,

173
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,224
we were at 71.2 million.

174
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:15,747
And so then the initial allocation was 73.5.

175
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:26,394
But we knew that we had an excess of things that had to be added to the budget for a variety of reasons.

176
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:30,396
And then in the end, we were able to say, okay,

177
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:53,467
how do we like some things we were able to sort of find revenue sources for like we were able to tap a couple of revolving funds for some of our vocational staff and that helped sort of shift things around and that's part of like what's so muddy about the budget is it's not a single budget it's a single budget and then there's all of these

178
00:19:54,857 --> 00:20:01,160
sources that happen around the budget, including grants, including revolving funds.

179
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:10,404
So there's just like a lot of things happening, you know, sort of all over the place, which makes it really complicated to sort of dive in and understand.

180
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:20,389
And then we had, we were able to add back some of the things that were originally proposed to be eliminated.

181
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:25,558
and also to sort of

182
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:33,485
right size some of the things in the budget where we always under budgeted but had to spend anyway like maintenance.

183
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:48,733
So for years we would budget something very small for maintenance and then we would have to actually do the maintenance and so we would always look like we overspent the budget even though we always knew that the budget number was smaller.

184
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:54,596
So we've sort of corrected for some of that in a handful of places as well.

185
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:55,436
So that's a

186
00:20:56,677 --> 00:20:59,221
big important part of the process too.

187
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:10,897
So this budget was like a lot of cleaning things up and scrubbing into it, like kind of putting things in a better place, which is, you know, will make it easier going forward.

188
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:20,080
Yeah, well, and it sounds like some of the issue was that we had like the like pandemic funding has run out.

189
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,203
And so there's like, you know, non renewable sources of income there.

190
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:28,105
And that maybe our cities, our city didn't necessarily make up for that income.

191
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:33,249
I know you talked about the override, but another and that's something like, you know, I think is a little bit down the road, hopefully.

192
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,250
But one of the things that I

193
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,791
the terms that I kept hearing was free cash.

194
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:43,712
And I wonder if you could just describe like what that is and when it can be used and like how that comes into the planning and negotiating.

195
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:45,273
Sure.

196
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:50,794
Okay, so free cash is a city side concept.

197
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:57,196
And it basically says like, at the end of a fiscal year, right, you have to close the books.

198
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:01,857
So we just finished the June fiscal year, and you close the books.

199
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:06,850
And you have to like do all the reconciliation and the audit and all the things that happen.

200
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:13,252
And of course, like all along the way, you've got a budget and you're spending and you're ideally spending to the budget.

201
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:20,393
And if you're not, you have some reason, you have a reason to believe that there's someplace else that money can come from, right?

202
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:21,834
And all that happens.

203
00:22:23,954 --> 00:22:26,315
Where free cash comes from is when what's,

204
00:22:28,503 --> 00:22:34,192
left at the end of the year is more than what

205
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,055
you spent, right?

206
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:42,136
So it's like, is it a surplus?

207
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:43,537
Not exactly.

208
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:48,739
I like to think of it as like, there's revenue coming in all the time.

209
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:55,541
And so when you make a budget, you're making an estimate about what kind of revenue is gonna come in.

210
00:22:56,401 --> 00:23:01,283
And you can't predict to the penny what that revenue would be.

211
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:03,344
Okay, so that's how free cash

212
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:11,216
is created is like there's money at the end of the year that is available.

213
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:27,509
That money goes into this like free cash pot and cities cannot access it until their books are closed and they're audited and that number is certified by the state.

214
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:31,191
So that free cash reserve is there

215
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:45,941
And, you know, not available for us just to like reach into any old time that we want, because the books have to be closed, the audit has to be done, the state has to agree with our number, they have to certify, and then it's available, right?

216
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:51,186
But essentially, free cash is like our rainy day fund for the city.

217
00:23:53,291 --> 00:24:01,857
the amount of money in free cash, like can fluctuate a lot over time, but it should, there are some like markers of what it should be.

218
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:08,222
And it should be, I think for us somewhere in the neighborhood of like $15 million.

219
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:15,948
And that means like that money should just always be in free cash because it's the rainy day fund.

220
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:20,351
So when it starts raining, there has to be like something available, right?

221
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,032
Like if you look around like the,

222
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:46,441
the school in Somerville where like the roof fell in right like in order to address something like that or like you have like a giant flood or like a tornado whips by and like it's a hole in a roof right like you you have to be able to like tap some reserve for those like real rainy day issues right

223
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:56,103
But the other thing that happens in cities is that like that free cash pot gets used for capital projects.

224
00:24:56,343 --> 00:25:02,865
And so over time, right, the number is going to, how much you have in free cash is going to fluctuate year to year.

225
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:08,186
Some of that is because how much you put in the pot every year is going to fluctuate.

226
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:12,667
And the other part of that is what you take out of it every year is also going to fluctuate.

227
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,768
So in a year where you have a big capital expenditure,

228
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:16,708
right?

229
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:18,450
That is tagged for free cash.

230
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,212
You're going to allocate that out of free cash.

231
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:23,695
You're going to put it somewhere else, like we actually just did with MSBA.

232
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:26,438
And then you're going to spend from that other pot.

233
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,564
So there's, there's, I think there's a lot of misinformation about free cash.

234
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:38,049
Like it wasn't a surprise that there was the amount of free cash that went into the

235
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,251
that went into free cash when it's certified in June.

236
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:45,393
It's not like we just found the money, like none of that is true.

237
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:53,617
Like this is just part of the process and it's not available to us until it gets through the audit process and gets certified and all that good stuff.

238
00:25:54,137 --> 00:26:00,360
Now, one of the things that we are talking about in the lead up to the override conversations is

239
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:13,833
to make clear to people what the plan is for that free cash, because there are plans for much of that money, except for that money that actually should stay there as rainy day, right?

240
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:22,442
And a couple of examples, what the council did at the end of last year, at the end of June, they did three things.

241
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:31,046
They moved $3 million into a special fund that authorizes us to do a feasibility study with MSBA.

242
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:39,435
So that money has to be allocated by the city and made available for when we get to that part in the process.

243
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:45,902
So $3 million from free cash was moved out of free cash before it got locked back up with the fiscal year.

244
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:51,326
and it is in a separate segregated account for the feasibility study.

245
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:56,650
So when we're ready to start to pay people for the feasibility study, that money is set aside.

246
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,691
So that's 3 million.

247
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:05,237
They also created two stabilization accounts, one for like 6 million and one for 5 million.

248
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:12,884
And one is like a general stabilization account, and the other one is a capital stabilization account.

249
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,552
both of those pots are essentially now available to us all year round.

250
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:24,998
The money that stays in free cash is not available to us all year round.

251
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:32,043
It is there and going to wait until free cash certifies again, and then it becomes accessible again.

252
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:43,952
So the big thing about those stabilization accounts is it moves money into position so that if something has to happen that is not on cycle with how free cash certifies, that it's available to us.

253
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:48,294
you know, a tornado whips by and puts a hole in the roof, right?

254
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,515
Like now we have a place where we can go.

255
00:27:51,176 --> 00:27:56,298
In order to access those funds, the mayor has to send a request to the council and the council has to approve.

256
00:27:56,358 --> 00:28:05,401
So the check and balance of like using the money in the stabilization account is no different than using money out of free cash or putting money in the budget.

257
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:06,982
It's all that very same process.

258
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,163
Mayor requests, council says yes or no.

259
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:20,398
One of the things we still have to do is articulate like some of the many uses for that money that was moved into the stabilization accounts.

260
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:36,162
And I'm actually meeting with the mayor later this week and we'll be talking about that because I know that we have like a $20 million project going on at the Andrews and McGlynn complexes to remediate and fix and replace their HVAC systems.

261
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,083
So both schools have,

262
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,344
failing HVAC systems.

263
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:43,747
And in many places, they have actually failed, right?

264
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:48,410
So if you go to the gym at the Andrews, like it's sweltering hot.

265
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,391
I think the gym at McGlynn is the same.

266
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:55,655
But in the end, both of those complexes need new HVAC systems.

267
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:59,157
So the process soup to nuts, it's a $20 million

268
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:01,412
process.

269
00:29:01,612 --> 00:29:04,673
So that money comes from somewhere.

270
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:09,935
I believe some of it will come from free cash, maybe not all of it, but some of it.

271
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:18,499
If you want to buy a new fire truck, I believe that is also one of the things that's like on the list, like that would come out of the stabilization account.

272
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,040
So it essentially is like

273
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:26,918
a place to like aggregate the money for our special projects.

274
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:33,739
Like that's what I think of free cash as like, you cannot use it again and again and again for things that recur.

275
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:41,041
Like you cannot use it for operating budget expenses because you will deplete your free cash and then you will have none.

276
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:44,322
And so that's why you don't use it that way.

277
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:50,163
Like you use in your budget what you can justify is like going to come in for the year

278
00:29:50,743 --> 00:30:18,748
and be sustainable right so that's the hard part is like to me I think of it as like the you know the special projects bucket and those special projects could be any number of things but if you start to put recurring expenses in your special projects bucket you're going to get to do a whole lot less special projects and if you look around Medford or if you look at the capital plan like there's plenty of special projects to do here in Medford not just for the schools but for citywide so

279
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:21,818
free cash is like a misnomer.

280
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,899
It makes it sound like it's actually free.

281
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,900
It's not, it's not actually free.

282
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,282
That money comes from revenue that the city brings in.

283
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:37,767
Some of it, you know, it's probably very negligibly tax revenue because that tax revenue is predictable and can be like attributed to recurring costs.

284
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:41,849
But if you think about like permitting fees or

285
00:30:42,415 --> 00:31:03,982
meals and hotel tax like you at the as you build a budget you do your best to estimate what you think that's going to look like and then you know poof the great american beer hall opens and it is a smashing success and it brings in three times the amount of tax revenue as we thought it would and that's you know that's where some of those surpluses come from so um

286
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:08,745
it isn't free in a whole variety of ways.

287
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:13,869
It also is not necessarily like taxpayer, like real estate tax dollars.

288
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:16,791
It can come from any number of sources.

289
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:29,741
And it also is generally like not available to us many, many months out of the year because our finance team does take their time to certify free cash and close the books every year.

290
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:29,801
So,

291
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,378
If we had more people in finance, maybe they would be able to move faster.

292
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,489
I don't know, but it is anything but free.

293
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:50,246
You know what, it helps too, because I think like, you know, some of the stuff that I had been reading and like hearing was about, you know, this idea that like free cash was always there.

294
00:31:50,286 --> 00:31:56,329
And then why did we have to haggle about the, or like be less transparent is the word I heard a lot about the budget if you had this money.

295
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,089
And so that helps, right?

296
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:06,513
It sounds like that's not what was happening, but also that like, you can't plan a budget around free cash, that it's kind of how I, maybe how I use my checking account versus my savings account, right?

297
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,754
Like you have extra and you can work on the sort of things you need.

298
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:28,275
you do it when you can but well the other thing that's been like sort of a an unusual phenomenon in the last like four years is that we've had ARPA money and the city got like 50 or 60 million dollars in ARPA money and that money had rules about broad uses and

299
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:41,627
ARPA has been used to do a whole lot of things in the last four years that free cash would have had to be used to do were it not for ARPA.

300
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:50,555
Were this five years ago, six years ago, seven years ago, there is no ARPA and free cash is the only place you go for those kinds of projects.

301
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:55,237
some of the funding that went into the McGlynn playground, for example.

302
00:32:55,918 --> 00:33:05,721
And so then you start to have to ask yourself these questions about like, well, could we, would we even have been willing to do it without this like additional funding source in ARPA?

303
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:15,144
And I think there's lots of examples where like, no, we probably never would have done those things if we didn't feel like we had a source for them, right?

304
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:19,446
So I do think the other thing that's been happening over the last handful of years is that

305
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:29,791
we're not doing more or fewer projects than we did five or 10 years ago, but we did have another revenue source.

306
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:41,113
And consequently that allowed more money to be returned to free cash than would have five or 10 years ago when this other funding stream didn't exist.

307
00:33:41,613 --> 00:33:43,414
So I think it,

308
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:53,969
makes it, I think ARPA sort of made it look like we were just like bulking up all of this like free cash when that's not really what was happening and it's over.

309
00:33:55,865 --> 00:34:22,975
I think that's the other thing is like okay like yes maybe that has happened for the last couple of years but that's over now and we have to get back to like spending only what we can generate right whether that's like whether that's real estate taxes or commercial development or whatever so there's plenty of revenue sources to talk about like meals and excise taxes and all the things but um

310
00:34:24,238 --> 00:34:31,922
Yeah, it's just a little bit of a different day as we like move out of this ARPA phase that we have to be careful about too.

311
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:47,210
And maybe in some ways that also delayed the conversation of how do we like change or increase revenue or how do we like kind of think about the big picture, which leads me to the other topic that I was hoping to discuss about the new high school and sort of what, if there's any updates on the process or kind of where we stand there.

312
00:34:47,846 --> 00:34:55,171
Yeah, so in December, we were invited to the eligibility phase with the Mass School Building Authority.

313
00:34:55,271 --> 00:35:02,657
So when you build with MSBA, there's a very prescriptive process that you must go through.

314
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:10,643
You can't skip steps, you can't go faster than they're ready for you to go, like you need approvals at each gate to go to the next step.

315
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:14,746
But in the end, they will reimburse

316
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:16,827
a portion of the project.

317
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:28,411
That portion is always sort of the million dollar, many million dollar question actually, because how big that portion is depends on what kind of community you are.

318
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:32,213
Like we're gonna have a higher reimbursement rate than say, Wellesley.

319
00:35:33,274 --> 00:35:36,255
And we're gonna have a lower reimbursement rate than Lawrence.

320
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:39,996
And so they look at a community's ability to pay.

321
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:43,718
And a lot of that is driven by like property wealth.

322
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:45,783
among many other things.

323
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:52,548
But at any rate, if you follow the process, they will pay for part of the building.

324
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,109
So that's great news, right?

325
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:56,611
Because that's money that we don't have to pay for.

326
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,656
So they invited us to the eligibility period, which is the first step in like, there's like seven steps.

327
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:04,777
And

328
00:36:07,016 --> 00:36:13,420
Our eligibility phase started on May 1st, so it required that we do a whole series of things.

329
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,962
We had to form a building committee, which we did before May 1st.

330
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:25,867
We had to put together a document called the educational profile, which is basically a description of what goes on in the building.

331
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:32,148
both right now and what we want it to be in this new building, whatever this new building looks like.

332
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:53,412
We also, because we have an active vocational program, we had to fill out a separate form around our chapter 74 programs and identify if we wanted to expand any of the programs and justify any such expansion, as well as identify if there were other programs we were wanting to start, but we can't because we're space constrained that we would want to be studying.

333
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,854
So we put both of those documents together.

334
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:06,603
The other big things that happen in this phase, one is that we have to talk about and justify our maintenance and capital planning practices.

335
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:13,810
So we had a huge survey we had to submit around our maintenance and capital planning practices, both

336
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:17,901
past, current, and future, I guess I'll say.

337
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:29,196
And we also have to have a conversation with them about what we think the enrollment of the building should be.

338
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:44,973
And that requires us to collect a lot of information about past enrollment, about planned building projects, what kind of building projects they are, what the real estate market looks like.

339
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:49,135
We had to do all of this development work on the development side of the house to say,

340
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:53,336
This is what is going to drive our enrollment in the future.

341
00:37:54,577 --> 00:38:08,022
All of that has been submitted so it took us like just a little bit over two months out of the six months of the phase that we have to submit that so the team moved lightning fast, the administration did a lot of work.

342
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:11,785
to get us to where we needed to be as quickly as possible.

343
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:26,100
And we have been pushing, pushing, pushing so that we can get out of this eligibility phase and get invited to the next phase, which is where we get to hire the owner's project manager and the architect who will ultimately do what they call a feasibility study.

344
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,285
So the next phase is like to bring on board those professionals who are going to do the heavy lifting for us.

345
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:42,310
I'm excited about that because all of the lifting up until this point has been on the building committee and on the district and on the people who have been involved in this process.

346
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:50,153
And now as we get into this next phase, we will have people whose full-time job it is to do these things.

347
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:55,835
So the owner's project manager will come on, will get to know us, and then will help us put out a bid for the architect.

348
00:38:57,258 --> 00:39:13,763
And then once that happens and we get approved to go to the next phase, we actually do the feasibility study and that architect will come in, they will learn all about our building and they will learn all about like what we said we were trying to do in the building, how big it's supposed to be, that's all the work we're doing right now.

349
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:29,392
And then they will look at the space and they will give us options and they will tell us like, gee, you could renovate this part of the high school and still meet your goals and it would take this long.

350
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:36,736
Or option B is you're going to build this building somewhere completely new so that you're not disrupting the education that's going on right now.

351
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:38,918
And so they will give us a series of

352
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:43,802
options essentially to think about in terms of like, how do we want to go forward?

353
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:51,068
And they will help us answer this question, which I hear a lot in the community, like, isn't it just better to renovate what we have?

354
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,311
I don't think that's going to be the answer, but it might be.

355
00:39:56,712 --> 00:40:03,858
And we will actually let professionals tell us that instead of sort of letting speculation rule the day.

356
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:05,880
So whatever that answer is,

357
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:08,841
is absolutely fine by me.

358
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:17,804
I think I want to do this project so that we get an amazing building out of it and we do so in the most cost-effective way for the residents.

359
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:25,106
But that in the end, the kids who go to school there are like, wow, this is amazing, right?

360
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:29,247
That's what you want your kids to feel like when they go into school every single day.

361
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,511
And that's to me the opportunity that we have.

362
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:43,959
So we're pushing as fast as we can to get through so we can put a shovel in the ground, but it is going to be some time.

363
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,542
And we still are a bit away from that, but

364
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:49,483
We're well positioned.

365
00:40:49,704 --> 00:40:52,065
We've got our feasibility study money put aside.

366
00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:58,590
MSBA will reimburse a portion of that if we go through all of the rest of the steps successfully, so that $3 million will be reduced.

367
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:00,712
But we do have to pay up front.

368
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:11,300
And yeah, we have a lot of planned outreach with the community as we get into that feasibility study.

369
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:16,464
The OPM and the architect will really be helping us with all of that community engagement.

370
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:38,808
And I don't think you'll see much of that this year, but probably into next year, you'll start to see like, you know, tables and concept drawings and working sessions and focus groups and all of that stuff to really hear from all of the stakeholders in this building, like what they wish for in a new building.

371
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:46,021
Yeah, I think there's been some good models around the city of getting community input with the parks and the playgrounds and things like that.

372
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:49,922
So it sounds like there's a good model to go from there in terms of what people want to need.

373
00:41:51,022 --> 00:41:59,985
Is there a rough timeline for when maybe they'd have an idea of how they're going to move forward in terms of do we renovate or do we make a new building?

374
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:02,245
Any idea of when we'll have that decision?

375
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:07,427
I don't have a great sense of that just yet.

376
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:17,914
But what MSBA typically says is that a project, if you build with them, the project usually takes five to seven years.

377
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:19,155
That's like the average.

378
00:42:20,836 --> 00:42:25,799
And that means like from the start to like kids inhabiting the new building.

379
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:31,102
So we're in like, you know, month three right now.

380
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:35,965
So we are legitimately at the beginning.

381
00:42:37,477 --> 00:42:44,039
But hopefully, we can move quickly through some of these phases so we can get to that place a little bit faster than planned.

382
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,480
Yeah, it's exciting to have a path forward.

383
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:46,800
Yeah.

384
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,320
Yeah.

385
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,640
Great.

386
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,441
Well, thank you for answering those questions.

387
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,622
I'm wondering if there's anything else you want to make sure we talk about before we wrap up.

388
00:42:57,093 --> 00:43:05,677
I think, you know, the only other thing that I will say is like we sort of have touched on the overrides a couple of times in this conversation.

389
00:43:07,657 --> 00:43:19,802
And that is all sort of coming right voters in Medford will have an opportunity to weigh in on that on three separate questions in July.

390
00:43:20,426 --> 00:43:29,735
Sorry, in, in November, so it is July, but in November, and on election day, it'll be on your ballot and you'll have three choices to make.

391
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,878
One is a debt exclusion for the fire station.

392
00:43:32,898 --> 00:43:34,860
And then the other two.

393
00:43:36,842 --> 00:43:38,243
are largely school related.

394
00:43:38,463 --> 00:43:48,612
One is like a stabilization number that would help stabilize the school budget and improve the services that the DPW is able to offer around like roads and sidewalks.

395
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:57,919
And then the third number is like sort of looking into the future kind of number for the schools.

396
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,803
And we have some work to do to like really describe

397
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:06,598
what all went into those numbers.

398
00:44:06,698 --> 00:44:24,966
But when we talk about things like pay equity for our paraprofessionals and for our cafeteria staff and our security monitors, we've been pushing for my whole time here to bring those wages up to something that resembles a living wage.

399
00:44:25,506 --> 00:44:27,987
And we've made a lot of progress, but we can't

400
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:38,109
We can't keep making progress without some ability to move the needle more than 2.5% a year, right?

401
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:43,090
So without this override, we're sort of stuck at that no more than 2.5% increase.

402
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:54,195
each year and it's not where we are in terms of the need.

403
00:44:54,255 --> 00:44:57,177
So there'll be a lot of activity as we go forward.

404
00:44:57,217 --> 00:45:08,345
But if there are people who want to know more, I'm very happy for people to reach out to me and I'm happy to chat with anybody who wants to get a little bit more information about what's coming.

405
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:11,828
But there'll be lots more information out in public soon enough.

406
00:45:12,348 --> 00:45:27,217
I mean, just that information that you provided is really helpful that I think it addresses some of the bigger issues that we hear about, like the fire station, the roads and sidewalks, and then just not having to worry about teachers losing jobs or how to fund our schools.

407
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,939
And then that third one sounds even more compelling to me as well.

408
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:30,860
But thank you.

409
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,840
That's really helpful.

410
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,242
And I do look forward to learning more soon as well.

411
00:45:34,262 --> 00:45:35,242
Yeah.

412
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:36,123
Great.

413
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:37,244
Well, thank you, Jenny.

414
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:38,925
Thanks, as always, for making the time for us.

415
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:40,398
Yeah, absolutely.

416
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:41,059
Anytime.

417
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,681
Um, I know it's a busy time of year.

418
00:45:45,182 --> 00:45:52,867
It's sort of everyone checks out of schools at this time of year, but I know the administration like this is their this is their busiest time of year.

419
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:56,969
So I know they're like working hard to like, put their plans in place.

420
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:02,273
And, you know, we've got, we've settled some contracts over the last couple of weeks.

421
00:46:02,953 --> 00:46:22,924
