1
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:14,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to reiterate, Traffic Commission meeting and in attendance is myself, Sergeant Canava, and Alva Erickson, and Chief Buckley will be here shortly, and Sergeant Rogers will be as well.

2
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you could do a roll call, Alva, that would be great.

3
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:19,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGibbon?

4
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:20,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Here.

5
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:21,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Hunt?

6
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:22,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Here.

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,892
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will be sitting in for Chief Buckley, so we do have the correct amount of people.

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:51,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could have a motion to pass the previous September 10th meeting, that would be by the commissioners to approve the minutes or business for September.

12
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:56,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion.

13
00:00:57,803 --> 00:01:05,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Commissioner Brzezinski, seconded by Tim O'Reilly.

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second it.

15
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

16
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:11,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call, Alba?

17
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGibbon?

18
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:13,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

19
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:15,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Hunt?

20
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:16,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

22
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:19,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

23
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:25,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say yes, as well.

24
00:01:25,364 --> 00:01:26,765
[SPEAKER_04]: So pass of a 4-0 vote.

25
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:29,407
[SPEAKER_04]: New business and new minutes have been passed.

26
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:47,765
[SPEAKER_04]: We are moving on to the new business, which is 2024-48, a dedicated 24-7 pickup slash drop-off area in Medford Square, three locations for economic development.

27
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jessica Martinez, I believe I saw you here.

28
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,191
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will ask you to unmute and then

29
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can ask if you need to share anything for your screen, we can have that as well.

30
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have something you want to propose, just let us know.

31
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:06,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Jessica Martinez.

32
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the economic development planner for the city.

33
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:10,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I work under Alicia Hunt's office.

34
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:19,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fortunate enough to get some response to this concept from a prior traffic parking policy meeting.

35
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,541
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sit on the meetings for the Chevalier here and something that's come up

36
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:36,007
[SPEAKER_01]: is the issue with traffic and traffic flow in front of the Chevalier Theater on evenings when they have shows.

37
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:50,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, a lot of people will call their transportation network companies, TNCs, like Uber Lyfts, and the cars will stop on Forest Street, blocking traffic going north and south on Forest Street.

38
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been a safety issue that has been needing addressing.

39
00:02:56,311 --> 00:03:08,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that we talked about was the creation of a dedicated pickup drop off area in the square so that would also benefit the other businesses like deep cuts or restaurants in the Medford square area.

40
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:16,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proposing 2 different spots that would be chosen by you folks ultimately.

41
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:25,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And I welcome feedback on whether this would be a place that we could have 24 hours or just from 6 p.m.

42
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:27,129
[SPEAKER_01]: on in the evenings.

43
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll share my screen briefly so I could show you where.

44
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:33,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can I, may I share my screen?

45
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:37,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going to make your call now so you can share it and that should be all set.

46
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:38,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

47
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:53,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's making me open system settings.

48
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what's going on here.

49
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just.

50
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, give me a second.

51
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, take your time.

52
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:16,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd have to, I'm sorry, I'm not going to share because I'd have to quit the app, but if you,

53
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:22,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you have an email or two and then we could sure.

54
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:30,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can share it for you.

55
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:32,214
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send it to me, Jess.

56
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

57
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:38,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've seen it, but I don't think I have a copy.

58
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:55,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about this, folks.

59
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,992
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not the most technology savvy people in the police department either, so.

60
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent it to you, Alicia, over at Teams.

61
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:14,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Opening it?

62
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:17,998
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

63
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be able to share it.

64
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:27,796
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

65
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:28,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

66
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:37,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two options that we narrowed down from the three that we had originally talked about was the three spots on Riverside Avenue.

67
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,506
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a one-way going east.

68
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:45,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And then four spots on Clippership Drive, and that's going east as well.

69
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:56,111
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea would be that we would put up signs that would signal that those are dedicated pickup drop-off spots for Uber and Lyft.

70
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:02,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about with the other meeting about making it 6 p.m.

71
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:02,792
[SPEAKER_01]: on.

72
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:08,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would welcome feedback from you folks on the idea and the proposed places.

73
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:18,036
[SPEAKER_04]: From a police department standpoint, I think 6 p.m.

74
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:23,518
[SPEAKER_04]: on would probably work more effectively just with the businesses that are in that area.

75
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:32,935
[SPEAKER_04]: If out of the two options, Clippership Drive, I feel, and Sergeant Rogers would probably agree, that that would be a better location.

76
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:47,280
[SPEAKER_04]: If we put it on Riverside Ave, we have an issue with cars doing U-turns from Salem Street onto Riverside Ave from that area, and I feel like Ubers and Lyfts would maybe enhance that issue that we've already occurred there.

77
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think Clippership Drive might be a easier location, especially,

78
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,141
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a straight shot and there's multiple accesses for them to get over there.

79
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,502
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just our point of view.

80
00:06:57,562 --> 00:07:03,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a heavy U-turn area over on Salem Street to Riverside Ave.

81
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's our input.

82
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:07,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry has something else.

83
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to, how do we promote this?

84
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'm thinking of is Shibari.

85
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: When the show lets out, it's insane there.

86
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:20,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what she's speaking with.

87
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,979
[SPEAKER_01]: We can contact Lyft and Uber.

88
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,643
[SPEAKER_01]: The people ordering the cars would be directed to the locations directly.

89
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:35,006
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be given instructions on how to walk there.

90
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:38,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just our input.

91
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, Todd, you had your hand up.

92
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you for doing this, Jessica.

93
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:50,641
[SPEAKER_11]: This is long overdue, and yeah, it's great that you're doing this, and it's vastly needed.

94
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to comment, when we say 6 p.m.

95
00:07:53,743 --> 00:08:06,736
[SPEAKER_11]: on, I think this should be an end time, whenever that is, whenever shows are usually over and out, or bars and restaurants, because there are residences that live above some of these businesses that do park overnight in the square.

96
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,486
[SPEAKER_11]: So whether that's 6 p.m.

97
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,086
[SPEAKER_11]: to 1 a.m.

98
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:12,908
[SPEAKER_11]: or what have you, just suggesting it has an end time.

99
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:20,472
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the latest that Deep Cuts and Chevalier hasn't, like, anything, even Tacuba, what is the latest, anybody?

100
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:20,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it 11 p.m.? ?

101
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,732
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me, what I would, my recommendation would be that we should make it 1 a.m.

102
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:32,272
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know if they have 11 p.m.

103
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:32,893
[SPEAKER_00]: or a 1 a.m.

104
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:35,673
[SPEAKER_00]: end time, but it's really reasonable.

105
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:41,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep Cuts does shows that if they were to request a 1 a.m.

106
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,756
[SPEAKER_00]: closing, we wouldn't wanna then have to come back and figure that out and change this up.

107
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Either people are gonna park here overnight or they're not gonna park here overnight, right?

108
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:51,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are people gonna come?

109
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:56,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think I'd rather just say it's like 6 p.m.

110
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:56,960
[SPEAKER_00]: to 1 a.m.

111
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,221
[SPEAKER_00]: or 6 p.m.

112
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,742
[SPEAKER_00]: to 6 a.m.

113
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we think residents park here overnight?

114
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:14,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure on the Clippership Drive they would, but Riverside Avenue and Talon Street, yeah.

115
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:26,661
[SPEAKER_11]: In the past, when we've done painting overnight, we've had a knock on doors and residents in their pajamas come out and move out these areas, because there's several above, like the Dunkin' Donuts building.

116
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,482
[SPEAKER_11]: It's two or three stories above.

117
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:30,404
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where they tend to.

118
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:32,565
[SPEAKER_11]: But Clippership, probably less so than Riverside.

119
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:42,413
[SPEAKER_11]: But you could probably start with like 6 PM to 1 or 2 AM and see how it goes.

120
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:42,673
[SPEAKER_04]: 6 to 2?

121
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:49,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the time is, on our end, it's irrelevant.

122
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for sure.

123
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:52,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine for us.

124
00:09:54,003 --> 00:10:00,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's anybody who maintains a master list of what closing times different businesses have in Medford.

125
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:05,210
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we've talked about putting together in our office, but I don't think we've had the bandwidth to do that yet.

126
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know if deep cuts are,

127
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:20,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been here when their show has gone past like 1130 or 12, but if they did to the future, so.

128
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't have to I mean, a 1 am I don't think there's an issue with that.

129
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:24,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just.

130
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:32,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that's not my not my our expertise for just.

131
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:45,874
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever time they get out, I think this is a great idea to avoid the foot traffic from Chevalier and Main Street from these shows for these Uber and Lyft drivers that aren't familiar with Medford.

132
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,016
[SPEAKER_04]: We have them sitting on sidewalks and sitting on Governor's Ave and whatnot.

133
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this will help out and alleviate a lot of the congestion, so.

134
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:56,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this is great.

135
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:59,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Jordan can speak to this too.

136
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:06,574
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't always have great success getting messages to the individual drivers, and individual drivers may end up doing whatever they want.

137
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:10,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the best case is what Jessica mentioned, target the customers.

138
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:16,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the customers, when they use the app, they have to pick a pin spot where the pickup is.

139
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:24,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So if they follow that appropriately when they're exiting the theater, then the driver, the individual drivers, will go to the pin spot, right?

140
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's the best way to reach them.

141
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Jessica, thank you.

142
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:46,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we might want to consider whether we want to put some signage up, like the Chevalier can have signage and information for their people using their business saying like where to go for lift pickup, but they don't have the ability to put signage past the edge of their building.

143
00:11:47,531 --> 00:12:11,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we would benefit a lot if we considered putting some signage, thinking about what the pedestrian path is, and then putting signage, the city pointing like rideshare pickup and signage, and then a very clear rideshare pickup here signage to help pedestrians from out of town find this location.

144
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:21,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be great if Jessica could help us figure out, like, is there standard stuff, what kind of signage we could use for that.

145
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,752
[SPEAKER_00]: The only place I've ever seen that is in Logan Airport.

146
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:31,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, I haven't seen anywhere else but Logan, but that would be extremely helpful.

147
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:41,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford, if you're not from here, Flipper Ship Drive is probably not a traveled way and probably may not be as easy for some people to find.

148
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:49,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can definitely work with Todd's office for signage design and guidance on how to do that.

149
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:54,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for what it's worth, a quick search, deep cuts close at 11 o'clock.

150
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:56,636
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the latest they'd be out.

151
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:02,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, 6 to midnight or whatever, whatever you guys think.

152
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: But Todd, didn't you say you had a contact at Lyft?

153
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,962
[SPEAKER_11]: We do, but like I said, we could get in touch with the overall firm at the individual drivers.

154
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:11,862
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll do our best.

155
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:15,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And the signage at the drop-off site itself is great.

156
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever Jessica gives the theater is great.

157
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:19,406
[SPEAKER_11]: And the additional signage, that's great, too.

158
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:23,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Jessica, I just wanted to ask a clarifying question because I don't know if we mentioned this.

159
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:29,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you proposing this as a pilot that you could revisit like three months, six months later and see how it's working?

160
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

161
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I forgot to mention.

162
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:33,632
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a pilot that we would initiate first.

163
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:40,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would think six months.

164
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:50,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure as how many shows Chevalier had, but at least he would want to get as many shows in as possible so you get the best data for knowing how many shows they've had.

165
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:57,917
[SPEAKER_04]: If we only have one or two in a six-month period, I don't know if that would be enough, but it seems like they do a show probably every week, probably in the spring here.

166
00:13:58,058 --> 00:13:59,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a good schedule.

167
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,178
[SPEAKER_04]: This September.

168
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,720
[SPEAKER_14]: The rest of the year.

169
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, six months would bring it to,

170
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,103
[SPEAKER_04]: April.

171
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:15,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the reason I highlighted that is whatever this commission tries, we could always have another bite of the apple.

172
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's good to try something and then either add or tweak if needed.

173
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:24,718
[SPEAKER_10]: During this time period, would it be no parking there for anybody else?

174
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,543
[SPEAKER_01]: From six to midnight or whenever we decide the length of time.

175
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:31,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so

176
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:43,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Those parking spaces become no parking and just the ride share pickup drop off location from six to I like at least his idea of one am because then if this works out, well, we can just keep it.

177
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:53,734
[SPEAKER_11]: And this commission did approve a similar thing, the other green line station of 2 or 3 spaces a while back.

178
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:54,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

179
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Those people that live at the Mystic Driving School building, those are condos now.

180
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:06,765
[SPEAKER_10]: They have their own parking lot in the back now, I believe?

181
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there's 13 spots.

182
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,148
[SPEAKER_10]: In that little lot there?

183
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:12,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

184
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:16,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right where the

185
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:19,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Right basically by the river.

186
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:21,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're right behind the right behind the building.

187
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:22,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I kind of see it for a little bit.

188
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:23,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

189
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:24,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

190
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:24,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

191
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

192
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:35,733
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think if if the concern with overnight this for residents, I don't think there's any residents that live near these spaces.

193
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure that they would be used for that.

194
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:39,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check.

195
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:39,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

196
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever put it and I came back and I go straight.

197
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:43,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see.

198
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm on board.

199
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it would really be from the commission, or so I understand it.

200
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:58,949
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a pickup drop off area from, let's say, 6 p.m.

201
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,130
[SPEAKER_04]: to 1 a.m.

202
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:07,855
[SPEAKER_04]: No parking at that time except

203
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:09,912
[SPEAKER_04]: holidays and Sundays.

204
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:11,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I know other signs have said that.

205
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know what we're going to put on the sign.

206
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:15,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also is this a six month trial?

207
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:20,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're coming back in the April meeting to reassess just so I can, we can write it down correctly.

208
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that would be for the commissioners and Jessica, what kind of you guys all think?

209
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the way you described it sounds fine to me.

210
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:36,706
[SPEAKER_10]: The holidays and, what are you, Sundays and holidays thing, I don't know what the schedule is.

211
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:39,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they have shows all the time, right?

212
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:40,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Holidays too.

213
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually just going to pull up their calendar.

214
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:48,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they definitely do have some shows on Sundays.

215
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,111
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather just make it all the time.

216
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:57,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's consistent because then like restaurants can count on it as well.

217
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we're only making it evenings.

218
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:07,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say like, I noticed Sunday shows tend to be sometimes two o'clock in the afternoon, Saturday shows are sometimes in the afternoon.

219
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,076
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great point, Alicia.

220
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:17,519
[SPEAKER_11]: You could consider doing, you know, noon, 2 p.m.

221
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,740
[SPEAKER_00]: to 1 a.m.

222
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,521
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only four spaces, I mean.

223
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:24,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually like to ask, why wouldn't we make it just all the time?

224
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it confusing that it's only sometimes?

225
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:35,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what would be the demand from... Like, I don't see people who are frequenting businesses finding this to be their best parking.

226
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,351
[SPEAKER_04]: The barber shop and shop...

227
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:46,542
[SPEAKER_04]: The barbershop that's next to it, the Marine building on the corner there as well.

228
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:54,708
[SPEAKER_04]: But the bank has their own parking lot, but I know the barbershop and there's another building above.

229
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:57,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's a tax building above the barbershop.

230
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,630
[SPEAKER_04]: What's above the barbershop?

231
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,532
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one other business on there.

232
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:01,472
[SPEAKER_04]: That studio.

233
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:05,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is, we have actually,

234
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:12,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Ticketed because that where that membership drive arrows where we block off is so busy.

235
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,316
[SPEAKER_04]: They always park on the end.

236
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't park in a parking spot.

237
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:20,357
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably have 150 tickets for vehicles parking on the end.

238
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:26,879
[SPEAKER_11]: So this area here where I'm pointing just the triangle piece with the end of where you're pointing.

239
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.

240
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:29,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.

241
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't.

242
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Go like a block further and park legally.

243
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, they pull right there and we probably have 150 in the parking lot and the bus can't make that swing.

244
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:52,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I guess the other things to consider Alicia's question about why 6 PM currently it's paid for Park 8 to 6. so whatever, which doesn't mean you can't do what you're suggesting.

245
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,485
[SPEAKER_11]: It just means it would be.

246
00:18:54,738 --> 00:19:03,332
[SPEAKER_11]: an impact to revenue of some sort, and you'd have to adjust those one paved-apart areas at different times, or eliminate entirely that one block.

247
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:08,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the problem that we're solving exist during the day before that 6 p.m.

248
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:08,902
[SPEAKER_10]: hour?

249
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:26,264
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking more in terms of consistency for people whose behavior we're trying to change, that having a consistency is easier for changing behavior rather than it's a problem during business hours.

250
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:34,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it might make sense easier for signage and enforcement and revenue equipment to just do it all day then.

251
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,092
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going to do half, maybe just do it all the time.

252
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Just thinking out loud.

253
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:53,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, if we're because I think there was some thought that we were going to originally some of us who saw this early an early version thought it was a request to have these spots and these spots and these spots.

254
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:56,877
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was and we were like, well, maybe just for the evenings.

255
00:19:57,017 --> 00:20:00,498
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we realized that actually it was an either or question.

256
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,122
[SPEAKER_00]: So which is why, because this is four spots, if I remember if I think you said, Jess.

257
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:08,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

258
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is on the sign, whether we do 6 p.m.

259
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:14,623
[SPEAKER_04]: to 1 a.m.

260
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:19,546
[SPEAKER_04]: or all day, are we putting that they'll be towed or ticketed?

261
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:31,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because we need to know on our end what are, you know, if they're in these spots, what are we... I think it would be just a restricted space fine.

262
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:32,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Another.

263
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:35,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just mention in regards to

264
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,193
[SPEAKER_09]: the all-day parking.

265
00:20:38,953 --> 00:21:02,425
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is a lot of restaurants are not open during the day, and there are very few shows at Chevalier during the day, during the weekday, but there are businesses and small businesses on that block that do depend on people parking there, and every time you drive by, there's always people parking there, so it's a well-utilized location.

266
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:03,906
[SPEAKER_09]: The 6 p.m.

267
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,307
[SPEAKER_09]: again, as Todd alluded to, was

268
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,900
[SPEAKER_09]: the pay for parking ends at 6 p.m.

269
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,924
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think maybe during the pilot process, you look at the limited time to see how many people participate in the program.

270
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:24,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you'll have a better idea at that point, whether or not you expand it if there's a need.

271
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:25,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

272
00:21:26,588 --> 00:21:34,251
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's I mean, that's useful and it's useful to understand that the local businesses there usually actually are using that parking.

273
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:50,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I guess if I. Question I don't know if anybody knows the answer to this, but there's a row of parking there just on the other side of the sidewalk that.

274
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:59,368
[SPEAKER_10]: appears to be either part of the bank's parking lot or our public parking lot?

275
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:00,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ours.

276
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:11,461
[SPEAKER_09]: So along that and the first three spaces or four spaces on the other street, it's business and municipal in that location.

277
00:22:12,142 --> 00:22:19,406
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that the paint company, which is located on Salem Street, their employees park there as well.

278
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:32,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So those business spaces are pretty much used from 8.30 on from the business folks, as well as the bank, Middlesex Bank, those folks park in there as well for business.

279
00:22:38,455 --> 00:22:48,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm reluctant on the on the all day thing, the dedicated thing to Alicia, just because those those businesses that are right there, the barbershop, Medford Arts Council, I think, is there.

280
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:52,772
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple more, the recruiting agency.

281
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

282
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess to reiterate,

283
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:02,972
[SPEAKER_04]: If I read it correctly or misstate what it is, Jessica, Alicia, just let me know.

284
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:12,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're passing the motion so we can write it down, it would be a dedicated pickup drop-off area in Medford Square from 6 p.m.

285
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:13,475
[SPEAKER_04]: to 1 a.m.

286
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:18,676
[SPEAKER_04]: on Clippership Drive for a six-month pilot to be revisited on April.

287
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:21,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Traffic Commission, that sound about right?

288
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:22,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

289
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing on Riverside yet?

290
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:26,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing on Riverside.

291
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:27,298
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just one.

292
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:36,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Jordan to help specify maybe the on streets based on clippership West of Roland G pot your way also clippership West.

293
00:23:36,936 --> 00:23:41,060
[SPEAKER_11]: West of Roland or yeah, just so it's clear that East of Roland.

294
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:42,702
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't include any of those.

295
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:44,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

296
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:48,008
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I will.

297
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,043
[SPEAKER_04]: see if anybody from the public is here too.

298
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:59,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, commissioners, if you have any more questions or you have anything to ask on this, I'll leave it up to you.

299
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:06,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve, I know you're here as well, so I just want to pop it out to the commissioners if there are any other questions.

300
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:10,888
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, I'll ask the public to see if there's any questions against or for.

301
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:13,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have a question.

302
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:18,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we not entertain trying to set this up on one of the bigger public parking

303
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:31,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots, the issue I see is that your Uber drivers, which the majority of them come down Salem Street, are still gonna have to wind through the intersection to turn onto Clippership.

304
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:45,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wondered why we didn't, or did we look at maybe the big parking lot down on Clippership at Riverside or the one on City Hall Mall to kind of get that traffic out of the intersection

305
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:54,726
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my feeling that the only way to get this to work is to get people to actually go to that spot and then call their Uber or Lyft.

306
00:24:55,707 --> 00:25:01,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would get tired of walking all the way down there and say, I'm just gonna call them from right here.

307
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:10,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wouldn't be as successful in getting people to use it if it was that far from the theater.

308
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,795
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.

309
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have the ability to restrict

310
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:19,331
[SPEAKER_08]: calling the Uber until you get to the area?

311
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:25,715
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can call it and tell it where you will be, but we can't.

312
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:33,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd, maybe you can tell me for sure, but I don't think there's any way for us to say like you can't call it here.

313
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the only thing that Logan is that they get fined if they come and they pick up at the curb.

314
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:40,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't believe so.

315
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:44,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually you see like, oh, three minutes till they arrive.

316
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:47,867
[SPEAKER_11]: And that gives you time to go over or move the pin to where exactly you are.

317
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:52,269
[SPEAKER_11]: But usually when you request it, you have to give a location.

318
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it's on its way, you might even be able to adjust it.

319
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:55,451
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah.

320
00:25:55,471 --> 00:26:03,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question is, Todd, can we tell Uber and Lyft you're only allowed to pick up in this area in Medford Square?

321
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:10,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we could suggest that and recommend to the company, but the individual drivers are mostly subcontracted.

322
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:14,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So whether they listen to that or not, this is why it's a pilot.

323
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,459
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do the best we can.

324
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,643
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think we could force them though.

325
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:38,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I am aware of is that people have been navigating to the Chevalier Theater and then they are getting off 93 like up at Roosevelt Circle and coming down forest and that causes horrible backups in forest.

326
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:47,959
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of the hope is that if we say on the Chevalier website, here's the location to point your

327
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:53,189
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the address to put in for Uber and Lyft.

328
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,271
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the rideshare address to use.

329
00:26:55,351 --> 00:27:06,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give them the address of this spot that they would then actually take the exit off of at Medford Square instead and never come down Forest Street.

330
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:09,683
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if it works.

331
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:16,170
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that really answers the questions about the parking lot.

332
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if others think that.

333
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,110
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.

334
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:19,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the idea.

335
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:30,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I just am fearful of out-of-town overdrivers coming down Salem Street, taking a left on a main missing clipper ship, and then what?

336
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:36,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Just sometimes if you're not familiar with that quick turn on the clipper ship, you can miss it.

337
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:41,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Then just using the parking lot, it would seem like it gives us

338
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:49,529
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot more just room for like navigation and whatnot that, you know, there could actually be like a staging area.

339
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:55,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be candid, I don't think it's that compared to a place you might get off in Boston to go to a show.

340
00:27:55,752 --> 00:28:10,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's that unreasonably far, but, um, no, I'm just concerned question about why, why we didn't entertain using areas that we had control of that might provide us with a little bit more flexibility on logistics.

341
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:15,336
[SPEAKER_10]: To get to the parking lots, they would need to take that left if they're going down Salem anyway.

342
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,261
[SPEAKER_08]: You can take River Street.

343
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:27,324
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more what I was thinking actually.

344
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:29,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we look at those three spaces on River Street?

345
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:31,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think that might be even better.

346
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:33,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the idea of River Street.

347
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, I think this is a great pilot program.

348
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:40,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't vote no on it because I think we need something.

349
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:45,540
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would like us to keep in mind potentially, like, see how the traffic flow goes.

350
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we find something that's a little bit farther away that alleviates traffic.

351
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:55,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we can have a pilot program in which maybe.

352
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:59,706
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's us, that's looking into it, or somebody had to kind of figure out.

353
00:29:01,213 --> 00:29:05,116
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how the experience of people had, or, you know, is, has this been an issue?

354
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:06,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it hard for them to find the area?

355
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:11,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got feedback, not just, we put it in and then we don't look at it until April.

356
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:20,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we don't really know about it, which I don't think any of us would do, but it's just, we could have some feedback from Chevalier of how people and patrons or drivers are left.

357
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:29,436
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be, I don't know how we would go about that, but at least some sort of feedback, the areas we have detail officers out there, but they're, they're not going to,

358
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,411
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to see up here.

359
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:51,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, in the short term, if it became very well used and we found people were stacking backwards, we could potentially emergency just expand it to the east side of Roland G. If it got that heavy use, you know, we're worried about backups.

360
00:29:53,546 --> 00:30:05,673
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would also say that Uber drivers who are coming from Boston or other parts of Medford are going to be coming off Route 16 off-ramp and taking a right onto Main and a right there as well.

361
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:08,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So it depends on where the driver is located.

362
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:14,299
[SPEAKER_09]: And the traffic will probably be coming from the south on Main Street to take a right.

363
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's sort of balanced from the pickup perspective from the driver.

364
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,264
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were doing 6 PM to 1 am, I'm not sure.

365
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:27,410
[SPEAKER_04]: How many businesses are on river street, but if we.

366
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:31,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Just spitball and if we did both locations.

367
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:35,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there's any directly on River Street.

368
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:55,853
[SPEAKER_04]: If we did both locations and then, you know, had River Street and Clippership, so that way you would capture majority of people coming off of Salem Street would take River Street and the people coming off Route 16, you would have on Clippership and you're really only eliminating two, maybe two spots on River Street or whatever it may be.

369
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a handicap on the, on the bottom.

370
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: and just spitball and, you know, I think this is a good idea.

371
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,871
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a music center and insurance company on River Street.

372
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:08,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

373
00:31:08,752 --> 00:31:10,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't imagine they're open after 6 p.m.

374
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,440
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's my input.

375
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you got both locations, you're really trying to hammer the Lyft and Uber drivers.

376
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:30,844
[SPEAKER_04]: really kind of pinpoint whichever way they're coming.

377
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:35,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get them from Salem Street in 93 and then you're going to get them from 16 on the other side.

378
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:50,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That also helps out the other businesses like Tacuba and Deep Cuts and whatever restaurant that may be open after that hour.

379
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:52,815
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody's sitting down to have a drink, they could call over.

380
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:57,257
[SPEAKER_04]: That's obviously a wise decision for

381
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:08,379
[SPEAKER_04]: that, but I will leave it up to the commissioners and we'll see if the public has anything to input on this.

382
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll open it up to the public if the commissioners don't have anything else to say or ask.

383
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:19,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no more questions.

384
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,667
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in support of the commission application.

385
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,831
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I'll just open this up to the public.

386
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:30,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody for this?

387
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:35,286
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have anything, just raise your hand, question, comments, concerns.

388
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:44,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, anybody against this for rideshare on Clippership?

389
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:50,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Just raise your hand or aren't able to do that, just type in the chat and we'll be able to.

390
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:56,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, I'll bring it back to the commissioners.

391
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:06,326
[SPEAKER_04]: If we'd like to move forward on a motion, I think the motion on the table would be Clippership Drive, 6 p.m.

392
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:10,527
[SPEAKER_04]: to 1 a.m., like we had proposed, by the program until April meeting.

393
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:13,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So moved for the Clippership location as shown.

394
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

395
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

396
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, roll call, Elwett.

397
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:21,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGibbon?

398
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:22,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

399
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:23,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Hunt?

400
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:23,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

401
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:25,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

402
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:26,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

403
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Sergeant Canaba?

404
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:28,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

405
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:46,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Four to nothing vote that passes and we will revisit this come April and then I don't know how long it'll take for the signs but just let us know and we'll help out with everything we can for Chevalier if we have any connections over there to kind of give them a heads up.

406
00:33:46,545 --> 00:33:51,829
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as we get the sign order from Chief Alba then it only takes a couple days.

407
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:56,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, actually, no, if this is a custom sign, we need to make it, it might take longer.

408
00:33:56,643 --> 00:33:58,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, a couple of weeks.

409
00:33:58,684 --> 00:33:58,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

410
00:33:59,644 --> 00:33:59,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

411
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:00,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony, don't worry.

412
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:02,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jessica.

413
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:05,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'll work with the team to get signs up and communicate with Chevalier.

414
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:07,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect, thank you.

415
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:08,806
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

416
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:21,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, moving forward, 2024-49, no parking here to crosswalk on Fulton Street at Kellis Field, starting at 160 feet south of Maple Park, and I'm extending 20 feet south of the crosswalk.

417
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:23,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd.

418
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:29,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Have we passed this already before, Todd?

419
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,710
[SPEAKER_11]: We did a similar one on Summer Street recently.

420
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no parking here at a corner when people have.

421
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:36,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the other side.

422
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:36,111
[SPEAKER_13]: St.

423
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:36,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Fulton.

424
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Fulton, okay.

425
00:34:37,672 --> 00:34:37,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

426
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:38,812
[SPEAKER_13]: At the condos.

427
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:45,135
[SPEAKER_11]: So this image on the right with the yellow arrow of Gillis Park Field is on the left.

428
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:48,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it crosswalk crossing over towards Rockwood Terrace?

429
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:53,846
[SPEAKER_11]: When a car is parked in that yellow area, it's very difficult for a pedestrian and driver to see one another.

430
00:34:54,727 --> 00:35:00,809
[SPEAKER_11]: So this goes in line with other daylighting we've done elsewhere where the one parking space prior to would be restricted.

431
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:06,152
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be 24-7 restriction.

432
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:16,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a safety thing to me.

433
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:26,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people use all of this parking, but it looks like it's a safety thing and we need to do it.

434
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:30,949
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the road is full all the time.

435
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:34,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I bike up and down that on my way to and from work.

436
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's probably more for when the games are being in session.

437
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:39,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least.

438
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:40,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

439
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:44,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And people do park in these various spots.

440
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:51,555
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be just making sure that the people who are always parking here, like, because their apartment building doesn't have parking.

441
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,575
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Maple Park, but the one on the corner doesn't.

442
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:56,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim, who is this?

443
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:57,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim, you're not muted.

444
00:35:57,637 --> 00:36:00,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Anthony.

445
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:00,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim.

446
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:01,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

447
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:07,229
[SPEAKER_00]: that they just don't think to not park so close to the crosswalk.

448
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:10,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

449
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:14,633
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be right back, hopefully.

450
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:22,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just this basically just from these telephone poles to the crosswalks.

451
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:24,018
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a lot.

452
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:25,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's nothing.

453
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:31,461
[SPEAKER_11]: You have all this, and then it's just this one area here closest.

454
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:38,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, unless there's some objection from the public, I motion to approve this.

455
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:40,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I will pass it out.

456
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:48,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there anybody that is in favor that would like to speak on the crosswalk here at Fulton Street?

457
00:36:52,939 --> 00:37:00,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if there's anybody against eliminating the spot 160 feet from the crosswalk, raise your hand or enter in the chat.

458
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:05,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing none, pass it back to the commissioners.

459
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:10,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And Commissioner Brzezinski, is that a motion to pass with no vote?

460
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:11,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, motion to pass.

461
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:16,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, seconded by... I'll second it.

462
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Hunt, we'll call the roll.

463
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGiven?

464
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:20,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

465
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:23,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Hunt?

466
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:24,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

467
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

468
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:26,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

469
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:28,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Patrick Canava?

470
00:37:28,484 --> 00:37:32,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 4-0, and that has passed 2024-49.

471
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:34,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

472
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:45,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to 2024-50, request from Leslie Colasso, 34 Valley Road for no parking, private property side.

473
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ask you, Leslie, to unmute.

474
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:55,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you do so?

475
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

476
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,072
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

477
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:57,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, how are you doing?

478
00:37:57,993 --> 00:37:58,393
[SPEAKER_04]: We're well.

479
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:05,935
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to just kind of explain the no parking private property sign?

480
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:13,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I live at the end of a dead end road which runs parallel to Lookout Road on 34 Valley Road.

481
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dead end road.

482
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,282
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been here 26 years and my driveway touches the road.

483
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:29,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So people look at my driveway as if it's part of the road and park on it overnight.

484
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:33,746
[SPEAKER_02]: There've been cars, there've been trailers, there's been boats.

485
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want them parking on my property.

486
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:46,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking for two signs that say private property, no parking.

487
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:51,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trying to share the screen, but.

488
00:38:53,572 --> 00:38:54,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if you can't see me.

489
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:56,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

490
00:38:56,654 --> 00:39:04,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, so the, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't, the city doesn't issue private property signs.

491
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:06,864
[SPEAKER_04]: No parking.

492
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:08,746
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no parking sign.

493
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:12,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm confused if you're just looking for no parking.

494
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:22,081
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing that would prevent the applicant from putting up her own private property sign on her side of the property line.

495
00:39:22,101 --> 00:39:24,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that and they've taken them down.

496
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:26,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Who takes them down?

497
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:27,547
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighbors.

498
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:36,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have people parking, not on the part near the house, but on the part near the dead end street.

499
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:40,790
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, my driveway is 150 feet long.

500
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:46,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree, it looks like it's part of the road, but it's not part of the road.

501
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:49,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Which section are you talking about, where this Toyota is here?

502
00:39:50,037 --> 00:39:54,241
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all the way down to Valley Road, where the pavement stops.

503
00:39:56,642 --> 00:39:59,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you even get the Google car going down your driveway.

504
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,305
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, that's my property you're on.

505
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:03,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

506
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:04,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that.

507
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:06,367
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, it's just kicking me out.

508
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:07,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of property.

509
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:08,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's a long driveway.

510
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:10,589
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful property.

511
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:11,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank you.

512
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:22,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been there 26 years and never really had a problem, but now we've got somebody that likes to park there with a boat and a trailer in that area that I still own.

513
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:25,916
[SPEAKER_02]: That white car right there, I don't own that area.

514
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:33,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I'm familiar with these property lines because there was an issue that I dealt with a while back.

515
00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:37,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, where the sidewalk ends there, just for the commissioners' behalf.

516
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.

517
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: To your right, you'll see a fence pole.

518
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:46,695
[SPEAKER_02]: A metal fence pole.

519
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:48,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

520
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,119
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the property line right there.

521
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we got some snow.

522
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Jordan, I could share with you the assessment map, too, that shows.

523
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:58,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I will stop.

524
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:00,182
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go ahead.

525
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:06,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Valley Road is public or private?

526
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Public.

527
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:09,266
[SPEAKER_02]: We have sidewalks.

528
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:10,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I know.

529
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:11,747
[SPEAKER_10]: But it doesn't matter if it's sidewalks.

530
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:13,987
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just whether or not it's accepted by the city in the past.

531
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:14,448
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.

532
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:15,568
[SPEAKER_10]: It's public.

533
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:18,767
[SPEAKER_11]: You see that?

534
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:25,071
[SPEAKER_11]: So not the circle itself that shows in reality is on your property as well, that's what you're saying, yeah.

535
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:32,316
[SPEAKER_02]: The circle I created so that people could come down and turn around, but I don't want anyone parking there.

536
00:41:32,996 --> 00:41:33,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

537
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,220
[SPEAKER_02]: My property goes all the way down to Fellsway West.

538
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you own that other parcel with the access and utility easement on it as well?

539
00:41:42,322 --> 00:41:43,603
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mine, yeah.

540
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:44,104
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all...

541
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:49,700
[SPEAKER_10]: So you own lot A, lot B. And C. And C, okay.

542
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And some down on the Fells Bay as well.

543
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:52,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

544
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:59,766
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'd like a sign that transitions from public adjacent to number 30 Valley Road.

545
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,328
[SPEAKER_03]: But on Valley, not on my property, on Valley Road.

546
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:09,211
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

547
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Todd, do you have the public-private list right there at your fingertips?

548
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we just confirm?

549
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:16,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

550
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:17,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked it up.

551
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:19,534
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we're thinking alike.

552
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:20,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

553
00:42:20,994 --> 00:42:22,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I could share it if you want.

554
00:42:22,715 --> 00:42:23,055
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

555
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:26,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to confirm it's public because a lot of people sometimes think private roles are public.

556
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:27,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

557
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:30,018
[SPEAKER_11]: It says public according to our list.

558
00:42:30,038 --> 00:42:30,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

559
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Regardless of the set, I don't necessarily

560
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:41,190
[SPEAKER_11]: In my opinion, I don't think it's a traffic commission issue that needs to be voted on, because it's just a matter of, you know, it's public property, it's private property.

561
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:49,997
[SPEAKER_11]: If a sign goes there by a person or by the city, DPW, you know, whatever, I don't think it's necessarily something that needs to be voted on.

562
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:54,941
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a matter of putting a sign, you know, on one side of the line or the other.

563
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:58,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I agree with that.

564
00:42:58,564 --> 00:42:59,064
[SPEAKER_10]: So, is it Ms.

565
00:42:59,184 --> 00:42:59,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Galasso?

566
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:01,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I hear you say that?

567
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:06,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Miss Colasso?

568
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:08,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that your name?

569
00:43:08,783 --> 00:43:09,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm here.

570
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:11,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I saying it right?

571
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:13,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Galapagos, correct, yes.

572
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:17,445
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm the Commissioner of Public Works.

573
00:43:17,465 --> 00:43:23,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So you got a public way, and then it enters your private property, that lot B, with an easement that goes over to the lot that your house is on.

574
00:43:24,326 --> 00:43:27,506
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's that kind of dirt circle that you made for turnaround.

575
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:30,327
[SPEAKER_10]: So your rights in there are kind of vast.

576
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:33,148
[SPEAKER_10]: You could put up a gate if you wanted to at the end of the road.

577
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:34,928
[SPEAKER_10]: You could put up all,

578
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,950
[SPEAKER_10]: barricades if you want, that only you can move.

579
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:47,616
[SPEAKER_10]: You can take action against people who are trespassing on your property if you put a no trespassing sign at the end of the road.

580
00:43:48,597 --> 00:43:51,519
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are the options that are available to you, but the- I have done.

581
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:55,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done the signs and they've ripped them down several times.

582
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:56,162
[SPEAKER_10]: That's illegal.

583
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:56,923
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't do that.

584
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:57,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a crime.

585
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:01,326
[SPEAKER_10]: So you could take that matter up with the police.

586
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll ask as far as a sign.

587
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:07,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but what I'm telling you is we can't really give you one.

588
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:08,350
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't really do that.

589
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:15,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm giving you what your options are as a private property owner that has, you know, this end of the road property.

590
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:18,718
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, this condition, you're not the only one with this condition.

591
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:23,642
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens all over the place, other towns and cities and whatnot.

592
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:31,309
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can put a sign at the end of the public way that says end of public way.

593
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:32,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

594
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:33,962
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be good.

595
00:44:33,982 --> 00:44:40,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that actually might do it right if we put a thing that said end of public road or end of public way.

596
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:48,670
[SPEAKER_00]: That, because I think what I'm hearing is that the problem is the neighbors don't believe that it's her private property.

597
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:54,733
[SPEAKER_00]: They've said that yes, they've said they don't believe it's your property.

598
00:44:55,113 --> 00:44:55,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

599
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Based on what we're looking at, you're actually very gracious to offer that circle to turn around.

600
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:09,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you did do one of the things that Commissioner McGiven suggested, they wouldn't even be able to physically turn around there.

601
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:10,456
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would become worse for them.

602
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:13,938
[SPEAKER_11]: So they should realize how nice you've been over the years.

603
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:14,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

604
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:15,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I can help you too.

605
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:16,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I live in this neighborhood.

606
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:20,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm moving, but I do live kind of close to you on Waterville.

607
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:28,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I could talk to your neighbor with you and explain the property lines and how they work and who's got rights for what.

608
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:35,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that access easement that you own, that you benefit from, would allow public access.

609
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:41,778
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably want to just make sure that your easement, the written words of your easement, doesn't give public access.

610
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:43,258
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.

611
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:43,918
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in writing.

612
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:45,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it in writing if you want to see it.

613
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:46,539
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't need to see it.

614
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:47,799
[SPEAKER_10]: I just.

615
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:49,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime I've got it in writing.

616
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,841
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, I just wanted to make sure that you, you know, read it and you know it and all that and it doesn't have anything that gives anybody else's rights.

617
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:56,201
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.

618
00:45:56,641 --> 00:46:00,402
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like it's a private easement on private property for your rights and all that.

619
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:01,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

620
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:04,843
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're in a great position to do any of the things I said you could.

621
00:46:05,003 --> 00:46:06,683
[SPEAKER_10]: You could put up a gate and lock it if you wanted to.

622
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:14,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're looking just looking for a sign today, but I think the most that we could really do and it's I don't even know if it's a traffic commission thing.

623
00:46:15,785 --> 00:46:18,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I'll ask, you know, Jordan or the chief to chop in there.

624
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:18,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Todd.

625
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:23,592
[SPEAKER_10]: This is definitely not a traffic commission vote.

626
00:46:24,632 --> 00:46:32,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it could be just the DPW works with you to put up a sign that just says end of public way or something like that.

627
00:46:33,899 --> 00:46:42,226
[SPEAKER_10]: That may help, but I think if I was you and I was in this position, I would definitely put up some sort of barricade.

628
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:54,875
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's destroyed or taken down, and if you put a no trespassing sign up that says no trespassing, like you can get them at the hardware store, then you can actually prosecute somebody for passing that sign.

629
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done that.

630
00:46:57,277 --> 00:46:57,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done that.

631
00:46:58,278 --> 00:47:00,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sign disappears overnight.

632
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know who's ripping it down.

633
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:02,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

634
00:47:04,278 --> 00:47:05,719
[SPEAKER_10]: You should be calling the police when that happens.

635
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,101
[SPEAKER_17]: To file a report that goes nowhere.

636
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:12,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the police are here.

637
00:47:12,802 --> 00:47:13,902
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't think it would go.

638
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:15,703
[SPEAKER_10]: These things don't go nowhere.

639
00:47:15,723 --> 00:47:16,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that wasn't me.

640
00:47:17,163 --> 00:47:17,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

641
00:47:18,004 --> 00:47:18,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

642
00:47:19,064 --> 00:47:20,525
[SPEAKER_17]: That's someone else in the background.

643
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:24,026
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the daughter chiming in because we've been dealing with this for 26 years.

644
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:27,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And finally, we've tried to speak to you because

645
00:47:28,828 --> 00:47:36,155
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember 10 years ago, we had, 10, 15 years ago, we had the chief of police Sasso come here and speak to us.

646
00:47:36,235 --> 00:47:37,957
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, oh yeah, we'll have it done.

647
00:47:38,117 --> 00:47:44,383
[SPEAKER_17]: And then he wrote it down in his little notebook and never, never did it again, never saw any sign.

648
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:51,589
[SPEAKER_17]: He never came back for it, but he came down, spoke to us, saw the land, heard our concerns,

649
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:52,810
[SPEAKER_17]: to the neighbors.

650
00:47:53,051 --> 00:48:00,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and he spoke to the neighbors back then and we have still had people parking all along there all night long.

651
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:08,481
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other problem is that the trash truck will use that turnaround to turn around as well, which is the whole point of it.

652
00:48:08,862 --> 00:48:14,125
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there's cars all along that turnaround, the trash truck cannot do its maneuvering.

653
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:16,107
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it is a traffic

654
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:19,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It isn't a problem, but it isn't.

655
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:26,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a private property issue, but we I can help you as the DBW commissioner and I'm sure I don't know if the chief is there now, but this is a different chief.

656
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:27,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we get.

657
00:48:27,878 --> 00:48:31,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I understand that, but it should have been handled 15 years ago and it wasn't.

658
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:33,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know what I mean?

659
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:36,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand what you're saying, but that was 15 years ago.

660
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:36,689
[SPEAKER_10]: You're here today.

661
00:48:36,729 --> 00:48:37,770
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about it.

662
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:44,736
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my purview, and I can come even down there tonight and talk to you about it and talk to you later.

663
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:55,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if we need to get the police involved because they're not obeying no trespassing signs and all that, then you can open up a conversation with the police.

664
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:02,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think it would be great if you could do the end of public way.

665
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:10,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Even if it's just that, and then we can take care of the no trespassing sign, the what have you, the no overnight parking.

666
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:13,864
[SPEAKER_17]: If we have to do that ourselves, we can have that done.

667
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:17,427
[SPEAKER_04]: If any vehicle is parked and I turn around and loop.

668
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,965
[SPEAKER_04]: being private property, you can call any private tow you'd like and have it towed out.

669
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:27,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, the police cannot tow off of that private lot.

670
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:32,348
[SPEAKER_10]: You can call a tow company and just have them tow.

671
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:37,112
[SPEAKER_10]: You can put up a sign that tells a person where the tow company is, but I don't even think you need to do that.

672
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:44,678
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think that end of public way, honestly, would be more than enough.

673
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,942
[SPEAKER_17]: If you guys would, I don't know, agree on that, but it seems like you don't want to.

674
00:49:51,127 --> 00:49:52,447
[SPEAKER_10]: that we don't want to, it's not our purview.

675
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:58,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just, I think we can take this offline and I can continue the conversation with you after this.

676
00:49:59,149 --> 00:49:59,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

677
00:49:59,609 --> 00:49:59,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

678
00:49:59,889 --> 00:50:06,770
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they had originally told us was that we wouldn't have to go through this meeting, but then they ended up sending us paperwork that we were going to be in the meeting anyway.

679
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:16,952
[SPEAKER_17]: But the woman that we spoke to, excuse me, the woman we spoke to at city hall said, oh yeah, I think we could get this taken care of before

680
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:24,551
[SPEAKER_17]: It even comes to the meeting, but yeah, I mean, we're just here because we got a letter in the mail saying to be here, you know?

681
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:25,912
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we understand.

682
00:50:26,052 --> 00:50:32,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So Commissioner McGibbon will speak to you offline, and then you guys can handle that from there.

683
00:50:33,816 --> 00:50:38,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that we don't want to vote for it, it's just not under the traffic unit.

684
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just quickly, the reason is because

685
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:54,573
[SPEAKER_11]: You know this this group decides on traffic regulations but that's that would be deciding on where is public property and in private property against it's already established it's already known right it's just signage to approve.

686
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it okay, thank you thank you time.

687
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:06,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I will cross it off here and I will take that off the agenda.

688
00:51:06,676 --> 00:51:12,198
[SPEAKER_14]: I will receive and place on file where it has already been on the agenda.

689
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:14,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so I'm not just going to cross it off.

690
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,821
[SPEAKER_14]: The action was received and placed on file.

691
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:18,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, so do we still have to vote on that?

692
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:21,243
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not necessarily.

693
00:51:21,263 --> 00:51:25,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I will take care of that and receive it and place it on file for the agenda.

694
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:27,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the next issue.

695
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: 2024-51, request from Peggy Rose, 87 Monument Street, for no parking here to corner signs on Harvard Ave at Monument Northeast and Southeast corner.

696
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:52,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So Peggy, if you are here, ask you to unmute or raise your hand.

697
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:56,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Assuming Pat Arsenault is this.

698
00:51:58,993 --> 00:51:59,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

699
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:00,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, how are you?

700
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:02,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

701
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:03,956
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Kat Eisenhart.

702
00:52:04,356 --> 00:52:05,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what you're going to?

703
00:52:05,677 --> 00:52:06,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one?

704
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:07,858
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're looking for Peggy Rose.

705
00:52:07,998 --> 00:52:08,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I thought so.

706
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:09,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

707
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am not seeing Peggy Rose.

708
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:18,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we have anybody else here besides us and Pat.

709
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:21,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Table it.

710
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll table it.

711
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:25,640
[SPEAKER_04]: And do we need a vote for that?

712
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:25,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

713
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, excuse me for a second, Sergeant.

714
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:29,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, go ahead.

715
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:41,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Since it's not requesting any specific distance, if they're just asking for signs to reinforce the existing 20-foot rule, it may not be a traffic commission item.

716
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:44,189
[SPEAKER_11]: It would only be if it was beyond the 20 feet.

717
00:52:44,249 --> 00:52:46,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't look like they're specifying anything different.

718
00:52:47,794 --> 00:53:15,632
[SPEAKER_04]: so that might be a you can't park in front park a vehicle 20 feet within an intersection anyways is that what you're saying correct so it's already a restriction of regulation so if it's just a matter of putting a sign reinforcing the existing 20 feet it's kind of like just a dpw request i guess we'll contact her for the next traffic commission unless she wants 30 or 40 feet something beyond 20 when we speak with her we'll ask her if it's beyond the 20 foot mark but for now it'll be tabled we'll move on to uh

719
00:53:16,578 --> 00:53:19,419
[SPEAKER_04]: 2024-52, no parking, 7 a.m.

720
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:20,119
[SPEAKER_04]: to 9 a.m.

721
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:21,039
[SPEAKER_04]: and 4 p.m.

722
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:21,700
[SPEAKER_04]: to 6 p.m.

723
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:28,402
[SPEAKER_04]: on the west side of 4th Street, approximately 90 feet north of Medford Square, extending 85 feet north in front of vacant lot.

724
00:53:28,482 --> 00:53:33,123
[SPEAKER_04]: This will provide for two short lanes, verse one during rush hour.

725
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Blake, sorry, Tom.

726
00:53:40,246 --> 00:53:40,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

727
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:43,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll share my screen.

728
00:53:52,575 --> 00:54:06,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you go forward to this, if I could ask the commissioners, since 2024-56 is the last participant, 29 Ridgeway Road, if we could move that up and move that next to go over that.

729
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:26,832
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't have to wade through all the other proposals we have, but that's up to the commissioners to pull it out of order.

730
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:33,196
[SPEAKER_04]: She's asking for a request for Patricia Eisenhower to Ridgeway Road to discuss speed and traffic problems on Ridgeway Road.

731
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:38,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even sure this is an issue with the traffic commission, so if we can pull that up and I'll see her.

732
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:44,703
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's something that we can handle as a police department outside of this, I'd just like to move that one up.

733
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:49,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to move that we go out of order and take that item next.

734
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, second.

735
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:51,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, great.

736
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to move 2024-56.

737
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we call for that, correct?

738
00:54:57,951 --> 00:54:58,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move that.

739
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:02,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Pat, we're going to go to you and speak on this issue.

740
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:10,495
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is a police issue that we can handle, if it's speeding on your road, I'm not sure that would go through traffic commission.

741
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:12,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I hope it does.

742
00:55:12,638 --> 00:55:15,641
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been to the Traffic Commission for 33 years about this.

743
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,484
[SPEAKER_16]: 33 years, gentlemen and ladies.

744
00:55:20,705 --> 00:55:23,127
[SPEAKER_16]: I started this when my daughter was five years old.

745
00:55:23,207 --> 00:55:23,527
[SPEAKER_16]: She's 38 now.

746
00:55:25,768 --> 00:55:28,630
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you're aware of where Ridgeway Road lay.

747
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:30,191
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a private way.

748
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:32,233
[SPEAKER_16]: It has been in my family.

749
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:36,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I have lived, my family has lived on this street for 98 years.

750
00:55:36,476 --> 00:55:38,558
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in one of the ancestral homes.

751
00:55:39,158 --> 00:55:43,922
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the pleasure of running between Fulton Street and Roosevelt Circle.

752
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:48,125
[SPEAKER_16]: We are the only street that dumps out onto Roosevelt Circle.

753
00:55:48,806 --> 00:55:54,830
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are being used as an exit ramp to 93, both morning and afternoon.

754
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:59,703
[SPEAKER_16]: It has acerbated to the degree of ridiculousness.

755
00:56:00,643 --> 00:56:03,706
[SPEAKER_16]: from 3.30 till six and seven o'clock at night.

756
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:10,252
[SPEAKER_16]: They get stuck in traffic down on the Fells Way coming northbound at Fulton Street.

757
00:56:10,973 --> 00:56:14,836
[SPEAKER_16]: They come up the bike lane onto Fulton Street.

758
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:16,818
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't wait for a light or anything.

759
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:25,807
[SPEAKER_16]: They come around, they come up to our street and they fly down it trying to beat the traffic that they've circumvented at the stoplight.

760
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:38,897
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a stop sign in the middle of the road at Upland Road that we had put in with Captain, Captain, I'm sorry, Chief Sacco, just to slow people down.

761
00:56:40,118 --> 00:56:42,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Right at the top of the hill there, there is a stop sign.

762
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:46,100
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in that where the red truck is, I'm right there.

763
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,482
[SPEAKER_16]: That stop sign, I would say nine out of 10 people blow through.

764
00:56:51,298 --> 00:56:52,198
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't stop.

765
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:56,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Now they have the point of, you can see my driveway on the left-hand side.

766
00:56:57,361 --> 00:57:17,851
[SPEAKER_16]: When my daughter and I come home at night at 3.30, four o'clock, I will put my directional on to come in my driveway and they will try to pass me on the left-hand side of my vehicle and T-bone me coming into my driveway, trying to go around me at a stop sign at the top of a hill.

767
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:21,484
[SPEAKER_16]: It's mind boggling.

768
00:57:21,824 --> 00:57:26,107
[SPEAKER_16]: And when I say I'm going to call the police, my daughter says to me, why bother?

769
00:57:26,168 --> 00:57:26,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody cares.

770
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:36,997
[SPEAKER_16]: In the end of the street, if you'll look at that end, you'll notice that the Fulton Street end has a blind corner going up Fulton Street.

771
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:49,965
[SPEAKER_16]: I have always thought that we should have, and I don't know why it wasn't done when they put Roosevelt Circle in, which I have to add was obsolete before they finished it.

772
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,781
[SPEAKER_16]: We are the only street that jumps out onto this.

773
00:57:54,141 --> 00:58:09,275
[SPEAKER_16]: If you'll notice the traffic on the Fellsway, it's two lanes of the Fellsway meeting an exit ramp of an interstate highway with two lanes of Roosevelt Circle and a private way, all at the same place.

774
00:58:10,493 --> 00:58:13,916
[SPEAKER_16]: People come out of my street onto the Fells Way.

775
00:58:14,217 --> 00:58:18,741
[SPEAKER_16]: The number of accidents they've caused down there is mind boggling.

776
00:58:19,522 --> 00:58:25,228
[SPEAKER_16]: We've heard people, you know, I've watched people go off in the ambulances without appendages since I've lived here.

777
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:31,914
[SPEAKER_16]: The street really should, I don't know how you're gonna solve this, but our street really should be blocked off at the end.

778
00:58:32,774 --> 00:58:34,696
[SPEAKER_16]: There's the blind corner at the Fulton end.

779
00:58:35,757 --> 00:58:41,560
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just the whole street, unfortunately, when it was put in, let's face it, back in the day, they were cow paths.

780
00:58:42,241 --> 00:58:46,904
[SPEAKER_16]: My grandmother climbed over cow pasture land fences to pick out her lot of land here.

781
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:52,668
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, these streets weren't planned, but it's now they're coming up.

782
00:58:52,688 --> 00:58:52,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

783
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:54,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we just ask you?

784
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:55,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

785
00:58:55,765 --> 00:59:02,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously this is before the Traffic Commission, so we can kind of narrow in here what exactly you're asking for.

786
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:03,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm asking for a solution.

787
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:19,819
[SPEAKER_16]: I went to Chief Sacco years ago, many, many times about this, and I was told, and I don't know if you're aware of it, but I was told that there really wasn't too much they could do about it because my brother was the head of traffic, and he lives on the street, and it would be considered nepotism, favoritism.

788
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:24,370
[SPEAKER_16]: So they gave us the stop sign to kind of slow people down.

789
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:29,892
[SPEAKER_16]: But as you probably know, being police officers in the city, people don't obey signs anymore.

790
00:59:31,053 --> 00:59:44,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have been out on Ridgeway, the traffic department, and out here from Fulton to Ridgeway on mornings more so than the evening.

791
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, right.

792
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,682
[SPEAKER_04]: To alleviate the issue of people turning right.

793
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:49,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

794
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:51,844
[SPEAKER_16]: which they still do.

795
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:55,270
[SPEAKER_16]: We had officer I believe Sebastian was there.

796
00:59:57,715 --> 01:00:01,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I guess before we can talk offline but this

797
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:05,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you have something that you'd like to traffic commission.

798
01:00:05,654 --> 01:00:08,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, what I'm asking you for is some way.

799
01:00:08,315 --> 01:00:12,117
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I've been told because it's a private way, there's not too much anybody can do.

800
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,218
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I'm asking you is it's public safety.

801
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,820
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm seeing these speed tables around the town.

802
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Why haven't we been given a speed bump?

803
01:00:23,122 --> 01:00:25,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to address the private way piece of this.

804
01:00:32,112 --> 01:00:32,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

805
01:00:34,395 --> 01:00:41,757
[SPEAKER_10]: The ownership of that road belongs most likely, because I'm sure it's derelict the way you described it, is to the frontage holders.

806
01:00:42,477 --> 01:00:45,118
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you say- Actually, excuse me.

807
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:49,359
[SPEAKER_16]: We were told by the solicitor, Mark Rumley, that is not true.

808
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:53,040
[SPEAKER_16]: That we were always believed that we owned to the middle of the street.

809
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,221
[SPEAKER_16]: We had to put in our own sidewalks.

810
01:00:55,861 --> 01:01:02,303
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when Mike McGlynn came and paved our street and none of us wanted it, we now have a runway.

811
01:01:03,143 --> 01:01:04,525
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were told we do not.

812
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:11,593
[SPEAKER_16]: If we thought we owned that street, then we don't have to have garbage collection and we don't have to have fire and police and all those things.

813
01:01:11,974 --> 01:01:12,915
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's not how it works.

814
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:13,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

815
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:15,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't around back then.

816
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:16,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

817
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:16,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

818
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty well versed in what's allowed in public ways and private ways and what the differences are and all that.

819
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:26,252
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, this is a private way.

820
01:01:26,272 --> 01:01:27,593
[SPEAKER_10]: It's signed as a private way.

821
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:31,677
[SPEAKER_10]: The speed tables that you're seeing around the city are on public ways.

822
01:01:31,998 --> 01:01:32,778
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that.

823
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:33,579
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that.

824
01:01:33,619 --> 01:01:38,184
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just going to let him speak and then you can.

825
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can spend public tax dollars on the public ways, but we

826
01:01:42,288 --> 01:01:47,954
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't spend public tax dollars on private ways in the capital improvement sort of way.

827
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:54,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can do things because the public does have rights in the private way, and they can travel through it, as you know, and we're talking about that.

828
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:57,764
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't have care and control of the road.

829
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:00,627
[SPEAKER_10]: We can pave it, which you saw Mike McGlynn do,

830
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:02,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I wasn't around back then.

831
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:08,490
[SPEAKER_10]: You should have received permission from the title holders of the land, which would be the folks who are frontage holders.

832
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:10,491
[SPEAKER_10]: In this case, I believe it's derelict.

833
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:13,232
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not derelict, that's different, but I don't think that's the case.

834
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,932
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no homeowners association that owns it.

835
01:02:15,952 --> 01:02:20,734
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no developer that built the houses that's still around that owns the way and plows it.

836
01:02:21,114 --> 01:02:21,874
[SPEAKER_10]: The city plows it.

837
01:02:21,894 --> 01:02:22,694
[SPEAKER_10]: We fix potholes.

838
01:02:22,714 --> 01:02:24,415
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like we paved it in the past.

839
01:02:25,395 --> 01:02:26,516
[SPEAKER_10]: We put up a stop sign.

840
01:02:28,057 --> 01:02:32,200
[SPEAKER_10]: We probably shouldn't even have put up a stop sign, to be honest with you, but we did.

841
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:34,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's done is done.

842
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:45,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, when the city says that there's not a lot that we can do, that doesn't mean that there's nothing that the owners of the land can do.

843
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:52,816
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as you're not violating the rights of the public who can travel through the way from Fulton to Roosevelt Circle,

844
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,919
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as you're not violating those rights, you can really do what you want.

845
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,763
[SPEAKER_10]: So you could put your own speed table in if you and your neighbors all agree to do it.

846
01:03:02,004 --> 01:03:03,826
[SPEAKER_10]: You can build your own sidewalks, like you said.

847
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:06,469
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't do these sorts of things in public ways.

848
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:09,912
[SPEAKER_10]: The public ways are under the control of the city.

849
01:03:11,173 --> 01:03:14,937
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully that helps sort of clear this up a little bit.

850
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:19,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I'm not sure what Mr. Rumley told you back in the day.

851
01:03:20,962 --> 01:03:27,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe this road does have an owner and we don't know about it, but it's probably not the case.

852
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:30,811
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, that's what I have to say.

853
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:35,095
[SPEAKER_16]: So who has jurisdiction on the speed on the street?

854
01:03:35,736 --> 01:03:36,496
[SPEAKER_10]: The police department.

855
01:03:36,516 --> 01:03:37,938
[SPEAKER_10]: That would still be the police department.

856
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I have not seen a police cruiser on this street since my brother retired.

857
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:57,828
[SPEAKER_04]: except we've got a trailer up there a radar trailer you know when no we put a radar trailer there what three four years ago so we can speak offline on any speeding enforcement that you would like on

858
01:03:59,454 --> 01:04:07,578
[SPEAKER_04]: You can speak with Sergeant Caraviello or Sergeant Rogers, either one of us, both in the traffic department, and we'd be more than happy to get our enforcement officers out there.

859
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:14,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've had enforcement on Ridgeway Road from Fulton and Ridgeway, and we had a speed trailer on there, I believe, for six months.

860
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:16,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not exactly sure on the date.

861
01:04:16,803 --> 01:04:17,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I think four years ago.

862
01:04:18,344 --> 01:04:26,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it possible for the Medford Police Department to speak to the state police about the traffic coming up from the Fellsway illegally on a bike path?

863
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:32,046
[SPEAKER_04]: We can absolutely speak to the state police.

864
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:32,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

865
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:35,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is better served on the offline.

866
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:37,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I have your information.

867
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:43,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I will personally call you after this meeting and we can get all your information for an email and anything else that we can get through.

868
01:04:43,889 --> 01:04:44,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

869
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very.

870
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:53,524
[SPEAKER_16]: upsetting thing to be able to come home at night and not pull in your driveway.

871
01:04:53,944 --> 01:04:59,187
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've actually had men get out of their car and tell me to shut my mouth or they'd snap my neck.

872
01:04:59,847 --> 01:05:05,991
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you just, you know, when you live someplace, you don't expect people to abuse the street you live on.

873
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:08,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Some kids gonna get killed up here, guys.

874
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: We will absolutely understand your frustration and myself and Sergeant Rogers will speak with you offline and we can get everything settled and situated for the traffic, a few speed radars and whatever else not.

875
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:26,152
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, and I do seem to have people that probably know.

876
01:05:26,553 --> 01:05:31,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to know who owns the end of the street on the Fellsway end.

877
01:05:31,716 --> 01:05:39,080
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand when it was put in, the Roosevelt Circle end was put in, that Leonard Circle up to the first house

878
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:43,800
[SPEAKER_16]: after Leonard Circle was owned by the state, is that correct?

879
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:49,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'd have to look it up, but at some point it goes from private way to State Road.

880
01:05:49,985 --> 01:05:51,486
[SPEAKER_10]: The city doesn't have a road down there.

881
01:05:51,987 --> 01:05:57,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, so they would be, it would be the state then that would have to shut it off, the street off, correct?

882
01:05:58,092 --> 01:06:05,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a gray area, because the public does have rights to pass through the private way.

883
01:06:05,998 --> 01:06:07,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know if you can block it off,

884
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:13,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, they did to the other streets across the Fellsway off of South Porter Road.

885
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:15,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are dead ends and circles.

886
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:20,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Those used to end up on Forest Street before 93, just like we did.

887
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:23,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, but now they're dead ends, so they have nowhere to go.

888
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:30,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about this is a through street, so it has one end on a road and the other end on the road, so it's not a dead end or anything like that.

889
01:06:30,655 --> 01:06:40,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you have a right-of-way, private, public, or otherwise, and it connects two places, then the public does have a right to pass through there.

890
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:53,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess what I'm trying to say, Tim, is why can't it be for public safety closed off because of where it ends up with that number of roads meeting all of that place?

891
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:58,402
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you're aware in your lifetime of the number of accidents that are down there.

892
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:00,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's a lot.

893
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:04,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is something that you'd have to take up with the state because that's where the private road intersects with state.

894
01:07:04,975 --> 01:07:06,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's what I'm wondering.

895
01:07:06,516 --> 01:07:12,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yeah, that we'd have to take that up with the state if the state decided to, you know, do it, change the road.

896
01:07:13,465 --> 01:07:14,807
[SPEAKER_10]: They, they could do that.

897
01:07:15,307 --> 01:07:17,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

898
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:25,993
[SPEAKER_10]: One more thing I wanted to just to make sure you know, you and your neighbors are interested in making that a public way so that the city can spend public tax dollars on things.

899
01:07:26,954 --> 01:07:28,335
[SPEAKER_10]: We can have that conversation too.

900
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:35,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell you the step-by-step process on how to get from private way and where you are now to an accepted public way that the city.

901
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:37,480
[SPEAKER_16]: What would be the benefit in that?

902
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:43,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we can't spend public tax dollars for capital improvements on a private way.

903
01:07:43,442 --> 01:07:48,244
[SPEAKER_10]: So when that road falls apart in the future, the city, we don't have it on our capital improvement plan.

904
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:52,145
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have plans to repave or rebuild that road in the future.

905
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:56,966
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have any plans to really do anything with that road in the future, but all the public ways we do.

906
01:07:57,546 --> 01:08:06,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So any improvements to that road, betterments they call it, would be on the owner's responsibility as opposed to the city's or the public's responsibility.

907
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:07,709
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the major benefit.

908
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:18,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Also right now, you're telling this board who has control of the public ways and regulations that you want them to do something, but right now they can't because it's private.

909
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:22,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's pros and cons of private and public.

910
01:08:24,594 --> 01:08:27,295
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the pros of the private is what Tim explained earlier.

911
01:08:27,315 --> 01:08:36,698
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the ability, there's many other streets asking for speed tables as well, but you have the ability with your neighbors to do it yourself if you wanted to, where the public street, they cannot.

912
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:49,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I heard that we did put in a speed bump as homeowners with what you said we own to the middle of the street, that we would be liable for any damage done to a car by that table.

913
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:55,715
[SPEAKER_10]: You already, unfortunately, you already are liable for damage that happens to vehicles because of your road.

914
01:08:57,195 --> 01:08:57,876
[SPEAKER_10]: You already are liable.

915
01:08:58,996 --> 01:09:04,378
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, the center of the road is just a helpful use for where your title is.

916
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:10,780
[SPEAKER_10]: But really, you've got to treat it as one whole thing, because any individual owner of the road can't really do much of anything.

917
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:15,462
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you and your neighbors get together, form a homeowner's association, which is one of the steps I would tell you about,

918
01:09:16,522 --> 01:09:20,606
[SPEAKER_10]: then you can actually take some actual substantial action.

919
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:22,828
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I can help you out with this online.

920
01:09:22,848 --> 01:09:25,430
[SPEAKER_10]: You can just contact me and I can tell you the process, okay?

921
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:26,931
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thank you so much, Tim.

922
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:28,012
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been very helpful.

923
01:09:28,312 --> 01:09:29,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, one last thing.

924
01:09:29,754 --> 01:09:31,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with everything that Tim said earlier.

925
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:33,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Take what he said to heart.

926
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:42,324
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one thing I could see that this board, possibly this commission could potentially have purview over that could help not eliminate things, but could help a little bit.

927
01:09:43,105 --> 01:09:52,211
[SPEAKER_11]: is the restriction from the public road on Fulton to Ridgeway, you could potentially consider a no-left turn 4 to 6 p.m.

928
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:52,591
[SPEAKER_11]: or 4 to 7 p.m.

929
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:55,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there's already a no-right turn.

930
01:09:55,793 --> 01:10:05,799
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a no-right turn coming down the hill during the morning hours, but now she's explained to us that in the evenings, people are shortcutting from Fulton to Ridgeway to get around the traffic on 28th.

931
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:14,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the only thing I think of that's in this commission's purview, because it's on the public intersection side of things that the Medford owns.

932
01:10:15,325 --> 01:10:18,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be like the reciprocal of what's there now coming down the hill.

933
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,229
[SPEAKER_11]: No right turn, 6 to 9.

934
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:24,391
[SPEAKER_11]: You could potentially do no left turn, 4 to 7 in the evening coming up.

935
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:31,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So didn't we speak of these that there's no way for us to really enforce them, say somebody does take a left turn?

936
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:35,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we could do it as long as it applies to everyone.

937
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:41,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So the old, you know, Pat and all of her neighbors couldn't take the left turn either.

938
01:10:41,752 --> 01:10:49,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So they'd have to come home downhill and, you know, and if they were coming in the morning, they'd come uphill like they do now.

939
01:10:49,475 --> 01:10:50,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would apply to everyone.

940
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:54,157
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, yeah, the issue with enforcement was residents only.

941
01:10:54,495 --> 01:11:01,500
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, I appreciate that and I understand that and I even thought of that and I doubt my neighbors, you know, I have some that would not go along with that.

942
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,822
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not looking for people not to be able to use the street.

943
01:11:05,422 --> 01:11:14,508
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really the speed they're coming through and the lack of consideration for people's safety when they come down.

944
01:11:14,988 --> 01:11:23,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they're doing the same thing coming up from the Fells where they get out of that traffic and they fly up over the hill and the road narrows right in that hill area.

945
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:27,055
[SPEAKER_16]: And if somebody is going to be killed, you mark my words.

946
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:38,685
[SPEAKER_11]: If you or your neighbors did consider doing your own speed device, I would strongly suggest having an engineering company design it in a proper build or build it to limit anything.

947
01:11:40,026 --> 01:11:40,787
[SPEAKER_11]: You do whatever you want.

948
01:11:40,807 --> 01:11:45,731
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not advising you to do one thing or another, but if you did take that approach, you should do it.

949
01:11:46,638 --> 01:11:50,822
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, to limit your life, but you could do it in a professional way to make sure it's done right.

950
01:11:51,382 --> 01:11:52,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, right.

951
01:11:52,143 --> 01:11:53,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that would be the only way.

952
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:56,227
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, again, I have young couples that live on the street.

953
01:11:57,267 --> 01:12:00,050
[SPEAKER_16]: The neighborhood is starting to change over from the original owners.

954
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,494
[SPEAKER_16]: And let's face it, with the economy, nobody wants an extra bill.

955
01:12:05,795 --> 01:12:10,699
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know whether that would be even an idea for them to go along with.

956
01:12:12,301 --> 01:12:14,403
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's just the speed is ridiculous.

957
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:19,807
[SPEAKER_16]: And if Sergeant Rogers is there, I'd be more than happy to speak with him about what we can do.

958
01:12:19,827 --> 01:12:21,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, we are both here.

959
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:26,052
[SPEAKER_04]: We will contact you offline immediately after this meeting.

960
01:12:26,973 --> 01:12:28,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Todd, what about making it a one-way?

961
01:12:29,515 --> 01:12:30,516
[SPEAKER_16]: We've talked about that.

962
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about that was... From the Thursway to Fulton Street.

963
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that... Could that be done legally?

964
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:37,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

965
01:12:37,922 --> 01:12:39,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why it wouldn't be.

966
01:12:39,123 --> 01:12:39,683
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean...

967
01:12:43,934 --> 01:12:51,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually when you do one-ways, you want to, so the neighborhood and including the people who live there themselves have ways to get around.

968
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:54,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually you want to pair it with another street that's a one-way the opposite.

969
01:12:55,198 --> 01:13:00,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So it doesn't become like, you know, very closed in neighborhoods.

970
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,561
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you did consider that, I would advise potentially, St.

971
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:05,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis is already West.

972
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Ridgeway is East, you know, Foam Spring has similar issues.

973
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they'd be interested, but.

974
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:14,308
[SPEAKER_11]: something to consider.

975
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:20,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

976
01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:21,193
[SPEAKER_16]: St.

977
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:22,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Francis Street is a one-way.

978
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:24,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's where he's standing.

979
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:31,021
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually, I was told it had to remain open to the Fellsway for the emergency vehicles.

980
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:37,364
[SPEAKER_16]: We've already had a fire truck hit a house on the corner of Fulton and Bridgeway when they came down the hill.

981
01:13:37,765 --> 01:13:37,985
[SPEAKER_16]: St.

982
01:13:38,025 --> 01:13:43,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Francis is a much safer way for them to get onto the Fellsway with what they need at the bottom of the hill.

983
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:45,989
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll work with Larry.

984
01:13:46,629 --> 01:13:47,789
[SPEAKER_16]: It is crazy up there.

985
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:48,490
[SPEAKER_16]: It really is.

986
01:13:49,537 --> 01:14:05,693
[SPEAKER_11]: you might have to consult with legal and I don't know Tim's opinion on this because would one way still qualify as allowing passage right I think so but right right we'd have to we'd have to talk about it and understand you know

987
01:14:06,897 --> 01:14:07,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I live up there.

988
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:09,038
[SPEAKER_10]: I use this road a lot, too.

989
01:14:09,058 --> 01:14:09,038
100%.

990
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:12,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you, Pat.

991
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:13,759
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a raceway.

992
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:14,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It's dangerous.

993
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:16,279
[SPEAKER_10]: People blow through that stop sign.

994
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:22,661
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't want to know what, I'm sorry, but the people from the Heights, and you have to be one of them, grew up there.

995
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:28,322
[SPEAKER_16]: When we first put this stop sign, they came down with a bandsaw and cut it down in the middle of the night.

996
01:14:30,358 --> 01:14:32,562
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this is what we're dealing with, you know?

997
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:35,989
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, we're not trying to be a private, private way.

998
01:14:36,029 --> 01:14:37,411
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just trying to have a safe road.

999
01:14:37,998 --> 01:14:40,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, we're going to support as best we can.

1000
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think you got some commitment from the officers.

1001
01:14:42,822 --> 01:14:47,806
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it sounds like we'll take a look at maybe some private way options.

1002
01:14:48,186 --> 01:14:53,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sorry, some one way options that I can help, you know, walk you through the process.

1003
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:55,773
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're interested in your unit is interested in making a public way.

1004
01:14:55,853 --> 01:14:56,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what we can offer you.

1005
01:14:57,234 --> 01:14:58,114
[SPEAKER_16]: That's wonderful.

1006
01:14:58,135 --> 01:14:59,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Larry has my email.

1007
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:02,178
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to email me and I get yours to talk with you.

1008
01:15:02,838 --> 01:15:03,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1009
01:15:03,459 --> 01:15:04,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, everybody.

1010
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1011
01:15:07,505 --> 01:15:14,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we'll go back to 2024-52, no parking, 7 a.m.

1012
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:15,654
[SPEAKER_04]: to 9 a.m.

1013
01:15:15,734 --> 01:15:17,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd, sorry, I cut you off there.

1014
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,100
[SPEAKER_04]: All you.

1015
01:15:23,343 --> 01:15:23,904
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

1016
01:15:24,204 --> 01:15:25,566
[SPEAKER_11]: It made sense what you did.

1017
01:15:25,586 --> 01:15:28,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying to share this.

1018
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:35,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this agenda item is the one on the left here.

1019
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:45,939
[SPEAKER_11]: So I could go to an aerial as well, but this shows the new lane structure that would be created at the signal come down Forest Street.

1020
01:15:46,919 --> 01:15:47,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now it's a single lane.

1021
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:54,485
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be a short two lanes during rush hour only in front of the vacant lot, which is this square parcel here.

1022
01:15:54,745 --> 01:16:01,510
[SPEAKER_11]: It would not impact the post office parking or parking during theater events after rush hour.

1023
01:16:02,882 --> 01:16:05,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I could show you Ariel as well.

1024
01:16:05,484 --> 01:16:13,028
[SPEAKER_11]: This is related to, it's a precursor to a state project that we got a congestion management grant for.

1025
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's an air pollution congestion management grant.

1026
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:20,493
[SPEAKER_11]: So the state's gonna do some other improvements at the signal to help things out.

1027
01:16:20,853 --> 01:16:23,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is one of the things that came out of it.

1028
01:16:25,076 --> 01:16:28,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, will this make that a right turn only lane?

1029
01:16:29,904 --> 01:16:33,185
[SPEAKER_00]: or two lanes straight through the light?

1030
01:16:33,205 --> 01:16:35,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure what happened.

1031
01:16:36,186 --> 01:16:38,526
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be a left through and a right through.

1032
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:43,828
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're in the left lane, you can take a left towards Clippership, what we've talked about earlier.

1033
01:16:44,048 --> 01:16:45,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're in the right lane, you can take a right towards High.

1034
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:51,810
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are two receiving lanes on Main Street in front of Deep Cuts, because there's double left turn from Salem already.

1035
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:54,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1036
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:54,851
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

1037
01:16:56,662 --> 01:16:59,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I could show the aerial might be easier too.

1038
01:17:01,945 --> 01:17:02,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1039
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:03,606
[SPEAKER_12]: I can do that myself.

1040
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:04,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, I just get it.

1041
01:17:04,847 --> 01:17:09,649
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the stop line, which is well back from the light?

1042
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:14,512
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is it has to be there for the fire trucks.

1043
01:17:14,972 --> 01:17:16,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I've watched it.

1044
01:17:16,493 --> 01:17:23,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the fire trucks come northbound and the median's in their way to go straight across, so they go opposite direction for that short bit.

1045
01:17:27,823 --> 01:17:31,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just talking about these four spaces here.

1046
01:17:31,685 --> 01:17:36,928
[SPEAKER_11]: You see this in the city of Boston a lot, where there'll be parking, and then during rush hour, it's restricted.

1047
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:39,850
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're ever in Boston, the red meter heads are like that.

1048
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:43,312
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a red meter head, don't park there during rush hours.

1049
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:51,396
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would allow two lanes to queue here and process it a little quicker, because delay contributes to air pollution.

1050
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,618
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the congestion management piece that the state's working on.

1051
01:17:56,303 --> 01:17:59,367
[SPEAKER_11]: So back here would still remain this one lane with parking.

1052
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:06,018
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this parking would be available during lunch and night, just not rush hour.

1053
01:18:13,349 --> 01:18:21,294
[SPEAKER_11]: So this sign would be revised to say 9 to 4, 2-hour parking, and then no parking other times.

1054
01:18:21,314 --> 01:18:23,576
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 to 9 and 4 to 6.

1055
01:18:23,736 --> 01:18:26,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's unrestricted after 7 p.m.

1056
01:18:26,358 --> 01:18:26,638
[SPEAKER_11]: right now.

1057
01:18:27,963 --> 01:18:29,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a selfish question, Todd.

1058
01:18:31,326 --> 01:18:37,011
[SPEAKER_00]: On my bike, my bike is wider than lots of bikes, can never get through.

1059
01:18:37,192 --> 01:18:42,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I literally have to go on the sidewalk because there's not enough space between the vehicles and the cars.

1060
01:18:42,697 --> 01:18:46,120
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still gonna be, bikes would have to get sharrows, right?

1061
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:53,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And just get in the lane with the vehicle because there would never be enough space to even go next to them.

1062
01:18:54,167 --> 01:19:00,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right now, the current situation is a sharer situation, and then this future would be a sharer situation as well.

1063
01:19:00,188 --> 01:19:01,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1064
01:19:02,588 --> 01:19:04,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be an easier situation.

1065
01:19:04,529 --> 01:19:10,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this end of forest definitely narrows up compared to the north end of forest.

1066
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:17,091
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why the north side parking drops out this far down towards Dunkin' Donuts.

1067
01:19:17,171 --> 01:19:22,232
[SPEAKER_11]: But as you get up towards Webster, it becomes wide enough to have parking on the east side, I should say.

1068
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:37,767
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing for me that my question or I guess my concern would be is, you know, obviously, there's the white arrows to not pull up to the light.

1069
01:19:39,369 --> 01:19:41,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, so emergency vehicles can come from.

1070
01:19:42,773 --> 01:19:46,036
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, onto Forest Street from, say, Maine or Salem.

1071
01:19:46,056 --> 01:19:57,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, obviously if that line is still there, you know, sometimes when you come up there, when you're trying to get up to, you know, Forest Street for an emergency, that would be my only concern.

1072
01:19:58,108 --> 01:20:02,672
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a white line painted there so they don't pull up ahead so that we can't get by them as well.

1073
01:20:02,993 --> 01:20:04,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a bus can't make the turn.

1074
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:07,437
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had the buses, school buses and things like that.

1075
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:12,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the big X would remain, be repainted, and the stop here in red would stay.

1076
01:20:12,526 --> 01:20:15,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be my only concern.

1077
01:20:15,527 --> 01:20:22,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this may alleviate some of the traffic issues, but other than that, I'd pass it on to commissioners.

1078
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:30,671
[SPEAKER_00]: I would move approval.

1079
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:32,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I second that.

1080
01:20:34,821 --> 01:20:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have one question.

1081
01:20:36,622 --> 01:20:44,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we talk to the businesses that have bought these parking spots around Woods Avenue?

1082
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:55,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the hours in which they're open, I don't know if Tom Young-Koon and the cleaners are

1083
01:20:56,492 --> 01:20:57,932
[SPEAKER_04]: open before 9 a.m.

1084
01:20:57,952 --> 01:21:00,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm positive, Tommy, I'm curious.

1085
01:21:00,633 --> 01:21:01,833
[SPEAKER_07]: The dry cleaner is open.

1086
01:21:02,493 --> 01:21:04,114
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I take my clothes.

1087
01:21:05,574 --> 01:21:11,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this puts more people parking in the Chevalier side lot just to get to her.

1088
01:21:11,615 --> 01:21:16,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Just curious.

1089
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:21,098
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1090
01:21:21,838 --> 01:21:22,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Alicia, I believe.

1091
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:25,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Tim seconded it.

1092
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:27,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call.

1093
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:29,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1094
01:21:30,442 --> 01:21:30,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1095
01:21:31,423 --> 01:21:32,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Hunt?

1096
01:21:32,604 --> 01:21:32,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1097
01:21:33,564 --> 01:21:34,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Brzezinski?

1098
01:21:35,386 --> 01:21:35,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1099
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:37,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Sergeant Canava?

1100
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:37,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1101
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:38,248
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-0, houses for 2024-52.

1102
01:21:38,288 --> 01:21:42,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to 2024-53, Forest Street, Southbound at Lawrence Road, lane structure B,

1103
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: formally changed to two lanes, right turn only and straight lane.

1104
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:08,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so this image on the right is coming down from Roosevelt Circle.

1105
01:22:09,615 --> 01:22:15,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, we kind of all know if you use this practically that people use it like this anyways, even though it's not striped this way.

1106
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:26,124
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would formally make it through in a right turn only, just in the short block between Lawrence and Homer Circle.

1107
01:22:26,144 --> 01:22:27,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1108
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:40,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so as I said, right now the yellow is drawn kind of in the middle of the road, which gives us a narrow two lanes there and a wide one lane going north.

1109
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:44,573
[SPEAKER_11]: This would formalize it, and it would be standard-sized lanes.

1110
01:22:47,034 --> 01:23:01,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so this would enable, you know, again, for the congestion management credits ahead of that, the signal system could be adjusted to potentially have a right arrow that that right lane could go at the same time as the Lawrence Road maneuver.

1111
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:07,283
[SPEAKER_11]: so then it would be more efficient, getting less delay and congestion coming out of tailpipes.

1112
01:23:09,183 --> 01:23:15,185
[SPEAKER_11]: But if anyone, the pedestrians would still operate the way they do now, if they press the button, everyone stops.

1113
01:23:15,265 --> 01:23:16,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's not an issue.

1114
01:23:17,405 --> 01:23:20,486
[SPEAKER_11]: It should still be no turn on red, which this board approved a while ago.

1115
01:23:21,186 --> 01:23:24,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just formalizing what they use it practically as today.

1116
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:30,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Northbound is not going to be as wide, correct?

1117
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:32,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1118
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:36,063
[SPEAKER_05]: The right lane is tight as it is now.

1119
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:44,673
[SPEAKER_11]: So share the aerial.

1120
01:23:48,712 --> 01:23:56,599
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is see how the northbound lane to the circle is the same width as the southbound where people operate two lanes.

1121
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:02,505
[SPEAKER_11]: So that kind of shows this with the no parking here is wider than it needs to be going north.

1122
01:24:04,046 --> 01:24:07,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's room to kick the yellow over a little bit and have formally two lanes.

1123
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,933
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see these cars back here making the two lanes already.

1124
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:20,545
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because there's no parking on this little stretch here between the crosswalk and Homer, it's actually plenty wide.

1125
01:24:28,368 --> 01:24:30,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that leads to the next item on the agenda.

1126
01:24:30,609 --> 01:24:39,533
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of paired together, but it's two separate requests, the no parking east side and for south of that intersection.

1127
01:24:45,797 --> 01:24:52,039
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just share that.

1128
01:24:52,319 --> 01:25:09,005
[SPEAKER_11]: The left side of this image here, so south of Lawrence Road on the east side of Forrest, there'd be 99 feet approximately of no parking because the yellow will shift over so that it aligns properly with that new maneuver or that new yellow coming down.

1129
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:15,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will go to the aerial there again.

1130
01:25:18,309 --> 01:25:23,991
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, so I am totally on board with the you do not own the parking spots in front of your house.

1131
01:25:24,591 --> 01:25:28,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody had any conversation with the property owners there?

1132
01:25:28,513 --> 01:25:34,355
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're aware that there's stuff that's being discussed in front of their homes on public meeting.

1133
01:25:36,428 --> 01:25:41,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not, but these are all, you know, single family homes with huge driveways.

1134
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Parking is a lot on both sides.

1135
01:25:46,611 --> 01:25:59,794
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, yeah, it's, Lily and I and Amy before were trying to get a handle on parking utilization in the street, because really it's much like some of the other streets where you could probably get away with only parking on one side.

1136
01:25:59,914 --> 01:26:02,615
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so sporadic on both sides that,

1137
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,102
[SPEAKER_11]: So it shouldn't be too much of an impact.

1138
01:26:06,182 --> 01:26:16,389
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they did need to park on the other side, this one stretch from this one driveway to the crosswalk, then you could press the button at the crosswalk and park immediately on the other side.

1139
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,192
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a way to safely do it at the crosswalk.

1140
01:26:28,357 --> 01:26:33,719
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be clear, when we're looking at the street right now in this orientation, it's the right side of the street.

1141
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:37,261
[SPEAKER_11]: It's where my cursor just measured this.

1142
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:45,285
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is right here from this driveway to there.

1143
01:26:45,765 --> 01:26:48,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So this yellow will be over a little bit.

1144
01:26:48,186 --> 01:26:51,868
[SPEAKER_11]: So this yellow will be over a little bit and taper over there from back here.

1145
01:26:52,893 --> 01:26:57,496
[SPEAKER_11]: So just getting people to be aligned kind of along this path here.

1146
01:26:58,517 --> 01:27:02,400
[SPEAKER_11]: So the street's kind of wide enough for three lanes across.

1147
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:03,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1148
01:27:03,941 --> 01:27:05,983
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, it's right here that you're seeing.

1149
01:27:06,003 --> 01:27:10,306
[SPEAKER_11]: So there'd still be this whole block back to Webster available in opposite.

1150
01:27:13,368 --> 01:27:14,529
[SPEAKER_11]: So it'd still be, yeah.

1151
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:22,594
[SPEAKER_11]: almost 300 feet available there, and directly opposite, another 350 feet available.

1152
01:27:25,318 --> 01:27:34,626
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's not atypical to have this in the end sections, like this section from Homer to the signal is already restricted, right?

1153
01:27:34,846 --> 01:27:38,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this section from this Lawrence, the signal is already restricted.

1154
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:44,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this section on this side of Lawrence is already restricted for the lane structure.

1155
01:27:44,955 --> 01:27:49,259
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's not that uncommon being that close to an end section to have that occur.

1156
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:59,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so you could see this multi-car driveway here, this one here, this one here, this long one here.

1157
01:27:59,464 --> 01:28:13,107
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these changes make sense, especially if we're

1158
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:22,734
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded like you were saying there was additional changes coming that these were going to be paired up with to make it more comprehensive.

1159
01:28:23,674 --> 01:28:40,458
[SPEAKER_11]: So the right turn only from Roosevelt Circle, this no parking that we just discussed is related because the yellow to get the traffic going northbound over closer to the curb as they go through Lawrence Road.

1160
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:44,967
[SPEAKER_11]: So those two are directly linked.

1161
01:28:51,520 --> 01:29:01,364
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this signal in Medford Square will have other upgrades to it associated with the MassDOT congestion management grant.

1162
01:29:01,524 --> 01:29:05,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's air pollution congestion alleviation grant.

1163
01:29:05,586 --> 01:29:13,890
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's supposed to make things more efficient, which means less delay, less tailpipe pollution from the cars for unnecessary delay.

1164
01:29:21,067 --> 01:29:21,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.

1165
01:29:24,465 --> 01:29:33,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Timing-wise, N-Grid owes us the repaving of that entire street from Medford Square to Lawrence Road because they ripped it up, and it's a guaranteed street.

1166
01:29:34,368 --> 01:29:36,548
[SPEAKER_11]: So after they pave it, they gotta repaint it.

1167
01:29:37,268 --> 01:29:43,110
[SPEAKER_11]: So whatever's approved or not approved tonight, then that informs the pavement marking plan that they have to restore.

1168
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:46,711
[SPEAKER_11]: So tonight, we're hoping they can do that this season before the winter.

1169
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:51,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, we gotta wait another whole season to either pave and paint.

1170
01:29:52,217 --> 01:29:54,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you think that they're going to repave it this fall?

1171
01:29:55,618 --> 01:29:57,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's the hope.

1172
01:29:57,499 --> 01:29:59,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't say I said that they will.

1173
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:00,079
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the hope.

1174
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1175
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:02,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1176
01:30:04,701 --> 01:30:07,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Owen's already informed them of it, so we'll, yeah.

1177
01:30:11,063 --> 01:30:13,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they haven't even done that section yet, have they?

1178
01:30:15,724 --> 01:30:17,365
[SPEAKER_11]: So they did work.

1179
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:18,025
[SPEAKER_11]: They did work.

1180
01:30:18,065 --> 01:30:21,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember last year when all the parents complained they couldn't get to school there in Russia?

1181
01:30:22,961 --> 01:30:25,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I don't think they did north of Lawrence Road.

1182
01:30:25,663 --> 01:30:30,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they ripped up from Dunkin' Donuts up to Lawrence Road itself, and then they temporary patched it.

1183
01:30:30,786 --> 01:30:32,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they got to do permanent road.

1184
01:30:33,448 --> 01:30:40,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm not sure if they went beyond the north of Lawrence either, but whatever Ingrid doesn't do, the Mass Stop project would capture.

1185
01:30:44,076 --> 01:30:45,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Larry, are you asking if they're done?

1186
01:30:45,217 --> 01:30:47,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

1187
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:48,279
[SPEAKER_10]: They're done.

1188
01:30:49,613 --> 01:30:50,053
[SPEAKER_10]: They're done?

1189
01:30:50,493 --> 01:30:51,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Farm or street?

1190
01:30:51,614 --> 01:30:52,214
[SPEAKER_10]: They should be done.

1191
01:30:52,334 --> 01:30:52,874
[SPEAKER_10]: By now, yeah.

1192
01:30:52,974 --> 01:30:56,256
[SPEAKER_10]: They only had two weeks left, four or five months ago or something like that.

1193
01:30:56,276 --> 01:30:58,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1194
01:30:58,697 --> 01:30:59,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1195
01:30:59,717 --> 01:31:02,018
[SPEAKER_10]: They made the mistake on that road.

1196
01:31:02,118 --> 01:31:03,619
[SPEAKER_10]: They told us we could pave it.

1197
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:07,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a year later, they're like, oh no, we need to replace the gas main.

1198
01:31:08,341 --> 01:31:12,603
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're taking their word for it, but they should be done.

1199
01:31:12,623 --> 01:31:18,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they could make another mistake, but unlikely at this point.

1200
01:31:25,152 --> 01:31:25,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion.

1201
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, um.

1202
01:31:30,057 --> 01:31:31,859
[SPEAKER_00]: A motion to approve both of them.

1203
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, motion to approve 2024 dash.

1204
01:31:33,901 --> 01:31:35,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually discussed 3 of the things are doing.

1205
01:31:35,543 --> 01:31:36,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you or did they already approve the earlier 1?

1206
01:31:36,925 --> 01:31:37,746
[SPEAKER_11]: We did the 1st, 1 already.

1207
01:31:46,971 --> 01:31:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sorry, I apologize.

1208
01:31:48,792 --> 01:31:51,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're just approving both of them, 2023-4 and 53 and 54.

1209
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:58,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Commissioner Hunt and then seconded by, sorry, I missed the first one.

1210
01:31:59,495 --> 01:31:59,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1211
01:32:00,635 --> 01:32:01,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, Commissioner McGibbon.

1212
01:32:01,575 --> 01:32:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call for both 2023 and 54, ALBA.

1213
01:32:05,836 --> 01:32:06,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1214
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:07,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1215
01:32:08,437 --> 01:32:09,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Hunt?

1216
01:32:09,877 --> 01:32:10,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1217
01:32:10,578 --> 01:32:11,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner Morizinski?

1218
01:32:12,178 --> 01:32:12,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1219
01:32:13,178 --> 01:32:13,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Sergeant Canava?

1220
01:32:14,019 --> 01:32:14,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1221
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,202
[SPEAKER_04]: 2024 and 53 both pass.

1222
01:32:19,823 --> 01:32:27,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to discussion on Washington Street parking lot, 2024-55, Commissioner Morgan.

1223
01:32:27,989 --> 01:32:28,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1224
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:37,157
[SPEAKER_10]: So we own a parking lot that was deeded to us as part of the Swan School Project a while ago, a long time ago.

1225
01:32:38,057 --> 01:32:42,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And this parking lot is on Washington Street near the corner of Park.

1226
01:32:43,021 --> 01:32:44,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And this parking lot

1227
01:32:45,698 --> 01:32:49,039
[SPEAKER_10]: is managed, well, no, it's not managed.

1228
01:32:49,059 --> 01:32:50,160
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not managed really at all.

1229
01:32:50,800 --> 01:33:03,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was, when it was deeded to us, it was deeded with the intent for it to be used by the neighborhood, something along those lines.

1230
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:05,306
[SPEAKER_10]: We recently took down the fence because it fell in.

1231
01:33:05,326 --> 01:33:07,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not our fence, it was put up as part of the project.

1232
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:10,561
[SPEAKER_10]: but we took it down because it was falling into the parking lot.

1233
01:33:11,221 --> 01:33:12,902
[SPEAKER_10]: We put up some Jersey barriers since.

1234
01:33:13,802 --> 01:33:15,663
[SPEAKER_10]: The lot's kind of a mess.

1235
01:33:18,184 --> 01:33:25,627
[SPEAKER_10]: It really hasn't been treated like a public parking lot, but I think we need to, should treat it like a public parking lot.

1236
01:33:28,089 --> 01:33:29,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Cars just sit there.

1237
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:31,931
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been people working on cars in the lot.

1238
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:35,432
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been people probably sleeping in their cars in the lot.

1239
01:33:37,033 --> 01:33:38,414
[SPEAKER_10]: People store their cars in the lot.

1240
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:44,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I've learned a lot of this over the last year or so, just dealing with the fence and the condominium.

1241
01:33:45,535 --> 01:33:50,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did read the deed and looked at the information associated with the Swan School.

1242
01:33:51,577 --> 01:33:53,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is under our title.

1243
01:33:53,317 --> 01:33:54,738
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our parking lot for sure.

1244
01:33:55,798 --> 01:34:01,460
[SPEAKER_10]: The only question is, is that, you know, dedicated or whatever, committed to neighborhood use.

1245
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure that's working out very well.

1246
01:34:04,741 --> 01:34:05,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would make the argument that

1247
01:34:07,793 --> 01:34:14,460
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, making it a paid public lot would still be in the interest of the of the neighborhood and the community.

1248
01:34:16,161 --> 01:34:17,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I wanted to open up the discussion now.

1249
01:34:17,483 --> 01:34:27,513
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't we don't need to come into conclusions tonight or voted on anything tonight, but I wanted to bring it to the table and see if there were any other opinions on the commission.

1250
01:34:28,518 --> 01:34:40,235
[SPEAKER_10]: that I can take into consideration here for development of some sort of more of a real agenda item to make it a paid lot, put signs up, kiosk, whatever.

1251
01:34:41,701 --> 01:34:55,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim, to kind of back you up, that language that you described, the generic kind of flexible language of neighborhood use, seems to be the same language in the Yale Street lot agreement and possibly others.

1252
01:34:55,264 --> 01:35:01,826
[SPEAKER_11]: And just as an example to others, the Yale Street lot is structured in a different way than Washington Street.

1253
01:35:01,866 --> 01:35:06,367
[SPEAKER_11]: So it shows what could be if that same language was used and what interpretation the city may have.

1254
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:17,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I want the city to be making revenue on the lot, really, so then I can feel good about spending public tax dollars to, you know, if we wanna put up a fence, if we wanna, you know, make some improvements to it, et cetera.

1255
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:29,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a so this is not the first time I've heard about this and I don't know why this is the first time I've thought of this, but we should do some level of public outreach.

1256
01:35:30,445 --> 01:35:32,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure what that is.

1257
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:39,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be that we should put up some signage in there saying the city is considering.

1258
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:46,011
[SPEAKER_00]: making this a paid lot or other public uses or whatever and some sort of like place where they could provide feedback.

1259
01:35:46,892 --> 01:35:57,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that says come to a meeting or fill out this form and send in your thoughts or something, because clearly people are using it.

1260
01:35:58,614 --> 01:36:06,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not thinking that some of those uses might be perfectly fine and some may really not be or really appropriate in a public lot.

1261
01:36:06,736 --> 01:36:09,357
[SPEAKER_00]: But there should be some opportunity for that.

1262
01:36:10,977 --> 01:36:18,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be that the right answer is that it should be a little park let you know that it should not be parking.

1263
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:23,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'm not saying it should be just because my office keeps making parks.

1264
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:30,361
[SPEAKER_00]: but that we should think about a little bit of a public process to go with it.

1265
01:36:31,441 --> 01:36:46,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't just say that, I mean, I was thinking through what level my staff could do, like put together a form, design some signs that go there to do some public outreach to sort of gather information about what is the right thing.

1266
01:36:47,189 --> 01:36:52,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of what that would do is say, this is public space and we're paying attention.

1267
01:36:54,122 --> 01:36:58,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might help some of the more inappropriate uses of the space.

1268
01:36:59,505 --> 01:37:01,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim, I could increase the enforcement.

1269
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:02,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I know that it exists.

1270
01:37:03,807 --> 01:37:07,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Increase the enforcement down there, or do we want to hold off?

1271
01:37:08,349 --> 01:37:12,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Alicia said, advertise first, like we did Hormel.

1272
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:19,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to just say, Hormel was a huge, I know it's totally different aspects, but Hormel Stadium,

1273
01:37:20,711 --> 01:37:30,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, went to, unbeknownst to us, we went to the leasing offices at Lumiere and the Mystic Towers and we had no idea that the Mystic Towers was telling people to park over there.

1274
01:37:30,275 --> 01:37:37,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, we were able to inform them that this lot is not owned by the Mystic Towers and there is no.

1275
01:37:38,838 --> 01:37:41,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that says that they can park over there and luckily we took.

1276
01:37:42,624 --> 01:37:48,090
[SPEAKER_04]: All necessary steps before we started towing vehicles and that lot has never been better.

1277
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:51,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that this is similar situation where we have.

1278
01:37:51,954 --> 01:37:59,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, jet skis and barbecue setups and trailers and whatnot there, but it seems like you have similar issues, but.

1279
01:38:00,524 --> 01:38:03,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Not not barbecue trailers and jet skis.

1280
01:38:04,092 --> 01:38:11,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Other options besides the meter could be resident permit, which then they pay a small fee for permit, and you'd be able to regulate in some way.

1281
01:38:12,134 --> 01:38:18,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Other ones could be business permit, which, you know, it seems pretty far away, but I just measured at 1,600 feet from Washington Street Park.

1282
01:38:19,335 --> 01:38:23,296
[SPEAKER_11]: There's several businesses that the employees might be able to use that for business permit.

1283
01:38:24,056 --> 01:38:25,756
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a six minute walk.

1284
01:38:26,636 --> 01:38:30,677
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are some other options that could be beneficial for various reasons.

1285
01:38:33,613 --> 01:38:36,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you, what do you think?

1286
01:38:36,815 --> 01:38:40,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, I'm happy to go back.

1287
01:38:41,318 --> 01:38:41,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.

1288
01:38:42,218 --> 01:38:43,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't get knocked off there.

1289
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:51,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to go back to my staff and ask them about doing, uh, some outreach around this.

1290
01:38:51,444 --> 01:38:53,405
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels right up Amanda's alley.

1291
01:38:54,085 --> 01:38:56,427
[SPEAKER_00]: She just had a ribbon cutting on one of her major projects.

1292
01:38:57,007 --> 01:38:57,087
Um,

1293
01:39:00,442 --> 01:39:14,528
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of do some outreach and maybe we do like a little web form that has, you know, scan a QR code that has some options has an email address could put in a phone number for our office to say, you could provide feedback and input.

1294
01:39:15,128 --> 01:39:18,090
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can put some of these choices business parking.

1295
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:28,695
[SPEAKER_00]: resident parking, paid parking, park let, see what comes up and say something like, if you are currently, you know, ask, are you currently using this?

1296
01:39:28,735 --> 01:39:29,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of it.

1297
01:39:30,136 --> 01:39:39,700
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I rely on this, this space to like, get drop downs like that to kind of open them.

1298
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

1299
01:39:40,921 --> 01:39:42,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Tim, I jumped off on you.

1300
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:43,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's OK.

1301
01:39:43,441 --> 01:39:44,742
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just talking over each other.

1302
01:39:44,762 --> 01:39:45,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine.

1303
01:39:45,342 --> 01:39:46,383
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the things about Zoom.

1304
01:39:46,443 --> 01:39:46,903
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wonderful.

1305
01:39:48,464 --> 01:39:50,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that makes a lot of sense, Alicia.

1306
01:39:50,264 --> 01:40:05,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think since this is the body that is charged with the care and control of off-street public parking lots, maybe we can use some of our time at our meeting to have this.

1307
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:11,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, we set aside an agenda item that is just for community feedback with some options, like you were saying.

1308
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:19,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And in a couple months, we could schedule it for a traffic commission meeting and take a half hour and let people speak about it.

1309
01:40:20,382 --> 01:40:23,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think it's going to be the people that use it who have cars there.

1310
01:40:23,825 --> 01:40:25,087
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to come.

1311
01:40:25,367 --> 01:40:27,669
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to give their feedback.

1312
01:40:27,729 --> 01:40:31,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, they're getting a free ride on very valuable public property.

1313
01:40:34,678 --> 01:40:37,400
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like Todd had mentioned a resident permit parking issue.

1314
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,881
[SPEAKER_04]: They still cannot work on a vehicle there.

1315
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:39,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That is still illegal.

1316
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:42,623
[SPEAKER_04]: They cannot have a disabled motor vehicle in there.

1317
01:40:42,643 --> 01:40:42,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1318
01:40:44,024 --> 01:40:46,805
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to let them know that as well, you can't be working on vehicles.

1319
01:40:47,606 --> 01:40:54,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we can even I mean, 1 of the options is could just be, I mean, putting up rules rules for the lot or something, you know.

1320
01:40:55,151 --> 01:40:58,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't come here today with solutions just to open up a discussion and see see where this needs to go.

1321
01:40:59,695 --> 01:41:03,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an idea about how many parking spots are there?

1322
01:41:03,437 --> 01:41:06,939
[SPEAKER_00]: That would give me a better sense of the size than if you gave me dimensions.

1323
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably a dozen to 20.

1324
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:10,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't count them.

1325
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:12,203
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a huge lot.

1326
01:41:12,823 --> 01:41:13,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Todd's good at that.

1327
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:18,447
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have the screen available, we could probably take a quick look.

1328
01:41:18,507 --> 01:41:23,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm only counting eight official, but I can't see in the back where the trees are.

1329
01:41:24,477 --> 01:41:26,458
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like a bit of a dog legs.

1330
01:41:26,478 --> 01:41:26,458
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

1331
01:41:28,339 --> 01:41:28,700
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably 12.

1332
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:30,781
[SPEAKER_10]: There's three or four right over there.

1333
01:41:31,862 --> 01:41:41,127
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where I've noticed that cars just, I went there for a few weeks in a row just to sporadically, and it was the same cars parked over there, kind of hidden.

1334
01:41:42,408 --> 01:41:43,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, kind of back there.

1335
01:41:43,649 --> 01:41:50,053
[SPEAKER_00]: We could even flyer those vehicles specifically saying the city's looking at this area, you know.

1336
01:41:50,673 --> 01:42:01,880
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a sign up in the lot, though, that says, you know, on this day discussion on the lot looking for community feedback or something like that for the city to.

1337
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:09,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know something like that, but I think it's a great task for for the office to see.

1338
01:42:10,713 --> 01:42:14,216
[SPEAKER_10]: to plan out sort of the use of that public space?

1339
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:17,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to also go along with Hormel.

1340
01:42:18,419 --> 01:42:24,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Hormel Stadium, we're only talking about making a profit on Hormel Stadium when we know we don't have events.

1341
01:42:25,084 --> 01:42:29,688
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a heck of a lot of spaces every single night that we are not using.

1342
01:42:30,509 --> 01:42:35,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of profit that can be made similar to this lot for the city.

1343
01:42:37,145 --> 01:42:42,591
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, formal stadium 90% of the time, if there's no event, there's 10 cars in the lot.

1344
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:47,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could get landscaping companies and schedule them out, but that's, you know, we're chatting about it.

1345
01:42:47,916 --> 01:42:49,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just my piece.

1346
01:42:53,402 --> 01:42:55,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it, you know.

1347
01:42:56,922 --> 01:43:00,224
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so, I mean, we don't really need to vote on anything or.

1348
01:43:00,884 --> 01:43:06,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's I think we're agreeing that if you put a sign up in there, and it comes back to a traffic commission meeting, I think it's.

1349
01:43:06,487 --> 01:43:13,310
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'll talk to you and I maybe we'll talk offline about this tomorrow or the next day or something and we'll come up with a plan.

1350
01:43:14,071 --> 01:43:16,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thanks Tim 2024 slash 57 proposed variance policy.

1351
01:43:16,512 --> 01:43:18,093
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I was pulling this up.

1352
01:43:27,391 --> 01:43:40,062
[SPEAKER_00]: So to just give this little context, there's sort of like two ends of this problem that I was talking with Jim to see about how we could solve.

1353
01:43:40,702 --> 01:43:49,810
[SPEAKER_00]: And one end of the problem is that the parking office was telling people that they had to come back to the traffic commission every year to renew their variance.

1354
01:43:50,290 --> 01:44:08,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to officially formally say a rule that that is not true, that once we pass a variance for parking on that street instead of this street and your visitors permits, that you can keep renewing it with the parking office without coming back to the traffic commission every year.

1355
01:44:08,723 --> 01:44:13,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume none of us wanna see these people every year, 50 people.

1356
01:44:14,226 --> 01:44:17,809
[SPEAKER_00]: The other end of it is that we do have a variance list

1357
01:44:18,349 --> 01:44:22,872
[SPEAKER_00]: of people who have been granted variances over time that is insanely long.

1358
01:44:23,593 --> 01:44:35,661
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's insanely long because variances from the 1980s and the 90s, they don't fall off because there is no way to say when does your variance actually end and under what conditions.

1359
01:44:36,241 --> 01:44:41,564
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had drafted some language that I want to say is spitball language is

1360
01:44:42,565 --> 01:44:45,207
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly worded exactly right.

1361
01:44:45,227 --> 01:44:47,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to post it into the chat for everybody.

1362
01:44:49,390 --> 01:45:02,800
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea would be, one, the statement that the variance is specific to the, and we need just some guidelines on it, that it's specific to the address and the person who requests it, and they should have a start date.

1363
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:09,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we must, something that says they don't have to come back and renew it.

1364
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:23,405
[SPEAKER_00]: So the language I had was the variance remains in place as long as the resident resides at the address the variance is at, or until a parking zone is created at that location, making the variance unnecessary.

1365
01:45:24,385 --> 01:45:35,996
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as long as they exercise the variance, as long as they come and get the permit, and I thought we ought to give people like, oh, you could skip a year, but then you can come back the next year and get it.

1366
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:45,445
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would have to, if you don't purchase it for one year or don't purchase it for two years, then it literally falls off our books and we delete it.

1367
01:45:46,464 --> 01:45:53,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would have to come back and reapply if you hadn't actually bought that resident permit for a couple of years in a row.

1368
01:45:53,610 --> 01:46:02,957
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would allow us to clear the, I don't know, I wanna say it's like 150 on our list that are like more than five years old.

1369
01:46:03,598 --> 01:46:15,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Jim actually was able to run the data on how many of them haven't been used in more than five years because we don't have a rule or a process that says we can remove it from the list.

1370
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:18,171
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what this is about.

1371
01:46:18,492 --> 01:46:36,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's as urgent as it had been, but the piece about saying people don't have to come back every year to renew the variance, that I think is that we have to pass and make it official so that it's clearly written out for the parking department.

1372
01:46:39,248 --> 01:46:40,629
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great, thank you.

1373
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:43,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Can there be just a little tiny asterisk at the end that says,

1374
01:46:44,903 --> 01:46:47,824
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, parking restrictions may change over the years.

1375
01:46:47,844 --> 01:46:49,885
[SPEAKER_11]: So you still have to follow whatever parking rules.

1376
01:46:49,925 --> 01:47:01,888
[SPEAKER_11]: So in case there's a variance given on like some side street and then there was no parking at all, you know, allowed on that side street at a later date, these people don't think that they, you know, they trump whatever their restriction is.

1377
01:47:04,049 --> 01:47:05,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Could have, but this is great.

1378
01:47:05,689 --> 01:47:07,130
[SPEAKER_11]: This is huge solution.

1379
01:47:09,323 --> 01:47:23,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think it's timely with the annual renewal coming up in December, the possibilities of multiple people having to come back to traffic commission will no longer be the case, potentially.

1380
01:47:23,027 --> 01:47:26,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And as Alicia alluded to, variances will

1381
01:47:27,889 --> 01:47:36,091
[SPEAKER_09]: If we go to zone parking, variances will no longer be an issue, per se, as they are now because of street by street.

1382
01:47:36,971 --> 01:47:37,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'll do it, Jim.

1383
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:38,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give the plug.

1384
01:47:38,892 --> 01:47:44,473
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a plug for additional zones to eventually eliminate variance.

1385
01:47:49,154 --> 01:47:56,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know if Alicia and Jim, you guys may have said this, but for the variances that have been there, is there any way to

1386
01:47:57,661 --> 01:48:05,846
[SPEAKER_04]: notify them that they haven't renewed their variance an X amount of time, and if they would like to renew it, that they could come into the parking department to do so.

1387
01:48:06,586 --> 01:48:10,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That way, like Alicia said, if they don't come in, then it's just eliminated.

1388
01:48:10,689 --> 01:48:12,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you said after two years, it would be eliminated.

1389
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:14,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, did I mishear that?

1390
01:48:14,872 --> 01:48:15,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1391
01:48:15,492 --> 01:48:22,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there might be some rationale in notifying people who haven't used it in the last one or two years.

1392
01:48:24,037 --> 01:48:28,661
[SPEAKER_00]: that if they don't come in and purchase it will determine that they no longer need it and won't use it.

1393
01:48:29,262 --> 01:48:33,365
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a variance, it would be a lot more legwork.

1394
01:48:33,525 --> 01:48:42,093
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be possible to compare the list to property owners, but there is no way to know if people still live there, if they're renters or not.

1395
01:48:42,754 --> 01:48:46,237
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit would be nervous about sending the letter to

1396
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:50,879
[SPEAKER_00]: property is where the people don't live anymore.

1397
01:48:51,419 --> 01:48:55,199
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now the new tenants are going, oh, I should do this.

1398
01:48:55,899 --> 01:49:00,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And granted, they might not if it was specifically addressed to the name person, they might not open it.

1399
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:06,701
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some weird ones in there that are just like this whole building gets variances on this street.

1400
01:49:07,261 --> 01:49:08,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really sure.

1401
01:49:08,522 --> 01:49:11,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even my brain couldn't even wrap my head around those.

1402
01:49:11,202 --> 01:49:15,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, let's first deal with the ones that are already too individual.

1403
01:49:15,283 --> 01:49:16,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to open up more.

1404
01:49:16,743 --> 01:49:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, can worms and need to be, but I think obviously the people that.

1405
01:49:20,185 --> 01:49:24,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Now say I live on 100 Main Street and I had a variance.

1406
01:49:24,688 --> 01:49:26,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm still living there.

1407
01:49:26,248 --> 01:49:27,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I think obviously you want.

1408
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:42,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose it would not actually be that hard to do a mail merge where you literally sent a paper letter to the that address that person's name at that address and in the letter you say you've had you had a variance in the past.

1409
01:49:43,658 --> 01:49:45,520
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you haven't purchased it.

1410
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:54,769
[SPEAKER_00]: in many years and it will go away if you choose not to purchase it this year or in January.

1411
01:49:55,830 --> 01:50:04,899
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the assumption that if they don't live there anymore, somebody else isn't going to open the letter and go, oh, I can do this.

1412
01:50:06,081 --> 01:50:09,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then we would have how would they come to the commission randomly?

1413
01:50:09,657 --> 01:50:12,098
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't open up some of the legally open up somebody's mouth.

1414
01:50:12,659 --> 01:50:13,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

1415
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:22,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will in regard to that in at this point, if you are utilizing your variants, you are have already done that.

1416
01:50:23,204 --> 01:50:34,750
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you haven't, when we need to run a report to actually get a dump of who is active and who isn't into a comparison, I like to look at this as sort of the voters list.

1417
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:36,791
[SPEAKER_09]: We do an annual census.

1418
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:37,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We

1419
01:50:38,091 --> 01:50:44,573
[SPEAKER_09]: to register to vote, to continue to vote, you may drop off, but it gives you an opportunity to value.

1420
01:50:44,753 --> 01:50:50,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Once this is passed, it's an opportunity to then dump that report and get a much better perspective.

1421
01:50:54,195 --> 01:50:55,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim, I got a quick question.

1422
01:50:55,336 --> 01:50:57,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It has nothing to do with this.

1423
01:50:58,436 --> 01:51:01,937
[SPEAKER_05]: The signs have been whited out that your time is going to be towed.

1424
01:51:02,858 --> 01:51:04,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know what's going on with that?

1425
01:51:06,224 --> 01:51:19,668
[SPEAKER_09]: White it out, yes, it's because we cannot actually tow, the parking department cannot tow, or there is a, I think it's Todd, from your perspective, how we check.

1426
01:51:20,269 --> 01:51:23,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the sign that crew asked me about this too.

1427
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:28,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hold on, let's just go back to this one and pass this, and then we'll come back to that.

1428
01:51:28,931 --> 01:51:30,452
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about it, I thought we were just talking about it.

1429
01:51:30,652 --> 01:51:31,712
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, it's gonna pass.

1430
01:51:31,752 --> 01:51:32,553
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1431
01:51:32,973 --> 01:51:33,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1432
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:38,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess proposed variants, I guess, is there anything we need to write?

1433
01:51:38,953 --> 01:51:47,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this language, if people want to wordsmith it, I'll pop it in another document where I can edit it.

1434
01:51:49,881 --> 01:51:51,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it what you listed in the chat, correct?

1435
01:51:51,562 --> 01:51:58,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the language that I also did send this around an email a couple of weeks ago just so that people would have the language in advance.

1436
01:52:01,169 --> 01:52:02,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I sent it to...

1437
01:52:12,227 --> 01:52:16,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just taking a picture of it so that way Allah can translate it.

1438
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:25,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I did email it to her a couple weeks ago and then I forwarded it like three days like right before the weekend.

1439
01:52:25,754 --> 01:52:27,735
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it.

1440
01:52:28,215 --> 01:52:38,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we have it if commissioners want to take a read in the chat and then they like that and then we'll somebody wants to propose a motion that

1441
01:52:41,368 --> 01:52:44,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question.

1442
01:52:44,609 --> 01:52:48,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what she wrote looks fine, but has the parking.

1443
01:52:50,170 --> 01:52:58,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Group taking a look at this, like, if they looked at it, do they I think they were the ones bringing this forward because they're getting all the people into the parking department.

1444
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:01,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Who wrote this did Alicia did you write this?

1445
01:53:02,252 --> 01:53:02,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it.

1446
01:53:04,052 --> 01:53:06,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this match what they're I mean, like, if you give this to them, do they go?

1447
01:53:06,973 --> 01:53:07,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

1448
01:53:08,204 --> 01:53:36,630
[SPEAKER_08]: have we done that correct this is brought up in our stakeholder group at city hall so yes this is part of one of the journey yeah i i don't i don't see an issue i mean it looks like more guidelines than anything so i don't see anything wrong with it i'd be happy to make a motion to approve it okay commission seconded by commissioner given roll call allowed commissioner mcgiven yes commissioner hunt yes commissioner berzinski yes

1449
01:53:37,513 --> 01:53:38,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize.

1450
01:53:38,313 --> 01:53:39,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get that through.

1451
01:54:02,741 --> 01:54:06,463
[SPEAKER_11]: to make them all uniform with the G in the bottom left and consistent.

1452
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:09,124
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some signs had that language, some didn't.

1453
01:54:09,484 --> 01:54:12,666
[SPEAKER_11]: We whited out all the, you may be towed at your own expense.

1454
01:54:12,826 --> 01:54:13,727
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not necessary.

1455
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:20,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Our city and other cities ticket for permanent parking without that language, and they never tow for it anyway.

1456
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:23,111
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's unnecessary, yeah.

1457
01:54:23,692 --> 01:54:29,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So future, to be more consistent, we should probably drop that language from our current parking system.

1458
01:54:31,253 --> 01:54:33,974
[SPEAKER_11]: For permit parking or for other reasons?

1459
01:54:34,274 --> 01:54:35,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, for resident parking.

1460
01:54:35,655 --> 01:54:35,915
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't?

1461
01:54:36,535 --> 01:54:36,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.

1462
01:54:38,196 --> 01:54:38,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.

1463
01:54:39,437 --> 01:54:40,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident permit parking?

1464
01:54:41,117 --> 01:54:41,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1465
01:54:43,258 --> 01:54:44,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, we don't.

1466
01:54:45,179 --> 01:54:47,660
[SPEAKER_11]: So for hydrants and other things, maybe?

1467
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,321
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for permit parking.

1468
01:54:50,501 --> 01:54:53,142
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't on the... We don't.

1469
01:54:56,344 --> 01:54:58,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know if that's changed, is what I'm saying.

1470
01:55:00,788 --> 01:55:02,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Thursday we can talk about this?

1471
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:04,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

1472
01:55:04,911 --> 01:55:06,793
[SPEAKER_11]: The signs aren't uniform throughout the city.

1473
01:55:06,893 --> 01:55:14,118
[SPEAKER_11]: So if it was related to an actual regulation, if it's a towable offense or not, then it's probably not consistent throughout the city.

1474
01:55:15,559 --> 01:55:15,639
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1475
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:17,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll talk about Thursday.

1476
01:55:18,361 --> 01:55:18,862
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a meeting.

1477
01:55:19,342 --> 01:55:19,542
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1478
01:55:20,042 --> 01:55:22,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Traffic meeting.

1479
01:55:22,704 --> 01:55:23,085
[SPEAKER_11]: 11 o'clock.

1480
01:55:24,838 --> 01:55:28,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Burgett have a problem with actual, since the G Zone was implemented?

1481
01:55:28,579 --> 01:55:32,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard anything being like the fears that they had of being a parking lot.

1482
01:55:32,861 --> 01:55:35,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's, I'm getting a lot of the tough students.

1483
01:55:36,022 --> 01:55:36,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting complaints.

1484
01:55:37,162 --> 01:55:40,763
[SPEAKER_11]: But in terms of the numbers, it's not full like a parking lot, right?

1485
01:55:41,124 --> 01:55:43,344
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that car's been there for a long time.

1486
01:55:43,764 --> 01:55:47,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, it's one particular party's calling concert.

1487
01:55:48,586 --> 01:55:50,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And my officer told me today,

1488
01:55:51,977 --> 01:55:54,898
[SPEAKER_05]: that the toll pots has been lighted up.

1489
01:55:55,879 --> 01:55:56,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was us.

1490
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:57,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1491
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:00,041
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1492
01:56:01,241 --> 01:56:04,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn the meeting.

1493
01:56:05,984 --> 01:56:07,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got one question for Jim.

1494
01:56:08,065 --> 01:56:09,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you in San Francisco?

1495
01:56:10,346 --> 01:56:16,148
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's actually my backyard here in South Medford.

1496
01:56:17,949 --> 01:56:18,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

1497
01:56:21,574 --> 01:56:22,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll snag it.

1498
01:56:22,696 --> 01:56:25,623
[SPEAKER_11]: That looks like the view behind Valley Road.

1499
01:56:26,325 --> 01:56:28,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a nice night.

1500
01:56:28,229 --> 01:56:28,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Drive safe.

1501
01:56:29,151 --> 01:56:30,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't sex and drive.

1502
01:56:30,033 --> 01:56:30,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
