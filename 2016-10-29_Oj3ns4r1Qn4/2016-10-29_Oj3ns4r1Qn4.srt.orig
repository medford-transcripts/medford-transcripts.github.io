[SPEAKER_08]: 16-723 offered by Vice President Lungo Kern.

33
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council invite Deborah Fallon, the Director of Portal to Hope,

34
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:24,388
[SPEAKER_08]: to the podium to make an announcement regarding a candlelight vigil that is to be held on October 26, 2016 at 5 p.m.

35
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,908
[SPEAKER_08]: at the Andrews School in Medford.

36
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:35,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that Director Fallon update the City Council on the services that Portal to Hope provides to victims of domestic violence.

37
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:36,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Vice President.

38
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:38,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

39
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:43,658
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have Deborah Fallon, who's the director of Portal to Hope before us tonight, as well as

40
00:01:44,136 --> 00:02:09,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe two people that also volunteer and work for Portable Hope on a number of different events, and whether it be fundraising or helping victims of domestic violence, this organization serves a number of communities and does great work for people in need of services, whether that be emergency shelter, to public assistance, to legal assistance,

41
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:16,509
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a number of things that this organization does and does well, and they've been doing for many years, thanks to Director Fallon.

42
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:22,741
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would like her to make a few announcements, let us know what she's doing in the community and how she's there to help.

43
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:24,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome counselor.

44
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:27,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

45
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to apologize.

47
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:36,465
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, I didn't realize we're missing a candle for you, so we'll have to make sure that you, that you receive one.

48
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:43,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as I mentioned to, um, uh, some of your colleagues earlier, we've set the ambience for tonight.

49
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for good purpose.

50
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:46,593
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be it.

51
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:51,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here on a matter that remains an epidemic problem in Medford.

52
00:02:51,572 --> 00:03:00,020
[SPEAKER_00]: So firstly, I want to start off by thanking you very much, Councilor Lango-Kern, for having me to come here tonight.

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,329
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been six years since I've been before this council last, so I'm happy to be back here, especially to see some new faces since then.

54
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:11,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you for all the great work that you do.

55
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:25,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially want to thank you, Attorney Lungo Kern, for all your work with our organization over the lastâ€”well, we're celebrating our 20th birthday this month, but certainly over the last 16 years.

56
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:31,146
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've been involved helping victims of domestic violence.

57
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:55,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure many of you are aware, I know Councilor Cornelio, from way back when, that Attorney Langel-Kern, as you had helped to support us, along with your other colleague, now mayor of the city of Bedford, whom we met with, Mayor Burke, and her predecessor, Mayor McGlynn, former Mayor McGlynn.

58
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:58,797
[SPEAKER_00]: But, Councilor Cornelio, you know that... Carviello.

59
00:03:58,937 --> 00:03:59,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Carviello.

60
00:03:59,498 --> 00:03:59,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

61
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I've called him that for a number of years.

62
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:04,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

63
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:06,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at the Hallmark Health meeting.

64
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,033
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I apologize.

65
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:13,918
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, you've been a terrific support to us and we really appreciate that.

66
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:22,202
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I'm here to mention about the candlelight vigil that we're hoping that you'll all attend and we invite the public to attend this event as well.

67
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:37,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Wednesday with mayor Burke and a city government, that meaning you all, um, and other community leaders, including leader Donato, we're going to be hosting a candlelight vigil outside of Medford city hall at 5 p.m.

68
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:38,572
[SPEAKER_00]: That vigil,

69
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:43,302
[SPEAKER_00]: is taking place because October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

70
00:04:44,063 --> 00:05:05,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this month, where there are 11 women and two men who were murdered at the hands of people that they loved here in Massachusetts since January, we remember their plight and we also remember the 347 Medford residents that Portal to Hope has served since that same time frame.

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are women

72
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:13,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Children and men as well, because domestic violence does not discriminate.

73
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:23,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Medford has actually creeped up a bit over the years with the number of domestic violence cases that we've been seeing,

74
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:33,430
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dedicating this next year to re-energizing the Medford community and calling for a public activism in the cause to end domestic violence.

75
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really reliant on you all to help us out with that.

76
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,455
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that you do.

77
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:46,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those Medford residents are a portion of the 900 people that we see and serve every year.

78
00:05:47,663 --> 00:06:05,578
[SPEAKER_00]: And as some of you already know, Councillor Marks as well, you as well, we have been providing comprehensive services, whether as Attorney Lango-Kern had mentioned, and President Capone, you've been involved in the past where you know that

79
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,539
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the emergency shelter, which is safe housing.

80
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,680
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide free legal aid and consultation.

81
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:19,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We're providing job and housing search and placement assistance, youth programs and the like.

82
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:35,218
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year in Medford, because we received a grant, thanks to the support of the members of this community, we received a grant from VOCA, the Victims of Crime Act, which is administered through the Massachusetts Office of Victim Assistance.

83
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:44,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And that grant is helping us to enhance our services in Medford, whereby we met with Superintendent Belson, and we're going to be looking at

84
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:50,188
[SPEAKER_00]: doing for the first time in 20 years some educational programs that will be helpful up at the high school.

85
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,490
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, providing all those other services.

86
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,632
[SPEAKER_00]: So in front of you, you have a candle.

87
00:06:56,932 --> 00:07:00,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Please remember, and I'll make sure you get one, I apologize.

88
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Please make sure that you remember to

89
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:11,371
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, remember the victims of domestic violence whom we are working with, not just in this community, but in the Commonwealth.

90
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:19,875
[SPEAKER_00]: On the informational cards that I've given you all tonight, on the back of them are the actual services that we provide, and they're numerous.

91
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:20,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

92
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:30,356
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another invitation that's being sent out to Medford residents for the candlelight vigil, which is taking place again next Wednesday.

93
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:46,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that if you can join us at that time, we know five o'clock is a tough time for people getting out of work, but whoever can join us, we would greatly appreciate it and look forward to working with you all on some new activities and new ventures over the next year.

94
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:50,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you again for allowing me the time to speak with you.

95
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Debbie, thank you for your leadership and your advocacy for people.

96
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:55,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

97
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:57,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great night and keep up the great work.

98
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.

99
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:58,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

100
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:00,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

101
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:10,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to, Oh, you'll say, I just want to point out my, my resolution was just inaccurate.

102
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:13,856
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe they're at the Andrews middle school this weekend for the community day.

103
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:18,605
[SPEAKER_15]: but October 26th, which is next Wednesday, five o'clock, we'll be here at city hall.

104
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:21,826
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to point that out a second time and all are welcome to attend.

105
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,467
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank Deb for coming forward tonight.

106
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:25,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

107
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:26,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

108
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:27,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Counselor Caffiello.

109
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:38,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, Mr. President, you know, I've been a supporter of Pueblo's Hope both personally and through my work at the Kiwanis for many years, along with Councilor Falco, with both Kiwanis members.

110
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been long-term supporters of your group and we will continue to support your group.

111
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:44,293
[SPEAKER_02]: going forward.

112
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:45,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for your work in the community.

113
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all.

114
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:52,979
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of vice-president Longo Kern that the paper be received and placed on file.

115
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,059

116
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,300
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

117
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

118
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:59,562
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of vice-president Longo Kern to return to the regular order of business.

119
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,643
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

120
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:01,704
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

121
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries 60-271.

122
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Offered by councilor Marks.

123
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:09,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Be resolved that South Medford resident permit parking be discussed.

124
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:10,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

125
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:13,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:34,251
[SPEAKER_17]: I was approached by SMARTO, which is South Meffitt Residents Together, an organization that was established some many years ago by Jim Silver and a number of South Meffitt residents to have a group that discusses issues in the South Meffitt neighborhood.

127
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:39,754
[SPEAKER_17]: And they've done yeoman's work on bringing up many public safety issues.

128
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:50,935
[SPEAKER_17]: many quality of life issues within the South Method neighborhood and have extended their tentacles to not only South Method but to also help other parts of the community.

129
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,943
[SPEAKER_17]: There has been an issue in South Medford for a number of years now.

130
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:03,748
[SPEAKER_17]: As we all know, parking is very tight and congested in the South Medford neighborhood as well as other parts of the city.

131
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:13,696
[SPEAKER_17]: And the way that we currently do our resident permit parking is outdated and antiquated to say the very least.

132
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:21,903
[SPEAKER_17]: In order to get resident permit parking in the city, you have to get a majority of the residents to sign a petition

133
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:27,369
[SPEAKER_17]: that petition then needs to go to the traffic commission, uh, for approval.

134
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:40,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, in my opinion, what's currently happening now is you have some streets that being approved other streets that aren't moving forward a petition or have been denied resident permit parking.

135
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,814
[SPEAKER_17]: And all we're doing is pushing a problem from one street to another.

136
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I did a little research.

137
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,716
[SPEAKER_17]: There's currently, I believe, uh, 133,

138
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:58,404
[SPEAKER_17]: resident permit parking streets, which is roughly 20% of the 655 streets in this community.

139
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:05,230
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you can see, there are a fair number of permit parking streets, uh, throughout scattered throughout our community.

140
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:17,421
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, it's long overdue in my opinion to create a citywide permit system that will look at citywide or possibly zoned, uh, permit parking.

141
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:20,025
[SPEAKER_17]: And it works in other communities.

142
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,406
[SPEAKER_17]: It's quite successful in other communities.

143
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:33,030
[SPEAKER_17]: It serves dual purpose to not only make sure that when a resident comes home from a busy day at work or comes home from picking up their kids at school that

144
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:46,583
[SPEAKER_17]: they should be able to find a spot on their street and not worry about people that are coming from other communities parking on our street for eight to 10 hours and going into town, Mr. President.

145
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:52,945
[SPEAKER_17]: So, with that being said, I'd like to invite Jim Silver up to the podium.

146
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:59,107
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's a lot of other issues involved with permit parking.

147
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,890
[SPEAKER_17]: And how do we create permit parking citywide?

148
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:06,055
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh, I don't think we have to recreate the wheel here.

149
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:13,906
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I'm hoping that we as a community can move forward with a sensible approach to a permit parking citywide.

150
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:14,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

151
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

152
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:15,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor.

153
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to announce that, um,

154
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:31,773
[SPEAKER_08]: After some deliberation between the Mayor, the Director of the Office of Community Development, and myself, the linkage committee voted to allot a sum of money, which I

155
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:34,164
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, has escaped my mind.

156
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:53,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it 20,000, 20,000, 25, uh, to, um, uh, to begin 20 to begin the, uh, study process on, uh, implementing this, which is, as you've rightly pointed out, counselor, uh, been a longstanding issue and, uh, one that we've advocated for a solution, uh, quite a long time.

157
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Just, just if I could on that, Mr. President,

158
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,036
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate the linkage committee.

159
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:13,260
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of people might not know what the linkage committee is, but, uh, in this city, if businesses want to do a business within this community and their project, uh, is over a certain size, um, they are required to pay the city a linkage money.

160
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,241
[SPEAKER_17]: And that linkage money can be used for a number of particular purposes.

161
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:21,842
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, in this case, uh, the committee, which consists of the president of the council,

162
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:25,139
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor and also the head of community development.

163
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:26,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's the auditor.

164
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:26,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

165
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,981
[SPEAKER_08]: The auditor met on Monday, October 17th to take $20,000 from the road trust, which is part of

166
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:42,948
[SPEAKER_17]: the linkage money that's available.

167
00:13:43,809 --> 00:14:08,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And although I'm not opposed to studies, Mr. President, I would just caution my fellow colleagues, even though it doesn't require approval from us, the previous history with studies in this community is one of three studies from 2005 to revitalize Method Square.

168
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:22,063
[SPEAKER_17]: that costed a couple of hundred thousand dollars for three studies to revitalize Meffitt Square, and we're no closer in revitalizing our square from 2005 to current.

169
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:26,466
[SPEAKER_17]: Governor Zav's feasibility study for the garage that fell down.

170
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:29,428
[SPEAKER_17]: A study was done for the Governor Zav garage.

171
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,730
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have a garage now.

172
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:41,100
[SPEAKER_17]: The Mystic River Water Taxi Service, a feasibility study to study taxi service from the Mystic River.

173
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:53,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Not quite sure when it freezes over in the winter, unless they're gonna have an ice cutter in front of the taxi, how it's gonna get down the Mystic River, but that was a study that was commissioned by the city.

174
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:57,055
[SPEAKER_17]: The Wellington Circle Traffic Improvement Study.

175
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:05,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, anyone that's been in the city for a lot of years will realize Wellington Circle's been that way for 75 years.

176
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:17,003
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's been a lot of talk and discussion, a lot of lip service, but, you know, overpass, underpass, but nothing has been done to improve pedestrian safety.

177
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Take it from someone that lives 30 yards from Wellington Circle.

178
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:27,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing has been done to improve pedestrian safety at Wellington Circle, even after the study was commissioned.

179
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:32,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we also had the police station feasibility study back in 2013.

180
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,729
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was three years ago.

181
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing has been done to date with that particular study.

182
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,511
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not opposed to studies.

183
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:44,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Studies could be very helpful.

184
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:57,378
[SPEAKER_17]: But in this case, Mr. President, I have an article from February 2015 where Chief Sacco stated on several occasions that

185
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, this is his quote by as early as next year.

186
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:12,116
[SPEAKER_17]: And this was again, February of 2015 by early of next year, which is January of 2016 police Sacco said the city plans to adopt a new system for residential parking.

187
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:17,918
[SPEAKER_17]: So that leads me to believe, although he's not timely, he's working on something.

188
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we've been told by the chief.

189
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:25,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Another quote, the street by street enforcement as it's done now is age old.

190
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:36,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Sacco said during a January, Medford City Council meeting, we either will go to zone or citywide residential permits, but I don't see that happening before next year.

191
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,158
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, this was January, February of 2015.

192
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:54,631
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it goes on to say, Sacco said the traffic commission would likely meet in June to develop a new residential parking system with the intent of implementing it at the start of next year, which would be January of this year.

193
00:16:55,153 --> 00:17:10,291
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have Chief Sacco and the Traffic Commission, by the way, which is responsible for the oversight of parking in this community, saying they're working on the issue unless they recommended that

194
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:14,450
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor commissioned a study for $20,000, which they might have.

195
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,571
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not privy to that.

196
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:24,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Why would we issue a $20,000 study when we have our own traffic commission, our own chief of police looking into an issue?

197
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,962
[SPEAKER_17]: And why do we need to spend $20,000, Mr. President, on a report

198
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:37,362
[SPEAKER_17]: that you can get three sensible people to sit around a table for two nights and figure out.

199
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:39,603
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't understand that.

200
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:41,244
[SPEAKER_17]: It really makes no sense.

201
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,447
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, it's what this city does.

202
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:47,397
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if there's an issue, commission a study.

203
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:51,258
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's an issue with the square being dead for 20 years, issue a study.

204
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:53,359
[SPEAKER_17]: If that doesn't work, issue a second one.

205
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:54,919
[SPEAKER_17]: If that doesn't work, issue a third one.

206
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:58,840
[SPEAKER_17]: And just keep on issuing studies, and maybe the people will forget.

207
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,160
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not sold on this $20,000, Mr. President.

208
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:10,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to hear from Chief Sacco about where he stands with permit parking in this community.

209
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:14,663
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would like to hear from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer.

210
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:21,486
[SPEAKER_17]: not just from a bureaucrat saying that we need to have another study in this community.

211
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:23,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Another study.

212
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:25,887
[SPEAKER_17]: It just doesn't sit well with me, Mr. President.

213
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:34,491
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I'd like to hear from Jim Silva from SMARTO on the issue, Mr. President.

214
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,571
[SPEAKER_08]: The Press Thank you.

215
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Mr. Silva.

216
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:38,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

217
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:39,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And welcome.

218
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:40,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Silva Thank you.

219
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Jim Silva, 115 Yale Street.

220
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:51,459
[SPEAKER_13]: As Councillor Marks alluded to, our request is for area-wide resident parking in South Metro specifically.

221
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:03,565
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do have four very important topics that are impacting people in the community currently and some suggestions we wanted to present to the city.

222
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, the small street resident parking.

223
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:16,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Too many cars, not enough spaces, streets like Wheeler, Shapely, Killsite, Berwick, Bradford, Benton, Hale.

224
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:21,396
[SPEAKER_13]: They have more residents, stickers, and visitor passes than spaces.

225
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:26,021
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a 48-hour street parking limits, and they're not being enforced.

226
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,271
[SPEAKER_13]: There's an overuse of visitor parking placards.

227
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:37,975
[SPEAKER_13]: And living on a corner allows you to park on adjoining streets, but you have to go to the Traffic Commission to actually get that approval.

228
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:50,581
[SPEAKER_13]: What we're recommending is, going forward, these small streets are allowed to park on adjoining streets going forward, all of the streets, based on the number of stickers on the side of the street.

229
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:56,344
[SPEAKER_13]: So it doesn't require people to come down to the Traffic Commission and have to advocate for themselves to get parking.

230
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,070
[SPEAKER_13]: The reality is they pay for this parking.

231
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:01,259
[SPEAKER_13]: They should be able to park in those adjoining streets.

232
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:09,526
[SPEAKER_13]: There are streets that have overnight street cleaning, Harvard Street and Boston Avenue, and they don't have alternative side parking.

233
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:13,727
[SPEAKER_13]: So all the streets that surround those streets are residents.

234
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:18,728
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not allowed to resident parking because they don't have resident parking on their particular street.

235
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:29,690
[SPEAKER_13]: What we're suggesting is we allow people to use the overnight public parking lot on Neal Street as well as Tufts University during the summer months as a temporary measure until

236
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,232
[SPEAKER_13]: area wide resident parking comes into play.

237
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:39,055
[SPEAKER_13]: That will be probably 20 nights a year where people would park in the public parking lot.

238
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:47,000
[SPEAKER_13]: So it shouldn't cause too much of a problem in the neighborhoods, but it really is something that needs to be looked at because people are getting tickets.

239
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:53,865
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no place for people to park on those street cleaning nights and somebody needs to stand up and sort of advocate for you.

240
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:58,688
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you can take this and run with it to the traffic commission or whomever,

241
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,215
[SPEAKER_13]: and just speak for us, because you do represent us.

242
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:02,978
[SPEAKER_13]: We really need some assistance.

243
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:11,612
[SPEAKER_13]: The other is the snow removal on a snow emergency on Maine, Harvard, Medford, Warner, and Boston Avenue.

244
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:14,738
[SPEAKER_13]: They again don't have resident parking.

245
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:26,542
[SPEAKER_13]: So on those nights when there's an emergency, and last year there was 4.5 weeks of emergency snow removal, snow emergency, those people were getting tickets.

246
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:30,284
[SPEAKER_13]: They were parking on streets surrounding them in their resident parking.

247
00:21:31,828 --> 00:21:44,233
[SPEAKER_13]: What we're suggesting is the city maybe should set up an alternative satellite parking location or have some type of snow temporary emergency pass that people can put in their window.

248
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:55,657
[SPEAKER_13]: They pay their excise tax bill and emergency passes given to them because they don't have the luxury of resident parking, but they should be able to park on the surrounding streets in those situations.

249
00:21:58,045 --> 00:22:03,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Number three, the enforcement of the 48-hour parking limit on non-resident parking streets.

250
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:16,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Winchester, Medford, Maine, Boston Ave from the Somerville line and Hicks Avenue all have cars that are parked there from out of state and coming over from the Somerville line for weeks, days and weeks at a time.

251
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:23,224
[SPEAKER_13]: People drop their car off, go into the city, and people can't possibly park on those streets.

252
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:27,107
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to enforce the 48-hour parking limit

253
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:31,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Streets under construction is number four.

254
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Boston Avenue is currently under construction from the Somerville line to Harvard Street.

255
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:46,253
[SPEAKER_13]: These people during the day have no alternative parking, so if people work nights and they're home during the day, they can't park on Warner, St.

256
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:50,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Clements, or Bristol Road, because those are resident parking.

257
00:22:51,216 --> 00:23:04,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we would suggest to the city to do some type of emergency parking pass for those people to allow them to be there, or maybe suspend during the day the resident parking criteria on the three streets that surround them.

258
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,197
[SPEAKER_13]: We understand this issue is difficult to walk with.

259
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:15,522
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had these conversations amongst us, but these are some of the suggestions that we have come to, and it really does work for a community.

260
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:21,326
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to make sure that when we build our community, we're building it for everybody, and that's what we're trying to do here.

261
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:26,269
[SPEAKER_13]: I invite any of you to come down any time and speak with us.

262
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,292
[SPEAKER_13]: I do suggest that you take public transportation because parking's tight.

263
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:31,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

264
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some people here from Shapely that would like to speak on this issue.

265
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:46,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to come up.

266
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

267
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:53,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

268
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:54,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

269
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:57,755
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Chris Coughlin, C-O-U-G-H-L-I-N.

270
00:23:57,975 --> 00:23:59,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I live at 28 Shapely Ave.

271
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:00,738
[SPEAKER_05]: here in Medford.

272
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a veteran of the Iraqi War.

273
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,146
[SPEAKER_05]: very grateful for law enforcement.

274
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a human intelligence collector over there.

275
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:11,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm on a tougher mission.

276
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually a public high school teacher.

277
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:20,735
[SPEAKER_05]: But so yeah, parking's tight, as everyone here knows.

278
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:26,018
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a few interactions with Park Medford people.

279
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:32,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And like someone mentioned, we just want to be able to come home from work and park.

280
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:37,414
[SPEAKER_05]: and feel comfortable, continue to feel comfortable in our neighborhood.

281
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:40,754
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have a few questions, though.

282
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:48,956
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very curious as to the, we heard that Park Medford was recently purchased by someone else.

283
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:51,097
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the company comes from Tennessee.

284
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:54,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I was shocked to hear about that, but anyway, that's another story.

285
00:24:56,918 --> 00:25:03,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanna know questions like, who is Park Medford accountable to?

286
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:15,083
[SPEAKER_05]: We would love to know the question, the answer to the question, what is the relationship between Medford Park, I'm sorry, Park Medford and the Medford Police?

287
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:18,285
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what's the relationship there?

288
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:20,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to know more about that.

289
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,588
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd also like to know a very important question.

290
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:29,092
[SPEAKER_05]: What percentage of revenue does this company take from Medford parking tickets?

291
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:34,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So what percentage of revenue does Park Medford take

292
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:37,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the exact numbers would be great.

293
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,041
[SPEAKER_05]: How much revenue does Medford acquire from Park Medford?

294
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:46,604
[SPEAKER_05]: How much does the city of Medford take from Park Medford?

295
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:47,484
[SPEAKER_05]: We would like to know that.

296
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:57,010
[SPEAKER_05]: We would also know that if the city has received some revenue from Park Medford, what is the money being used for?

297
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,753
[SPEAKER_05]: But we would love something like, you know, we're thinking

298
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:07,690
[SPEAKER_05]: the zone parking, like South Medford permit, something like that.

299
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for your work.

300
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:13,634
[SPEAKER_05]: We know you guys are taking serious consideration.

301
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:15,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you.

302
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:16,376
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an honor to be here tonight.

303
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:17,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

304
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:20,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

305
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:29,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion.

306
00:26:29,884 --> 00:26:31,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

307
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:32,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor.

308
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:44,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Just if I could, um, if, if we can have the, uh, the gentleman that just spoke last, if he can leave us a list of the questions, I think those questions should be answered by the city administration.

309
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:53,155
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you can leave a list of the questions with the city messenger, uh, we'll make sure that it's read into the report and we get those questions answered.

310
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:55,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, also, Mr. President,

311
00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:09,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Silver and his group have done a lot of work in compiling a lot of information that I believe the administration as well as Park Method should find very useful.

312
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:13,242
[SPEAKER_17]: And what better to have residents that get together

313
00:27:13,562 --> 00:27:20,610
[SPEAKER_17]: with a common cause and present not only a gripe, but how to resolve an issue.

314
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:30,582
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you heard from Mr. Silva, he's laying out how they can resolve some of the issues that are confronting residents in particular in Salt Method.

315
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:44,107
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, if we could, uh, by a vote of this council, uh, pass that along to the traffic commission for, uh, for their next meeting, um, that would be very helpful, Mr. President.

316
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:52,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we can also, um, have a park method, which counselor Caviello was called for a number of times now,

317
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:59,725
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, come to a council meeting to discuss some of the issues that we've had, uh, on the program itself.

318
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I think we should reiterate that.

319
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:07,472
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we can have, uh, everything that was stated by Jim Silver and Mr. Clark, did you get any of that?

320
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:14,338
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't Jim, Jim, would you mind when your mind just coming up to the podium one more time?

321
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:18,521
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, cause I wrote down some, I don't know if I captured all of them.

322
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:19,762
[SPEAKER_17]: I wrote down, uh,

323
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:31,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, uh, council before we have that, uh, may I point out to you that, uh, a counselor, a member of this body is the one who, uh, adds, uh, pieces to a motion.

324
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:32,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor.

325
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:32,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

326
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Knight point of information.

327
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:39,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, point of information would be if in fact, we're looking for the exact verbiage.

328
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I know that the council is in the past, always accepted written testimony as well.

329
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:48,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we can accept the written testimony and save Mr. Silver the trouble of reiterating it three or four times and going through the process.

330
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:54,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, you can submit the written testimony to the city clerk to be forwarded to the traffic commission if that's a suitable to the council.

331
00:28:55,774 --> 00:29:09,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that, well, that's, I don't know what his written testimony looks like, but, um, I think it's always helpful with, would it be helpful to give bullet points or the written testimony to, uh, I believe we all received an email some weeks ago.

332
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:16,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you have a list of the bullet points?

333
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:16,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

334
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:33,412
[SPEAKER_17]: So Mr. President, if we can accept the bullet points, uh, and I have the bullet points forwarded to traffic commission for review and, uh, answer the questions also that were presented, uh, regarding, um, uh, park method would be helpful.

335
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:34,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

336
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:34,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

337
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:35,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

338
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:38,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor chair recognizes vice president Lungel Kern.

339
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:40,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

340
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:41,537
[SPEAKER_15]: President DelaRusso.

341
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:42,097
[SPEAKER_15]: I just,

342
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:55,103
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's great that we did appropriate some money or the city, the linkage committee did appropriates 20,000 to review parking in the area at the South method is an area where we get a lot of complaints and Mr. Silva's right.

343
00:29:55,143 --> 00:30:00,444
[SPEAKER_15]: There's, there's more permits that are given out than their actual parking spaces, which does cause a problem.

344
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:07,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, in, in, I think we should be hopeful and hope that this $20,000 will go to be spent

345
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,532
[SPEAKER_15]: in a reasonable amount of time to come up with some resolution to the issue.

346
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:21,976
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think Mr. Silva gives a number of great recommendations that really should be implemented on an immediate basis.

347
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:30,761
[SPEAKER_15]: I think allowing the public lot to be used during street sweeping nights is a extremely good point.

348
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:36,544
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think there's little things that can be done to alleviate some of the congestion and some of the problems that are taking place.

349
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:39,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So I really hope that the Traffic Commission

350
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:44,830
[SPEAKER_15]: reviews the bullet points and takes them into account and potentially votes on them at the next meeting.

351
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:55,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if Jim knows when the next meeting is, so maybe we could get this on the agenda and maybe a few counselors could come and support you and the neighbors who are having the problem.

352
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

353
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,242
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just asking when the next traffic meeting is.

354
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:00,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know?

355
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:03,565
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're the second Tuesday of every month.

356
00:31:03,605 --> 00:31:04,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Second Tuesday.

357
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,647
[SPEAKER_15]: So November, second Tuesday in November.

358
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's maybe the following week.

359
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:16,300
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will definitely get on the agenda.

360
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,765
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could let us know when the next meeting is and if we could request that this be on the agenda for that meeting in November.

361
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:25,007
[SPEAKER_08]: The Traffic Commission actually notifies us a week before every meeting in our packets.

362
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:27,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

363
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:35,537
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we could ask the Traffic Commission to put this on the agenda specifically, that congestion and parking in South Medford be discussed.

364
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:40,872
[SPEAKER_15]: with the recommendations from the city council and Mr. Silva to be addressed and voted on.

365
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:46,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that making that request is something that we can do.

366
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:47,117
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in our purview.

367
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:58,565
[SPEAKER_15]: We can make requests and recommendations, and I think it's something that will go a long way in helping Mr. Silva's cause and the citizens of South Medford who are having a great deal of problems in that area.

368
00:31:59,266 --> 00:31:59,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

369
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:00,567
[SPEAKER_08]: All set.

370
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:02,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

371
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:04,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

372
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:04,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you.

373
00:32:04,738 --> 00:32:06,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks for bringing this issue forward.

374
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I've been a firm advocate for examining citywide permit parking since my election some years ago.

375
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:20,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and I think that that's really the best approach would be to taking, taking a look at this in a citywide perspective.

376
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, um, the piecemeal approach isn't working as we're going street by street by petition.

377
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:27,190
[SPEAKER_09]: All it is is pushing the problem over to the next block.

378
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:37,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the only fair and equitable way to really address this would be to take a look at the whole entire city, because the problems that the individuals are having in South Medford aren't much different than the problems that the individuals in the hillside are having.

379
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not much different than the problems that the individuals down on First, Second, Third, and Fourth Street are having.

380
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:49,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that the only fair and equitable approach, Mr. President, would be to examine it in a citywide basis.

381
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:54,592
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the position that I've had for a number of years, and that's the position that I'm going to maintain, Mr. President.

382
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly also would support a study.

383
00:32:57,546 --> 00:33:04,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that as we look at the best practices of municipal government, best practices would show that data-driven decision-making is the way to go.

384
00:33:05,174 --> 00:33:08,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't make data-driven decision-making without collecting data.

385
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:10,539
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way to collect the data would be through a study.

386
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can certainly sympathize with the issues that are going on down in South Medford, because I quite frequently spend a lot of time there.

387
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:18,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, too, have issues with parking.

388
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:25,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I think about it right now, I have a $100 ticket that I have to pay for being a little too close to a bus stop down there.

389
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:34,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, too, have been victimized and victimized myself, I guess, by trying to do the best I can to squeeze in down in that neighborhood, Mr. President.

390
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:35,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So I certainly understand the frustrations.

391
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:37,464
[SPEAKER_09]: And ultimately, it is a quality-of-life issue.

392
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that this is something that can be addressed.

393
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:45,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's also taken too long for the Traffic Commission to make a determination as to whether or not citywide permit parking is the way to go.

394
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:53,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think that looking at this in the only fair and equitable way would be to do it on a citywide basis.

395
00:33:53,803 --> 00:33:55,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

396
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:57,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes the citizen of East Medford.

397
00:33:59,045 --> 00:33:59,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

398
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

399
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:03,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

400
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew P. Castanetti, Cushion Street, Medford, Mass.

401
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:14,132
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have much to add to the pains in Salt and Method for the parking.

402
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:22,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I do feel that pain, however, because although I've been out of there for 36 years, I used to live in Mystic Avenue.

403
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:27,347
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the old Route 93 to Boston before they built Route 93 in 1960.

404
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:33,571
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't a picnic back then when there's more cars, obviously, these days.

405
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:47,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to advise to a word of caution for future excavations of the problems for future parking.

406
00:34:48,319 --> 00:35:01,765
[SPEAKER_11]: It may become even more of a nightmare if the board of appeals allows developers to not meet their 2.1 parking spots per residential unit.

407
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:06,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I would find it hard to issue an invariance

408
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:14,758
[SPEAKER_11]: to not require the 2.1, which maybe we could even increase the three or whatever.

409
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:17,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a word of caution.

410
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:18,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for listening.

411
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, citizen.

412
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:22,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion.

413
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:27,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval, roll call, Mr. President.

414
00:35:27,331 --> 00:35:29,673
[SPEAKER_08]: A motion for approval by Councilor Marks as amended.

415
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:31,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call has been requested.

416
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:41,649
[SPEAKER_08]: We have it.

417
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

418
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:47,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Calviano?

419
00:35:47,873 --> 00:35:48,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

420
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco?

421
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:49,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

422
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:51,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

423
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:51,775
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

424
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:54,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President O'Kerry?

425
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:54,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

426
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:56,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Mox?

427
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:56,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

428
00:35:57,258 --> 00:35:58,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scott Valley?

429
00:35:58,058 --> 00:35:58,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

430
00:35:59,039 --> 00:35:59,860
[SPEAKER_07]: President Del Rosso?

431
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

432
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,282
[SPEAKER_08]: The vote is six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

433
00:36:04,822 --> 00:36:05,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

434
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:06,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I count that right?

435
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:09,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

436
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:23,360
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-722 off the council of Falco, whereas route 28 Felsway West is a state road and one of the most heavily traveled roads in the city of Medford.

437
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:39,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas many residents cross route 28 Felsway West at the intersection of Fulton street, be it resolved that the city of Metro requested DCR, the department of conservation and recreation,

438
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:50,519
[SPEAKER_08]: to adjust the pedestrian timing signal to allow pedestrians more time to cross route 28 Felsway West at the intersection of Fulton Street.

439
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:51,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

440
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:55,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I brought this, uh, resolution up for tonight.

442
00:36:55,843 --> 00:37:05,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I've received a number of calls from, uh, residents in the heights and, uh, also in down in the lower Fulton street area, uh, people crossing the Felsway right down near St.

443
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:06,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Francis.

444
00:37:06,712 --> 00:37:07,172
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um,

445
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:15,575
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the biggest problems down there is when you press the button to actually cross the Fellsway, there's not enough time to cross.

446
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:16,495
[SPEAKER_12]: So it counts down.

447
00:37:16,815 --> 00:37:20,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you get halfway across, you have to sprint the rest of the way.

448
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:22,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, it's definitely a public safety issue.

449
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:28,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, in fact, uh, on the way to the meeting tonight, I was the first car on line down by St.

450
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:28,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Francis stop.

451
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:35,562
[SPEAKER_12]: The couple was walking and they hit the button, they crossed, they made it to the island in the middle, and then they had to sprint to get to the other side.

452
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:38,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's, you know, you have traffic coming off of 93.

453
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,945
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very busy roadway and it's a public safety issue.

454
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:54,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd appreciate it if we could have, um, uh, someone from the mayor's office reached out to the DCR and see what we can do to have the, um, more time added to that crossing signal so people can cross the street safely.

455
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:54,851
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a,

456
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:56,607
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very busy intersection.

457
00:37:56,628 --> 00:38:04,015
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people cross that intersection in the morning, walk across there to catch the bus to go into Boston, or to go to Wellington Station.

458
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:07,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Some kids cross to get to baseball in the summer and whatnot.

459
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:16,053
[SPEAKER_12]: have someone contact the DCR to increase the time to cross the street, the walking signals.

460
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:17,514
[SPEAKER_12]: I greatly appreciate it.

461
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:18,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

462
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:21,395
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, Councilor Longo-Kern.

463
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:21,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

464
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

465
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:25,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I just want to second the paper.

466
00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:29,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I drive down Fulton street on my way to drop off my kids every day.

467
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:31,557
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a problem.

468
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:33,538
[SPEAKER_15]: You see pedestrians that don't have enough time.

469
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:38,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I also want to see if you wouldn't mind amending the paper if, if,

470
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:49,749
[SPEAKER_15]: DCR is amenable to changing those lights, maybe giving a few extra seconds to people coming down Fulton Street, because we are getting a backup all the way past Jim's Market on some days.

471
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:54,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Today was right at Jim's Market, and it took 20 minutes to get down Fulton Street.

472
00:38:54,292 --> 00:39:06,139
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what, kids are being late for school, so we have a pedestrian issue, and we have, if we could just adjust those, that time as well, or request it, I think that would be helpful for the traffic that's backing up

473
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:12,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, because you definitely can give them an extra 10 seconds, each green signal and still have the Fells wake free and clear.

474
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:13,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

475
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good on that motion as amended.

476
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:17,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor night.

477
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:34,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Mr. President, I'd also like to further amend the paper and request that the DCI provide us with a listing of all of the DCI controlled crosswalks and, um, cross signals in the community so that we can take a look and make sure that we're all operational and, uh, meeting their intended purpose on that motion as amended again.

478
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,509
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

479
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,012
[SPEAKER_08]: All those, oh, welcome.

480
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:42,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

481
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

482
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street.

483
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:51,211
[SPEAKER_01]: The intersection that we're talking about is actually six lanes across with the island.

484
00:39:51,312 --> 00:39:52,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah, it's a jaunt.

485
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:57,935
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the kids that live in Fulton Heights do attend the Roberts Elementary.

486
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:03,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have walking Wednesdays two months out of the year, which encourages the children from Fulton Heights to walk there.

487
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:06,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though there are adults, they definitely can't make it through.

488
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,381
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to have a crossing guard there.

489
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:18,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also should be noted that from Salem Street to that point, it's .7 miles with no slow down, no stop.

490
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:28,530
[SPEAKER_01]: A crosswalk at the intersection of Park and Felsway could probably slow them down some as well, because I know that's considered a dragway.

491
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:35,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who lives near there has witnessed the sprint trying to get from Salem through to the highway without having to stop.

492
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really dangerous intersection.

493
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can address that.

494
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:40,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

495
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,745
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval as amended.

496
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:44,106
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

497
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:45,266
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

498
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:46,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

499
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:48,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Petition.

500
00:40:49,629 --> 00:40:51,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for suspension of the rules.

501
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

502
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:53,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk, Mr. President.

503
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:58,595
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk and papers under suspension.

504
00:40:58,615 --> 00:40:59,236
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

505
00:40:59,276 --> 00:40:59,836
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

506
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:00,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Carries.

507
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:01,958
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-725 offered by Councilor Caviello.

508
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:11,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its condolences to the family of Anthony Silva, longtime resident of Medford.

509
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Anthony Silva served his country as an Army veteran of the Green War.

510
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,936
[SPEAKER_08]: His presence in our community will be missed.

511
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:18,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor.

512
00:41:19,337 --> 00:41:20,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

513
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:27,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I just want to send the condolences to the Silva family and their, his wife and their three children.

514
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:29,765
[SPEAKER_02]: They're longtime residents.

515
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:32,827
[SPEAKER_02]: his presence will be missed in our community.

516
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Good people.

517
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:52,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Please stand for a moment of silence for this deceased Metro resident.

518
00:41:52,120 --> 00:42:00,306
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-726 offered by Councilor Caviello will be resolved that the Memphis City Council request an answer to why there was no crossing guard at the Brooks School on Monday morning.

519
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:08,758
[SPEAKER_08]: be it further resolved that a job description for the crossing guards be provided, if possible, request that the Medford police attend.

520
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:10,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Carfiolo.

521
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

522
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:18,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've been having a lot of problems in that corner there, and I was dismayed when I got a call at 8 o'clock in the morning.

523
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:21,056
[SPEAKER_02]: about no crossing guards there.

524
00:42:21,676 --> 00:42:40,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately went to the school, I spoke with the Principal Galluzzi, she informed me of the situation, and I was made aware that an officer was there within a few minutes after them being called, and to take care of the situation along with someone else.

525
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did have the opportunity to get out to the police station, and Captain Clementi,

526
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:53,005
[SPEAKER_02]: gave me a description of what happened over there and why there was no officer, no crossing guy there.

527
00:42:53,045 --> 00:43:03,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact remains that I don't know how this fell through the cracks, that at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning, nobody was there.

528
00:43:03,593 --> 00:43:09,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's something that either the reporting system didn't work or something didn't work.

529
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:14,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, Mr. President, these crossing guards are doing more than crossing children.

530
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:16,042
[SPEAKER_02]: They're directing traffic.

531
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:20,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's part of their job description.

532
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a job description?

533
00:43:23,182 --> 00:43:24,563
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do, could it be provided?

534
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:29,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as I say, these women and men are doing more than I think they're supposed to be doing.

535
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:31,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, especially at these busy schools and intersections.

536
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, you know, crossing the kids is dangerous enough.

537
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevermind with them having to direct traffic with all these cars on these side streets.

538
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:41,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

539
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:42,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

540
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:44,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falcone.

541
00:43:44,974 --> 00:43:45,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

542
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:49,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, thank you, uh, consular Caviello for bringing this forward tonight.

543
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:53,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I also did receive calls, um, uh, the other day about this issue.

544
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,924
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, we talked a lot about this at our last police community meeting.

545
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:06,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, one of these, they talked about the various solutions, uh, um, that they were going to implement in that, at that intersection and crosswalk.

546
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, one of them I believe was to, uh,

547
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,381
[SPEAKER_12]: set up like a, um, a flashing sign that would slow down cars.

548
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:14,884
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, that hasn't arrived yet.

549
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:23,631
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could just, uh, get, we'll find out from the mayor's office as to when, um, that sign is going to be, um, uh, set up and installed.

550
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:25,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

551
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:28,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Clerk has that, uh, madam vice president.

552
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:29,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, president Della Russo.

553
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:33,079
[SPEAKER_15]: I too got a number of emails and two phone calls with regards to,

554
00:44:34,147 --> 00:44:37,550
[SPEAKER_15]: what happened yesterday, and it is sad that that fell through the cracks.

555
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:56,525
[SPEAKER_15]: There was also, I believe, a gentleman in the audience posted on Facebook, so you actually see pictures of the principal, who obviously should be directing her students accordingly in the school, was out doing her due diligence and stopping traffic and allowing the children to cross.

556
00:44:56,625 --> 00:45:03,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we know we've had a couple near misses in the last few weeks at that location, so everybody is concerned about it,

557
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:11,504
[SPEAKER_15]: we do need to make sure that that intersection and all our intersections near all of our schools are manned on a daily basis.

558
00:45:11,564 --> 00:45:17,026
[SPEAKER_15]: If a crossing guard is out, we need to make sure somebody fills in to cross the students.

559
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:29,932
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I did reach out to the mayor's office and the mayor's office was very responsive and has asked a reserve crossing guard to remain at the post as well as a sector car for the remainder of the time that that crossing guard

560
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:32,324
[SPEAKER_15]: who is normally there will be out.

561
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:34,465
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank the mayor's office for doing that.

562
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:39,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And hopefully we can keep on top of this through the mayor's office and through the chief of police.

563
00:45:39,828 --> 00:45:52,714
[SPEAKER_15]: We can make sure that each and every one of our crossing locations for the schools is manned every day, morning and afternoon, so that we can prevent anything or do our best to prevent anything from happening to one of our children.

564
00:45:53,915 --> 00:45:55,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

565
00:45:55,116 --> 00:45:56,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

566
00:45:56,776 --> 00:45:57,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

567
00:45:59,017 --> 00:45:59,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's safe to say that

568
00:46:00,672 --> 00:46:02,853
[SPEAKER_09]: We here in the community ask a lot of our educators.

569
00:46:03,654 --> 00:46:05,475
[SPEAKER_09]: But asking them to be crossing guards is a bit much.

570
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:16,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to publicly commend Principal Suzanne Buckley-Galusi on her efforts and her work in taking this situation as seriously as it is and getting out there and actually taking action.

571
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:20,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think she was a great hire and a great selection for principal of the Brooks School.

572
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's really living up to expectations.

573
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:24,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is evident, Mr. President.

574
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,430
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that being said, we have a representative here from the police department.

575
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:38,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Barry Clemente here, and maybe he can shed some light on the situation as to what happened and explain to us exactly what was going on on Monday morning and how we got to that situation and what steps have been taken to prevent it from happening again.

576
00:46:39,418 --> 00:46:40,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We hear his voice all the time.

577
00:46:41,179 --> 00:46:44,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Now before us live, the man behind the phone calls, right?

578
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Behind the phone calls.

579
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:46,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Captain Barry Clemente.

580
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:48,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

581
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:55,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as far as what happened Monday, um, the traffic supervisor did call in, um,

582
00:46:55,898 --> 00:47:02,303
[SPEAKER_03]: That information was not relayed to the commanding officer, which in turn wasn't relayed to the assignment office.

583
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:08,948
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result, there was nobody there at the pole, not the pole, but the traffic spot post.

584
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:14,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we took immediate, uh, action to rectify it.

585
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:19,697
[SPEAKER_03]: We did put a, um, a mock unit down there with an officer when it became clear to us what had happened.

586
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:20,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

587
00:47:21,635 --> 00:47:31,243
[SPEAKER_03]: What we've done to prevent this from happening in the future is, you know, we've reestablished the policy and put it out to all the offices on our digital headquarters board.

588
00:47:31,824 --> 00:47:41,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all the offices know the importance of, uh, relaying that information to the commanding officer, which in turn will make it to the, uh, the assignment office.

589
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:47,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the offices are genuinely concerned about the safety of the children and, uh,

590
00:47:48,210 --> 00:48:07,776
[SPEAKER_03]: We've senses, uh, council long goes, uh, mentioned, we do have cruises down there, mock units with lights on, um, both on both ends of the, um, the assignment, which is the AM and PM, um, at the Brooks school, along with the reserve officer that has been there to fill for the engine traffic supervisor.

591
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:10,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't anticipate on this happening again.

592
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:12,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unfortunate though.

593
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:13,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It did happen on Monday.

594
00:48:15,146 --> 00:48:18,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we thank you for the ethics of the police department and straightening this out.

595
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:20,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, it's definitely been straightened out.

596
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:27,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, counselor, I know you mentioned, um, something about the, um, the future system that's going to be down there.

597
00:48:28,297 --> 00:48:34,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're, they are looking to actually change the configuration and infrastructure that's down there right now.

598
00:48:34,882 --> 00:48:37,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I do have, uh, some paperwork here.

599
00:48:37,404 --> 00:48:41,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe everyone's been briefed on everything that's going to be going on down there.

600
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:42,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

601
00:48:43,513 --> 00:48:50,498
[SPEAKER_03]: that system that you were talking about, um, actually has an 80 to 90% yield rate when it's implemented.

602
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:53,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that's going to help immensely down there.

603
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're going to be straightening out the crosswalks down there as well.

604
00:48:57,603 --> 00:49:04,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which, and adding curbing, which will actually shorten the length of the crosswalk, which makes it a little bit safer.

605
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:07,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think with all that implementation,

606
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:12,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with the addition of the police officers being on scene, I don't anticipate any problems.

607
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:17,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That device is actually called a Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacon.

608
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,012
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a mouthful.

609
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:23,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But we actually have the locations where that's going to go in.

610
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:28,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chief Sacco and Officer Brooks have been working constantly with that.

611
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a time frame for that, but I'm hoping that very soon that that's going to start.

612
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:35,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And that should,

613
00:49:36,648 --> 00:49:40,529
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you know, alleviate some of the problems that have been occurring down there.

614
00:49:41,189 --> 00:49:43,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the congestion all over the city is, is just amazing.

615
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:45,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you can see it in the square.

616
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:53,091
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't leave my house at six 30 in the morning, um, it can take 30, 40 minutes for me to get down here and I'm not far away at all.

617
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:55,591
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an increase in traffic all over the city.

618
00:49:56,592 --> 00:50:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the office is doing a good job, um, you know, with the enforcement.

619
00:50:01,212 --> 00:50:04,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, again, they're generally concerned about the welfare of the children in the schools.

620
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and we're going to have offices down there on the AM and PM shifts along with the reserve officer.

621
00:50:10,911 --> 00:50:15,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't anticipate, uh, any lack of coverage in the future.

622
00:50:15,573 --> 00:50:16,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

623
00:50:17,153 --> 00:50:18,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

624
00:50:18,374 --> 00:50:18,854
[SPEAKER_08]: My pleasure.

625
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:19,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

626
00:50:19,674 --> 00:50:19,874
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

627
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:20,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

628
00:50:20,674 --> 00:50:22,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes counselor Knight.

629
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:23,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

630
00:50:23,575 --> 00:50:24,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, captain appreciate the work you do.

631
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:25,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

632
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:27,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor marks.

633
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:32,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I know captain Clemente doesn't oversee the crossing guides, correct?

634
00:50:32,457 --> 00:50:33,178
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't oversee them.

635
00:50:33,478 --> 00:50:34,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not know.

636
00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:45,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Our assignment office will assign accordingly if there is a traffic supervisor on vacation or if one does call in sick.

637
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:48,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a list of reserve offices, right now we have three.

638
00:50:49,703 --> 00:50:56,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's a situation where there aren't enough of reserve offices, we do put a unit down there.

639
00:50:57,447 --> 00:51:03,610
[SPEAKER_03]: We take a unit from the shift, whether it be a traffic unit or a sector car to help cross the students and the parents.

640
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:06,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that number seem a little low, three reserves?

641
00:51:06,986 --> 00:51:07,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

642
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:11,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember in previous years we used to have maybe a dozen.

643
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:13,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love, I'd love to see a dozen.

644
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:21,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen situations where we've had, um, we've had to deplete the shift pretty much, uh, covering traffic posts.

645
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a safety problem in and of itself, uh, as they're answering calls for service.

646
00:51:27,195 --> 00:51:28,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So we definitely need more reserves.

647
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:37,293
[SPEAKER_17]: So what happens if a police officer is acting as a crossing guy and they receive a public safety call?

648
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:39,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we take another unit in that area.

649
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:45,899
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two units in each, each sector, um, on good days and, um, we'll assign accordingly.

650
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:51,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've seen situations where the shifts have been pretty much depleted.

651
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:51,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

652
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:57,307
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if there are a lot of situations or a lot of traffic supervisors out, um, I've seen it happen.

653
00:51:58,253 --> 00:52:05,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Now do our traffic supervisors have a way of communicating with the police department when they're out on the streets?

654
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, phone, they don't have radios.

655
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:13,506
[SPEAKER_17]: So their own personal phone, right?

656
00:52:13,646 --> 00:52:18,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a reason why we don't give them some type of walkie talkie or communication directly?

657
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Something, something to be looked at.

658
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:21,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

659
00:52:21,213 --> 00:52:22,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely down the road to improve things.

660
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:27,147
[SPEAKER_17]: That's that's what I was told by the chief a couple of years ago that that that was going to happen.

661
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:28,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they'd look into it.

662
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:28,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

663
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:33,299
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think at the time you were getting an upgrade on your walkie talkies.

664
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:42,061
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was mentioned that maybe some of the older ones could be used, because I've had crossing guards come up to me and say, you know, we have cars that aren't stopping.

665
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:50,688
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm able to get a license plate, but, you know, by the time I pull out my phone or do what I have to do, you know, it's easier just to let the car go by.

666
00:52:51,188 --> 00:53:02,417
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think if we had quicker communication, you know, with some of these people that are disregarding kids in the crosswalk, disregarding a traffic supervisor that's out there with their hand up saying stop,

667
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:05,018
[SPEAKER_17]: You probably hear the stories.

668
00:53:06,038 --> 00:53:16,083
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to see greater communication in cracking down on these people that are paying no attention to traffic supervisors.

669
00:53:16,464 --> 00:53:18,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll speak to the chief about that.

670
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, everyone's texting.

671
00:53:21,506 --> 00:53:23,047
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many distractions out there.

672
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:28,529
[SPEAKER_03]: There's less attention as a result of those texting or being on the phone.

673
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:30,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a problem.

674
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:31,831
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a problem.

675
00:53:32,678 --> 00:53:39,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we do have a reserve officer in place for the book school, um, from here on in.

676
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:49,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So further notice along with the police officer lights, cruiser, and so further notice, both shifts morning and afternoon.

677
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:50,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, captain.

678
00:53:50,778 --> 00:53:50,958
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

679
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:51,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

680
00:53:52,244 --> 00:53:52,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight again?

681
00:53:53,405 --> 00:54:04,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Captain, when you say reserve officer, are you referring to a reserve officer on the reserve list that could be eligible for hire if in fact a position became available?

682
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:13,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have three right now on the list that if a traffic supervisor calls in sick or takes a vacation, we can pull off of that reserve list.

683
00:54:15,122 --> 00:54:16,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, there's three people there.

684
00:54:17,224 --> 00:54:18,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have an auxiliary as well?

685
00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:21,227
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we just have the original.

686
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:24,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Original list for the traffic supervisors and then the reserve.

687
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so there's no auxiliary, please.

688
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:27,404
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no auxiliary.

689
00:54:27,424 --> 00:54:34,748
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more we need more Thank you, thank you very much.

690
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:35,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

691
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:35,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

692
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,990
[SPEAKER_16]: I was this.

693
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:37,590
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

694
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:37,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

695
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:38,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

696
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:44,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you captain appreciate all you do I know that on the school committee we received many a

697
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:48,990
[SPEAKER_16]: calls when you're driving into school, there's no crossing guard.

698
00:54:49,550 --> 00:55:00,155
[SPEAKER_16]: When we say reserves, do we have, for instance, substitute crossing guards that come in that could be called in when someone's not able?

699
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:01,516
[SPEAKER_03]: We have those three on the reserve.

700
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:02,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so those are the only three?

701
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:03,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only three right now.

702
00:55:03,597 --> 00:55:05,718
[SPEAKER_03]: If it goes past that, we use our officers.

703
00:55:06,238 --> 00:55:13,102
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, so is it possible if we can put an amendment on that to ask the mayor?

704
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:29,007
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this would be a great opportunity to maybe get the seniors involved in part of the tax break, looking to train our volunteers and getting volunteers, even different school systems, different areas.

705
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:41,292
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe even asking the PTGs and the PTOs if there are parents that are in the area that if you wanted to volunteer and be trained in case of emergency,

706
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:44,062
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that'll help.

707
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:46,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I think anything would help right now.

708
00:55:46,183 --> 00:56:06,994
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe if we look into that and asking maybe the superintendent to look and talking to the chief and maybe the mayor about, um, asking us to school volunteers, if there are any, you know, uh, parents that are in the, in the area that want to be trained and used for emergency situations like this, maybe that could be something we can look at.

709
00:56:07,374 --> 00:56:08,615
[SPEAKER_16]: So that can alleviate the issue.

710
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:11,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so your, your amendment is that the mayor,

711
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:25,375
[SPEAKER_08]: investigate the possibility of implementing volunteers, either seniors or parents to be able to step in in the event of a lack of crossing guards.

712
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:25,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

713
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:26,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

714
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:26,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

715
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:27,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Counselor.

716
00:56:27,956 --> 00:56:36,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm very excited that with these, um, with this infrastructure change here, I can see immediately that it will help down there at the book school.

717
00:56:37,779 --> 00:56:42,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the chief addressed the parents down there at the book school at the last community meeting.

718
00:56:43,055 --> 00:56:48,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you get a good reception from them as a result of this.

719
00:56:49,597 --> 00:56:49,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

720
00:56:49,997 --> 00:56:52,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't have the timetable on it, but I know it's in the works.

721
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much.

722
00:56:54,739 --> 00:56:55,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

723
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a couple of citizens wanted to address the council on this as well.

724
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:12,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, uh, Frank O'Leary, 85 Rollington street.

725
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:21,706
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I'd like to thank the City Council, Mayor's Office, and Medford Police Department for taking on this issue and acting as quickly as you have been.

726
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:27,650
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been great strides over at the Brooks, at the Alston Street and High Street corner.

727
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:29,371
[SPEAKER_04]: The street markings are in.

728
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:32,834
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that visually the road is getting smaller.

729
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:37,090
[SPEAKER_04]: The incident with the miscommunication was definitely unfortunate.

730
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:41,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows that there's definitely still a lot more work that needs to be done.

731
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:49,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious, when you said that there was going to be officers in place there indefinitely, is that until Nicole comes back?

732
00:57:49,975 --> 00:57:51,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that going to be ongoing?

733
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Nicole's wonderful.

734
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:57,017
[SPEAKER_04]: She's incredibly brave for being out there.

735
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:02,712
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's not there now, because she was either struck or almost struck.

736
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she was almost struck last Wednesday.

737
00:58:06,753 --> 00:58:14,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result of getting out of the way of a motor vehicle, she actually twisted, moved awkwardly and twisted something.

738
00:58:15,115 --> 00:58:19,656
[SPEAKER_03]: She did manage to, it was 7 in the morning, she did manage to go to her afternoon shift.

739
00:58:19,836 --> 00:58:24,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at 4 p.m., we moved inside to her, and she didn't seem to have a lot of attention.

740
00:58:26,182 --> 00:58:28,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever played in the car, she did speak to the driver.

741
00:58:28,764 --> 00:58:29,744
[SPEAKER_03]: The car did stop.

742
00:58:30,265 --> 00:58:34,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I'm on track to investigate that.

743
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:41,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's out indefinitely right now.

744
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:48,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And for right now, until further notice, we're going to have officers down there, as well as a reserve officer.

745
00:58:50,508 --> 00:58:54,710
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as the push is going to continue.

746
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:55,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

747
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:59,832
[SPEAKER_04]: There's clearly a disregard for the crosswalk and for the crossing guards.

748
00:59:00,272 --> 00:59:03,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen her almost get struck several times personally.

749
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:13,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other day with Susan Galussi going out there, it put her in danger of not having the experience of crossing children.

750
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:19,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is that the meeting that we had with the chief, the DPW,

751
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: made it sound like instated that the flashing, I'm not even gonna try to pronounce that, whatever, rectangular rabbit flash thing, that they would be in place within 10 days, that after the meeting, they're gonna order them and they'll be in place.

752
00:59:34,975 --> 00:59:40,879
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering what the delay is on that because that's the band-aid fix that everybody's looking for.

753
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:46,904
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand that it's gonna be after January into the spring before a lot of things happening gets developed.

754
00:59:47,524 --> 00:59:56,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And another thing I would point out is that on the social media, there have been a number of reports that Brooks isn't the only school where this is happening at.

755
00:59:56,828 --> 01:00:00,710
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other schools where principals are crossing kids.

756
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:07,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is not just a West Medford, this is a Medford issue.

757
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:09,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

758
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:10,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Miller.

759
01:00:10,895 --> 01:00:11,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Captain.

760
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:12,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

761
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:13,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

762
01:00:15,117 --> 01:00:15,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

763
01:00:18,138 --> 01:00:18,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight.

764
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:19,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

765
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:19,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

766
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:30,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I had a recent conversation with, um, personnel in the DPW that did inform me that some signage is in stock or has arrived relative to pedestrian crossings.

767
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:42,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's the rectangular rapid flashing beacon, but I know that they have some stock that has arrived and I can clarify that for Mr O'Leary as to whether or not, um,

768
01:00:42,624 --> 01:00:46,967
[SPEAKER_09]: that is the material that has come in, uh, that's in stock and ready to go, Mr. President.

769
01:00:47,007 --> 01:01:00,935
[SPEAKER_09]: But ultimately I'd like to amend the paper and, um, include counselor Moxley's recommendation that our traffic super and supervisors be outfitted with communication equipment that will allow them to dispatch either the main office of the school that they're working at or to the Metro police department.

770
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:08,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think that, like I, as I said, we ask a lot of our educators, Mr. President, but they're always willing to rise to the top and rise to the occasion.

771
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they're being,

772
01:01:09,385 --> 01:01:17,348
[SPEAKER_09]: dispatched by the crossing got into the main office that there's a problem out there than the main office has some personnel that can handle some of the phone calls and stuff like that.

773
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:21,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the crossing traffic supervisor continues to cross kids and make sure that they get to school.

774
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's an excellent recommendation, Mr. President.

775
01:01:23,651 --> 01:01:25,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it should be added to part of the resolution.

776
01:01:25,552 --> 01:01:26,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you for bringing it up.

777
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:28,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, counselor, ma'am.

778
01:01:28,653 --> 01:01:29,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

779
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

780
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:32,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

781
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:38,937
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope, uh, I just hope that the mayor is going to listen to me and I'm not being antagonistic at all.

782
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:45,071
[SPEAKER_10]: The city needs, and I'm trying really not to be antagonistic, I'm not yelling at her, I'm not doing anything.

783
01:01:46,231 --> 01:02:04,616
[SPEAKER_10]: When the city doesn't look at it from a city perspective, it's gonna cost money, it's gonna be painful to people, not everybody's gonna like it, but I agree with Mr. Knight tonight, I agree with Mr. Falco, and Mr. Marks is always talking about traffic calming measures.

784
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:06,477
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all the same theme all night.

785
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:20,445
[SPEAKER_10]: And unless you look at the whole city and you look at the flow patterns and you get a professional in here to do the traffic calming measures, get the traffic engineer, and the parking needs to be done at a city level.

786
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:21,485
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.

787
01:02:21,745 --> 01:02:26,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, you're going to have this constant drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.

788
01:02:26,228 --> 01:02:28,229
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not trying to be, I'm not yelling at her.

789
01:02:28,669 --> 01:02:36,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I really want her to look at the whole overview, hire somebody, take the political hits because you're going to irritate people.

790
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:40,852
[SPEAKER_10]: when you tell them that they can't park there anymore or whatever, it's going to cost.

791
01:02:41,412 --> 01:02:56,599
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the long run, if you don't take care of it, it comes down on the bottom, and I have talked to some of the safety people that cross, and they see the sun in the eyes because it's certain times of day, and the people don't respect the guards.

792
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:57,019
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

793
01:02:57,179 --> 01:02:59,160
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't respect the crossing guards.

794
01:03:00,168 --> 01:03:07,670
[SPEAKER_10]: not considered really, you know, they gotta get to work, or they gotta get their kid off to school, or whatever, and the mindset has changed.

795
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,230
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they don't respect it.

796
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:18,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we don't have a slower moving system, and yeah, it's gonna back up, and yeah, there's gonna be complaints, but yeah, you have to do something about it because somebody's gonna get hurt.

797
01:03:19,293 --> 01:03:24,894
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the traffic people, a kid, and who can't feel sorry for kids getting hit?

798
01:03:25,354 --> 01:03:29,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's, you know, I mean, there's no, and the other thing is elderly.

799
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when you're talking about the Felsway, I know some elderly ladies that go to St.

800
01:03:33,172 --> 01:03:40,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Francis and they walk down there, and they go down to the senior citizen center, and they walk, some of them actually walk down there.

801
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:44,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very, very dangerous for seniors as well, because they can't scoot.

802
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:54,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm begging the mayor to really take a good look at the overview of the city, because otherwise it comes down to the bottom, and those people at the bottom get crushed.

803
01:03:54,909 --> 01:03:55,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we need to hire more,

804
01:03:57,933 --> 01:04:02,274
[SPEAKER_10]: auxiliary for the crossing guards, then we have to find the money to do it.

805
01:04:02,674 --> 01:04:11,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So that when there's a sick call or something, that there's a replacement for that person, because you can't use the police, unless you're going to use the police for crossing guards, period.

806
01:04:11,637 --> 01:04:15,057
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can't use the police, it doesn't make sense.

807
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,598
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a reason why we have the police, why we have the crossing guards.

808
01:04:18,638 --> 01:04:21,119
[SPEAKER_10]: The crossing guards are there to cross the children.

809
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you pull them, we don't have enough to pull off the police.

810
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:28,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Because what if there's an actual emergency?

811
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:28,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you've got to catch 22.

812
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:42,006
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one thing when they're on a site for National Grid, they can be pulled away because, you know, but how can you leave, abandon a site where it's a crossing guard for an hour when you have a robbery or something or something more important?

813
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:44,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you have to, the cop has to make that decision.

814
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:47,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And he shouldn't have to or she shouldn't have to be in that position.

815
01:04:47,686 --> 01:04:53,132
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really, really, really, I hope that she looks at the whole thing.

816
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:57,856
[SPEAKER_10]: You need a city engineer, you need to do this, and it's not gonna get any easier.

817
01:04:57,956 --> 01:04:58,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

818
01:04:58,617 --> 01:04:59,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Ms.

819
01:04:59,658 --> 01:04:59,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Martin.

820
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:03,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, please state your name and address for the record, welcome.

821
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:05,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

822
01:05:05,107 --> 01:05:09,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street, which is the street that the Roberts Elementary School is on.

823
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:12,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Our principal is one of the principals who is out in the parking lot.

824
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:22,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Our traffic configuration was changed so that the drop-off loop is now parking because our teachers, our school has expanded to the point that we don't have enough parking for our teachers.

825
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:27,233
[SPEAKER_01]: They double parked in the parking lot and that overflowed and now they're parked in the

826
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:31,440
[SPEAKER_01]: the drop-off loop, so our kids are further away from the school when they get dropped off.

827
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:43,908
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a problem with parents and commuters who've decided that the drop-off loop is a great way to bypass all the cars that are backed up on Park Street down to the Felsway, so they'll buzz through as the children are trying to cross.

828
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:57,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So, our principal has taken to standing at the end of the driveway with his arms crossed in an effort to stop people because my child has been one of the children that has almost been mowed down by someone just whipping through.

829
01:05:57,647 --> 01:06:04,776
[SPEAKER_01]: either from Court Street all the way across through the loop and out Park Street or through the loop from Park Street to Park Street.

830
01:06:05,236 --> 01:06:14,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a dangerous situation and I'm sure that if you talk to people at the Columbus, if you talk to people at the Andrews, I had a daughter at the McGlynn, there were issues there.

831
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:17,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think we need to look at all the schools.

832
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:22,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the Brooks is having emergent problems right now and I'm happy that they're being addressed.

833
01:06:23,176 --> 01:06:26,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope that the rest of the schools are involved in the conversation.

834
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:33,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Mr. Johnson has asked the school committee they announced last night that he had asked for an additional crossing guard to help at the loop area.

835
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:36,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the status of that is.

836
01:06:36,502 --> 01:06:42,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I also spoke to Chief Sacco at the community meeting and asked him to look again at our traffic configuration.

837
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he would get back to me.

838
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:46,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the status is on that either.

839
01:06:47,244 --> 01:06:49,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to inject that in the conversation.

840
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:50,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

841
01:06:51,428 --> 01:06:51,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

842
01:06:52,348 --> 01:06:52,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

843
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:53,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

844
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:55,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

845
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:56,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

846
01:06:56,793 --> 01:06:58,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob Capucci is 71 Evans street.

847
01:06:59,856 --> 01:07:07,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I don't know how feasible it is, is for the city, but if an extra set of eyes is, is needed,

848
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:14,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I know neighboring communities like Cambridge, they have cameras at intersections and such.

849
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:27,274
[SPEAKER_14]: And if people are, I mean, I've never personally seen anybody blow off a crossing guard, but if people are, I mean, that's a very serious issue that drastic measures have to definitely be taken.

850
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:37,336
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the matter of hiring auxiliary, last Tuesday night when I presented that humble suggestion, the next day actually,

851
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I walk my dog at the park.

852
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:48,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke to a guy who used to be an auxiliary police officer and, um, they're, they're invaluable in terms of the service that they provide.

853
01:07:48,873 --> 01:07:50,614
[SPEAKER_14]: If they're only working 20 hours a week.

854
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:58,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this guy personally actually, uh, caught down and tracked a, a, uh, an offender.

855
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:04,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't say of what nature, but, uh, um, I wonder if the city knows when,

856
01:08:06,504 --> 01:08:08,905
[SPEAKER_14]: We did get rid of the auxiliary police we used to have.

857
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:12,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I know growing up in the 70s and 80s, we used to call them parkies.

858
01:08:12,385 --> 01:08:14,646
[SPEAKER_14]: There used to be a cop at every park.

859
01:08:15,986 --> 01:08:20,487
[SPEAKER_14]: But we've got rid of that program, and I'm wondering why, just if it was budgeted.

860
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,428
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can find out, that would be great.

861
01:08:23,568 --> 01:08:26,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And look into it, whatever you can do for public safety.

862
01:08:26,788 --> 01:08:30,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really government's first issue is protection of the citizens.

863
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:30,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

864
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:31,629
[SPEAKER_08]: You're absolutely right.

865
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:32,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, sir.

866
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Citizen.

867
01:08:35,037 --> 01:08:36,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

868
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:37,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

869
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:38,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Castanetti, Cushing street.

870
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:43,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I don't know much about this auxiliary enforcement police business.

871
01:08:43,945 --> 01:09:02,302
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if I recollect years back when we took away the parking meters in Memphis square and then I believe the city installed signs saying two hour parking only.

872
01:09:03,858 --> 01:09:16,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And for whatever reason or reasons, it wasn't enforced very well, especially after my buddy Vinnie the cop left the department.

873
01:09:17,505 --> 01:09:29,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And all they had to do was show, in my estimation, five orange tickets on a daily basis in each square, including the middle square, all five squares, and other squares, if they exist.

874
01:09:30,811 --> 01:09:31,792
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think people would have,

875
01:09:33,605 --> 01:09:47,014
[SPEAKER_11]: saw the orange and said, maybe I should stay in Winchester and Stoneham, Melrose, et cetera, or Somerville, and find other alternate transportation to work.

876
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:48,795
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just assuming all this.

877
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:49,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really know.

878
01:09:53,819 --> 01:10:01,684
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, I believe, actually, that some citizen brought up a point, well, why can't we hire

879
01:10:03,147 --> 01:10:06,669
[SPEAKER_11]: since the police staff might be understaffed in this community.

880
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:22,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't we hire, I believe the term was auxiliary police, in order to give out tickets and maybe pay them 10, 12, $15 an hour, instead of what the going rate is in pension for police officers.

881
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:32,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe the police, not to get involved with unions, but there was some comment made

882
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:38,271
[SPEAKER_11]: from a department or entity of government here that it's not allowed.

883
01:10:40,231 --> 01:10:58,135
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I believe down the road there was sort of some sort of an agreement between the city and the police union of Medford that they would allow the city to hire auxiliary police.

884
01:11:00,315 --> 01:11:00,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

885
01:11:01,728 --> 01:11:07,529
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, the city had to give in to some sort of perks, I think, for the union, for the officers.

886
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:12,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was something to do with extra education monies, things of that nature.

887
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:12,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

888
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:14,311
[SPEAKER_11]: My recollection's not that good.

889
01:11:14,711 --> 01:11:15,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

890
01:11:16,632 --> 01:11:30,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know what happened thereafter, but maybe there's something to that that might be of some help for the, across industries for these children.

891
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:32,042
[SPEAKER_11]: if they could hire them.

892
01:11:33,443 --> 01:11:34,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for listening.

893
01:11:34,784 --> 01:11:35,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, citizen.

894
01:11:36,245 --> 01:11:37,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, counselor.

895
01:11:37,386 --> 01:11:38,346
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to take our vote.

896
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:39,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

897
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:39,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be brief.

898
01:11:40,348 --> 01:11:44,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to touch upon the topic of the Roberts Elementary School that came up earlier.

899
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:52,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I was involved a few years ago with the police department and a number of parents as well, just to redesign the loop system down there.

900
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:54,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And it has worked well for a little while.

901
01:11:54,638 --> 01:12:00,723
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we could just have Officer Brooks, because Officer Brooks was very instrumental in changing the system down there.

902
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:13,905
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could just have him follow up directly with Mr. Johnson to see what's working and what's not working, because I know some things have changed and it sounds like it's not working, but Officer Brooks was definitely instrumental in making that change.

903
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:19,992
[SPEAKER_12]: And if he could work directly with Principal Johnson, that would be greatly appreciated.

904
01:12:20,452 --> 01:12:22,014
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended by Councilor Falco.

905
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:27,211
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended.

906
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:28,612
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

907
01:12:29,232 --> 01:12:31,614
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

908
01:12:31,634 --> 01:12:32,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Carried.

909
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,475
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-727 offered by Councilor Caviello.

910
01:12:33,956 --> 01:12:41,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Mayor instruct the Chief to increase its police presence in Medford Square.

911
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:50,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Calls are continuing relating to loitering, public drinking of alcoholic beverages, panhandling, and bothering of merchants and patrons

912
01:12:51,037 --> 01:12:52,919
[SPEAKER_08]: in Medford Square, Councilor Caviello.

913
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:53,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

914
01:12:53,959 --> 01:13:04,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I brought this up two weeks ago, and I'm gonna continue to bring it up until the Chief puts somebody in the square, either walking or some type of presence there.

915
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:20,081
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people there that are, they hang in front of Century Bank in that garden there, drinking alcohol, beverages, smoking, harassing the people, foul language, they're panhandled.

916
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:28,922
[SPEAKER_02]: They're down in between the alley by the optical store, drinking alcoholic beverages there, smoking pot.

917
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:40,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, and it goes on all day, and the merchants are perturbed about it, and they're not happy with the answer they're getting is they're not bothering anybody.

918
01:13:40,264 --> 01:13:41,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they are bothering somebody.

919
01:13:42,245 --> 01:13:46,185
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bothering the residents, and they're bothering the merchants.

920
01:13:47,326 --> 01:13:49,126
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep talking about revitalizing the square,

921
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:54,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this isn't how we revitalize the square by having people sitting down there doing this and begging for money.

922
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:56,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It continues.

923
01:13:56,558 --> 01:14:00,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm telling you, I'm going to bring it up every two weeks until it stops.

924
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:06,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President's motion for approval by council Caviello, seconded by councilor Falco councilor Falco.

925
01:14:06,723 --> 01:14:07,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

926
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:07,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

927
01:14:07,904 --> 01:14:09,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Caviello for bringing this forward.

928
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,707
[SPEAKER_12]: I received a number of calls about this as well.

929
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:16,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, this is, uh, definitely an issue that needs to be addressed sooner than later.

930
01:14:17,929 --> 01:14:19,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I received a call the other day from a neighbor.

931
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,219
[SPEAKER_12]: She had gone down to the square.

932
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:22,887
[SPEAKER_12]: I think to get her nails done.

933
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:29,490
[SPEAKER_12]: And she was approached several times by people looking for money while she was on the way to her car.

934
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:30,410
[SPEAKER_12]: She felt intimidated.

935
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:37,472
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we don't want our residents feeling that way when they're coming into the downtown business district.

936
01:14:38,213 --> 01:14:38,673
[SPEAKER_12]: It's wrong.

937
01:14:38,793 --> 01:14:42,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, here we are, we're trying to, you know, revitalize the square.

938
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:43,294
[SPEAKER_12]: We keep talking about it.

939
01:14:44,295 --> 01:14:50,917
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you want economic development, but if you want economic development, you don't want to scare away people that are kind of coming here to spend their money.

940
01:14:51,397 --> 01:14:53,979
[SPEAKER_12]: So this needs to be addressed, it needs to be addressed right away.

941
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:03,348
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been going on far too long and I definitely support this resolution and I second the motion.

942
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:06,070
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion, seconded.

943
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call has been requested.

944
01:15:07,672 --> 01:15:08,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight.

945
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:10,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly appreciate the resolution as well, Mr. President.

946
01:15:10,855 --> 01:15:13,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good idea to increase the police presence in Medford Square.

947
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:15,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in a catch-22.

948
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:22,088
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to create a vibrant square with places for people to congregate and for people to relax and for people to reflect like at the Peace Garden.

949
01:15:22,128 --> 01:15:33,217
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, we want to be sure that we're policing the individuals that are there so that we're providing a strong quality life and a nice environment for those to utilize and enjoy these spaces, Mr. President.

950
01:15:33,257 --> 01:15:36,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wholeheartedly in support of this resolution and I, too, move for approval.

951
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

952
01:15:39,696 --> 01:15:40,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caviolo?

953
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:41,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

954
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:42,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Felico?

955
01:15:42,157 --> 01:15:42,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

956
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:43,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

957
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:43,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

958
01:15:44,037 --> 01:15:45,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Langer-Kern?

959
01:15:45,237 --> 01:15:45,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

960
01:15:45,998 --> 01:15:46,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Moxley?

961
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:47,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

962
01:15:47,518 --> 01:15:48,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

963
01:15:48,278 --> 01:15:48,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

964
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: President Dela Cruz?

965
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:50,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

966
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:53,259
[SPEAKER_08]: With the vote of the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion carries.

967
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:59,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Papers in the hands of the clerk, be it resolved, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved the city administration update the council

968
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:05,664
[SPEAKER_08]: on the status of noise complaints by Terrace Road residents relative to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

969
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:06,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor?

970
01:16:06,825 --> 01:16:07,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

971
01:16:07,505 --> 01:16:10,086
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been a lingering issue for a couple of years now.

972
01:16:11,207 --> 01:16:18,530
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been some complaints from residents on Terrace Road that there is a ongoing humming or buzzing sound that is coming potentially from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

973
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:22,372
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been some investigation into the matter and meetings with the city administration.

974
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:25,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just asking for an update as to where we are in that process, Mr. President.

975
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:35,150
[SPEAKER_08]: be it resolved that the Director of Veterans Services provide the Council with the following.

976
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,974
[SPEAKER_08]: One, a list of applicants awaiting the addition of their names to Honor Roll Park.

977
01:16:40,494 --> 01:16:45,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Two, a timeline as to when those names will be added to Honor Roll Park.

978
01:16:45,698 --> 01:16:46,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor?

979
01:16:46,559 --> 01:16:47,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

980
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:51,503
[SPEAKER_09]: With Veterans Day fast approaching, I've received a number of calls of some individuals who have applied.

981
01:16:51,944 --> 01:16:53,746
[SPEAKER_09]: to have their name added to Honor Roll Park.

982
01:16:54,347 --> 01:17:03,516
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all know, Honor Roll Park is the monument on Winthrop Street at the foot of Steve Miller Way leading up to the high school that would honor those combat veterans that have served in our community.

983
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:07,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been brought to my attention that the list is expanding and growing.

984
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:12,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have potentially enough applicants right now, Mr. President, where we could

985
01:17:13,192 --> 01:17:23,976
[SPEAKER_09]: move to add the names to one row park and it would be cost effective and I just would like this information so that I can cross-reference that and see how much it will cost and then maybe make a recommendation to the mayor to appropriate funds.

986
01:17:24,737 --> 01:17:33,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Veterans Day is fast approaching on November 11th and I think if we get this information before then maybe by Memorial Day we'll be able to have some money appropriated and get the names added to the list.

987
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:35,841
[SPEAKER_08]: On that motion all those in favor?

988
01:17:36,241 --> 01:17:36,922
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

989
01:17:37,302 --> 01:17:37,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Carries.

990
01:17:38,402 --> 01:17:41,484
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two papers that

991
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:46,794
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two papers eligible for a second reading.

992
01:17:46,814 --> 01:17:49,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

993
01:17:49,675 --> 01:17:54,276
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of the Council of the Vice President, Langa Kern, to revert back to the regular order of business.

994
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,077
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

995
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:56,317
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

996
01:17:56,377 --> 01:18:02,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

997
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:08,321
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-724, petition by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medgar, Mass., to speak on the rules of city council meetings.

998
01:18:08,681 --> 01:18:11,562
[SPEAKER_08]: In my experience, speaking about and at the community meeting.

999
01:18:16,954 --> 01:18:19,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park street.

1000
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:36,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I spoke at the podium last week about the issue that I, I started to speak about the issue that I had at the community meeting and I was interrupted and everyone that I ran into from Medford this week said, wow, I can't believe that that happened at the city council meeting.

1001
01:18:37,078 --> 01:18:44,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did some research and found out that in the Roberts Rules of Order, I shouldn't have been interrupted because I had the right to speak.

1002
01:18:44,624 --> 01:18:47,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't speaking, saying anything inflammatory.

1003
01:18:47,506 --> 01:18:49,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sharing my experience from having gone to that meeting.

1004
01:18:51,389 --> 01:18:55,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to come up and say that.

1005
01:18:55,271 --> 01:19:02,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also wanted to share the information that I had from the meeting because I felt that I didn't really get to share it last time because of that.

1006
01:19:03,373 --> 01:19:09,519
[SPEAKER_01]: One other interesting thing I found out when I was researching the Roberts Rules of Order was that a point of information is when you have a question for the speaker.

1007
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:12,061
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not actually to give information.

1008
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:25,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty surprised about that, but when I spoke to my 20-year-old college student who is on the student government at her college, she said, of course, mom, everybody knows that, because she had to take a crash course in Roberts Rules of Law in order to be on student government.

1009
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:33,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty thrown off when I was interrupted for several minutes, so I just wanted to go back.

1010
01:19:33,908 --> 01:19:38,330
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw the Facebook post about the meeting being in the neighborhoods, I wanted to attend.

1011
01:19:38,911 --> 01:19:45,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I came straight from the South Medford Economic Transition meeting to that meeting, so I missed the five-minute introduction.

1012
01:19:46,316 --> 01:19:47,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting in the back of the room.

1013
01:19:48,277 --> 01:19:55,762
[SPEAKER_01]: The Brooks parents had a very large showing, and I sat for the first hour and heard them discuss their issues on High Street.

1014
01:19:57,632 --> 01:20:03,482
[SPEAKER_01]: After that point, I raised my hand so that I could have an opportunity to speak as everyone else in the room was doing.

1015
01:20:03,622 --> 01:20:05,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my hand up for several minutes.

1016
01:20:05,786 --> 01:20:09,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I swapped my hands back and forth as my arms got tired from being held up.

1017
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:12,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone came up behind me and told me to stand up.

1018
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:13,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps he couldn't see me.

1019
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:14,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I did stand up.

1020
01:20:15,059 --> 01:20:16,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone I knew across the room waved at me.

1021
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:17,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I waved my arm.

1022
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I still wasn't called on.

1023
01:20:20,321 --> 01:20:28,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Three people around me, I actually leaned over and said to Councilor Falco, I think that perhaps they don't want to call on me.

1024
01:20:29,589 --> 01:20:31,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept my hand up.

1025
01:20:31,631 --> 01:20:33,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Three people around me raised their hands.

1026
01:20:33,972 --> 01:20:36,074
[SPEAKER_01]: They were each called on fairly quickly.

1027
01:20:36,234 --> 01:20:39,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Each said, I just raised my hand so that she could have a turn to speak.

1028
01:20:40,617 --> 01:20:43,179
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did not feel welcome at that meeting.

1029
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,962
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty known that I live in East Medford.

1030
01:20:48,372 --> 01:20:52,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that was or was not the reason that I wasn't called on.

1031
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:59,661
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that I wished to say at that meeting was what I say when I come here, is that traffic is an issue everywhere in the city.

1032
01:20:59,741 --> 01:21:02,484
[SPEAKER_01]: There are dangerous conditions in other parts of the city.

1033
01:21:03,064 --> 01:21:13,353
[SPEAKER_01]: What they were stressing at that meeting was calling in the mass DOT to meet about High Street, and I wanted to interject that if we were going to have them come down, they would only come down once.

1034
01:21:14,113 --> 01:21:24,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should identify all the other mass DOT streets that we have within Medford that have issues and have them all tour those streets at the same time.

1035
01:21:24,157 --> 01:21:29,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you go to any school and talk to the parents, they'll all tell you a horror story about a street nearby.

1036
01:21:29,959 --> 01:21:32,780
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the senior center, they'll tell you a similar story.

1037
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:39,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make sure that we got the best that we could for all of Medford, and that was my point speaking then.

1038
01:21:41,382 --> 01:21:49,029
[SPEAKER_01]: At that meeting, we were instructed if we wanted to see accidents, I'm almost done, that we could go on the Mass Highway website and find traffic data.

1039
01:21:49,549 --> 01:21:52,431
[SPEAKER_01]: So the latest data that I could find was from 2014.

1040
01:21:53,032 --> 01:21:54,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't include any Wellington Circle 93 or the

1041
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:02,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Rotary that's right out here, I'm not sure the name of it, just because those are things we really can't fix.

1042
01:22:03,242 --> 01:22:07,963
[SPEAKER_01]: But the big winner, or maybe the loser, depending on how you want to look at it, was Main Street.

1043
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:12,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Main Street had the most accidents, by far, of any other street in our city in 2014.

1044
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:16,405
[SPEAKER_01]: They had 87 accidents, which I thought was wow.

1045
01:22:16,525 --> 01:22:19,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard anybody come in and complain about accidents on Main Street.

1046
01:22:20,146 --> 01:22:21,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Salem Street was at 62.

1047
01:22:22,007 --> 01:22:22,707
[SPEAKER_01]: High Street was at 50.

1048
01:22:22,907 --> 01:22:25,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I included the entirety of these streets.

1049
01:22:26,028 --> 01:22:27,489
[SPEAKER_01]: The Felsway was at 34.

1050
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:28,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Riverside, 32.

1051
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:30,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Ave, 27.

1052
01:22:30,752 --> 01:22:32,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Middlesex Ave, 24.

1053
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:36,176
[SPEAKER_01]: The Winthrop Circle, the infamous Winthrop Circle, was at 17.

1054
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:42,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And Locust Street, where we want to put 490 units as well as Wegman, had 14 accidents.

1055
01:22:42,981 --> 01:22:46,504
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very short strip of street to have 14 accidents in one year.

1056
01:22:48,755 --> 01:23:10,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Central lab at the intersection of spring also had 10 accidents that year So I just wanted to point out that there's a lot of issues in the city I know that the police are short-staffed and I know that we're looking to make changes to the infrastructure and that we want to hire someone but Sometimes if you just look at the data and you talk to everyone then you can find out I hope that a lot of people will come to the meeting.

1057
01:23:10,748 --> 01:23:12,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure the date of the meeting I

1058
01:23:16,722 --> 01:23:20,663
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Wednesday of the month, November 5th, according to Councilor Falco, and that will be at St.

1059
01:23:20,703 --> 01:23:21,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Francis.

1060
01:23:23,464 --> 01:23:33,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage everyone to attend and make sure that the city knows everything that's going on because there are a lot of issues and we can't just be quiet and hope that someone will notice and fix them.

1061
01:23:33,267 --> 01:23:34,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all that I can say.

1062
01:23:34,908 --> 01:23:35,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.

1063
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:46,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, pursuant to our rules, Mr. President, a similar matter was disposed of last week and, uh, the paper should not have reached the table for 90 days.

1064
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:58,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if we're going to be looking at the rules and Robert's rules of order, I think it's also important to point out that the rules of the Memphis city council would indicate that that paper was disposed of and then, uh, substantial and like matters cannot be brought to the table for 90 days.

1065
01:23:58,344 --> 01:24:05,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but with that being said, motion to receive in place on file on that motion, all those in favor, all those, uh, succeeds.

1066
01:24:05,866 --> 01:24:08,267
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two papers that are eligible for a third reading.

1067
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:15,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper 16667 from the table for third reading.

1068
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:19,274
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Council Knight to take paper 16-667.

1069
01:24:19,334 --> 01:24:19,994
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1070
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:20,614
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1071
01:24:21,035 --> 01:24:24,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Legal age of 21 to purchase tobacco in Medford.

1072
01:24:24,516 --> 01:24:25,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Eligible for the third reading.

1073
01:24:25,697 --> 01:24:26,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits motion.

1074
01:24:27,158 --> 01:24:35,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this was a piece of legislation that I put forward to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco in the city of Medford from 18 to 21 years of age.

1075
01:24:35,602 --> 01:24:39,504
[SPEAKER_09]: It was recommended by way of our tobacco prevention grant coordinator.

1076
01:24:39,928 --> 01:24:41,948
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, supported by the administration verbally.

1077
01:24:42,088 --> 01:24:43,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in discussions with the administration.

1078
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:46,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it was also passed unanimously here at the city council.

1079
01:24:46,629 --> 01:24:51,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, at its first reading, it was advertised duly in the Medford transcript on October 6th, 2016.

1080
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,271
[SPEAKER_09]: It is eligible for third reading today.

1081
01:24:53,711 --> 01:24:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I would ask that this matter be approved this evening.

1082
01:24:56,572 --> 01:24:59,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, by doing so, we'll be addressing a public health concern.

1083
01:24:59,372 --> 01:25:06,574
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not only in the region, in the area, but also in the state and across the country on the motion of council night for approval, seconded by counselor Scott Pelly.

1084
01:25:06,934 --> 01:25:08,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:31,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is ordered.

1101
01:25:31,655 --> 01:25:40,201
[SPEAKER_08]: 16-674, loan order of $1,800,000, City Hall roof and facade, which is already under process, is eligible for its third reading.

1102
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:41,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits motion.

1103
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:45,496
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello for approval.

1104

[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1105
01:25:47,703 --> 01:25:48,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1106
01:26:08,093 --> 01:26:08,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Scott Kelly?

1107
01:26:08,653 --> 01:26:08,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1108
01:26:09,453 --> 01:26:10,134
[SPEAKER_07]: President DelaRusso?

1109
01:26:10,294 --> 01:26:10,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1110
01:26:10,674 --> 01:26:14,675
[SPEAKER_08]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes and is ordered.

1111
01:26:15,695 --> 01:26:31,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And according to the provisions of said motion, there'll be a paper coming to us that this is approved for rescinding the allotment for free cash, which allowed the project to get underway so that valuable time wouldn't be lost.

1112
01:26:32,281 --> 01:26:36,682
[SPEAKER_08]: The records of the meeting of October 11th, 2016 were passed to Councilor Knight.

1113
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:45,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And before we take those records, we're going to receive an announcement from the Vice President of the Medicine Council, Attorney Brianna Lungo Kern.

1114
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:46,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

1115
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:52,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to make an announcement about an event that's taking place, multiple events that are taking place this weekend.

1116
01:26:53,123 --> 01:26:59,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't probably have all the facts in my head because there's a large flyer that goes along with it that I didn't bring.

1117
01:27:00,197 --> 01:27:11,462
[SPEAKER_15]: A Medford resident who suffered a spinal cord injury months ago and who has gone through over 30 surgeries obviously has some medical bills that are in need to be paid.

1118
01:27:11,622 --> 01:27:16,385
[SPEAKER_15]: So on Saturday there is a blood drive, which is a good sentiment.

1119
01:27:16,425 --> 01:27:19,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there is a golf tournament at Mount Hood that begins at noon.

1120
01:27:20,627 --> 01:27:25,549
[SPEAKER_15]: And there is a event Saturday night at the Irish American where there will be a

1121
01:27:26,076 --> 01:27:28,357
[SPEAKER_15]: over 50 raffles and silent auctions.

1122
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:32,618
[SPEAKER_15]: There'll be a band and a comedian and all money raised goes to pay the medical bills.

1123
01:27:33,238 --> 01:27:35,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, for his name is TJ Scanlon.

1124
01:27:35,619 --> 01:27:47,663
[SPEAKER_15]: He's actually the brother of our assistant city solicitor, Kim Scanlon, who has suffered a tough few months and hopefully anybody is welcome to come and buy a ticket and get some raffles and have a good time.

1125
01:27:49,204 --> 01:27:49,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1126
01:27:50,627 --> 01:27:52,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

1127
01:27:52,448 --> 01:27:55,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, upon review of the records, I find them in order and would move for approval.

1128
01:27:56,369 --> 01:27:58,289
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval of records, all those in favor?

1129
01:27:58,329 --> 01:27:58,849
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1130
01:27:59,169 --> 01:28:00,270
[SPEAKER_08]: The records are approved.

1131
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:08,572
[SPEAKER_08]: The clerk has just reminded me that the general election for this year is November 8, 2016.

1132
01:28:10,893 --> 01:28:13,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Polls are open 7 to 8 in the evening.

1133
01:28:14,974 --> 01:28:19,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can vote early at the city

1134
01:28:20,602 --> 01:28:21,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Register on City Hall.

1135
01:28:24,044 --> 01:28:30,088
[SPEAKER_08]: On October 24th, 830 to 430, the 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, October 31st, November 1st, All Saints, November 2nd, All Souls, November 3rd and 4th, from 830 to 430 some days, to 1230 some days,

1136
01:28:44,706 --> 01:28:45,747
[SPEAKER_08]: and to 1 p.m.

1137
01:28:46,628 --> 01:28:47,228
[SPEAKER_08]: some days.

1138
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:56,297
[SPEAKER_08]: This is posted on the city website and is posted in the clerk's office and in the office of the registrar and voters.

1139
01:28:56,757 --> 01:29:00,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Also keep in mind citizens that all of you should have received

1140
01:29:00,438 --> 01:29:05,641
[SPEAKER_08]: A booklet from the Secretary of State in the mail several weeks ago, a red covered booklet.

1141
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:16,626
[SPEAKER_08]: That will give you a pro and con discourse on all the many ballot options, the ballot questions that are before the citizens for referendum.

1142
01:29:17,027 --> 01:29:18,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And those have a binding effect.

1143
01:29:19,028 --> 01:29:21,449
[SPEAKER_08]: So do your research and study well.

1144
01:29:22,109 --> 01:29:24,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It covers everything from marijuana to veal.

1145
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:29,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion of Councilor Scott Pelley for adjournment.

1146
01:29:29,972 --> 01:29:31,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Councilor Falco has an announcement.

1147
01:29:32,994 --> 01:29:36,377
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may really quick, I need to make a quick correction.

1148
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:39,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I had mentioned that the next police community meeting is on the 5th.

1149
01:29:39,559 --> 01:29:41,301
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually November 2nd.

1150
01:29:41,981 --> 01:29:42,522
[SPEAKER_12]: It's at St.

1151
01:29:42,582 --> 01:29:50,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Francis, and while we're at it, December 7th is at the Andrews Middle School, and January 4th is at the South Benford Fire Station.

1152
01:29:50,768 --> 01:29:54,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor, for your leadership in this matter and bringing it out to the people.

1153
01:29:54,711 --> 01:29:55,252
