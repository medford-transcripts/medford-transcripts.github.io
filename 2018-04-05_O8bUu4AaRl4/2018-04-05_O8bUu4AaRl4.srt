1
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:05,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:06,557
[SPEAKER_01]: The secretary will call the roll.

3
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:11,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Mrs. Metz, here.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Mrs. Stone, here.

5
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:14,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Ruggiero, here.

6
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Russo, here.

7
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:17,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Mrs. Van de Koot, here.

8
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:19,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Burke, present.

9
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:20,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven present, none absent.

10
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:22,366
[SPEAKER_01]: All please rise and salute our flag.

11
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:30,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

12
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:36,207
[SPEAKER_12]: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

13
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone for being here tonight.

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:45,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I see many administrators, teachers, parents, so it's really nice to have you here this evening.

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,372
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, we will be conducting public interviews for the four candidates that were submitted from the search committee.

16
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,633
[SPEAKER_01]: The recommendations came from that body that met

17
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:01,780
[SPEAKER_01]: confidentially in executive session over the last month, and we have their recommendations at hand.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,208
[SPEAKER_01]: So this evening we will be meeting with Dr. Donna Strait and Dr. John Ferrella, and then we have the remaining two on Wednesday night starting at 6.15 also.

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,692
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a very intense process.

20
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're pretty much on schedule.

21
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:18,075
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be like a few days behind at this point.

22
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:21,117
[SPEAKER_01]: But the committee put in a lot of work and a lot of effort.

23
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:23,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to just personally thank you.

24
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll have all the members up at a later date.

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,702
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, thank you for the efforts that went into this.

26
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:33,145
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, a couple of the meetings were led by the group without school committee members present.

27
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:39,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did a phenomenal job really working hard on questions and processes, so I thank

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,232
[SPEAKER_01]: all of you for the work that you did.

29
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:48,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, we would like to welcome in our very first person, Dr. Donna Strait.

30
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,905
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I start, just that this is really an opportunity for the school committee to interview the candidate.

31
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,670
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, it is school committee purview to hire the superintendent of schools.

32
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really is an opportunity for the seven of us

33
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:10,121
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask questions and we will not be deliberating this evening obviously, but we will ask questions and then continue on Wednesday evening.

34
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to welcome in Dr. Strait.

35
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:28,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:29,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening everyone.

39
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Right to the middle.

40
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:03,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Right there.

41
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:05,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew it was right there in the middle.

42
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much, Dr. Strait, for joining us this evening.

43
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:13,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the search committee thoroughly enjoyed and learned quite a bit about you during that.

44
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,820
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are starting fresh with the seven members of the school committee.

45
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:20,283
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would like to open it up at this point just for opening comments.

46
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:21,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

47
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:22,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

48
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:29,909
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I'd just like to thank you for having me and giving me this wonderful opportunity to speak with you regarding

49
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,384
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the most important positions that we have in helping to lead your schools.

50
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:47,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there's a huge legacy that we will have to follow by Superintendent Belson and that's such an impressive stature that I would look forward to being able to move forward.

51
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:55,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to share a few things in reviewing your Medford application process and what some of the standards are.

52
00:03:56,584 --> 00:04:06,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I found that much of what you're looking for with your next superintendent are elements of my background, that I've had the opportunity to work in both suburban and urban districts.

53
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:16,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had the opportunity to create, determine, and implement different varieties of academics, curriculum, and assessment.

54
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also been very invested in working in social-emotional learning for students, which we know today is a huge

55
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:32,046
[SPEAKER_06]: situation with many of our students and parents dealing with and an area that we really want to develop.

56
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:45,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel very excited at the opportunities that you have here as well as the extensive collaboration between the city and the school district and knowing that everybody wants the best, not just for this city, but also for our children.

57
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:46,776
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you again.

58
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:47,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

59
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:48,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

60
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to open it up to Miss Mustone.

61
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:52,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to officially meet you.

63
00:04:56,203 --> 00:05:05,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say if you've googled Medford school system, you probably got a lot of articles about communication within the district with parents, with teachers.

64
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:15,557
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could talk about how you communicate with teachers, administrators, parents, and everyone, and children, and the students, that would be, I would love to hear it.

65
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:16,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

66
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:16,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

67
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:29,882
[SPEAKER_06]: As a superintendent, communication is vital to ensure that people understand what is the message of our school district, what is it that we're trying to do for our students.

68
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:38,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We want our students to be successful and have the skills, whether it's college and career readiness, for the 21st century global society that we're moving into.

69
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:42,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So I communicate in a variety of different ways, certainly

70
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:53,331
[SPEAKER_06]: the old ways, which would include going out to parent groups, going out to civic organizations, going to student events, whether it's a play, a sporting event, a Decker event.

71
00:05:54,012 --> 00:06:01,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I communicate through parent organizations, PTO, the special education pack.

72
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:05,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I also find ways to communicate technically as well.

73
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Recently, because we have a new

74
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:12,587
[SPEAKER_06]: role of student services.

75
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:21,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've taken everything not general education in North Andover and we've put it all under the same umbrella of student services.

76
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:31,271
[SPEAKER_06]: So in speaking with people about what student services are within our own community, I realized that many people didn't understand exactly what student services was.

77
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:39,012
[SPEAKER_06]: So I decided one of the best approaches would be to create a 30 minute show using the

78
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:43,234
[SPEAKER_06]: camera opportunities that we have the cable in our own town.

79
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:53,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So as much as maybe we don't enjoy seeing ourselves on TV all the time, I thought that was the best way to facilitate some knowledge with regard to the good work that we do within our schools.

80
00:06:54,497 --> 00:07:04,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So we most recently in this last week, we taped a show where I invited my director of social emotional learning and three of our therapists onto the show.

81
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And effectively what we did was number one, discuss what are some of

82
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:16,758
[SPEAKER_06]: the things that you would see in the home for your child if they're having some anxiety difficulties, they're experiencing school phobia.

83
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,118
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that look like?

84
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,059
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that present itself at different developmental ages?

85
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:25,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And then define some strategies that parents could utilize within their home.

86
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we can certainly tweet.

87
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: We can send out monthly and weekly newsletters.

88
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:36,123
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the most important thing in order to build trust and transparency is to

89
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:57,078
[SPEAKER_06]: see people in person, meet people, attend functions, communicate, set up meetings, whether it's with union representatives, walkthroughs in classrooms, sit down with students, see what they're doing, have conversations with them, enjoy the opportunities of our student representative to share with what's happening.

90
00:07:57,418 --> 00:08:00,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed you have a play going on, and that's pretty exciting.

91
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was able to speak with some of the students on the way in.

92
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

93
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:04,891
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

94
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any follow-up?

95
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:06,271
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

96
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:06,351
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

97
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:06,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

98
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:07,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

99
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:08,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

100
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:08,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Kreatz.

101
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:09,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

102
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:10,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

103
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:11,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to meet you, Dr. Strait.

104
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:11,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

105
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:12,313
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

106
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:12,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

107
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,975
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as you know, we have 18 approved vocational programs.

108
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:17,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

109
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:19,896
[SPEAKER_12]: How would you enhance the programs already in place?

110
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:24,678
[SPEAKER_12]: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?

111
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,761
[SPEAKER_12]: And where do you see the programs in three to five years?

112
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:28,681
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

113
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:34,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to see if I can write down all of the elements of your question.

114
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:34,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

115
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,165
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can repeat that.

116
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:36,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Please do.

117
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:36,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

118
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:37,507
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

119
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:42,670
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first part is, how would you enhance the programs already in place?

120
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,695
[SPEAKER_12]: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?

121
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:55,449
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

122
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And where do you see the programs in three to five years?

123
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:07,215
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

124
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:21,623
[SPEAKER_06]: First, what I'd like to say is I'd like to just compliment you on your capacity to have a high school that serves both your traditional college prep program for students, but as well as adapts the vocational component

125
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:30,500
[SPEAKER_06]: My personal children actually went through a high school that was both of those things, and it was just such a wonderful opportunity for all students.

126
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:51,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So with regard to enhancing the programs, I did a review of all of the programs that you have to offer currently, and I was quite impressed with the breadth of programming that you have, with the certifications that students are able to come out of the program with so they can obtain employment if that is something that they desire to do.

127
00:09:52,239 --> 00:10:03,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They can transfer those credits on to a two-year school, or a technical school, or even to a four-year school if they're taking some of the media or computer applications programs.

128
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:10,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think as far as enhancing the programs, it's always a nice idea to evaluate what you have in place.

129
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,672
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take a look at the types of programming you have, who's teaching those programs.

130
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:20,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they matching up to the current standards that we have?

131
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we currently implemented programs with regard to what our 21st century companies need right now?

132
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:31,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also look at asking companies.

133
00:10:31,888 --> 00:10:38,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes we go to a company or a business and we ask them, you know, what can you do for us?

134
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,072
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you help us build our robotics program or donate some computers?

135
00:10:43,532 --> 00:10:49,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a question in this case in order to enhance our programs would be, what do you need from our students?

136
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:59,053
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, how can we help and enhance our programs in order to ensure our students are meeting the appropriate levels of career choice that you need?

137
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:14,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So with regard to looking at the cutting edge of technology, again, I would want to understand what you have in place with regards to a technology plan, not just for our vocational center, but across our district and all of our schools.

138
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:16,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a plan in place?

139
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a five-year plan?

140
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:19,813
[SPEAKER_06]: What does our infrastructure look like?

141
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:26,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have the appropriate types of Wi-Fi and updated technologies in place?

142
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:35,480
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working with students in the 21st century who, you know, you see any children with tablets in their hands at a year and a half old.

143
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're really, their brains are developing differently and they're coming from a different place.

144
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:47,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would really be beneficial for us to really sort of rethink our approach to technology and how we're instructing students

145
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, that comes with a cost.

146
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:56,001
[SPEAKER_06]: And that cost needs to be spread out over time and balanced with all the other needs of both the school and the city.

147
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:06,189
[SPEAKER_06]: So programs in three to five years, it's really always hard to understand what the world is going to look like in three to five years in these days.

148
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,874
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would say relative to the programs you have in place, many of your programs are highly effective.

149
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:19,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you, but the last time I tried to find somebody to do HVAC in my home, it was nearly impossible to find somebody.

150
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:25,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's a wonderful opportunity to have for students in that area, as well as the construction sites.

151
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:33,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was also pleased to see that we're expanding it to include computer operations, media development, and all of those areas.

152
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:36,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I would see in three to five years is really a flexible plan.

153
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:44,848
[SPEAKER_06]: based on program assessment that we've done to understand what approach we're taking and where we're moving for our schools.

154
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:46,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

155
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:47,168
[SPEAKER_12]: That answers the question.

156
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

157
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:50,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have two questions?

158
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:50,830
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go around again.

159
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we'll go around again.

160
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:51,670
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

161
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

162
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Trevena.

163
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

164
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:54,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

165
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:54,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

166
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:04,318
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your plan to increase academic growth at each level of our educational system?

167
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:10,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, could you list your priority actions for each level, elementary, middle, and high school?

168
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:13,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, for the academic rigor, was your question.

169
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:29,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did a little digging into the data that I could find relative to Medford and what your trajectory is with regards to student performance.

170
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:35,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And overall, I was quite impressed with your per-pupil cost as well as your class size.

171
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's something that Medford should be very proud of.

172
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:47,977
[SPEAKER_06]: One area that I would want to focus on, and this would be across all levels, would be in the area of mathematics.

173
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:57,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed, and I know that you have a new math program that you've been working on and implementing, and that takes some time and some professional development as well.

174
00:13:57,543 --> 00:14:08,051
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would want to take a look at mathematics and how it's being implemented, how students are problem solving, looking at the types of things teachers might need with regard to that specific area.

175
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:27,488
[SPEAKER_06]: We've recently implemented Eureka Math in our district, and it was through a process of really analyzing multiple different types of mathematics programs that we compared to what the Common Core and Massachusetts curriculum units were in matching those standards to the programs.

176
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:36,655
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a process of a committee where we had different teachers in different schools try the different

177
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,641
[SPEAKER_06]: programs to see which one best met our students' needs and made a selection.

178
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:49,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're implementing it through a long process of professional development, ensuring all teachers and paraprofessionals have that specific area.

179
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:56,069
[SPEAKER_06]: With regards to if I looked at your middle school level, I think that's such an interesting and trying time.

180
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent 10 years in middle school as both a teacher and as a building administrator.

181
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:10,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I find really important in that specific area is really implementing some significant areas of social-emotional development.

182
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:18,863
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where the students grow quite frequently with regard to who they are as an individual, how they identify themselves.

183
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:25,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know if we look at the SEL competencies of self-awareness, self-reflection,

184
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:37,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Self-management, those are directly correlated to both an increase in students' IQs and an increase in students' competencies and graduation requirements.

185
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:46,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a particular area that I think I would like to look at a tiered system of supports in all the areas, if not across the district, but specifically there.

186
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,130
[SPEAKER_06]: With regard to your high school programming,

187
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:56,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that providing additional opportunities for advanced placement courses would be nice for students.

188
00:15:56,964 --> 00:16:00,065
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a nice array of advanced placement courses.

189
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:07,687
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would also want to look at how we could integrate and work with the many universities that are in our general area.

190
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:12,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Between Tufts universities, we have the community college.

191
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:17,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And how can we increase or assist our students, whether it's students who

192
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:41,433
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at differentiation of students' learning abilities, how are we able to connect kids to those different opportunities where they can either increase and go breadth and depth of what they're learning, or we can provide them some additional resources to improve or remediate some specific areas that they might need.

193
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:45,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also want to take a look at how we're providing inclusion

194
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:53,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I think inclusion, based on the research we know, is really a precursor to student success.

195
00:16:54,189 --> 00:17:01,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would want to take a look at co-teaching models and the types of instruction that would be appropriate for those students.

196
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:15,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had some extensive experience in working with inclusion and implementing different curriculums and bringing in students from out of district so that we can improve their learning within their home district as well.

197
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

198
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:16,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

199
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:17,393
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

200
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:18,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

201
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:19,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Ruggiero.

202
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:25,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Stray, as I was reviewing your resume, your special education work really stood out to me.

203
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:33,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like you to describe the most difficult dilemma you faced when you were managing the special education department in Andover.

204
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you address that challenge,

205
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like you to focus on three specific areas for me.

206
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:40,935
[SPEAKER_05]: First, what made your decision challenging?

207
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, what interests were pitted against each other?

208
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:52,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And third, ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of your decision to move forward?

209
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:04,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the decisions, that's what made the decision challenging.

210
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Interests pitted against each other.

211
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Ian, what was your third?

212
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:15,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of this decision?

213
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:21,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great question.

214
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:45,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if we're thinking about special education, I think most of us realize that about 25% in any school district of your budget is spent on your special education students, whether that's your out-of-district placements, the staff that are teaching your students within district, your transportation, your home services.

215
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:49,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It really encompasses about 25% of your overall budget.

216
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:55,396
[SPEAKER_06]: My personal belief and my core values are that our children

217
00:18:56,058 --> 00:19:03,404
[SPEAKER_06]: have an inherent right to be within their own school system, within their own neighborhood, and to be with their own families and friends.

218
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:15,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the basis for which I try to make decisions and I try to implement programming, look across the district, look at vertical alignment of what we can do to help our students and keep our students where they belong.

219
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:22,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say for me, a challenging decision was in coming to North Andover,

220
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:24,817
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a wonderful school district.

221
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:37,649
[SPEAKER_06]: What I saw happening was they didn't have what I would consider a consistent, vertically aligned social-emotional program.

222
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:44,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Over 40% of our audit district students were because of social-emotional issues.

223
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:48,319
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fairly significant when you're looking at a budget.

224
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So my thought was, what can we do to improve this?

225
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:57,382
[SPEAKER_06]: What can we do to bring students back into our district and provide them with the appropriate services?

226
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:18,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So the decision was challenging in the sense that oftentimes, I find that staff and sometimes administrators don't necessarily feel that they have the appropriate background or knowledge base, that they feel that they can meet the needs of students.

227
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:28,725
[SPEAKER_06]: who are either having anxiety disorders, depression, or some of the behavioral challenges, because we know anxiety can come out in many different ways, including behavioral ways.

228
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:39,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was really talking to the leadership team, sharing what my idea or my proposal was for what these programs would look like, both from Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3.

229
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:41,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tier 1 being the 80% of what most people need.

230
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:48,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Tier two is sort of your at-risk model of what we can do to help kids and sort of bring them along.

231
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:59,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And tier three is really those kids that have significant issues, whether it's suicidal ideations, whether they're placed out of district behavioral challenges, and how can we help all of those students.

232
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:13,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So in addition to creating a plan and looking at how the implementation was, it was really evaluating who the staff were going to be to meet the needs of those students.

233
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:17,815
[SPEAKER_06]: and to meet the needs of the staff as well.

234
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:24,439
[SPEAKER_06]: So the interests, obviously, that were pitted against each other was the money, right?

235
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:42,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I looked at my plan, I felt that one of the first things I felt that we needed was a director of social emotional learning, somebody who had been a psychotherapist, who had worked outside of the public setting and in the private sector, and had worked with students with these significant details who could come in.

236
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:47,180
[SPEAKER_06]: and sort of help us tease out exactly what we needed to do and put the right things in place.

237
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:58,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I also felt that we needed some therapists in the programs so that the students were able to access true therapeutic, cognitive behavior therapeutic components.

238
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:13,594
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as working with outside agencies to bring some of those people in at no cost to the school district to provide some of those services to our tier two students as well or those occasional students who just have their moments of difficulties.

239
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:23,258
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the interest pitted against us was financial and the other piece was really in creating, like most schools, you know, we have a space problem.

240
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So really saying, okay, here's the type of

241
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,400
[SPEAKER_06]: space we need for these programs.

242
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,561
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we work together to make that happen in each of our schools?

243
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:45,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the negative consequences, I guess, I think if I were to think about how to do that more broadly, I would bring additional stakeholders into the conversation.

244
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:55,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Initially, I brought it to the CPAC and had conversations with the CPAC about the types of programming and changes and challenges we're having and how we wanted to change it.

245
00:22:55,435 --> 00:23:06,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what I would have done was broaden that scope, too, and bring additional parents in, gone to PTO meetings, had some conversations maybe with the FinCom so that they can understand it.

246
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:09,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the difficult pieces are the intangible monies.

247
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:16,661
[SPEAKER_06]: When you bring students back, you don't understand necessarily the intangible money that that can produce.

248
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can support the additional staff so that it's cost neutral.

249
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:26,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really the key when you're doing this work, is to make a cost neutral, because we don't want to have to increase our costs.

250
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:32,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to make sure people understand that we're not pitting general ed against special ed, for example.

251
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're really working for the benefits of all students.

252
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:51,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to get more, to get to know you a little bit more.

253
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:51,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

254
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:59,580
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'd like to know what are the core values that define you in your work and how do they affect the way you do your jobs as an administrator and a leader?

255
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

256
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's highly important.

257
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:15,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So my core value is always what can we do for the best of students and how can we look at children as a whole child, not just as a student that we want to achieve academically, which of course we want to do.

258
00:24:16,636 --> 00:24:18,717
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I do that and how do I implement that?

259
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I gain trust with people.

260
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:27,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I were to become the Medford superintendent, one of the first things I would want to do is an entry plan.

261
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:37,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that entry plan, I would define key stakeholders that I would want to go and visit and meet and start engaging in transparent discussion with regard to building trusting relationships.

262
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we can move forward without trusting relationships.

263
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:45,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also want to ensure that people understood that I meant what I said.

264
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:55,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I told you I was going to do something, you could certainly count on the fact that that's exactly what I was going to do, and I would show it to you in any number of ways.

265
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:58,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I also value the input of others.

266
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:07,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm looking at implementing a program, developing a program, considering ways that I can collaborate with the

267
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:14,455
[SPEAKER_06]: other city departments, what I want to do is bring those people in and have those collegial conversations.

268
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:25,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to surround myself with people who have different strengths than the strengths that I have and that I would share, build those defining relationships so that we can move forward together.

269
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:34,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's lots of different building projects and needs in the city of Method right now, and that's a competing interest.

270
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:44,600
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when you consider the library, the fire department, the police department, and certainly when you consider what we want to do for our high school and our vocational schools.

271
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do we sit down as a team and build trust and transparency and work together in a collaborative effort?

272
00:25:51,364 --> 00:26:01,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are really my core values, always looking at what can we do for the benefit of our students' success and to develop the whole child so that they are ready

273
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: of the world that they're going to face, a world that we don't necessarily even know what it's going to look like in 10 years, as well as ensuring that we're meeting the needs of the city.

274
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:13,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

275
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:13,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

276
00:26:13,787 --> 00:26:14,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Russo.

277
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:15,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

278
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:16,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

279
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:18,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael stole my first question.

280
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:19,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

281
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:19,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

282
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It was bound to happen.

283
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it was bound to happen.

284
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:29,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you're skeptical and why?

285
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:34,542
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

286
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:56,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I were to say what I believe would be popular today,

287
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,205
[SPEAKER_06]: would be a one-on-one computer initiative.

288
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:11,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, that's not to say that I don't support technology for our students, because I most certainly support technology, not just for our students, but for our teachers as well.

289
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:21,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, as I stated earlier, we know that our students are coming into us capable of more with technological devices than, well, certainly than I am.

290
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:24,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to learn, but certainly than I am.

291
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: fallacy maybe of the skepticism comes from just the capacity of placing the laptop, the computer, having those devices in the classroom, and just naturally assuming that our teacher's instruction is going to change because it's there, or because they have a model classroom, or they have a whiteboard in place that they're able to use.

292
00:27:53,533 --> 00:28:15,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that without the appropriate implementation plan thoughtfully written out, the professional development plan written, and ensure that we provide that professional development with follow-up and modeling, ensuring that our infrastructure is appropriate and can support the type of teaching that we want to do with technology,

293
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:26,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be skeptical that something like a one-on-one initiative would be beneficial or would work, and it wouldn't be just another way for students to take notes.

294
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:28,778
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

295
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:29,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

296
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:30,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Paul.

297
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:36,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you describe your direct involvement with crisis management and threat assessment?

298
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly.

299
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,781
[SPEAKER_06]: That's certainly something that's on the forefront of all of our minds these days.

300
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:45,582
[SPEAKER_06]: We've certainly heard so many horrible stories for years now.

301
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,421
[SPEAKER_06]: both in our public schools as well as just any public place that you could be.

302
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:57,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that there should be layers of crisis teams.

303
00:28:57,663 --> 00:28:59,543
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have a district crisis team.

304
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:06,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And that crisis team is really looking at what are the appropriate policies and procedures, protocols that we should have in place.

305
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:15,847
[SPEAKER_06]: What is our working relationship with the police and fire department, who should also be part of our district level crisis team.

306
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,173
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that look like?

307
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:20,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we implemented something for our teachers?

308
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:43,242
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, I find that the ALICE program is especially appropriate, and it takes us away from those days of, you know, hide in place, and, you know, we know the stories where then students are kind of sitting ducks for, you know, situations that occur, and moving away from using the code blue and code red, but actually saying, you know,

309
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:45,318
[SPEAKER_06]: where the threat may be.

310
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:51,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people who are nowhere near there can provide some assistance to their students in getting out of the building.

311
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:57,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think that each school building should also have its own crisis team.

312
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,029
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be assigned.

313
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:12,019
[SPEAKER_06]: They should know what their specific roles are, whether they're the communicators, whether they're checking on the teachers and the status of the students, whether they're the person that's the liaison with the police and fire department when they show up.

314
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:17,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And these all should be practiced and understood, and they should meet on a regular basis.

315
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:22,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's just important that we look at this as a collaborative effort.

316
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:26,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also want to do some practice sessions with our students.

317
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:33,759
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're training your teachers and analysts, it can be very overwhelming for them because they've taken on a new responsibility.

318
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:41,720
[SPEAKER_06]: They are now potentially responsible for their students and their students' safety, which is both enlightening

319
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:47,023
[SPEAKER_06]: and empowering, but it can also be a frightening moment for teachers as well.

320
00:30:48,044 --> 00:30:52,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we should have some trainings and practices in those specific areas.

321
00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:02,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, it comes down to the policies, protocols, relationships with our police, fire department, as well as the appropriate professional development.

322
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:04,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

323
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:05,510
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

324
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know much about

325
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:27,050
[SPEAKER_10]: preschool education, except that it seems like a lot of front lines of newspapers is that four-year-olds should have a universal full-day program.

326
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,232
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know in Boston it's K1 and K2.

327
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:34,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about North Andover or if it's something you're interested in, if you think it's something we could do here.

328
00:31:34,856 --> 00:31:38,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I know parents have asked me quite often about a four-year-old program.

329
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:40,521
[SPEAKER_10]: So your thoughts, early childhood?

330
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:44,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a lot of experience in early childhood.

331
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:58,213
[SPEAKER_06]: When you work as the assistant superintendent of student services, part of your umbrella is that age three to five, early childhood, and working with early intervention aspect of it.

332
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:04,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I know in North Andover, we have a waiting list of over 100 students who would like to come to our preschool.

333
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:14,843
[SPEAKER_06]: If I bored you and talked all about the research that I've read with regard to the preschool, it would tell you that they absolutely would recommend a four-year-old program.

334
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,278
[SPEAKER_06]: for students.

335
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:36,983
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that the earlier we are able to get books in the hands of students, education for students, even something as allowing students to play, allowing students crayons to color, all of these different aspects really starts developing all of those fine motor skills, those gross motor skills.

336
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:45,065
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a connection to that to the brain development, which is connected to encoding and decoding and developing reading skills.

337
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:50,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So that said, yes, I 100% support having a four-year-old program.

338
00:32:51,032 --> 00:33:01,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also know that there's a budget, and we have to analyze the budget across the city and take a look at what is appropriate and what we can afford.

339
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:06,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it something that we want to offer where we can provide tuitioning students in?

340
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:13,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there other ways, creative ways, thinking outside the box of providing some activities for three and four-year-olds that

341
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:19,353
[SPEAKER_06]: can come to our schools, whether it's through relationships with our high school students.

342
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:24,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that high school students have to do 15 hours a year of volunteer work.

343
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:28,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And one positive benefit might be to do some of that play with students.

344
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's many different ways to look at it.

345
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:39,377
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's absolutely brain building and increasing students' IQ when they have the capacity to learn all of those skills at that young age.

346
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:40,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

347
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:41,158
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

348
00:33:41,738 --> 00:33:41,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

349
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:42,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Kritz?

350
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:43,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

351
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:47,577
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have kind of part two on my vocational question.

352
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:55,943
[SPEAKER_12]: How would you work with the school administration to continue to promote career and technical education in Medford?

353
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:57,784
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all.

354
00:33:58,364 --> 00:33:59,845
[SPEAKER_12]: There wasn't any other questions to that.

355
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:06,110
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

356
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So how would I work with the school administration to work together to promote career and technical education is your question?

357
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:12,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

358
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:16,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's nothing better than showboating what we have.

359
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:24,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, again, I go back to my 30-minute segment on cable news.

360
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:29,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently, my cable news friends told me you'd be surprised how many people actually watch those shows.

361
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:43,256
[SPEAKER_06]: So advertising that way, showing what kids can do, what they're creating, having a fair for particularly our middle school students to show what

362
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:46,459
[SPEAKER_06]: types of classes and what opportunities they might have.

363
00:34:47,059 --> 00:35:00,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Advertising, again, that you can come out with a certificate for going out and getting a decent paying job, if that's your goal, or it gives you credits for going to classes.

364
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:12,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that visiting other districts, having the capacity, I noticed that you're letting students from Everett tuition in now, and I think that's a fabulous idea, too.

365
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:28,040
[SPEAKER_06]: because it not only promotes and strengthens your program, but it also provides you with a revenue source that you can potentially expand your vocational program as well, and looking at what are some other areas that we can improve on and expand and offer for our students.

366
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:39,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think one thing we as school districts don't do, which is really advertise and promote ourselves and all the good work that we really do to the community.

367
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:42,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say that would be one of the best routes

368
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:48,952
[SPEAKER_06]: and really showcasing it to our students to ensure that our students stay here in Medford and attend our schools.

369
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:50,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

370
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,274
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

371
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:53,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Benedetto.

372
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

373
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:55,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey again.

374
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:56,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

375
00:35:57,717 --> 00:36:04,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So could you please elaborate on your experience with collective bargaining and a large scale budget development?

376
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:05,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

377
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:10,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the big school committee policies there.

378
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:37,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a variety of experience with collective bargaining in many of the different areas, both teachers bargaining, paraprofessional bargaining, custodial bargaining, different avenues.

379
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:45,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what I'd like to focus on with regard to collective bargaining is really the approach that you take to bargaining.

380
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,062
[SPEAKER_06]: The traditional method, which I've experienced most of the time up until recently,

381
00:36:52,631 --> 00:37:00,376
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really you get the two sides, the union side and the administrative side, and they're working at two different ends.

382
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:05,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We want this, we want that, and we don't want you to have whatever it is.

383
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:12,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And it tends to be one person from each side speaking, and the atmosphere tends to be more compatible.

384
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:21,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So recently, I've had the opportunity to work with interest-based bargaining, which is an opportunity to bring

385
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:24,287
[SPEAKER_06]: all collective brains together.

386
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:31,449
[SPEAKER_06]: You set standards as to what are we all interested in, what do we want from this union contract.

387
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:34,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's list what those things are.

388
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not talk about them.

389
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not talk about the impossibilities that we maybe think that they are.

390
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:42,953
[SPEAKER_06]: But what do we want together?

391
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:46,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, your teachers are going to list what they're looking for.

392
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:49,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the administrators are going to list what they're looking for.

393
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:57,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you move from there, and you start having discussions as to the rationale for each of those items and some clarifications.

394
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:00,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can ask clarifying questions.

395
00:38:00,184 --> 00:38:02,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, why is this something that's important to you in this?

396
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:04,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's talk about that.

397
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:10,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, you get to the resolution phase, where it has to be a unanimous resolution.

398
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:16,478
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have a whole team of people sitting around, able to speak and collaborate, share their ideas.

399
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,663
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no bad ideas.

400
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:21,223
[SPEAKER_06]: We put them all down on the table.

401
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:23,164
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all worthy for conversation.

402
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,365
[SPEAKER_06]: And then everybody gets a vote on it.

403
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:29,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has to be a unanimous vote in order for it to pass and be part of it.

404
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:41,632
[SPEAKER_06]: When we went through the training, because it requires a certain amount of training, you can't just dive right in and naturally assume this role, particularly when you're accustomed to the old standards of union bargaining.

405
00:38:43,332 --> 00:38:47,414
[SPEAKER_06]: My first thought in going through the training was, oh, good grief, this is going to take forever.

406
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:53,502
[SPEAKER_06]: because everybody was going to have all those conversations, and everybody was going to be able to say something.

407
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:56,223
[SPEAKER_06]: But that wasn't the way it was at all.

408
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:58,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually a fabulous process.

409
00:38:58,443 --> 00:38:59,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody felt heard.

410
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:01,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody felt equal.

411
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:06,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody felt like they had an opportunity to say what they wanted to and really justify it.

412
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:12,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it came to the very end of the contract, people walked out the door feeling good about it on both sides.

413
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And we felt comfortable, and we knew it was rational conversation.

414
00:39:17,136 --> 00:39:21,558
[SPEAKER_06]: And we knew that people were able to just really share what they had wanted.

415
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:24,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was highly, highly successful.

416
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've had a number of areas in collective bargaining.

417
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:36,745
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as budget development, I mean, again, I've worked as a special ed director and assistant superintendent for maybe eight years total.

418
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:44,809
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time, I also did six years on the finance committee, which gave me a broad perspective.

419
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:56,903
[SPEAKER_06]: on the budget across the towns, and the importance of the interconnection of the town budget with the school district budget, and the importance of collaborating.

420
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:08,193
[SPEAKER_06]: What we do, if we're focusing specifically on a school-based budget, as a superintendent, what I would do is pull my team together initially.

421
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:10,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We would review the strategic plan.

422
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we on the strategic plan?

423
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:14,518
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it we want for our students?

424
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,619
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we want our students to be able to do?

425
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:20,980
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it we're looking for for the next fiscal year with regard to our students?

426
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the basis of our decision making.

427
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:30,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So as an example, for North Andover for this year's budget, we went through that process.

428
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:38,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And that included our central office administration, our directors, our principals, our assistant principals having that conversation.

429
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:41,404
[SPEAKER_06]: We found that we had significantly high

430
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:53,019
[SPEAKER_06]: class sizes and we really needed to build a kindergarten building attaching it to our early childhood center in an effort so that we could lower our class size because we just had no room.

431
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:54,140
[SPEAKER_06]: We were out of capacity.

432
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:04,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had that conversation both at the administrative team as well as having that conversation with the town manager and the FinCom.

433
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them know what the direction we were heading in.

434
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of that issue was

435
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:13,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the bag of money we have.

436
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:19,908
[SPEAKER_06]: We have this percentage that we know we can increase over our budget from the previous year.

437
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:22,610
[SPEAKER_06]: How are we going to distribute and spend that money?

438
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's list our priorities on the wall.

439
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:28,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, after we were done listing our priorities on the wall, guess what?

440
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:35,415
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to support that new kindergarten building, because when you have a new structure like that, you're going to need custodial staff.

441
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:38,801
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to need additional kitchen help.

442
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:42,283
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to need another PE teacher, those types of things.

443
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:47,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really having those conversations and then looking at thinking of ways that we could find other monies.

444
00:41:47,786 --> 00:41:58,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did a huge Medicaid sweep where we ensured that all students that were eligible to the point where we visited people and said, hi, so we just want to explain Medicaid to you.

445
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:01,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And that by signing this document,

446
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:05,669
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in no way impacting your ability to get Medicaid for your child.

447
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:09,552
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just helping the school district get the money that is owed to it.

448
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:13,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So really being proactive, looking at grants and those types of things.

449
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:18,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So the other piece, again, of the budget development is how do you get support within your community for that?

450
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I go back to the transparency piece.

451
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:28,728
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going out into the community, going to the Chamber of Commerce, working with the FinCom, working with the mayor and the city council.

452
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:48,419
[SPEAKER_06]: going to the PTOs, engaging at the elderly center, just making sure that everybody in town, all the stakeholders, all of the constituencies truly understand the budget and truly understand what we're doing and why we're doing this for our children and why we want our children to be successful.

453
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

454
00:42:51,322 --> 00:42:51,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Ruggiero.

455
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:56,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Strait.

456
00:42:56,763 --> 00:43:08,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed the conversation, talking about community engagement and successful budgeting, which involves a lot of what I was going to ask you next.

457
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:10,110
[SPEAKER_06]: My answers are too long-winded.

458
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,211
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, they're perfect.

459
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:11,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

460
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: They're perfect.

461
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:13,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Speak as long as you like.

462
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:19,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really interested in this conversation about strategic planning and turning that into budgeting.

463
00:43:20,735 --> 00:43:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk specifically, if you could, about how you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts.

464
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:32,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So your team has come together, they've put together a strategic plan and a draft budget.

465
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:38,801
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you receive their input and how do you change the numbers based on that input?

466
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:43,003
[SPEAKER_05]: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?

467
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:48,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And how would you hold your administration responsible for maintaining that budget?

468
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:51,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, plans don't always work the way you think they will.

469
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:56,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you identify when things begin to go wrong in the budget and then address that problem?

470
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:57,676
Thank you.

471
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:02,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I will probably ask you to repeat some of that, but let me try and dive in there.

472
00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:08,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first question is, once we've established a strategic plan,

473
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:20,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And the elements of developing a district strategic plan really begin, I think, with the central office administration thinking broadly in terms of what do we think our students need.

474
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the case of this strategic plan I'm currently working in, we're looking at all students.

475
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:32,124
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we collectively ensure that all students are receiving the type of education that they deserve?

476
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:34,826
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at professional practice.

477
00:44:35,246 --> 00:44:37,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Professional practice includes having

478
00:44:38,888 --> 00:44:53,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Your teachers, your paraprofessionals, your parents, your principals, are they receiving appropriate professional development in order to ensure that curriculum and instruction are being done so that our students are learning?

479
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:56,894
[SPEAKER_06]: That we're not just delivering the curriculum, but our students are learning.

480
00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:02,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And the third piece of it that we're looking at is the social-emotional elements of it.

481
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:09,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I stated, that was a crisis in our district because over 40% of our district costs were relative to our social-emotional students.

482
00:45:10,258 --> 00:45:13,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And we knew that we could work with those kids in our own district.

483
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So we start with the core of what we believe based on the data that we've collected.

484
00:45:19,465 --> 00:45:22,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we broaden that to our leadership team.

485
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:24,729
[SPEAKER_06]: We meet monthly with our entire leadership team

486
00:45:25,712 --> 00:45:29,816
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the district, and we sort of put that up on the wall and say, okay, here's what we're thinking.

487
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:33,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about what our objectives are going to be and our strategic goals.

488
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And we develop that through a collaborative process.

489
00:45:37,763 --> 00:45:49,653
[SPEAKER_06]: The principals then take that back to their teams of teachers and they have that same type of conversation so that they can add their own relevance to that because teachers in the classroom really

490
00:45:50,026 --> 00:45:51,768
[SPEAKER_06]: have the greatest impact on our students.

491
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:52,708
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that.

492
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:56,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to know what they have to say with regards to that.

493
00:45:57,433 --> 00:46:02,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So once we have that final product, the important part then is going out and selling it.

494
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So we start with presentations.

495
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:06,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We do community presentations.

496
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:09,064
[SPEAKER_06]: We go to our various groups.

497
00:46:10,905 --> 00:46:13,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was driving with the superintendent one day.

498
00:46:13,948 --> 00:46:15,430
[SPEAKER_06]: We were going from point A to point B.

499
00:46:16,642 --> 00:46:20,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were discussing our strategic plan and the development of the kindergarten.

500
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:23,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a beautiful day out.

501
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:29,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And we saw over by the library just a horde of moms and baby carriages and little toddlers.

502
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:37,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So she pulled right over and immediately we jumped out of the car and we started telling these moms and

503
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:44,034
[SPEAKER_06]: with the toddlers all about the kindergarten that the children could go to and all about our strategic plan and what the importance of it was.

504
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:49,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really getting out there and communicating those pieces to ensure that everybody understands that.

505
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:52,541
[SPEAKER_06]: We also developed what we talked about as the elevator talk.

506
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:56,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're in an elevator and you're going up 10 floors,

507
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:07,583
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you say in a 10-floor speech that you're going to be able to disseminate that information to people so that they can walk away and have an understanding of what it is we're doing and why we're doing it?

508
00:47:07,603 --> 00:47:11,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And we practiced that, and we fine-tuned it, and it was fabulous.

509
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:15,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And what was the rest of your question?

510
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:20,215
[SPEAKER_05]: What resources in the community would you develop to augment limited funds?

511
00:47:21,454 --> 00:47:22,835
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that's a good question.

512
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So we obviously look toward our grant writing and ensure that we are meeting the needs of all of our grant writing.

513
00:47:29,317 --> 00:47:44,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I talked about going out to the community and really inquiring not just how can you help us and what can you do for us, but really reciprocating with what can we do for you and what do you want our students to walk out the door being able to do.

514
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:56,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think it's important to, because there's such a connection to the strategic plan and the finances, is really ensuring that everybody understands that and supports that piece of it.

515
00:47:56,509 --> 00:48:08,777
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think being visible as a superintendent and knowing people and being able to communicate those pieces, attending different events, whether it's Chamber of Commerce or Rotary, and really getting in there

516
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:16,370
[SPEAKER_06]: to gain that trust and that transparency with people really helps with that financing piece.

517
00:48:17,491 --> 00:48:24,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, what indicators do you look for to notice points where your plan is beginning to fail?

518
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:25,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you adjust them?

519
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:34,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what we always want to do is periodic measurements of our goals, looking at a strategic plan.

520
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:38,355
[SPEAKER_06]: As a superintendent, I would anticipate that my evaluation

521
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:53,920
[SPEAKER_06]: would be based on the goals of the strategic plan and what are our initiatives, what dates do we have written down for, you know, by this date we expect to have this done, by this date we expect to have that done, and really being able to measure that.

522
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:06,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I would meet with my team at least once a week to ensure that we're on the right track and where are they, what projects have they done, how are we moving along, how can I help you, what do you need to be successful,

523
00:49:06,812 --> 00:49:09,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I would anticipate that they would do that with their staff.

524
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:14,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So really collecting that data and analyzing it so that we can make those appropriate shifts as need be.

525
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:21,105
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I think the ultimate measurement would be when you as the school committee would say, where are you at the strategic plan?

526
00:49:21,345 --> 00:49:23,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And being able to measure that.

527
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:26,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

528
00:49:30,757 --> 00:49:34,658
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to pass over the question I planned at the moment just to be able to follow up on that.

529
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:39,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like you to speak more specifically to your experience in grant writing.

530
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:53,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a grant or grants you could tell us about that you identified and followed up with either, you know, with a group of people but that really you consider to be your success?

531
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:54,702
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, sure.

532
00:49:55,263 --> 00:50:03,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's all the standard grants, the federal grants that we can apply for, which naturally I do and am successful for.

533
00:50:03,727 --> 00:50:15,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But one grant in particular, which was a competitive grant I'll speak to, and that grant was in regards to working with developing some social emotional learning strategies

534
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:21,776
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that Massachusetts is now currently making standards in social-emotional learning.

535
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:24,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there are K to 3 standards that are written at this point.

536
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:28,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's an area that we have to go and we have to move towards.

537
00:50:28,923 --> 00:50:35,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like myself and my team have been on the forefront of that and really looking at what we need to do for students.

538
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:37,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a competitive grant out there for $30,000.

539
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:51,809
[SPEAKER_06]: that my team and I decided to take a look at and determine what was the criteria, what did we have in place, what did we need, and we wrote that grant and we actually were able to achieve that grant.

540
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:54,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that a grant from the DESC?

541
00:50:54,472 --> 00:50:54,692
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

542
00:50:55,132 --> 00:50:57,494
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this was a private grant that was out.

543
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:00,958
[SPEAKER_13]: How did you identify that grant?

544
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:19,019
[SPEAKER_06]: My director of social emotional learning, I asked her to do some digging into looking at grants and looking at possibilities of how we could connect with some outside agencies, some universities that are doing work, specific research in those particular areas.

545
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one grant that she was able to pull in.

546
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:29,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also been able to connect with some of the colleges and universities to bring some practitioners in, some of our

547
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:32,832
[SPEAKER_06]: therapists that are not quite licensed but need oversee.

548
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:36,978
[SPEAKER_06]: They come in and they work with our students as part of their college programming.

549
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,720
[SPEAKER_06]: We provide some mentoring.

550
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:45,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So really looking at some of the outside agencies and seeing what they have available and what we can go after.

551
00:51:45,129 --> 00:51:45,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

552
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

553
00:51:46,351 --> 00:51:46,831
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

554
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:51,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo.

555
00:51:52,032 --> 00:51:52,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, thank you.

556
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:58,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm struggling.

557
00:51:58,455 --> 00:52:00,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you all stop taking my questions?

558
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:03,617
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with you next time.

559
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:04,377
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's OK.

560
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:05,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

561
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:09,620
[SPEAKER_04]: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?

562
00:52:11,581 --> 00:52:15,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my answer to the three, four-year-old question,

563
00:52:17,025 --> 00:52:20,627
[SPEAKER_06]: think it's vitally important that our children get out and play.

564
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:27,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Play is developed socially, you develop physically, you develop creativity.

565
00:52:27,832 --> 00:52:37,819
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many aspects that children need in just being able to go out and imaginatively play with their peers, to run around, to investigate.

566
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:39,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's vital

567
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:51,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, what we find happens out of necessity is when you're looking at a tight budget, oftentimes some things that are caught, whether it's your PE or your art classes, things like that.

568
00:52:52,174 --> 00:52:59,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's vital that students have those opportunities to get out there and express themselves and move their bodies and develop their brains in that way.

569
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:05,337
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said before, it really is connected to so many levels of childhood development that it's key.

570
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to follow up on that.

571
00:53:08,164 --> 00:53:08,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

572
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:14,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think that recess has any place in the discipline system?

573
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Should recess ever be taken away for disciplinary reasons?

574
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:22,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's an interesting question.

575
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:34,064
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think anything can be used as a way of a learning tool.

576
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:46,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Would I blanketly say that you should discipline a child by taking away recess or taking away art or taking away that essay that you don't have to write anymore just for what you did?

577
00:53:46,572 --> 00:53:48,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say no.

578
00:53:50,493 --> 00:54:04,635
[SPEAKER_06]: If a child is having difficulties at recess, let's say, I'm just going to pretend that the situation is that the child is combative at recess, is involved in poor unstructured play.

579
00:54:05,253 --> 00:54:30,899
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would recommend is taking a look at and assessing what's happening with that child during their unstructured time, whether it be passing in the halls, lunchtime, or recess, and making a determination as to why is the child choosing to behave in a certain manner, and then implementing some lessons there, whether it's social skills that they need, practicing interacting with students of their own age, giving them stories for what appropriate play looks like.

580
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:33,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would prefer to look at it that way as opposed to just

581
00:54:35,578 --> 00:54:37,279
[SPEAKER_06]: punishment, an external punishment.

582
00:54:43,223 --> 00:54:47,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for your comments so far.

583
00:54:59,752 --> 00:55:06,094
[SPEAKER_02]: This question partly deals with your educational philosophy and partly with your implementation as a leader.

584
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:07,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

585
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:14,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Strait, do you see the school setting as a place for civic engagement for students to engage with communities as well as government?

586
00:55:15,176 --> 00:55:26,739
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, how would you continue to begin programs or policies, begin or continue programs or policies to promote civic engagement and learning, and if not, why?

587
00:55:29,645 --> 00:55:41,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So our school buildings are public buildings and are certainly open to the use for civic engagement, free speech.

588
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:57,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Within those confines, though, we also have an obligation to ensure that our students are safe, to ensure that our students are learning how to be appropriate,

589
00:55:57,702 --> 00:56:01,965
[SPEAKER_06]: global citizens, to understand diversity, to understand cultural competency.

590
00:56:04,347 --> 00:56:25,742
[SPEAKER_06]: So I support having classes and experiences, whether during the school hours or after school hours, when you're maybe working with a class advisor, where you're systematically able to engage in what your inherent rights are as an American citizen.

591
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:36,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that what I would want to see, again, is what are the learning outcomes?

592
00:56:37,715 --> 00:56:38,716
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we involved in?

593
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:40,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we involved in it?

594
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:51,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is it that I want to see you as a student come out understanding, knowing, being able to think critically, being able to respond as a competent global citizen?

595
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:55,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to follow up on that?

596
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:56,159
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

597
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:56,500
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

598
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,060
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.

599
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:57,501
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

600
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:57,901
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

601
00:56:58,482 --> 00:56:58,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin?

602
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:01,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a follow-up to that question.

603
00:57:02,105 --> 00:57:07,150
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see as the role of student leadership in shaping school policy?

604
00:57:09,432 --> 00:57:14,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, number one, I'm happy to see the both of you at the ends of the table here participating in this process.

605
00:57:14,617 --> 00:57:16,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's very appropriate.

606
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:21,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I think students have a good voice.

607
00:57:21,736 --> 00:57:34,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that when students are coming through the program that they understand what has happened to them personally in their experience as a student here in Medford.

608
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:40,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in some cases they understand what has happened to their friends' experiences here.

609
00:57:40,956 --> 00:57:47,260
[SPEAKER_06]: and that they have a voice and they have ideas as to how to change.

610
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:54,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say improve, but maybe change, modify, create other areas that they find more appropriate.

611
00:57:55,146 --> 00:57:59,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I might go back to the question with regards to technology.

612
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:08,315
[SPEAKER_06]: So my response may have shocked you when I said I don't necessarily believe in a one-on-one policy with regards to technology unless

613
00:58:09,471 --> 00:58:11,072
[SPEAKER_06]: you put certain things in place.

614
00:58:12,273 --> 00:58:24,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as a student, your voice is important so that you can share what those experiences are with the adults who are often sitting here making these decisions and having these conversations and discussing research.

615
00:58:24,641 --> 00:58:26,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But what is the practical experience?

616
00:58:27,402 --> 00:58:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it that you need that you should be able to have that discourse at the table to provide insight that we

617
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:39,484
[SPEAKER_06]: as adults a few years out of high school don't necessarily have anymore.

618
00:58:41,545 --> 00:58:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few.

619
00:58:44,426 --> 00:58:52,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you describe your management style and if you had a team to put together around you, what skills would they have to complement yours?

620
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:54,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's a great question.

621
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:59,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think obviously my management style centers on a collaborative management style.

622
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:02,375
[SPEAKER_06]: No single person can do everything by themselves.

623
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:13,004
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, I would also say that given ed reform, we really need to have a distributive leadership style as well in that.

624
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:27,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And with regards to that, what that does is actually allows the practice of leadership in complex systems, because we know principals have increased authority over their buildings.

625
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:29,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Under ed reform, we want them to have that capacity.

626
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:34,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would need to lead in that method as well.

627
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:45,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, when you're looking at a complex system such as this, a large school district with many layers, you want to have an adaptive leadership style.

628
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:54,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that does is it affords the opportunity for change, but it also supports people through that change, because we know change is hard.

629
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:58,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So how can we change and support people through it?

630
00:59:59,235 --> 01:00:02,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that what we want to have is people surviving that.

631
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:14,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I were to put together a team, I would want to look at surrounding myself with people who had areas of expertise that I do not necessarily have.

632
01:00:14,613 --> 01:00:18,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Such as?

633
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:19,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Such as, yes.

634
01:00:21,061 --> 01:00:26,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to get people, number one would be technology and the infrastructure.

635
01:00:26,983 --> 01:00:29,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I can speak in some terms.

636
01:00:29,324 --> 01:00:32,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that we need certain platforms.

637
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:34,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand we need certain equipment.

638
01:00:34,286 --> 01:00:37,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand we need to assess our infrastructure.

639
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:43,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I know exactly what types of things we need, what that implementation needs?

640
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:52,539
[SPEAKER_06]: How many years between having to rotate your laptops or your Wi-Fi or your cable systems?

641
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:54,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, don't know that.

642
01:00:55,261 --> 01:00:56,081
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we need it though.

643
01:00:58,943 --> 01:01:03,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also wanna look at having, I understand collective bargaining.

644
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:08,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I've certainly had to work through some tough and difficult evaluations.

645
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I've mentored principals.

646
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I've mentored teachers.

647
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm comfortable with all of those areas.

648
01:01:15,241 --> 01:01:19,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I know all the specifics of all of the laws with regards to human resources?

649
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:21,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

650
01:01:21,983 --> 01:01:25,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I would want somebody who has all of those details as well.

651
01:01:25,704 --> 01:01:33,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly know all the special education and 504 laws, but I would still want somebody surrounding me at this point who has the capacity

652
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:50,609
[SPEAKER_06]: to understand the need for developing vertical alignment in programs, has the understanding of implementing those, and has the understanding of assessing the data in the district to say, what is it that we need?

653
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:53,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, with curriculum instruction, it's always changing.

654
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,871
[SPEAKER_06]: How our students are learning is always changing.

655
01:01:57,331 --> 01:02:01,732
[SPEAKER_06]: What our students are requesting and the participation that they want is changing, so I would look

656
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:16,464
[SPEAKER_06]: to have somebody surrounding me that has experience in bringing the student voice to the table to the degree where maybe they've been that class advisor, and they've come up through the ranks where they've really brought that voice in.

657
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:22,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I can certainly go into schools, and I can sit with you at the table, and I can hear what your concerns are and talk about it.

658
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:29,368
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would want somebody who is on the ground doing that work specifically with you, gathering people together and having those areas.

659
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:31,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

660
01:02:32,797 --> 01:02:34,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to take a question?

661
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:43,321
[SPEAKER_13]: So Dr. Strait, I would like to know what being an educational leader means to you.

662
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:48,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue?

663
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:53,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, or and, if you could tomorrow, what would you like to address them on?

664
01:03:12,565 --> 01:03:25,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think to start, how I'm finding myself sitting here interviewing for the Medford School Superintendent is kind of an interesting path.

665
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:37,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was always interested in teaching, and I started my career as an engineer and decided, nope, what I really want to do is teach kids and be with kids, and I want to have an impact on the future.

666
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:38,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's where I went.

667
01:03:38,758 --> 01:03:43,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And I started in elementary, went to special education, taught at the middle school level.

668
01:03:44,823 --> 01:03:50,267
[SPEAKER_06]: During that time period, one of my children was highly allergic to mold.

669
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:54,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was before people knew about toxic mold and the impacts that it had.

670
01:03:54,971 --> 01:04:01,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a first grade student, he was in a very, very old building that was infested with black mold.

671
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:06,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And we knew that because he was sort of that canary down in the mine.

672
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:11,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he was the first one, I can't even tell you how many times he was hospitalized that year and all of that.

673
01:04:12,012 --> 01:04:17,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And then teachers would come whisper to me and tell me that, you know, about the mold and they would be chipping it off.

674
01:04:18,456 --> 01:04:25,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So that started my path down the road of saying, wait a minute, you know, we can do things differently or we can improve things.

675
01:04:25,641 --> 01:04:29,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ran for school committee to, you know, try and work some policies.

676
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:54,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And as part of a team of parents and the school committee, we went to the state legislation and talked about getting tools for schools and really assessing schools for a healthy environment, ensuring that students were going to a healthy environment and that they weren't allowed to just be sitting in schools that were making them sick and impacting their learning and impacting their health long term.

677
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:57,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I progressed through that,

678
01:04:57,955 --> 01:05:13,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I realized that I really enjoyed that capacity, so I sat on a school committee for six years, so I understand the pressures that you have working on a school committee and the impact of being out at the soccer game and people wanting to know different things that you can't tell.

679
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:25,422
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of the school committee, I also was a representative to the FinCom, so I was able to really understand the process of the monies and how that happened.

680
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:29,644
[SPEAKER_13]: And this took place when I was living in- Just FinCom is financial?

681
01:05:29,964 --> 01:05:31,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, yes, the finance committee.

682
01:05:32,545 --> 01:05:33,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

683
01:05:36,092 --> 01:05:38,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So really understanding the process of the money.

684
01:05:38,294 --> 01:05:40,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was living in New Hampshire.

685
01:05:40,956 --> 01:05:42,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is where this took place.

686
01:05:42,757 --> 01:05:48,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't have the same type of foundation budget that they have in Massachusetts.

687
01:05:48,621 --> 01:05:53,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really a poor system of prioritizing schools and the funds that they need.

688
01:05:55,046 --> 01:05:57,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my first step into the advocacy of it.

689
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:05,654
[SPEAKER_06]: In Massachusetts, I was part of DESE put together a committee of visiting colleges and universities

690
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:20,436
[SPEAKER_06]: They advertised for people who wanted to be part of that, so I was accepted to be part of the visiting team for going to colleges and universities and really analyzing their coursework for pre-service teachers and understanding what classes they were taking.

691
01:06:20,516 --> 01:06:21,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it appropriate?

692
01:06:22,497 --> 01:06:26,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it really meet the needs of what we're looking for for our teachers today?

693
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes it didn't.

694
01:06:30,408 --> 01:06:33,049
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have one class in special education.

695
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,110
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no classes in behavior management.

696
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,491
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nothing in understanding social needs of teachers.

697
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:47,813
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was part of beginning my advocacy with regards to changing the laws surrounding pre-service teacher education.

698
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:54,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Also as a special education director and assistant superintendent of student services,

699
01:06:54,628 --> 01:07:04,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes what we find is the private special education schools that are out there will ask the state to raise their tuition rates.

700
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:20,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So a group of other directors and myself got together and we moved forward to have those conversations with our legislatures and really explain that it really wasn't appropriate or fair that they were able to ask for

701
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:34,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I know in the case, and I won't name which school it was, they were looking for a 16% increase in their budget that was going to impact the tuition that we as districts were going to pay because they wanted to add guidance Councilors so they could have 1 to 10 guidance Councilors.

702
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:37,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're saying, we have 1 to 350.

703
01:07:37,404 --> 01:07:40,845
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not right.

704
01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:48,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So really having those conversations and changing the way that people are thinking with regard to that.

705
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:55,011
[SPEAKER_06]: if I could advocate for something now, if I were involved in it.

706
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:11,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, when I think about education for students, and again, I said that teachers are, you know, the direct line and the most important person to those students because they're in the classroom every day with them.

707
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:18,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I think about the stresses that the accountability of MCAS and the legacy MCAS and the new MCAS 2.0,

708
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:22,013
[SPEAKER_06]: is putting on both teachers as well as students.

709
01:08:22,613 --> 01:08:25,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would advocate for a different approach to that.

710
01:08:27,434 --> 01:08:33,396
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a couple of teachers last week crying about their MCAS portfolios.

711
01:08:34,456 --> 01:08:40,198
[SPEAKER_06]: You shouldn't have teachers crying in the hallways because they're afraid their MCAS portfolios aren't put together appropriately.

712
01:08:40,538 --> 01:08:43,919
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be in working with those students and helping their students.

713
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:48,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wonder, in addition to other societal

714
01:08:49,255 --> 01:08:58,622
[SPEAKER_06]: changes the impact of this added stress on our teachers and on our children and the impact that's having on our student learning.

715
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:01,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

716
01:09:01,505 --> 01:09:01,825
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

717
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:02,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

718
01:09:02,766 --> 01:09:03,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Rousseau?

719
01:09:08,515 --> 01:09:09,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you all set?

720
01:09:09,055 --> 01:09:09,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all set.

721
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,135
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

722
01:09:10,195 --> 01:09:11,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other questions on this side?

723
01:09:11,896 --> 01:09:12,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have one more question.

724
01:09:13,076 --> 01:09:13,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

725
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:19,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Another concern of many parents is the physical space in a capital plan for upkeep.

726
01:09:19,637 --> 01:09:23,298
[SPEAKER_10]: So our elementary schools and our middle schools are still new.

727
01:09:24,038 --> 01:09:24,999
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 13 years.

728
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:28,539
[SPEAKER_10]: But have you worked with the capital plan?

729
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:32,380
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you address the building needs, the upkeep, the maintenance?

730
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,241
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something that comes up often.

731
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:36,900
[SPEAKER_10]: with our buildings?

732
01:09:37,601 --> 01:09:39,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure does, most buildings.

733
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:50,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, one of the agencies that I've worked with is the Massachusetts School Building Association in my present district and in my previous district.

734
01:09:51,028 --> 01:10:01,534
[SPEAKER_06]: We've worked with them in developing, writing our application in order to either one, build a brand spanking new building that we did in my last district or

735
01:10:02,344 --> 01:10:11,793
[SPEAKER_06]: At present, we just completed our application for making additions and updates to our middle school.

736
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It is our most crowded building.

737
01:10:15,097 --> 01:10:19,081
[SPEAKER_06]: It really needs changes in the science labs and other specific areas.

738
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:25,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So really enhancing our application to hopefully obtain some of those funds.

739
01:10:26,337 --> 01:10:29,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Also part of your question, I think, centers on the upkeep.

740
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:33,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that comes to, again, a capital improvement plan.

741
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:34,704
[SPEAKER_06]: And what does that look like?

742
01:10:34,784 --> 01:10:39,228
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you correlate that with the needs of the town or the city?

743
01:10:39,288 --> 01:10:40,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And I reference that again.

744
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:42,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there's a lot of projects in town.

745
01:10:43,311 --> 01:10:53,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So really looking at a collaborative effort with the mayor, the city council, myself, school committee, and analyzing what would our plan be?

746
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,641
[SPEAKER_06]: What would that look like?

747
01:10:56,074 --> 01:10:57,455
[SPEAKER_06]: What are our greatest needs?

748
01:10:57,775 --> 01:11:07,420
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we implement that as we're developing a protocol for maybe bidding out for what we need for the technical school?

749
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,041
[SPEAKER_06]: What would the next step be in line?

750
01:11:10,501 --> 01:11:16,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we move forward, just really rotating that, because we always have to be not just mindful of the upkeep of the buildings.

751
01:11:17,765 --> 01:11:22,507
[SPEAKER_06]: We certainly want to ensure that they're clean and healthy, as I described in my last story.

752
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,614
[SPEAKER_06]: really making it affordable.

753
01:11:25,654 --> 01:11:27,615
[SPEAKER_06]: We want people to be able to stay in Medford.

754
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:33,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford has people that have been living here for a long, long time, many family members.

755
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:47,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to ensure that that stays the same, but we also need to ensure that our infrastructure is appropriate and is meeting the needs of our students and all of our fire, police departments and all of that.

756
01:11:47,498 --> 01:11:50,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So really looking at a plan and working collaboratively.

757
01:11:50,879 --> 01:11:52,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you part of the writing team for the

758
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Middle school application.

759
01:11:55,904 --> 01:11:56,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

760
01:11:56,184 --> 01:11:57,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a contributing member.

761
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:57,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

762
01:11:57,907 --> 01:11:58,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

763
01:11:58,288 --> 01:12:00,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Mr. Shiro

764
01:12:02,749 --> 01:12:11,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a certified teacher myself, and one of the things that I think about a lot is this idea of risk in education and trying experimental new ideas.

765
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:23,829
[SPEAKER_05]: On one hand, you want to try the most innovative approaches, but on the other hand, when you deviate from a known path, in some respects, you're risking educational time that will be lost on the student.

766
01:12:24,409 --> 01:12:34,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm interested in knowing about is tell us about the most innovative educational practice you've tried, something that was experimental.

767
01:12:35,336 --> 01:12:40,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like to know about some of the resistance you received from the community and how you went along implementing that plan.

768
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:43,902
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an interesting question.

769
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:56,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what I would share with you, and probably today you're going to say, well, that's not particularly risky.

770
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:59,105
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the time I implemented it, it was.

771
01:13:02,706 --> 01:13:12,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So as the assistant principal in a 1,400 student middle school, I was in charge of the special education department.

772
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:25,306
[SPEAKER_06]: grave concerns with regard to the fact that students were systematically sort of shuffled off into specific directions and teams.

773
01:13:26,587 --> 01:13:38,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, we know that best practice now we've learned is that students need to have access to the general curriculum, access to their regular peers, and that's going to improve their performance.

774
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:53,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought it would be a fabulous idea to put my special education teachers and my ELA English teachers, English and writing teachers, and my math teachers together.

775
01:13:53,409 --> 01:14:00,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would have two teachers in a classroom, about 25, 30 kids, and they would work together.

776
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:07,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So the issue of that was I didn't ask anybody else what they thought of that idea.

777
01:14:09,591 --> 01:14:12,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I also didn't ask the teachers what they thought of that idea.

778
01:14:12,553 --> 01:14:17,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, all right, Paulette, you and Paul are working together on math, and go enjoy that.

779
01:14:17,997 --> 01:14:23,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't realize Paulette and Paul, and I'm making this up, didn't really like each other.

780
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So that didn't go very well.

781
01:14:28,024 --> 01:14:30,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you're sitting next to each other, so you do.

782
01:14:34,449 --> 01:14:37,471
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had this conceptual idea in my head of how

783
01:14:38,044 --> 01:14:41,046
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we improve the education of our students?

784
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,928
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I made my master plan over the summer.

785
01:14:44,529 --> 01:14:45,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I assigned everybody.

786
01:14:45,509 --> 01:14:46,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I scheduled it.

787
01:14:47,511 --> 01:14:51,333
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a complete and utter disaster for those reasons.

788
01:14:52,814 --> 01:14:53,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Took a step back.

789
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:55,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Had to restructure it.

790
01:14:55,997 --> 01:15:05,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Had to think about actually rolling out and implementing an appropriate plan that included professional development, included people raising their hand saying, yep, I'm interested in doing that.

791
01:15:05,643 --> 01:15:06,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Sign me up.

792
01:15:07,014 --> 01:15:08,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to do it with that person.

793
01:15:10,095 --> 01:15:19,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So a year later, after really going through the appropriate motions of implementing a plan, implementing curriculum, it was a successful process.

794
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:29,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would always want to encourage teachers to take risks, because we do know that our students are different and think differently and behave differently than once upon a time we did.

795
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:34,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But doing it in a safe and secure and thoughtful manner is appropriate.

796
01:15:34,087 --> 01:15:35,968
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

797
01:15:37,296 --> 01:15:37,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Russo.

798
01:15:42,619 --> 01:15:52,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Teaching colleges, you did mention your work with Desi around, you know, what teaching colleges are really, how they're preparing teachers or often how they're not preparing teachers.

799
01:15:53,865 --> 01:15:57,347
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you systematize supports for new teachers in particular?

800
01:15:57,447 --> 01:16:02,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, of all the teachers I've spoken to, their first year is sort of like

801
01:16:04,096 --> 01:16:05,136
[SPEAKER_04]: a very bad memory.

802
01:16:05,516 --> 01:16:06,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they don't sleep.

803
01:16:06,717 --> 01:16:07,257
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

804
01:16:07,277 --> 01:16:07,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

805
01:16:07,737 --> 01:16:12,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just seems to me like a lot of that is just a lack of supports for them.

806
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:16,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So how would you systematize some supports for them?

807
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:23,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think a well-thought-out mentoring program would be appropriate.

808
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say well-thought-out, I would want something that was systematically put together and thoughtful with regard to

809
01:16:33,482 --> 01:16:48,605
[SPEAKER_06]: not just what are we going to do to support teachers and inform teachers, how are we going to have collegial conversations with teachers, how can they share in a safe manner problems of practice that they're having so they don't feel that somebody's going to judge them.

810
01:16:49,746 --> 01:16:55,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also want to think carefully about who their mentor teacher was.

811
01:16:56,849 --> 01:17:04,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen instances where a special education teacher has a physics teacher who's mentoring them.

812
01:17:04,116 --> 01:17:10,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And although they're both teaching, it's not necessarily the same.

813
01:17:10,922 --> 01:17:14,685
[SPEAKER_06]: The responsibilities of the jobs aren't necessarily the same.

814
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:23,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would really need to be matched up with somebody who had a similar experience and could really share some of those pieces, how to connect with families on a frequent basis.

815
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:30,891
[SPEAKER_06]: how to establish the team sitting around the table when you're having an individual education plan meeting, for example.

816
01:17:33,433 --> 01:17:46,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I might look at bringing research-based teaching in so that they have an understanding of some of the systematic research-based approaches and be able to have an understanding of that.

817
01:17:47,383 --> 01:17:52,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also want to ask them what they needed and who they needed from it.

818
01:17:53,945 --> 01:18:06,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think a lot of times what happens as teachers don't have that classroom management technique under their belt because it's not still definitely taught appropriately.

819
01:18:06,169 --> 01:18:18,013
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't understand necessarily how to meet the needs of students socially or emotionally and have some perhaps preconceived notions as to why a student is behaving in a certain way.

820
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So provide them with some opportunities, maybe have your

821
01:18:22,315 --> 01:18:32,362
[SPEAKER_06]: board certified behavior analysts or behavior specialists going into the classroom and doing some observations and giving them some feedback or doing some modeling for them.

822
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:35,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would do the same with reading specialists.

823
01:18:35,804 --> 01:18:40,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that you have reading specialists and directors of humanities that could help in those areas.

824
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:52,195
[SPEAKER_06]: So really doing some global planning as well and pinpointing the specifics of what the individuals need themselves as well in a safe manner where they don't feel they're being evaluated for their concerns.

825
01:18:53,203 --> 01:18:53,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

826
01:18:56,105 --> 01:18:56,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Venditto.

827
01:18:57,025 --> 01:18:57,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

828
01:18:59,586 --> 01:19:02,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So in our district, we have an alternative high school.

829
01:19:03,588 --> 01:19:12,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very separate from where we are here at this high school and our vocational high school are very close together.

830
01:19:13,773 --> 01:19:21,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you think of a few ways that we could open up our program to the high school and vice versa to have

831
01:19:22,253 --> 01:19:25,956
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure that those students feel like they are a true Mustang?

832
01:19:26,476 --> 01:19:26,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

833
01:19:28,337 --> 01:19:29,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

834
01:19:29,678 --> 01:19:38,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would want to visit that high school and understand, what is the entrance criteria?

835
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:42,447
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the exit criteria for those students in the high school?

836
01:19:43,508 --> 01:19:50,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed, I believe, there's 21 students there, if I'm correct, at the data that I reviewed.

837
01:19:52,515 --> 01:20:20,489
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it about those 21 students that we can't integrate them into a school or that we can't think in terms of a program within our high school and vocational school that would allow them not just access to what they need as far as their therapeutic needs or behavioral needs, but also access to all of the same types of curriculum and courses and voc opportunities that other students have?

838
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:31,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel that Medford was on the cutting edge of having a school to serve those students, because not all schools did that.

839
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:33,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Most schools would send the students away.

840
01:20:34,467 --> 01:20:41,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So I applaud the efforts of Medford in having that school, but I would want to really analyze and understand the elements of it.

841
01:20:41,789 --> 01:20:43,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, what is that entrance criteria?

842
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:45,410
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do students exit?

843
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:48,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there an opportunity for them to integrate back?

844
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:49,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do we do?

845
01:20:49,705 --> 01:20:53,908
[SPEAKER_06]: What have we put in place for plans for teaching them?

846
01:20:54,088 --> 01:20:58,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, self-awareness, self-management, self-responsibility, good decision making.

847
01:20:58,691 --> 01:21:03,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are all some of the SEL criteria that we need to teach students.

848
01:21:03,936 --> 01:21:11,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can measure those components as well to move them back in and give them those opportunities because we want them college and career ready as well.

849
01:21:13,143 --> 01:21:13,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

850
01:21:14,485 --> 01:21:22,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned a little earlier popping out of the car because you saw a group of, I'll use the moms, you said moms, and children playing by the library or whatnot.

851
01:21:22,968 --> 01:21:28,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So Medford's first language spoken at home, for those not being English, is 23.6%.

852
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,632
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 34% minority in the high school from a student base.

853
01:21:33,272 --> 01:21:40,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be your framework for community engagement knowing that that's the audience that you have to serve and you have to communicate with them?

854
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think what I would do is,

855
01:21:45,899 --> 01:21:47,740
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always church groups.

856
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,982
[SPEAKER_06]: There's library groups.

857
01:21:50,102 --> 01:21:53,884
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other cultural groups.

858
01:21:54,104 --> 01:21:58,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would want to find ways to be able to integrate myself into those opportunities.

859
01:21:59,668 --> 01:22:09,714
[SPEAKER_06]: In some cases, you may need to rely on a translator, because a lot of people, as you say, are not speaking English as their first language.

860
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:15,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody that could help you interpret or answer questions or share the knowledge about the schools

861
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:24,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to be visible and accessible as a school superintendent in order to share the good word and the good work of what we do.

862
01:22:25,046 --> 01:22:29,249
[SPEAKER_06]: So really integrating myself within the community and all of the different aspects of it.

863
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:31,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

864
01:22:31,091 --> 01:22:31,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow up?

865
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:37,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to ask also about discipline, because I don't think we've asked a lot of those questions so far.

866
01:22:37,216 --> 01:22:41,880
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to give you a hypothetical situation, and I'd like to hear how you could address it for us.

867
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:42,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get my pen out.

868
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:43,101
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

869
01:22:45,245 --> 01:23:03,019
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like you to imagine a student who has filmed a teacher without the teacher's consent or knowledge and puts an inappropriate but not terrible voiceover over this YouTube video.

870
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:08,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So something that isn't inflammatory but something that is not really appropriate.

871
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:10,205
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you address that situation?

872
01:23:12,751 --> 01:23:17,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's assume this student has some discipline issues in the past, but nothing serious.

873
01:23:18,015 --> 01:23:19,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar sorts of problems.

874
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:19,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

875
01:23:20,957 --> 01:23:22,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just tell the principal to handle it.

876
01:23:22,558 --> 01:23:23,839
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

877
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:25,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So that said, so, you know,

878
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:45,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I would guess that the teacher's going to be upset about it because they're going to feel that their rights have been violated.

879
01:23:45,524 --> 01:23:55,029
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been filmed without their permission, which we know is something that you can't do, and put it on YouTube or whatever else.

880
01:23:55,069 --> 01:23:57,130
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's going to be that concern.

881
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:00,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That would require some conversations with the union.

882
01:24:01,592 --> 01:24:07,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they would want to get involved, and they would want to have some discussions relative to policy if there aren't policies in the school handbook.

883
01:24:08,804 --> 01:24:11,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be one area that I would be focusing on.

884
01:24:11,585 --> 01:24:21,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also, you know, we would look at what, if any, technology policies and use policies we have and did the student violate that.

885
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, it would have to immediately come down off of YouTube.

886
01:24:24,951 --> 01:24:27,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anything can forever be off of YouTube.

887
01:24:27,473 --> 01:24:28,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

888
01:24:28,853 --> 01:24:30,154
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I need that IT guy.

889
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:36,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would look at that aspect.

890
01:24:36,981 --> 01:24:48,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think that with regard to discipline, again, of course, we always, you know, the same thing with taking recess away, you know, what is the learning opportunity here for the student?

891
01:24:49,552 --> 01:24:56,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And what does the handbook and what are our school policies with regard to the discipline that would take place for that student?

892
01:24:57,116 --> 01:25:05,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really policy driven in a lot of ways, but then there's also the emotional side effect of it for specifically the teacher and how we would manage that.

893
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And were there any updates to policy that we needed to include there?

894
01:25:12,283 --> 01:25:13,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin, last question of the night.

895
01:25:15,204 --> 01:25:16,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Paulette has one more.

896
01:25:17,085 --> 01:25:17,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin.

897
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as you know, we live in a diverse community and in a globalizing society.

898
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:35,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Our students come from all over the world, and after they leave high school, they end up in different countries, studying different countries, working in different countries.

899
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you build a global connection between the Medford Public Schools and the world as a whole?

900
01:25:42,995 --> 01:25:44,075
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great question.

901
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:47,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one thing that we've done

902
01:25:49,232 --> 01:25:55,857
[SPEAKER_06]: in North Andover, specifically, is we have made a connection with a sister school in China, for example.

903
01:25:56,778 --> 01:26:01,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've sent some of our administrators over there a couple of years ago to meet with those administrators.

904
01:26:02,162 --> 01:26:06,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we're exchanging students to do a student exchange so that they have those opportunities.

905
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:08,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would want to open up that opportunity.

906
01:26:10,261 --> 01:26:12,242
[SPEAKER_06]: further to do exchange students.

907
01:26:12,922 --> 01:26:28,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I think also if we were to take a look at what our humanities curriculum was, how are we integrating that knowledge into the learning of our students at the various levels, all levels really.

908
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:37,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Do our students understand what, do our teachers and our administrators understand what cultural competency is?

909
01:26:38,056 --> 01:26:39,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Can they articulate it?

910
01:26:39,837 --> 01:26:44,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they understand how it applies to the work that they do and to their daily lives?

911
01:26:44,659 --> 01:27:05,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I know for myself, one of the first courses that we took during our doctoral work was understanding ourselves as a cultural being, and we had to pick certain elements of who we were, research that, investigate that, and say, well, how did that impact my life and who I am as a person?

912
01:27:06,462 --> 01:27:08,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a very interesting experience.

913
01:27:09,543 --> 01:27:16,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Beyond that, what we had to do then was expand that to really understand other people's experiences.

914
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:21,665
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it like to be this type of person and engage in those conversations?

915
01:27:22,225 --> 01:27:34,527
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would want to really analyze and look at what's happening within our schools with regards to developing that understanding, and then reach out to the greater global community as to how we can do some exchanges.

916
01:27:36,596 --> 01:27:36,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

917
01:27:39,409 --> 01:27:46,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Strait, when we put together the application, I kept on thinking that we really ought to put one of those warning boxes.

918
01:27:47,255 --> 01:27:51,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And the warning box would say that our current superintendent is available 24-7.

919
01:27:51,459 --> 01:27:55,822
[SPEAKER_13]: And he works around the clock, and we can always get him.

920
01:27:56,022 --> 01:27:58,124
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's been on vacation.

921
01:27:58,204 --> 01:28:01,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I've talked to him when he's on vacation, which is a rarity.

922
01:28:02,207 --> 01:28:07,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And frankly, quite honestly, we're just used to that accessibility to our superintendent.

923
01:28:08,172 --> 01:28:09,993
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to warn you, OK?

924
01:28:10,413 --> 01:28:12,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to thank Superintendent Bellison for that.

925
01:28:14,696 --> 01:28:15,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

926
01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:20,259
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want you to understand what our expectation is.

927
01:28:20,619 --> 01:28:28,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Because quite honestly, no joking aside, that really is quite a difficult place to follow on.

928
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:34,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Having said that, I'd like you to know what you do for fun, and what you do in your way, and how you de-stress.

929
01:28:37,642 --> 01:28:37,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

930
01:28:38,462 --> 01:28:39,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you stumped me on that one.

931
01:28:41,503 --> 01:28:49,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So as an assistant superintendent, I work all hours, long hours.

932
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:51,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I work weekends.

933
01:28:52,365 --> 01:28:57,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I know part of the job is investing in the community and in attending community events.

934
01:28:57,606 --> 01:28:59,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of those take place at night.

935
01:28:59,207 --> 01:29:00,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those take place at weekends.

936
01:29:00,747 --> 01:29:04,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of your union negotiations take place in the evening.

937
01:29:05,987 --> 01:29:11,269
[SPEAKER_06]: phone calls from my staff or text messages from people all the time.

938
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:19,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not unaccustomed to that level of work and engagement.

939
01:29:20,133 --> 01:29:28,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I do for fun, I'd like to say that I exercise, but it's probably been four months since I've hit the gym, so I'm not going to say that.

940
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:31,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I do enjoy reading.

941
01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:35,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoy spending time with my children.

942
01:29:35,584 --> 01:29:40,926
[SPEAKER_06]: My children are all grown and out of the house and gainfully employed, yay me.

943
01:29:41,826 --> 01:29:48,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So I enjoy spending time when I have the opportunity to do that with my children and my friends.

944
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:55,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be it, actually, because I just don't go to the gym anymore.

945
01:29:55,296 --> 01:29:59,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

946
01:29:59,299 --> 01:30:00,099
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

947
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:02,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much for the time you spent with us.

948
01:30:03,301 --> 01:30:06,764
[SPEAKER_01]: We greatly appreciate it, and we'd like to just allow you to have some closing remarks.

949
01:30:07,024 --> 01:30:07,724
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.

950
01:30:07,964 --> 01:30:08,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

951
01:30:10,686 --> 01:30:16,690
[SPEAKER_06]: For my closing remarks, the first thing I'd like to do is just really thank you for the opportunity to be with you this evening.

952
01:30:17,490 --> 01:30:19,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate all of your questions.

953
01:30:19,251 --> 01:30:21,833
[SPEAKER_06]: They were quite thoughtful, some quite lengthy.

954
01:30:24,374 --> 01:30:38,083
[SPEAKER_06]: As I think about the data and the research that I've done on Medford and the comfort that I feel sitting here and in my first interview, I feel like my skill set really matches some of the areas of need that I see that you have.

955
01:30:38,677 --> 01:30:50,544
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, your question relative to the students in their own high school and how can we bring them back, that is a huge initiative and passion of mine is having accessibility for all students.

956
01:30:50,944 --> 01:30:59,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have a very great experience in developing vertical teams for social-emotional development across all students.

957
01:31:00,449 --> 01:31:03,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I've implemented a new math curriculum, and I see that

958
01:31:04,318 --> 01:31:09,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of your areas of improvement you could utilize would be in the specific math area.

959
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:18,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have, as I discussed, some experience with regard to infrastructure working with the Math School Building Association.

960
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:20,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that's a huge initiative as well.

961
01:31:21,368 --> 01:31:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank you again.

962
01:31:23,249 --> 01:31:24,789
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a wonderful opportunity.

963
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:26,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish you luck on your search.

964
01:31:27,351 --> 01:31:28,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish seniors luck on

965
01:31:29,602 --> 01:31:33,590
[SPEAKER_06]: your finals, and you're lucky all the snow days this year.

966
01:31:34,993 --> 01:31:35,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

967
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:36,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Dr. Straton.

968
01:31:36,697 --> 01:31:37,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

969
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:37,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

970
01:33:38,456 --> 01:33:38,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like.

971
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:13,310
[SPEAKER_08]: You have more?

972
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:40,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have to find you to get more.

973
01:43:40,712 --> 01:43:40,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Russo.

974
01:43:47,657 --> 01:43:50,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now going to welcome Dr. John Perrella to our interview process.

975
01:44:20,486 --> 01:44:21,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Dr. Perrella.

976
01:44:22,026 --> 01:44:22,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

977
01:44:24,047 --> 01:44:24,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

978
01:44:25,827 --> 01:44:29,808
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, we'd like to open it up for just opening statements, if you'd like to get started.

979
01:44:30,008 --> 01:44:30,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

980
01:44:30,328 --> 01:44:35,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to begin with an appreciation and thank you for this opportunity.

981
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:41,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to be here and extremely excited about the conversation that we'll have take part in tonight.

982
01:44:46,832 --> 01:44:49,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2012, I have been the headmaster of Medford High School.

983
01:44:50,953 --> 01:44:57,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the past six years, this complex has undergone tremendous yet quiet transformation.

984
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:02,777
[SPEAKER_00]: We have expanded educational opportunities for all students.

985
01:45:04,397 --> 01:45:19,102
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this through our partnerships, through Boston College and Harvard University and Tufts University, through our expanded opportunities for students to take advantage of the Middlesex Fells Reservation and engage in stewardship

986
01:45:20,609 --> 01:45:21,890
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this through our integration.

987
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:34,678
[SPEAKER_00]: The integration process itself has allowed the Medford public school system to regain over a million dollars that was lost to Minuteman Lexington schools.

988
01:45:35,398 --> 01:45:44,344
[SPEAKER_00]: We've since, in the past year and a half, added over 300,000 in resources and revenue because of our integration.

989
01:45:45,458 --> 01:45:49,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Integration goes way beyond two buildings coming together, however.

990
01:45:49,539 --> 01:45:58,301
[SPEAKER_00]: It also includes English learners, special education students, who are not included, but they're integrated into our school.

991
01:46:00,341 --> 01:46:11,084
[SPEAKER_00]: During the past six years and under my leadership, we've established a trusting and caring culture where all stakeholders, all students, receive exquisite respect.

992
01:46:11,764 --> 01:46:13,204
[SPEAKER_00]: They are listened to and they are valued.

993
01:46:16,138 --> 01:46:17,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very proud of the past six years.

994
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:20,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you this tonight for two reasons.

995
01:46:20,483 --> 01:46:29,372
[SPEAKER_00]: One, because it is an example of how I would lead the school system, as well as a model of my style and my approach.

996
01:46:30,654 --> 01:46:33,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the conversation tonight with all of you.

997
01:46:34,017 --> 01:46:34,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

998
01:46:34,678 --> 01:46:35,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

999
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:37,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Russo.

1000
01:46:39,377 --> 01:46:41,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to go first so that nobody steals my questions.

1001
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,340
[SPEAKER_04]: What was my number four question, sorry.

1002
01:46:47,581 --> 01:46:54,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't prepared for you to point to me.

1003
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:56,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just go with the question, my number two question.

1004
01:46:57,925 --> 01:47:02,627
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you're skeptical and why?

1005
01:47:10,086 --> 01:47:16,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of discussion right now regarding start times, when students can come into school and when they should leave school.

1006
01:47:16,948 --> 01:47:22,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a lot of consideration for allowing students to come in at later times.

1007
01:47:23,410 --> 01:47:27,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that as not that I'm against it, but actually I'm interested in it.

1008
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:37,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there has been some pushback in the belief that students who do come in at later times, there is no significant increase in their learning capacity.

1009
01:47:38,254 --> 01:47:42,978
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think it goes beyond just coming in later, but just expanding learning throughout the day.

1010
01:47:43,518 --> 01:47:46,601
[SPEAKER_00]: So expanding learning opportunities into the afternoon and into the evening.

1011
01:47:47,162 --> 01:47:59,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I'm concerned about is the restrictions we place on education for students and how we sort of structure it in a way that is only from 8 to 2.30 for eight months out of the year.

1012
01:47:59,352 --> 01:48:01,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that does a disservice to students.

1013
01:48:01,914 --> 01:48:06,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to go beyond that and consider alternative ways to meet student needs.

1014
01:48:15,012 --> 01:48:18,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Perella, decision-making is a two-edged sword.

1015
01:48:18,695 --> 01:48:24,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Some situations call for decisiveness right at the start while others involved consensus building.

1016
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:28,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell us about a situation where you were decisive and how it worked out for you.

1017
01:48:28,863 --> 01:48:32,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Then tell us about the time when you weren't decisive enough and what you learned from it.

1018
01:48:34,963 --> 01:48:35,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Paulette.

1019
01:48:36,624 --> 01:48:41,568
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that have been a really exciting opportunity for me the past six years is to learn how to lead.

1020
01:48:42,149 --> 01:48:46,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've learned this specifically from the superintendent.

1021
01:48:47,073 --> 01:48:59,864
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the lessons I've learned, the strongest lesson I've probably learned, is that we had an event a few years back where there was a hijab day discussion, or an idea to celebrate hijab day.

1022
01:49:00,885 --> 01:49:04,046
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that instance, I acted.

1023
01:49:04,386 --> 01:49:05,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was a great idea.

1024
01:49:05,726 --> 01:49:08,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the students had meaningful reasons behind it.

1025
01:49:08,887 --> 01:49:10,147
[SPEAKER_00]: It was empowering of students.

1026
01:49:10,848 --> 01:49:12,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went ahead with it, and I supported it.

1027
01:49:13,488 --> 01:49:16,489
[SPEAKER_00]: In hindsight, I should have sought out advice.

1028
01:49:16,649 --> 01:49:19,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have looked to the community to see if there was concerns.

1029
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:25,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I should have done a better job of sharing the idea and the issue with the entire community.

1030
01:49:26,872 --> 01:49:27,612
[SPEAKER_00]: In other instances,

1031
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:33,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe one of my strengths actually is to work in groups and to collaborate.

1032
01:49:33,836 --> 01:49:36,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a key attribute that I have.

1033
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:44,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the sense of a time when I did not collaborate enough, that's the first example.

1034
01:49:44,464 --> 01:49:50,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And other times where I have sought out collaboration when I should have reacted.

1035
01:49:52,699 --> 01:49:55,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could second guess lots of different things we do.

1036
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:59,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a very common situation where collaboration isn't useful.

1037
01:50:00,021 --> 01:50:02,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in times of crisis, of course, you need to react.

1038
01:50:02,802 --> 01:50:04,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those times, I have reacted.

1039
01:50:04,982 --> 01:50:11,784
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the other areas, one of the things that I've come to realize pretty quickly is I don't know everything about everything.

1040
01:50:12,024 --> 01:50:16,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to seek out supports from experts and get some consensus at times.

1041
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:24,996
[SPEAKER_13]: So John, why don't you speak to some accomplishment that you've done through collaboration and why you particularly see that as successful?

1042
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:25,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1043
01:50:26,417 --> 01:50:31,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the style I embrace the most, is collaboration.

1044
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:39,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that 95% of all the things that's happened in the past six years, things that I will take credit for, have been products of collaboration.

1045
01:50:40,888 --> 01:50:49,658
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been situations where I oversee a group of experts, professionals, we present the problem, we place it on the table, and we work at it.

1046
01:50:50,139 --> 01:50:53,683
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come to some conclusion of what is the best for the community and what's the best for students.

1047
01:50:54,644 --> 01:50:59,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's everything I've ever done really is reflected in that collaborative spirit.

1048
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:05,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I hope to convey tonight is I will continue to be collaborative, especially with the school committee.

1049
01:51:05,872 --> 01:51:12,633
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my role, is to work with you to make sure that priorities of the community and of the school community are met.

1050
01:51:14,894 --> 01:51:15,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1051
01:51:15,874 --> 01:51:16,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo?

1052
01:51:16,194 --> 01:51:16,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1053
01:51:24,956 --> 01:51:25,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Mestone.

1054
01:51:25,256 --> 01:51:25,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Dr. Cabrera.

1055
01:51:28,177 --> 01:51:28,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1056
01:51:29,042 --> 01:51:29,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn this on.

1057
01:51:30,783 --> 01:51:36,788
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did learn through your resume that you have middle school and high school experience, but we do have four elementary schools.

1058
01:51:36,869 --> 01:51:44,435
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could talk some concerns you have, both your strengths with elementary are tying it in, or concerns of now heading a school system K through 12.

1059
01:51:45,616 --> 01:51:45,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1060
01:51:47,037 --> 01:51:50,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So my experience has been, professional experience, has been in middle and high school.

1061
01:51:51,322 --> 01:51:56,790
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we realized pretty quickly is that high school is the culmination of all the students' experiences.

1062
01:51:57,210 --> 01:52:02,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Graduation isn't a ceremony for the high school staff, it's a ceremony for all faculty.

1063
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:05,062
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I realized that

1064
01:52:06,391 --> 01:52:13,336
[SPEAKER_00]: I would need to do a lot of work to make sure that I well understand the needs and concerns of the elementary students and families.

1065
01:52:13,716 --> 01:52:22,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to that, actually, is getting into the elementary schools and meeting with students and meeting with each of the principals in their communities individually.

1066
01:52:23,463 --> 01:52:27,466
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, I am also a parent of three children in the public school system.

1067
01:52:27,546 --> 01:52:31,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a parent, I have experienced that elementary experience.

1068
01:52:32,209 --> 01:52:35,171
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an eye-opener situation for anyone to go through.

1069
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:42,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically though, I think that elementary education is, of course, critical in the life of a student.

1070
01:52:42,485 --> 01:52:49,690
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that statistically, students who do well up to third grade have a much higher level of success throughout their careers in education.

1071
01:52:50,411 --> 01:52:55,395
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I think what we need to do is really look at each individual building and the needs of those buildings.

1072
01:52:55,875 --> 01:52:57,697
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the Kindergarten, Aids, and

1073
01:52:58,337 --> 01:53:08,189
[SPEAKER_00]: in the schools have been a question and concern and I have been following that and I would say that I would work with the school committee to identify how we could address each of those situations independently.

1074
01:53:09,477 --> 01:53:14,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that MedFit has a strong family network and this is a model for the entire nation.

1075
01:53:14,378 --> 01:53:19,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is extremely exciting for us and something that we should celebrate and embrace.

1076
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:28,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we must continually remind the community that education is not elementary or middle or high school, it's a journey for students.

1077
01:53:28,742 --> 01:53:31,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that journey is connected on all levels.

1078
01:53:31,943 --> 01:53:40,791
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that is essential is if we don't have a strong elementary and early education programs, then it will not be a successful middle and high school program.

1079
01:53:41,171 --> 01:53:41,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I follow up?

1080
01:53:42,172 --> 01:53:42,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly.

1081
01:53:44,033 --> 01:53:52,981
[SPEAKER_10]: So about early childhood, a lot of surrounding towns are talking about a four-year-old full day, calling it K1, pre-K, K2.

1082
01:53:53,421 --> 01:53:59,086
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know if you have thoughts on that or if you see how that could work here in MedFed or if you've

1083
01:53:59,983 --> 01:54:00,644
[SPEAKER_10]: have a plan?

1084
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1085
01:54:02,665 --> 01:54:07,789
[SPEAKER_00]: The earlier we get students into schools or into an educational environment, the better off they're going to be.

1086
01:54:08,029 --> 01:54:11,492
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been known since the 1960s in a lot of the studies that took place then.

1087
01:54:12,132 --> 01:54:14,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is a budget discussion as well.

1088
01:54:14,834 --> 01:54:19,538
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would work with the school committee to see if that is a priority of the community and the school committee.

1089
01:54:20,318 --> 01:54:25,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in and of itself, the sooner we get students into schools, the better we're going to be.

1090
01:54:26,603 --> 01:54:27,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1091
01:54:27,203 --> 01:54:27,604
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

1092
01:54:28,744 --> 01:54:28,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1093
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:29,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Kritz.

1094
01:54:31,676 --> 01:54:31,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Kathy.

1095
01:54:32,036 --> 01:54:32,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Dr. Perla.

1096
01:54:33,637 --> 01:54:37,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I have a question, some vocational questions.

1097
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:42,560
[SPEAKER_12]: So as you know, Medford Public Schools has 18 approved vocational programs.

1098
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,661
[SPEAKER_12]: How would you enhance the programs already in place?

1099
01:54:46,342 --> 01:54:49,663
[SPEAKER_12]: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?

1100
01:54:50,303 --> 01:54:52,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Where do you see the programs in three to five years?

1101
01:54:54,614 --> 01:54:59,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I'm most proud of is the collaboration of the high school vocational technical high school.

1102
01:54:59,979 --> 01:55:06,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Riccio and I spent hundreds of hours collaborating and figuring out how to make this a better experience for all students.

1103
01:55:07,265 --> 01:55:12,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So presently any ninth grader that walks into this building has the pathway to Harvard University,

1104
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:18,773
[SPEAKER_00]: or a CTE program and opportunity to join the workforce.

1105
01:55:19,634 --> 01:55:22,395
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically, I would continue what we've been doing.

1106
01:55:22,675 --> 01:55:25,237
[SPEAKER_00]: The integration has been taking place for six years.

1107
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:26,177
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not over with.

1108
01:55:26,537 --> 01:55:36,743
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is to continue to find, take small steps to make it more accessible for all students to enjoy and take advantage of the resources for both sides of the building.

1109
01:55:37,583 --> 01:55:42,905
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to continue to integrate the faculty and the students in the community to what is happening.

1110
01:55:43,426 --> 01:55:49,568
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to look for more opportunities to bring in revenue and students to take advantage of the great programs that we presently have.

1111
01:55:50,168 --> 01:55:56,651
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I'd love to leave with you tonight is that one of the key ingredients or one of the key

1112
01:55:58,812 --> 01:56:05,880
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that had to take place for the improved programs that we have now is the integration itself.

1113
01:56:06,281 --> 01:56:14,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the integration, we could not have expanded the 11 additional programs because those programs are dependent on higher academic classes and classwork.

1114
01:56:15,871 --> 01:56:24,281
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would continue to do is allow students on both sides to take advantage of foreign language, fine arts, and all the unique opportunities that vocational offer.

1115
01:56:24,781 --> 01:56:35,314
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, next year we have a plan in place to offer a period 7 courses in the vocational technical program for students in the high school level who might be interested in taking a culinary course or a carpentry course.

1116
01:56:35,834 --> 01:56:37,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we would take incremental steps.

1117
01:56:38,295 --> 01:56:46,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years from now, I see as much change as happened from the past six years, that will take place six years from now.

1118
01:56:46,818 --> 01:56:48,319
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to continue that journey.

1119
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:50,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1120
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:51,480
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1121
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:59,683
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could just a quick follow-up, how would you go about looking at the current programs we have at the vocational school to determine whether or not they should continue?

1122
01:57:00,472 --> 01:57:03,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, I would rely on the experts in the vocational technical program.

1123
01:57:03,714 --> 01:57:05,195
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two excellent ones.

1124
01:57:06,555 --> 01:57:10,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically boils down to if there's student interest, then we run the programs.

1125
01:57:11,898 --> 01:57:13,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Some programs do get phased out over time.

1126
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,521
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an easy process.

1127
01:57:15,921 --> 01:57:18,122
[SPEAKER_00]: And some programs get included over time.

1128
01:57:18,182 --> 01:57:19,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realize there's a need for that.

1129
01:57:20,023 --> 01:57:30,893
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is dependent on initially, if you know, with Minuteman, we looked at the programs that they offered that we were unable to offer and that allowed that school to take those students from us.

1130
01:57:31,673 --> 01:57:38,139
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done since is look at the programs that are popular and needed in our society and really invest in those.

1131
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:41,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're finding is most of those programs are on the technical side.

1132
01:57:42,023 --> 01:57:43,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's always a need

1133
01:57:43,624 --> 01:57:53,986
[SPEAKER_00]: for the traditional vocational programs, but many of the new programs require this higher level of education, such as robotics, such as engineering, and things of that nature, and business management.

1134
01:57:54,787 --> 01:57:56,407
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it really depends on a couple different things.

1135
01:57:57,087 --> 01:58:02,268
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at student interest, as well as what society and what businesses are looking for.

1136
01:58:02,288 --> 01:58:03,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1137
01:58:04,169 --> 01:58:04,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Benedetto.

1138
01:58:05,799 --> 01:58:07,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1139
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:10,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just follow up with a question on that?

1140
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:24,042
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dr. Parla, could you tell me which parts of the collaboration of the vocational school and the high school have your actual fingerprints on it, just so we have concrete examples of what you did in that process?

1141
01:58:24,202 --> 01:58:25,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say all of them.

1142
01:58:25,683 --> 01:58:33,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, of course, the specific programs that were brought on were done through the leadership of the experts in those fields at the time, Dr. Heidi Riccio.

1143
01:58:34,636 --> 01:58:50,291
[SPEAKER_00]: But in each step of the way, what we did is we concluded that the only way to allow those programs to flourish was to work in conjunction with not only the physical needs of those programs in the building, but also the academic and cultural needs of those programs.

1144
01:58:50,752 --> 01:58:58,459
[SPEAKER_00]: So we allowed the students to be integrated completely so that they could take the fine art courses, they could take the foreign language courses, that these new programs

1145
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:05,085
[SPEAKER_00]: in theory, because they're new programs, we haven't actually seen them to that point yet, would require for college acceptance.

1146
01:59:05,726 --> 01:59:15,355
[SPEAKER_00]: So every step of the way, and it's been a real, it's been a quiet side on the Medford High School as far as our participation, but it has been essential for this to take place.

1147
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:17,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1148
01:59:18,499 --> 01:59:27,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to go forward with my question, is what's your plan to increase academic growth at each level of an educational system?

1149
01:59:27,902 --> 01:59:35,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Please list for me some of your priority actions for our elementary, middle, high school, vocational school, and Curtis Tufts School.

1150
01:59:36,184 --> 01:59:36,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Erin.

1151
01:59:37,884 --> 01:59:45,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin with, I would say that we have to look at this as a whole, or a unit, instead of separating it and atomizing it into different sections.

1152
01:59:46,126 --> 01:59:50,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we look at the whole student from the minute that they come into our system to the minute they leave our system.

1153
01:59:50,908 --> 01:59:59,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to really view that in that sense, because otherwise, we fragment how we go about it and the communication and, of course,

1154
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:02,431
[SPEAKER_00]: the planning is impacted by that.

1155
02:00:02,892 --> 02:00:09,916
[SPEAKER_00]: So for elementary we would look at, one of the things that I feel very strongly about is increasing our coaching capacity in the elementary levels.

1156
02:00:10,556 --> 02:00:19,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and this is true throughout the state, that in many schools, in elementary schools, there is a need for expanded mathematics and science support.

1157
02:00:19,802 --> 02:00:23,184
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot to ask an elementary teacher to be a master of all fields.

1158
02:00:23,764 --> 02:00:28,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have experienced when I worked in the city of Revere is that our math coaches worked hand in hand

1159
02:00:29,287 --> 02:00:38,637
[SPEAKER_00]: elementary teachers and middle school teachers and really brought that not only expertise but again the idea that this has to continue from elementary to middle through high school.

1160
02:00:39,217 --> 02:00:47,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this time right now we unfortunately rely heavily on individual directors when this is something that we would need a little bit more support and help with.

1161
02:00:48,786 --> 02:00:53,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that we have to continue to provide a safe setting in all of these buildings.

1162
02:00:53,789 --> 02:00:57,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Students need to feel safe, not just physically, but emotionally and intellectually.

1163
02:00:58,231 --> 02:00:59,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to nurture that in students.

1164
02:01:00,392 --> 02:01:04,554
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things, one of the ways I would approach this would be to leverage our partnerships.

1165
02:01:04,974 --> 02:01:14,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Presently, we have partnerships with Boston College, Harvard University, and Tufts University, and those partnerships bring actual student supports and programs for our students to take part in.

1166
02:01:15,439 --> 02:01:22,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those programs have asked me if I could help them get into the elementary and middle school programs and how they can support those programs and those schools.

1167
02:01:23,806 --> 02:01:25,467
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I don't have that capacity.

1168
02:01:25,947 --> 02:01:34,294
[SPEAKER_00]: As a superintendent, I would explore and examine and bring to the attention of the school committee all kinds of ways that we can further support what happens in these programs.

1169
02:01:34,934 --> 02:01:42,280
[SPEAKER_00]: With the middle school, I think one of the concerns that we have right now, of course, is the differences between the two middle schools and how we identify who goes to what school.

1170
02:01:43,601 --> 02:01:47,083
[SPEAKER_00]: paying close attention to this and it is something that we need to really consider.

1171
02:01:47,703 --> 02:01:52,086
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of avenues, a lot of different districts do different things with middle schools.

1172
02:01:52,886 --> 02:01:56,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is something that I would obviously I'm paying close attention to now.

1173
02:01:57,068 --> 02:02:06,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at see what the results are this year and then take a step back and if I have that position I would review it further and see how that we can not only

1174
02:02:07,714 --> 02:02:11,577
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen, but also create better connections with the elementary through the high school.

1175
02:02:12,037 --> 02:02:14,418
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the high school level, I would keep the course.

1176
02:02:14,518 --> 02:02:18,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're doing is having really great success.

1177
02:02:18,841 --> 02:02:22,864
[SPEAKER_00]: As you all know, the high school this year has had the highest graduation rate in its history.

1178
02:02:23,244 --> 02:02:29,388
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we've done is create flexible systems in our school to meet the diverse needs of students.

1179
02:02:30,529 --> 02:02:31,870
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would approach that, Erin.

1180
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:33,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1181
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:33,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow-up?

1182
02:02:38,382 --> 02:02:42,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, I did have a follow up on that if that's okay.

1183
02:02:43,046 --> 02:02:53,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so I was referring pretty much towards testing scores and what actual programs and how could we, you know, get our academic achievement up.

1184
02:02:53,615 --> 02:03:01,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have become aware that this year there have been more eighth grade applications to outside school districts other than our high school.

1185
02:03:01,402 --> 02:03:05,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if you could give us any information or your viewpoint on that.

1186
02:03:05,973 --> 02:03:06,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1187
02:03:06,273 --> 02:03:13,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So to go back then, of course, standardized exams are a key indicator of the success of a school.

1188
02:03:14,316 --> 02:03:18,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And my philosophy is that good teaching will result in higher scores.

1189
02:03:19,217 --> 02:03:20,578
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to teach to any test.

1190
02:03:21,078 --> 02:03:28,660
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to invest in students, make them feel comfortable, make them feel that they're being listened to, and get them active and excited in their learning.

1191
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:31,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will give us better test results.

1192
02:03:31,721 --> 02:03:37,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific to your concerns with the middle school, this is something that I have been working with the middle school principals all year.

1193
02:03:37,622 --> 02:03:43,244
[SPEAKER_00]: We did identify that as a concern as well and we felt like there were a few reasons for that possibly happening.

1194
02:03:43,964 --> 02:03:57,347
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the situations that took place this year was that in our parent-teacher conference, 8th grade open house night, there was a school community event the same night where we lost some of our directors to that meeting and there were parents concerned and they wanted to

1195
02:03:58,087 --> 02:03:59,050
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet with directors.

1196
02:03:59,151 --> 02:04:02,882
[SPEAKER_00]: We have since reached out to those parents and I've held

1197
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:11,251
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a dozen individual parent tours in this building where I've met with students and met with their families.

1198
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:17,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is a concern because there is some confusion perhaps in the community about what is happening at the high school.

1199
02:04:17,252 --> 02:04:19,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a merge of two schools?

1200
02:04:19,673 --> 02:04:20,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a new school?

1201
02:04:21,253 --> 02:04:25,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all students coming in as vocational technical students because of our exploratory program?

1202
02:04:25,854 --> 02:04:29,854
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to be understood that those things happen when any kind of change takes place.

1203
02:04:30,394 --> 02:04:33,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we've shown in the past few months that we're addressing that.

1204
02:04:33,755 --> 02:04:35,776
[SPEAKER_00]: through communication and through forums.

1205
02:04:36,656 --> 02:04:42,539
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would continue to do that and clarify those questions that might be present from middle school families.

1206
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:43,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1207
02:04:44,540 --> 02:04:45,521
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

1208
02:04:48,402 --> 02:04:51,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke, first off, I just wanted to know, is the live stream okay?

1209
02:04:52,244 --> 02:04:53,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Bilson just went to check.

1210
02:04:53,905 --> 02:04:57,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's being addressed okay.

1211
02:04:58,067 --> 02:04:58,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's my question.

1212
02:05:00,651 --> 02:05:04,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the past few days, I've been looking through my emails in preparation for these interviews.

1213
02:05:05,852 --> 02:05:12,634
[SPEAKER_05]: What has surprised me is how some very intelligent, passionate, and engaged parents of our community have lost faith in our schools.

1214
02:05:13,774 --> 02:05:18,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Some have urged me not to consider any candidate from within our system, even as one as qualified as you.

1215
02:05:19,695 --> 02:05:22,716
[SPEAKER_05]: To these residents, how would you rebuild their faith?

1216
02:05:23,856 --> 02:05:25,958
[SPEAKER_05]: In your experience, how is trust built?

1217
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:27,380
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it damaged?

1218
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:34,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And what actions can we take to ensure greater community participation at all levels of the Medford school system?

1219
02:05:35,827 --> 02:05:36,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Michael.

1220
02:05:38,874 --> 02:05:44,918
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first heard that I was the insider, I was taken aback by that because I've never considered myself an insider to MedFed.

1221
02:05:45,778 --> 02:05:50,481
[SPEAKER_00]: As you probably know, I've been trained in Riviera Public Schools as well as the Everett Public Schools.

1222
02:05:51,242 --> 02:05:54,744
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to think of myself as a real combination of insider and outsider.

1223
02:05:54,764 --> 02:05:56,805
[SPEAKER_00]: An outsider with an insider

1224
02:05:57,682 --> 02:06:07,150
[SPEAKER_00]: internship or training where I've been able to meet and get to know the families and the community in a way that is priceless, really.

1225
02:06:07,870 --> 02:06:12,134
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say to those families is that I am not an insider.

1226
02:06:12,914 --> 02:06:17,398
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that unfortunately or fortunately, depending on who you are, I get compared to Mr. Bellson.

1227
02:06:18,612 --> 02:06:20,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Bellison is a mentor of mine.

1228
02:06:20,293 --> 02:06:21,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect him highly.

1229
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:23,355
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I've had many mentors.

1230
02:06:23,636 --> 02:06:26,778
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked under Paul Dakin from Rivere.

1231
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:28,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked under Fred Forrester from Everett.

1232
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked under John Duria from Teachers 21.

1233
02:06:32,102 --> 02:06:37,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many others who really have an impact on my style and my philosophy of learning.

1234
02:06:38,266 --> 02:06:50,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I would ask that, I would hope that those people that reached out to you were not families of the high school community because I feel like I've done a really good job of being available to all stakeholders in the community.

1235
02:06:51,429 --> 02:06:58,530
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I pride myself in is the ability to meet with everyone or anyone that wants to meet with me and it happens all day long.

1236
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:04,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that every individual in this community should expect exquisite respect.

1237
02:07:04,911 --> 02:07:07,752
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they should be listened to, valued, they should be heard from,

1238
02:07:09,012 --> 02:07:09,593
[SPEAKER_00]: and respected.

1239
02:07:10,213 --> 02:07:27,101
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say to those people is to look into and to speak to other people in the community, to talk to teachers at the high school and the vocational school, to talk to students, to talk to the community members and see if what they say and do or say about me echoes how I feel or how I present myself tonight.

1240
02:07:29,728 --> 02:07:37,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And how would you work to, for some, I've talked to a number of parents and especially the ones in high school actually do have a very high opinion of you.

1241
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:40,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to make sure I make that clear.

1242
02:07:40,723 --> 02:07:47,252
[SPEAKER_05]: But that said, I mean, among the other parents, how would we reach out to them to create a higher trust environment?

1243
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:51,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would look to my experience as the headmaster.

1244
02:07:51,702 --> 02:08:07,588
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you were here, Michael, when I was hired six years ago, and I know there are a few members on the committee that were there, I spent the first year engaging in community, talking, listening, to the point where I think some teachers were asking, what is he going to do?

1245
02:08:07,868 --> 02:08:08,769
[SPEAKER_00]: When will he do something?

1246
02:08:09,289 --> 02:08:14,553
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at the time, I was truly trying to understand the community, and I think this is an attribute and an asset I have presently.

1247
02:08:15,133 --> 02:08:16,474
[SPEAKER_00]: I would continue that same approach.

1248
02:08:17,154 --> 02:08:33,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd have to spend a tremendous amount of time working with the early education parents and families in the community, in the middle school as well, and make sure that I am not only the face of this school district, but also the individual who can work with families on any level, on any situation.

1249
02:08:34,106 --> 02:08:38,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I have also shown in the past few months, especially, how I operate in times of crises.

1250
02:08:39,529 --> 02:08:46,932
[SPEAKER_00]: where I listen, I am reflective, I try to be very patient, and I don't just knee-jerk react.

1251
02:08:48,013 --> 02:09:07,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would go about my first six months in the same manner, where I would seek out ideas, supports, as well as really a capacity to better understand those areas of the community that I don't, and probably more importantly, that those areas better understand me.

1252
02:09:08,442 --> 02:09:08,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1253
02:09:09,142 --> 02:09:13,505
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

1254
02:09:13,525 --> 02:09:15,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo?

1255
02:09:17,668 --> 02:09:17,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1256
02:09:18,449 --> 02:09:24,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Teaching colleges often don't prepare teachers for the challenges of a classroom right out of the gate.

1257
02:09:25,493 --> 02:09:29,396
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do to systematize supports for new teachers to ensure their success?

1258
02:09:30,788 --> 02:09:31,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree completely, Paul.

1259
02:09:32,009 --> 02:09:46,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're still transitioning between this concept that teachers should be trained only in the curriculum and in pedagogy when the expectations of our society is that they play a much bigger role in students' lives.

1260
02:09:47,398 --> 02:09:52,701
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we have already done in our school under my leadership is we created what was called MHS 101.

1261
02:09:53,341 --> 02:10:06,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done in the past four years is every new teacher we meet with, and when I say me, it's the principals, guidance Councilors at times, other administrators, we meet with new teachers on a monthly basis.

1262
02:10:06,747 --> 02:10:08,670
[SPEAKER_00]: where we review all kinds of different things.

1263
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:17,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Things as simple as what the city of Method looks like, how to interact with different situations, how to engage in a parent-teacher conference.

1264
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:21,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we always focus on is so that

1265
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:27,554
[SPEAKER_00]: layer that you're referencing is what do we do with these situations that we're not really trained and prepared for.

1266
02:10:28,135 --> 02:10:51,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the biggest thing we need to be able to do with teachers and really all faculty in an educational setting is to prepare them to be able to adapt to situations, to do the things that we expect them to do, which is support students, to be a rock for students in the community, to be a professional as far as the curriculum and the areas of expertise.

1267
02:10:51,551 --> 02:10:59,719
[SPEAKER_00]: and to listen, and to, again, exhibit exquisite respect with all family and students that they feel listened to and valued.

1268
02:11:00,059 --> 02:11:01,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's critical for us.

1269
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:04,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that, you know, we've been spending a lot of time talking about security.

1270
02:11:05,704 --> 02:11:16,153
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the best way that we ensure the safety of schools is to also ensure that all students feel like this is their home, that they're not pushed out of the buildings, that they are listened to.

1271
02:11:16,474 --> 02:11:17,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is how we address

1272
02:11:18,702 --> 02:11:28,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, along with all the security measures that we've already taken place, but that's the primary way I think that we can avoid concerning situations that have been taking place in the past years.

1273
02:11:31,129 --> 02:11:31,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

1274
02:11:31,269 --> 02:11:31,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Vander Kloot.

1275
02:11:32,890 --> 02:11:36,172
[SPEAKER_13]: John, what does being an educational leader mean to you?

1276
02:11:37,053 --> 02:11:47,619
[SPEAKER_13]: And have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue, or if you could, or and if you could, if you could go before them tomorrow, what would you address them on?

1277
02:11:48,677 --> 02:12:03,220
[SPEAKER_00]: With education related to me, this is what I've been trained for my entire life, is to be able to be the conductor of the orchestra, to be able to make sure that all the instruments are playing in tune with each other.

1278
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:05,641
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean I can play all the instruments.

1279
02:12:06,281 --> 02:12:11,382
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I checked with Mr. Tony Zigny today about this, and he told me he couldn't play all the instruments either.

1280
02:12:12,162 --> 02:12:14,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that I like that metaphor a lot.

1281
02:12:15,933 --> 02:12:26,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's key, is that you have to coordinate and facilitate the environment for growth and learning, so people can feel comfortable and be empowered to do great things.

1282
02:12:26,923 --> 02:12:29,846
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the styles I embrace is called entrepreneurial leadership.

1283
02:12:30,186 --> 02:12:30,807
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this style,

1284
02:12:31,387 --> 02:12:32,268
[SPEAKER_00]: You do exactly that.

1285
02:12:32,688 --> 02:12:39,251
[SPEAKER_00]: You empower individuals to take ownership and to invest in their ideas, and then you back off, and you give them the credit for it.

1286
02:12:39,712 --> 02:12:41,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many examples of that.

1287
02:12:41,493 --> 02:12:49,417
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, our Fells Educational Program, which was an idea of mine, has been taken by others, and they've run with it and made it into something really exciting.

1288
02:12:50,177 --> 02:12:53,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not been in front of the educational board.

1289
02:12:54,419 --> 02:12:55,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had that experience yet.

1290
02:12:56,235 --> 02:13:10,592
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think is essential that we start to address is this belief that the only way we can assess a student's ability to be successful in a content area is through standardized exams.

1291
02:13:11,373 --> 02:13:12,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it is

1292
02:13:13,951 --> 02:13:30,657
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no doubt in my mind that if presented in the proper way we could get the state to understand and of course in support with other superintendents that there are lots of ways to demonstrate competency in areas and that we must utilize what we already know in education that

1293
02:13:31,457 --> 02:13:36,118
[SPEAKER_00]: to differentiate is to be truly an educator, and that we can't have a one-size-fits-all.

1294
02:13:36,898 --> 02:13:45,160
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the area I would spend a lot of my energies and time investigating, exploring, and then addressing.

1295
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:46,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1296
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:47,140
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1297
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Sebastian.

1298
02:13:54,382 --> 02:13:59,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So this question sort of deals with your educational philosophy and with your implementation as well.

1299
02:14:01,952 --> 02:14:08,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you see the school setting as a place for civic engagement for students to engage with communities as well as government?

1300
02:14:10,378 --> 02:14:17,562
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, how would you continue to implement opportunities for civic learning into the curriculum?

1301
02:14:19,464 --> 02:14:26,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And possibly if you could also go into learning at all levels, high school, middle school, and elementary school.

1302
02:14:26,829 --> 02:14:27,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1303
02:14:28,698 --> 02:14:32,899
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe that civic engagement is a key component to public education.

1304
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:39,341
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've seen that in the past few weeks and not only in this community but in the nation as a whole.

1305
02:14:40,002 --> 02:14:57,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had conversations with students recently where they've told me that the most impactful experience they've had in 12 years, the thing that they can't go to sleep without thinking about is their willingness to be part of something bigger than them in a civic engagement such as a protest.

1306
02:14:59,321 --> 02:15:07,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And it struck me really hard at first thinking that we spend all this time and energy, you know, teaching students and this is the moment, the thing had nothing to do with what we're doing.

1307
02:15:09,125 --> 02:15:17,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really sort of crystallized to me that we have to look at, we have to listen to students and understand that they're a part of the educational process.

1308
02:15:17,969 --> 02:15:22,491
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to hear what they have to say and not just tell them this is, these are the things you need to learn.

1309
02:15:23,111 --> 02:15:23,632
[SPEAKER_00]: We know better.

1310
02:15:24,953 --> 02:15:25,714
[SPEAKER_00]: just do what we tell you.

1311
02:15:26,355 --> 02:15:36,664
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that civic engagement is really empowering students to take part in their future, to take part in what they want to see in the change in our society and our community.

1312
02:15:37,164 --> 02:15:39,086
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that at the high school.

1313
02:15:39,326 --> 02:15:41,348
[SPEAKER_00]: The CCSR is a great example of that.

1314
02:15:41,768 --> 02:15:45,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that it's sort of an outside component to public education.

1315
02:15:46,072 --> 02:15:50,016
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing I would like more than to have that to be a senior requirement.

1316
02:15:50,376 --> 02:15:58,078
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we're working on this year in conjunction with our partnership with Harvard University is exploring how to expand a senior year for students.

1317
02:15:58,258 --> 02:16:05,000
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of experiences would be really powerful experiences that would better prepare them for life outside of high school?

1318
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:13,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways we would like to explore that is through a capstone project or a civic engagement project that would encompass much of their senior year.

1319
02:16:14,182 --> 02:16:18,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Presently what happens, and I've seen this in my 15 years in high school,

1320
02:16:18,562 --> 02:16:21,363
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of the senior year is a struggle for everyone.

1321
02:16:21,683 --> 02:16:23,104
[SPEAKER_00]: The seniors don't want to be in school.

1322
02:16:23,564 --> 02:16:24,805
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers are trying to hold on to them.

1323
02:16:24,825 --> 02:16:26,105
[SPEAKER_00]: They already got accepted into college.

1324
02:16:26,585 --> 02:16:29,847
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost worse than the beginning of the ninth grade.

1325
02:16:30,087 --> 02:16:32,008
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a curve that takes place.

1326
02:16:32,388 --> 02:16:33,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And we struggle with this every year.

1327
02:16:34,089 --> 02:16:35,869
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to hold these things over their heads.

1328
02:16:35,969 --> 02:16:37,090
[SPEAKER_00]: You better do this.

1329
02:16:37,130 --> 02:16:38,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can contact the schools.

1330
02:16:38,711 --> 02:16:40,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can revoke your letters of recommendation.

1331
02:16:40,851 --> 02:16:43,753
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, we realize that it's not really

1332
02:16:44,793 --> 02:16:46,555
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why that they're restless.

1333
02:16:46,635 --> 02:16:51,939
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why that they're not engaged at that time because we're treating them the same way we treat ninth graders.

1334
02:16:52,540 --> 02:17:01,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've seen in other districts and what I'd like to explore and what we've created also a task force this year to investigate is how we can expand that senior experience for students.

1335
02:17:02,708 --> 02:17:06,870
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think civic engagement is a really healthy and essential component.

1336
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:09,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to scale that throughout the system.

1337
02:17:09,872 --> 02:17:11,333
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't just be a high school experience.

1338
02:17:11,453 --> 02:17:14,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should be taught in elementary and middle school as well.

1339
02:17:15,275 --> 02:17:18,977
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I would really further investigate and support.

1340
02:17:20,658 --> 02:17:20,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1341
02:17:21,138 --> 02:17:21,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin.

1342
02:17:22,232 --> 02:17:23,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a follow-up to that.

1343
02:17:23,273 --> 02:17:26,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So you talked about restless seniors, which I know all too well.

1344
02:17:26,835 --> 02:17:31,117
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are restless students of other grades as well.

1345
02:17:31,978 --> 02:17:42,844
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of students who know they want to major in science, they don't get the point of taking a history class or an English class.

1346
02:17:43,264 --> 02:17:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same with other subjects, with foreign languages or with math.

1347
02:17:48,167 --> 02:17:53,510
[SPEAKER_03]: how would you propose to give classes more meaning to students?

1348
02:17:56,531 --> 02:18:02,734
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that we, in our XQ project, I hope some of you have got an opportunity to look at that, this was a

1349
02:18:04,594 --> 02:18:07,796
[SPEAKER_00]: a school redesign project that Dr. Riccio and I spearheaded.

1350
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:13,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that, we examined that phenomenon, that concern, is how do we keep engagement in students?

1351
02:18:14,060 --> 02:18:17,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we sort of envisioned it was to create pathways.

1352
02:18:18,303 --> 02:18:26,248
[SPEAKER_00]: So students would then be able to come into a school, identify an area of interest or concern, or interest, I would say, and then explore it.

1353
02:18:26,629 --> 02:18:33,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's always a need for required classes, especially when you consider the MCAS the way it's set up presently.

1354
02:18:34,714 --> 02:18:37,517
[SPEAKER_00]: We envisioned it, and I think this is extremely doable.

1355
02:18:37,537 --> 02:18:46,627
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we are on the, really the path to this happening right now is that a student would come in to Medford High School as a ninth grader and be presented with an array of pathways.

1356
02:18:47,207 --> 02:18:48,529
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two years they would have to

1357
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:54,691
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of the required courses, and then they would have freedom to explore areas of their interest.

1358
02:18:55,171 --> 02:18:59,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thinking behind this is that this is how we get students invested.

1359
02:18:59,112 --> 02:19:07,834
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just, again, force feed them something that we think they should learn, but really give them the opportunity to have a say in this process.

1360
02:19:08,454 --> 02:19:14,555
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would model it very similarly to the vocational model of finding a pathway, finding a program or a pathway,

1361
02:19:14,875 --> 02:19:16,336
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be science, for instance.

1362
02:19:16,876 --> 02:19:26,059
[SPEAKER_00]: You create an advisory committee around that, and then you have an end result, or a project, or an internship, or a collaborative, or another step in that direction.

1363
02:19:26,699 --> 02:19:39,303
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in science, if we're following that example, we could, and this has been done already, is through our partnerships with Tufts University, enable students to have an internship in a lab at Tufts, let's say, in their senior year.

1364
02:19:39,563 --> 02:19:44,225
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be sort of a step-by-step process of really empowering, listening to students,

1365
02:19:44,565 --> 02:19:49,610
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding their opportunities, educational opportunities, and hopefully getting them to invest in that whole process.

1366
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:51,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think you're absolutely right.

1367
02:19:51,311 --> 02:19:56,816
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to do all this at the same time because we're losing interest in students.

1368
02:19:57,217 --> 02:20:00,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of students look around and say, why am I doing this?

1369
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:01,581
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really make any sense to me.

1370
02:20:02,372 --> 02:20:11,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also, not to belittle this, but I think we need to stop looking at content area as sort of separate from life.

1371
02:20:11,397 --> 02:20:13,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is history and this is geometry.

1372
02:20:14,039 --> 02:20:17,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we need to do is look at opportunities to sort of mix these two.

1373
02:20:17,261 --> 02:20:29,008
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, one of the things that we were hoping to do this year, but we did not, we can hope to do it next year, is create a combination course where you have carpentry and mathematics, students are learning mathematical skills,

1374
02:20:29,528 --> 02:20:33,791
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as carpentry skills, and they're applying them, because obviously there's mathematical elements to carpentry.

1375
02:20:34,272 --> 02:20:35,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's lots of examples of this.

1376
02:20:36,113 --> 02:20:37,354
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to be creative.

1377
02:20:37,735 --> 02:20:41,418
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to not be stuck in our traditional ways and views of public education.

1378
02:20:41,798 --> 02:20:43,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really scary for some people to hear.

1379
02:20:43,619 --> 02:20:48,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sometimes temper myself from saying things like this, because I don't want to look too radical.

1380
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:54,048
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's also the future of public education, of really engaging with students in a genuine way.

1381
02:20:56,309 --> 02:20:56,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Benedetto.

1382
02:20:58,208 --> 02:21:07,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to follow up with the idea that you just brought forward, so with carpentry and math, can you tell me how, I mean, it's a great concept, but how do we execute that?

1383
02:21:09,015 --> 02:21:14,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we have to do, we have to start off with designing a master schedule that will allow us to do that.

1384
02:21:15,079 --> 02:21:22,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Presently, at the high school level, we are restricted by the things that we can do because of the schedule we have, which has been in place since the 1990s.

1385
02:21:22,684 --> 02:21:26,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we would do is we would get people, stakeholders together, and we would

1386
02:21:27,605 --> 02:21:29,686
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have conversations about how it could look.

1387
02:21:30,507 --> 02:21:33,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have all the answers tonight, Erin, as far as what I would do with that.

1388
02:21:34,129 --> 02:21:38,432
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that I would reach out to the right people and say, this is an idea that is worth exploring.

1389
02:21:38,752 --> 02:21:39,612
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make it happen?

1390
02:21:40,173 --> 02:21:43,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it as a co-teaching class where you have the carpentry.

1391
02:21:44,295 --> 02:21:55,258
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher, and you have a mathematics teacher, who work together, requires some planning, I would think at least a year of conceptualizing and planning, and basically getting together and saying, how can we make something unique and exciting?

1392
02:21:55,678 --> 02:22:01,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps we offer it in a pilot version where we see how it works, but it's really applicable to any content area.

1393
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:06,182
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it in English and history often, but I do think it goes way beyond that.

1394
02:22:06,242 --> 02:22:08,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could look at it in mixing a lot of different courses.

1395
02:22:10,263 --> 02:22:10,583
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1396
02:22:11,656 --> 02:22:11,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

1397
02:22:11,956 --> 02:22:14,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Stone.

1398
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:19,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You had used the phrase you're an outsider with an insider view.

1399
02:22:20,308 --> 02:22:27,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that inside view, what would you say is the Medford Public Schools greatest strength and greatest weakness and how would you address the weakness?

1400
02:22:29,744 --> 02:22:32,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the strength is the community itself.

1401
02:22:32,907 --> 02:22:40,295
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came here, I was blown away by the passion, by the commitment of the students, of the faculty.

1402
02:22:41,035 --> 02:22:44,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to sound cliche, but really the best part of my job is the students.

1403
02:22:44,659 --> 02:22:48,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I love meeting and talking to students.

1404
02:22:48,763 --> 02:22:52,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had one bad interaction with a student in six years.

1405
02:22:53,187 --> 02:22:54,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that with all honesty.

1406
02:22:55,730 --> 02:23:02,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I find listening to them and hearing them and when you give a student respect, you're going to get that respect back.

1407
02:23:02,455 --> 02:23:04,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're saying and doing things that you might not agree with.

1408
02:23:05,138 --> 02:23:09,121
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that really the essence of this community is the families.

1409
02:23:09,321 --> 02:23:12,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the families that make up it.

1410
02:23:12,644 --> 02:23:13,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the teaching staff is

1411
02:23:15,446 --> 02:23:16,747
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best teachers I've ever seen.

1412
02:23:16,767 --> 02:23:24,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the concerns I would have would be in the structures and organizations, the systems that are in place.

1413
02:23:24,613 --> 02:23:31,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that I would do is really, I wouldn't say audit, but I would review the systems in place.

1414
02:23:31,098 --> 02:23:33,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there needs to be more of an emphasis on technology.

1415
02:23:33,659 --> 02:23:35,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there needs to be more of an emphasis on

1416
02:23:37,622 --> 02:23:43,005
[SPEAKER_00]: innovative and expanded learning opportunities and being more flexible in how we approach students.

1417
02:23:44,005 --> 02:23:50,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that another great opportunity is that we're sharing this city with the college, Tufts University.

1418
02:23:51,088 --> 02:23:52,429
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at Tufts University.

1419
02:23:52,809 --> 02:23:58,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very close with five or six of the education professors as well as a handful of other professors.

1420
02:23:58,952 --> 02:24:02,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I would ask the school committee for support in this and I would hope the mayor would do as well.

1421
02:24:02,814 --> 02:24:05,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we could expand learning

1422
02:24:06,275 --> 02:24:10,358
[SPEAKER_00]: a learning partnership with Tufts University that would be powerful.

1423
02:24:10,498 --> 02:24:22,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could do a five or ten year formal agreement, not in a resource, just give us money, but how do we get Tufts education professors in Tufts facilities utilized by our students and our faculty?

1424
02:24:22,385 --> 02:24:26,968
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we create professional development opportunities from experts in the fields of education?

1425
02:24:27,328 --> 02:24:31,791
[SPEAKER_00]: They want this, and I think it's really a good opportunity for us to take advantage of that.

1426
02:24:32,128 --> 02:24:45,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to follow up on that, I know that we've exchanged emails that I had met with the two community directors for Medford and Somerville, and that I was unaware that any student can audit a class that would be high school credit, not Tufts credit.

1427
02:24:46,095 --> 02:24:52,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And that the woman, Barbara Rugal, said she's had one most of the time, at most a year three.

1428
02:24:52,579 --> 02:24:57,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is something that they are eager to get more partnership going.

1429
02:24:57,161 --> 02:24:58,061
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not saying that.

1430
02:24:58,081 --> 02:25:00,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that one of the things that we realize with our students is that they are

1431
02:25:01,543 --> 02:25:05,866
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmed with activities and clubs and sports and classes.

1432
02:25:06,406 --> 02:25:15,872
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of auditing a course at Tufts is not as appealing, but we've had situations where we've had students who are beyond our mathematics and we've taken them and given them opportunities.

1433
02:25:15,912 --> 02:25:18,114
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right, there are opportunities.

1434
02:25:18,654 --> 02:25:22,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to formalize a partnership where it's happening in the building during the school day.

1435
02:25:23,297 --> 02:25:23,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1436
02:25:24,218 --> 02:25:24,938
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

1437
02:25:25,679 --> 02:25:36,508
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could just jump in, clearly you see the change that's happening in the school system with the deputy superintendent retiring, three directors retiring as well.

1438
02:25:37,388 --> 02:25:43,934
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see putting together the team, if you were the superintendent, to make this system keep moving forward?

1439
02:25:44,114 --> 02:25:49,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you say, being innovative, how would you see that moving forward?

1440
02:25:49,753 --> 02:26:00,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's probably the biggest task for the next superintendent, especially in the first year, is putting around that individual a team of professionals and experts.

1441
02:26:01,918 --> 02:26:06,119
[SPEAKER_00]: As one of the things I have referenced in the past is my

1442
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:16,043
[SPEAKER_00]: My approach to leadership includes a Collins good to great concept of getting the right people on the bus first, then deciding where the bus goes.

1443
02:26:16,504 --> 02:26:32,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of coming in and saying, I'm the leader, I'm going to tell you where we're going, you bring in experts in the fields, people who would challenge you, people who you are dependent upon to push you and to create in that conflict and in that discussion ideas that are worth following through on.

1444
02:26:33,391 --> 02:26:35,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I would personally, I have thought quite a lot about this.

1445
02:26:36,552 --> 02:26:43,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I fortunately have lots of connections in different educational areas in the city, excuse me, in the state.

1446
02:26:44,616 --> 02:26:50,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look for people with the support of the school committee to help bring our vision to fruition.

1447
02:26:51,218 --> 02:26:53,939
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need people who are going to be vocal.

1448
02:26:54,539 --> 02:26:56,720
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't want someone to just yes you to death.

1449
02:26:56,760 --> 02:27:00,562
[SPEAKER_00]: You want someone to support you in ways that you might be lacking in areas.

1450
02:27:01,182 --> 02:27:15,909
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I would say that is a strength that's already in place, for instance, is we have a brilliant business manager, we have a brilliant special education director, we have a new EL director, and those are three areas that I think are essential in the next couple of years.

1451
02:27:15,949 --> 02:27:25,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that the other areas are not, they are, of course, but those are things that, they're changes, not so much to business management, but they're changes in the city that we have to sort of anticipate for, especially the EL director.

1452
02:27:26,455 --> 02:27:33,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is, it would be my number one focus to make sure that I put in place the right people.

1453
02:27:34,207 --> 02:27:36,288
[SPEAKER_00]: My success would be dependent upon that.

1454
02:27:36,488 --> 02:27:46,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I do every time I hire a new teacher is I tell them the most important thing I do, the most important thing I do in my job as a headmaster is to place the right teacher into a classroom.

1455
02:27:46,773 --> 02:27:51,036
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most important thing that any of us do, because that's where the learning happens.

1456
02:27:51,196 --> 02:27:53,397
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the front lines of education.

1457
02:27:53,917 --> 02:27:56,959
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand the critical nature of this decision.

1458
02:27:58,179 --> 02:28:07,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that I would work in conjunction with the school community to identify areas that we all think need support and ways that we can improve on that.

1459
02:28:08,548 --> 02:28:14,954
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be your weakness as a superintendent that you would want to compensate for with a deputy superintendent, for example?

1460
02:28:16,495 --> 02:28:23,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, fortunately, we have an assistant superintendent who covers an area that I am not as strong in, and that is Ms.

1461
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:23,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Caldwell.

1462
02:28:23,921 --> 02:28:26,123
[SPEAKER_00]: She is an expert in the field of elementary education.

1463
02:28:26,530 --> 02:28:28,012
[SPEAKER_00]: with lots of experience in that area.

1464
02:28:28,793 --> 02:28:44,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, fortunately for me, the areas that I would say that I probably am the least strong in, I'll use that expression, is areas such as business management, and I think obviously that's, I'm not a trained business manager, I'm a trained educational leader.

1465
02:28:44,596 --> 02:28:49,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Special education is an area that I don't have the formal training in.

1466
02:28:49,717 --> 02:28:56,979
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also say elementary education is something I haven't had as much experience in, but I'm looking forward to take part in.

1467
02:28:57,981 --> 02:28:58,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1468
02:28:59,462 --> 02:28:59,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

1469
02:28:59,722 --> 02:28:59,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Kreatz.

1470
02:29:03,464 --> 02:29:03,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

1471
02:29:04,805 --> 02:29:07,506
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have another question regarding the vocational.

1472
02:29:08,687 --> 02:29:15,591
[SPEAKER_12]: How would you work with the current administration to continue to promote career in technical education in Medford?

1473
02:29:16,883 --> 02:29:19,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very good relationship presently.

1474
02:29:19,564 --> 02:29:29,627
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I do on a weekly basis, I not only meet with the director and associate director, principal of the vocational school, but with all the directors in the district.

1475
02:29:30,187 --> 02:29:34,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have these conversations on a weekly basis in our instructional leadership team meetings.

1476
02:29:35,129 --> 02:29:38,790
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I would approach it is be very, no different than how I do it now.

1477
02:29:39,570 --> 02:29:47,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my role would be a little bit different in the sense that, of course, I'm looking at this from a district perspective, but it's still the same idea.

1478
02:29:47,291 --> 02:29:47,992
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we grow it?

1479
02:29:48,072 --> 02:29:48,832
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we nurture it?

1480
02:29:49,112 --> 02:29:50,492
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we continue to support it?

1481
02:29:50,852 --> 02:29:52,392
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very fragile state right now.

1482
02:29:52,792 --> 02:30:00,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've made some significant changes, and I think one of the things we have to do is make sure that we stabilize, stabilize the programs that are in place.

1483
02:30:01,463 --> 02:30:03,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that also applies to the entire district.

1484
02:30:03,384 --> 02:30:05,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the district is in a critical state right now.

1485
02:30:05,505 --> 02:30:06,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of change.

1486
02:30:07,185 --> 02:30:10,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the mayor has mentioned, there's a lot of turnover taking place.

1487
02:30:12,007 --> 02:30:19,510
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the roles I see myself playing is that stability role, is stabilizing the district as we get back on our feet and we march forward.

1488
02:30:23,064 --> 02:30:24,445
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just have one follow-up.

1489
02:30:25,426 --> 02:30:29,070
[SPEAKER_12]: How would you allocate money to support the programs?

1490
02:30:29,210 --> 02:30:35,175
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a lot of the programs, some of them have a higher number of enrollment versus others.

1491
02:30:36,356 --> 02:30:37,758
[SPEAKER_12]: And what would you do?

1492
02:30:38,258 --> 02:30:44,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have any experience writing grants to request money to support some of the programs?

1493
02:30:46,303 --> 02:30:50,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So the budget itself is an active process.

1494
02:30:50,267 --> 02:31:03,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that is really interesting about MedFit is that we do bring in a tremendous amount of revenue from our partnerships and from our after school and summer programs that we have, and from the grants.

1495
02:31:03,178 --> 02:31:09,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Presently, we bring about $5 to $6 million a year of resources into our district for that purpose.

1496
02:31:10,065 --> 02:31:11,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to continue doing what we've been doing.

1497
02:31:13,107 --> 02:31:16,549
[SPEAKER_00]: improve our capacity to host students from different communities.

1498
02:31:16,569 --> 02:31:17,769
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bringing in revenue.

1499
02:31:18,370 --> 02:31:25,853
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to seek out grants, work with our partners to develop and design and to get those grants.

1500
02:31:26,053 --> 02:31:38,099
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we did well with the vocational school is we identified areas of need, as well as in the state itself, there is a lot of interest in CTE programs, and for good reason.

1501
02:31:38,459 --> 02:31:40,360
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an essential component

1502
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:43,402
[SPEAKER_00]: to a city's educational system.

1503
02:31:43,982 --> 02:31:54,309
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would continue to do basically what we've been doing, is value it, understand its role in the big picture, nurture it, and support it through all the efforts that we can.

1504
02:31:55,730 --> 02:31:56,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1505
02:31:56,330 --> 02:31:58,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Ruggiero, did you have a follow-up?

1506
02:31:58,752 --> 02:31:59,232
[SPEAKER_01]: No question.

1507
02:32:01,883 --> 02:32:06,867
[SPEAKER_05]: As all cities in Massachusetts, severe poverty touches the lives of some of our students.

1508
02:32:07,787 --> 02:32:13,011
[SPEAKER_05]: What types of challenges do you think that these children endure and how would you help them succeed?

1509
02:32:14,912 --> 02:32:16,633
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the experiences I have that I can

1510
02:32:18,396 --> 02:32:21,939
[SPEAKER_00]: reach back to is working in Revere, where the poverty rate was much higher.

1511
02:32:21,959 --> 02:32:23,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Revere as well.

1512
02:32:24,201 --> 02:32:25,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I understood its roots.

1513
02:32:25,902 --> 02:32:27,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's much different from Medford.

1514
02:32:27,964 --> 02:32:31,447
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some differences.

1515
02:32:31,788 --> 02:32:35,471
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the EL population and the high-needs population is much higher.

1516
02:32:36,211 --> 02:32:46,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I realized as a teacher and a coach and an administrator in Revere is that school is really the safest place and the place that these students want to be more than anything else.

1517
02:32:47,733 --> 02:32:55,054
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a thing that most teachers and administrators laugh about is that the most challenging student is there every day.

1518
02:32:55,715 --> 02:32:57,955
[SPEAKER_00]: They never miss school.

1519
02:32:57,975 --> 02:33:00,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And we embrace that.

1520
02:33:00,215 --> 02:33:01,176
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that fact.

1521
02:33:01,256 --> 02:33:03,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not something that we want them to miss school.

1522
02:33:03,536 --> 02:33:05,438
[SPEAKER_00]: But we realize that this is where they want to be.

1523
02:33:06,218 --> 02:33:13,945
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we need to do is understand that students are coming in with different needs, and we have to differentiate how we address those students.

1524
02:33:14,245 --> 02:33:17,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's differentiating their learning environment.

1525
02:33:17,468 --> 02:33:20,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's differentiating the teaching that we give to those students.

1526
02:33:20,510 --> 02:33:23,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's differentiating how we deal with those students and families.

1527
02:33:23,833 --> 02:33:27,596
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at each group as individuals and not one size fits all.

1528
02:33:28,337 --> 02:33:38,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm well trained in that and had a lot of experience in that and what I bring to this position is an empathy and an understanding of students no matter where they're coming from.

1529
02:33:40,121 --> 02:33:46,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to share a particular experience that you've had in particular dealing with a student that had severe poverty and how you helped them?

1530
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:49,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1531
02:33:50,061 --> 02:33:55,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's lots of students I'm thinking of in my experience that students came from poverty.

1532
02:33:56,007 --> 02:34:07,118
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one student that I think from MedFed that I have a, I won't say his name, of course, but there was a student in one of my first years who came, he was a transfer student, who came over from Cambridge.

1533
02:34:07,839 --> 02:34:10,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came in here like a sore thumb.

1534
02:34:12,944 --> 02:34:19,010
[SPEAKER_00]: was happy to be the outlier, to be someone that no one liked and didn't want to be connected.

1535
02:34:19,430 --> 02:34:21,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came from a very troubling environment.

1536
02:34:21,993 --> 02:34:30,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Only through working with him and believing in him and giving him hope and opportunity was he able to break down and sort of convey that.

1537
02:34:31,762 --> 02:34:36,587
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is something that he didn't really feel in the way he acted, he was just sort of acting out.

1538
02:34:37,347 --> 02:34:51,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we've been very fortunate in the past few years is to really invest, and you guys have done this, we've invested in social emotional intelligence and our adjustment Councilors and our understanding that students come in with a whole range of needs and concerns.

1539
02:34:51,735 --> 02:35:09,445
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes we look at being in the high school as working in a triage unit, in that we don't know what's coming in at any given day, but we do know that certain things work with children, and that's love, attention, listening to them, trying to be empathetic to their background and the situation, and giving them hope and giving them opportunities.

1540
02:35:10,166 --> 02:35:11,126
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would approach this.

1541
02:35:13,147 --> 02:35:13,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1542
02:35:13,447 --> 02:35:14,008
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1543
02:35:14,028 --> 02:35:14,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin?

1544
02:35:18,678 --> 02:35:29,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a lot of innovative ideas for the Medford Public School District, and you spoke a little about potentially scaring away some stakeholders in our community.

1545
02:35:31,632 --> 02:35:39,181
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, contract negotiations are going on this month, and they may not conclude until the new superintendent takes office.

1546
02:35:40,802 --> 02:35:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were put in a situation where the contract did not allow you the flexibility that you desire to build this innovative teaching method, this innovative community, how would you work within that contract?

1547
02:36:00,329 --> 02:36:03,070
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has happened, you said, if that has ever happened.

1548
02:36:03,170 --> 02:36:06,531
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened every day of my life in this district.

1549
02:36:07,777 --> 02:36:08,857
[SPEAKER_00]: One happens, it happens every day.

1550
02:36:09,718 --> 02:36:23,861
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I was having a lot of trouble with the first few years is I was looking at this as a problem of structure, of I need to be able to redesign the structures to get the results we wanted.

1551
02:36:24,521 --> 02:36:28,802
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are correct that change is really hard for people.

1552
02:36:28,822 --> 02:36:30,583
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, having conversations about

1553
02:36:32,711 --> 02:36:38,272
[SPEAKER_00]: innovative schedules is challenging to listen to because not everyone agrees with that philosophically.

1554
02:36:39,013 --> 02:36:54,457
[SPEAKER_00]: And it struck me one day that I was going about it all wrong and that instead of trying to change the structures, I need to build within the capacity of the actual instruction happening and the environment and the culture that I have a role in, that I can impact.

1555
02:36:55,177 --> 02:37:04,246
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we tried to focus on how to get students to be more engaged in whatever they're doing and to feel more comfortable coming into the building, to be heard and listened to.

1556
02:37:04,887 --> 02:37:10,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I'm sure no one's even recognized this, but I did, is that

1557
02:37:10,612 --> 02:37:16,815
[SPEAKER_00]: My focus initially, my first few years, was listening primarily to teachers and trying to figure out how to make those structural changes.

1558
02:37:17,576 --> 02:37:25,900
[SPEAKER_00]: It shifted, not that I didn't listen to teachers anymore, but then I shifted into listening more to students' needs and understanding what they needed and what I can actually give them.

1559
02:37:26,461 --> 02:37:32,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has allowed us, I believe, to create a truly positive culture at the high school.

1560
02:37:32,624 --> 02:37:34,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people feel supported.

1561
02:37:34,645 --> 02:37:39,408
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfect, but I think people feel like they come in there every day and it's their home.

1562
02:37:39,966 --> 02:37:53,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the way it would go about the contract negotiations is that understanding that it's a complex situation, that I would approach it, most times it's approached in a positional sense, my way or your way.

1563
02:37:54,511 --> 02:37:59,853
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was trained in a win-win negotiation style, where we sit down and we say, what is in the best interest of all of us?

1564
02:38:00,374 --> 02:38:04,695
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do that you don't really mind or think it's a bad idea?

1565
02:38:04,715 --> 02:38:06,536
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can I do that you don't?

1566
02:38:07,156 --> 02:38:07,877
[SPEAKER_00]: think is a bad idea.

1567
02:38:08,217 --> 02:38:13,701
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of idea that we can put everything on the table and come up with ways to find a way that we all win.

1568
02:38:14,161 --> 02:38:14,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's doable.

1569
02:38:15,322 --> 02:38:18,984
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do this on a daily basis with our union members.

1570
02:38:19,385 --> 02:38:25,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that they would think, and I think if you could get a chance to speak to them at the high school, that I have a respectful relationship to all of them.

1571
02:38:25,769 --> 02:38:29,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And we deal and address problems before they ever get to a grievance.

1572
02:38:29,412 --> 02:38:32,914
[SPEAKER_00]: They have yet to have a grievance at the high school, primarily because of that.

1573
02:38:33,395 --> 02:38:35,096
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not in the end stage of grievance.

1574
02:38:41,375 --> 02:38:47,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

1575
02:38:49,425 --> 02:38:54,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So during your tenure here, the foreign language program has increased a little bit.

1576
02:38:56,398 --> 02:39:17,385
[SPEAKER_02]: well, a significant amount, and I was wondering how you would go forward expanding into the middle school programs and elementary schools, which arguably are lacking, as well as using our diverse community to teach foreign language innovatively and outside of the classrooms.

1577
02:39:18,185 --> 02:39:19,185
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are correct.

1578
02:39:19,205 --> 02:39:24,847
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came, foreign language was taught five out of six days, and I made it a real priority.

1579
02:39:25,547 --> 02:39:29,489
[SPEAKER_00]: after listening to students and to teachers that it needed to be treated equally.

1580
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:32,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the things that I kind of made a stand on.

1581
02:39:33,872 --> 02:39:40,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only did we expand foreign language offerings, but we at this point offer it now to vocational technical students where it never was before.

1582
02:39:41,357 --> 02:39:43,538
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's valuable, it's necessary.

1583
02:39:44,398 --> 02:39:46,800
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I would love to explore

1584
02:39:47,401 --> 02:39:53,182
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think is a very worthwhile idea, is to create a dual-language school.

1585
02:39:53,682 --> 02:39:55,382
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a challenging concept.

1586
02:39:55,482 --> 02:40:08,305
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it doesn't happen overnight, but I think I would like to explore that, where a lot of districts feel that if you can create a dual-language school in these schools, what happens is it's two languages are taught at the same time in the early level.

1587
02:40:08,705 --> 02:40:12,465
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly the only way to create fluency, I believe, in a language.

1588
02:40:12,965 --> 02:40:16,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be an exciting experiment.

1589
02:40:17,407 --> 02:40:18,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it wouldn't happen overnight.

1590
02:40:18,608 --> 02:40:23,894
[SPEAKER_00]: It would require investigation, exploration, and a way to actually make it, see it through.

1591
02:40:24,174 --> 02:40:26,156
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that could be something we could discuss.

1592
02:40:26,757 --> 02:40:37,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I think foreign language is one of the things that we realize is that foreign languages right now are sort of traditional in what we offer, and that we did discuss two years ago looking at

1593
02:40:38,169 --> 02:40:42,210
[SPEAKER_00]: offering Mandarin, for instance, or Arabic.

1594
02:40:42,390 --> 02:40:53,613
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not approach that initially because of the concerns in my discussions with the director about the middle school piece to that and how that would really shake things up.

1595
02:40:53,853 --> 02:40:55,774
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just remove a foreign language.

1596
02:40:56,414 --> 02:41:00,155
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of teachers who teach that and there are a lot of individuals who are interested in that.

1597
02:41:00,755 --> 02:41:03,637
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it has to be taken very slowly and delicately.

1598
02:41:04,037 --> 02:41:13,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to continually look at what other districts do to offer foreign languages to students, what colleges are looking for, and ultimately what's going to get fluency in those languages.

1599
02:41:13,602 --> 02:41:21,226
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we're exploring this year is this sale of bilingual, the bilingual sale, which is a new idea that was just presented to me

1600
02:41:22,327 --> 02:41:22,868
[SPEAKER_00]: a few weeks ago.

1601
02:41:23,608 --> 02:41:35,018
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea is that we present students with the award and a seal that if they have a bilingual capacity, that should be something that is championed and celebrated.

1602
02:41:35,979 --> 02:41:39,362
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is part of the culture we have to sort of nurture.

1603
02:41:39,883 --> 02:41:41,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there are lots of opportunities.

1604
02:41:41,965 --> 02:41:43,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it begins with

1605
02:41:44,670 --> 02:41:46,974
[SPEAKER_00]: really valuing what that foreign languages offers.

1606
02:41:47,154 --> 02:41:52,302
[SPEAKER_00]: In some districts, foreign languages is sort of this side class that's not as important as mathematics and English.

1607
02:41:52,883 --> 02:41:53,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's missing the point.

1608
02:41:55,525 --> 02:42:15,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a follow-up sort of with diversity in language so the other half of that would be the EL population where there is a language barrier and I think around the school you sometimes will see you know

1609
02:42:17,514 --> 02:42:20,316
[SPEAKER_02]: different languages staying in their own cliques in a way.

1610
02:42:21,217 --> 02:42:26,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So how would you streamline EL students to integrate into the community?

1611
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:29,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, we have a plan in place for next year to do exactly that.

1612
02:42:30,162 --> 02:42:38,928
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we're lucky to have is an EL director who just got hired from Malden last year who has vast experience working with a larger EL population.

1613
02:42:39,548 --> 02:42:45,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things in the past two years we've seen is that the EL population actually grew to the point where it was reflected in our

1614
02:42:46,472 --> 02:42:53,037
[SPEAKER_00]: MCAS indicators, which was the first time that's ever happened, because it's usually been a very small population, at least on the high school level.

1615
02:42:53,678 --> 02:42:55,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those conversations are happening.

1616
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:57,381
[SPEAKER_00]: We're meeting with directors right now.

1617
02:42:58,522 --> 02:43:00,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a good plan in place.

1618
02:43:00,263 --> 02:43:08,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel I'm ready to present that yet, because I know we're working on it, but I do think that the idea is to integrate them, not to isolate them.

1619
02:43:09,250 --> 02:43:15,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the words integration a lot, because we use words like inclusion in special education and EL,

1620
02:43:15,895 --> 02:43:23,961
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, we want to integrate them into the fabric of the building, so it's not sort of a special group that we allow to come into this program, but they're part of the program.

1621
02:43:24,321 --> 02:43:29,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've got to continue to grow in that direction, and I feel like we're on the right path right now.

1622
02:43:29,044 --> 02:43:30,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1623
02:43:32,307 --> 02:43:33,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Benedetto.

1624
02:43:33,267 --> 02:43:33,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1625
02:43:34,668 --> 02:43:44,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So my official second question is, please elaborate on your experience with collective bargaining and large-scale budget development.

1626
02:43:45,057 --> 02:43:50,140
[SPEAKER_00]: So collective bargaining, I've been fortunate enough to be able to be part of the negotiation team this year.

1627
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:59,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in discussion with the superintendent throughout the past six years regarding needs for negotiation and for bargaining.

1628
02:44:00,185 --> 02:44:04,848
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I mentioned earlier is that I'm in continuous bargaining with the union.

1629
02:44:04,868 --> 02:44:06,909
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've been really working on is

1630
02:44:08,590 --> 02:44:16,416
[SPEAKER_00]: We're restricted by our contract for the structure of the contract, but yet we've done significant things that are quite different than we used to do it.

1631
02:44:16,636 --> 02:44:35,572
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we do that is through conversations and dialogue about what's best for students and how these things that seem foreign and maybe a little scary are actually not an attempt to force you to work harder or more than you had previously, but it's to give us all a better opportunity to teach children and to create a better learning environment.

1632
02:44:36,652 --> 02:44:37,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I would continue to do that.

1633
02:44:38,313 --> 02:44:47,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, again, I hope you get an opportunity to talk to the representatives at the high school, the union representatives, and how we interact on a monthly basis, I would say.

1634
02:44:48,379 --> 02:44:53,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of the times what we did was we sort of just had conversations prior to things being a problem.

1635
02:44:53,582 --> 02:44:56,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, lots of times it's really misunderstandings.

1636
02:44:57,384 --> 02:45:06,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding budgets, I think the budget process obviously is how we prioritize what is essential and what's discretionary as far as spending.

1637
02:45:07,251 --> 02:45:15,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Presently, we have a significant budget that where 82% of it is salaries for teachers and for faculty.

1638
02:45:16,197 --> 02:45:19,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So it leaves us a small area to sort of manage and to manipulate.

1639
02:45:20,319 --> 02:45:27,064
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that we would need to do that is to bring in obviously more revenues to slash costs

1640
02:45:27,624 --> 02:45:36,894
[SPEAKER_00]: areas such as energy or transportation and look at those areas is how can we save money and Also look to expand revenue coming into the district That's a concern.

1641
02:45:36,954 --> 02:45:49,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure for some of us here, you know, the more revenue the more we utilize our buildings the more we start to then have to address the safety of those buildings, so clearly there's a there's a There's a balance here.

1642
02:45:49,306 --> 02:45:50,067
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to establish

1643
02:45:50,740 --> 02:46:01,726
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways I think that I would look to that has not been really tapped into yet is the educational partnerships with these universities I previously mentioned.

1644
02:46:02,086 --> 02:46:14,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we consider that over 80% of the budget is on teaching staff, if we could augment and support teachers through these university partnerships, that would be a way I think that we could

1645
02:46:15,854 --> 02:46:17,994
[SPEAKER_00]: further reduce the budgetary needs.

1646
02:46:18,595 --> 02:46:21,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Budgetary process, I'm looking forward to being a bigger part of that.

1647
02:46:21,275 --> 02:46:23,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sat in budgetary meetings with the superintendent the past few years.

1648
02:46:24,376 --> 02:46:26,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the process.

1649
02:46:26,776 --> 02:46:29,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it from a system perspective.

1650
02:46:30,797 --> 02:46:40,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I would work with you, the school community, and with the business manager to make sure that we have a sound budget that represents the needs and the desires of the community.

1651
02:46:42,199 --> 02:46:42,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1652
02:46:42,899 --> 02:46:43,239
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1653
02:46:44,656 --> 02:46:44,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

1654
02:46:44,816 --> 02:46:47,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Vander Kloot, your mic.

1655
02:46:49,887 --> 02:46:59,914
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that you've done here, and it's easy to, it really wasn't that long ago, but it feels longer ago, was that you oversaw the reconstruction of the science labs.

1656
02:47:00,535 --> 02:47:10,061
[SPEAKER_13]: And as superintendent, there's the educational leadership, there's the budget, there's negotiations, and there's also keeping up with the buildings and grounds.

1657
02:47:10,702 --> 02:47:15,706
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the most challenging aspect of having a major building project in the building?

1658
02:47:16,106 --> 02:47:17,667
[SPEAKER_13]: And what did you learn from the experience?

1659
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:20,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was a great experience.

1660
02:47:20,801 --> 02:47:24,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very glad I got a chance to, you know, looking back it was a nightmare for me.

1661
02:47:25,625 --> 02:47:30,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I recall one morning we had four fire alarms before homeroom.

1662
02:47:30,829 --> 02:47:33,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fire alarm went off four times before we even had the first period.

1663
02:47:34,031 --> 02:47:35,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So students would come in, they'd go back out.

1664
02:47:35,553 --> 02:47:36,573
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd come in, they'd go back out.

1665
02:47:38,875 --> 02:47:54,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds of fire alarms during that year because of our system, and it really impressed on me the need to relax under times of crisis, to find humor at times, to share that humor with everyone in the building.

1666
02:47:55,029 --> 02:47:58,671
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had to lighten up a little bit, understand that this is a challenge for all of us.

1667
02:47:59,651 --> 02:48:11,977
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that, I remember, I think it was maybe my second year we did this, the superintendent and I literally walked around the building and identified ways that we could move 17 classrooms and find, how do we find 17 extra classrooms?

1668
02:48:12,918 --> 02:48:15,119
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have 17 extra classrooms, but we did it.

1669
02:48:15,579 --> 02:48:22,349
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it by galvanizing the entire building to understand this is something that's positive for all of us, for all of our students.

1670
02:48:22,549 --> 02:48:24,912
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to require a little sacrifice, but we can do that.

1671
02:48:25,733 --> 02:48:31,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was a really good lesson for me in managing people and managing concerns and really

1672
02:48:32,142 --> 02:48:33,542
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety in a lot of ways.

1673
02:48:33,862 --> 02:48:39,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if you look around right here, and this library is a perfect example, is we have a lot of work to do.

1674
02:48:40,324 --> 02:48:44,125
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a shot at it last year, and I know the superintendent and Ms.

1675
02:48:44,145 --> 02:48:50,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Patterson and myself have been actively working to continue that process of rebuilding sections of our school.

1676
02:48:50,787 --> 02:48:53,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't just end at the high school.

1677
02:48:53,408 --> 02:48:57,109
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the buildings at the middle of schools are all going to need new roofs in the next few years.

1678
02:48:58,809 --> 02:49:03,872
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the toll of public education is that we have to continually support these buildings.

1679
02:49:04,172 --> 02:49:11,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that most schools are crumbling is not just something people throw around.

1680
02:49:11,095 --> 02:49:14,077
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of evidence to that in the country as a whole.

1681
02:49:14,857 --> 02:49:18,059
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not given enough support and investment as it needs to be.

1682
02:49:18,339 --> 02:49:21,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to find ways to make it happen.

1683
02:49:21,881 --> 02:49:23,802
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're on the right path in this building.

1684
02:49:24,182 --> 02:49:25,523
[SPEAKER_00]: We envision this building to be

1685
02:49:26,543 --> 02:49:31,566
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next five, ten years to continuously have renovations happening in different sections of the building.

1686
02:49:31,586 --> 02:49:33,347
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way we're going to replace this school.

1687
02:49:33,827 --> 02:49:42,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned to the superintendent once that it would be beautiful if we had the high school up on the Field of Dreams overlooking the Boston skyline and I just was visioning my office seeing the Boston skyline.

1688
02:49:42,933 --> 02:49:47,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the millions and millions of dollars it would take, but it's never going to happen.

1689
02:49:47,455 --> 02:49:50,858
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would probably take millions of dollars to even just remove this building the way it's set up.

1690
02:49:51,818 --> 02:49:57,343
[SPEAKER_00]: This building has good bones and I think it can really take us into the next 25, 30 years.

1691
02:49:57,963 --> 02:50:03,768
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to continually, I have to do a better job obviously of understanding the needs of the elementary buildings and the middle school buildings.

1692
02:50:04,109 --> 02:50:08,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Although they're not as old, they're coming around the time where they're going to need support and help as well.

1693
02:50:09,273 --> 02:50:11,395
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be something that is balanced.

1694
02:50:11,475 --> 02:50:14,598
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a great education happening in a crumbling building.

1695
02:50:14,938 --> 02:50:17,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there needs to be an excitement.

1696
02:50:17,624 --> 02:50:19,429
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that with the science labs.

1697
02:50:19,469 --> 02:50:21,313
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw what that did for students in the community.

1698
02:50:21,654 --> 02:50:23,638
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to continue that in all other areas.

1699
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:29,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, John, you gave me a perfect segue because in your answer you mentioned anxiety.

1700
02:50:29,565 --> 02:50:32,186
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other question I really wanted to ask you tonight was about that.

1701
02:50:32,686 --> 02:50:36,607
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that students are presenting with is increasing levels of anxiety.

1702
02:50:37,208 --> 02:50:42,950
[SPEAKER_13]: How do we balance the emotional needs of students while maintaining academic rigor?

1703
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:51,893
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wondered if you could give me any, obviously because of confidentiality, I want to be very careful, but could you give me examples of how we can do that?

1704
02:50:54,201 --> 02:51:12,431
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that without the sense of belonging, without the serenity, the comfort level that comes with a student who feels at home in a building and invested, there really cannot be any higher learning.

1705
02:51:12,771 --> 02:51:13,812
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it restricts us.

1706
02:51:13,912 --> 02:51:14,633
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds us back.

1707
02:51:14,713 --> 02:51:18,795
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to where if you're angry, you're not able to logically think.

1708
02:51:19,215 --> 02:51:20,216
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this through science.

1709
02:51:20,896 --> 02:51:22,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the same applies to education.

1710
02:51:22,357 --> 02:51:28,061
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we do not meet those student needs, then we cannot have higher standards.

1711
02:51:28,481 --> 02:51:32,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we cannot have higher standards, but we cannot expect students to be able to perform to the highest capacity.

1712
02:51:33,725 --> 02:51:35,366
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that has to be the baseline.

1713
02:51:35,706 --> 02:51:47,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really the model I've applied in every situation I've ever been involved with in education is you create a foundation of trust, of positive, healthy culture where people feel comfortable and safe, and you build from there.

1714
02:51:47,614 --> 02:51:50,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is applicable to this situation as well.

1715
02:51:51,176 --> 02:51:57,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to bring students, and I think the example that I gave earlier of that student who came in from Cambridge is a good example of that.

1716
02:51:57,463 --> 02:52:03,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Until he felt he was part of this building, until he was a Mustang, he wasn't going to be successful.

1717
02:52:04,311 --> 02:52:09,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, he probably purposely pushed away from the school for that one reason, that he didn't feel connected to the school.

1718
02:52:10,217 --> 02:52:11,598
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this has to happen on all levels.

1719
02:52:11,638 --> 02:52:16,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I think elementary students have to feel like they're a part of the building as well as middle and high school.

1720
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:23,922
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just recently I happened to, maybe you've seen this as well, there's a lot of talk about Fred Rogers and his work in the 1970s.

1721
02:52:25,703 --> 02:52:26,604
[SPEAKER_00]: a documentary coming out.

1722
02:52:26,644 --> 02:52:35,630
[SPEAKER_00]: But it reminded me of the essential need that we have to support and help students find their voice and feel safe and secure wherever they may be.

1723
02:52:36,050 --> 02:52:37,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can't forget that.

1724
02:52:38,172 --> 02:52:40,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is really dependent on that ability.

1725
02:52:41,014 --> 02:52:41,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1726
02:52:42,815 --> 02:52:43,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Russo.

1727
02:52:45,117 --> 02:52:45,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello again.

1728
02:52:47,018 --> 02:52:50,881
[SPEAKER_04]: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?

1729
02:52:52,500 --> 02:52:57,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think recess is, if you define recess as a break from classroom instruction.

1730
02:52:58,959 --> 02:53:02,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that needs to be part of every school experience.

1731
02:53:02,641 --> 02:53:17,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And not because we need to run around and kick a ball at each other and play tag in a concrete yard, but that we need to find ways to infuse active participation in games and fun and get some laughter back into our schools.

1732
02:53:18,411 --> 02:53:20,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the things that make students feel comfortable.

1733
02:53:21,133 --> 02:53:25,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, one of the things we did this year is we opened up the gymnasium during lunch.

1734
02:53:26,076 --> 02:53:27,937
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't sure what was going to happen from that.

1735
02:53:28,338 --> 02:53:30,559
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know if it was going to have an impact or not.

1736
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:39,726
[SPEAKER_00]: But we thought, you know, maybe students want to throw a basketball around or hang out and burn off some steam before their fifth and sixth period classes.

1737
02:53:40,226 --> 02:53:42,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results were pretty profound.

1738
02:53:42,468 --> 02:53:43,408
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a change.

1739
02:53:43,789 --> 02:53:46,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers reported this to us as well, that students were calmer.

1740
02:53:46,811 --> 02:53:49,853
[SPEAKER_00]: They were more focused on their academics.

1741
02:53:50,393 --> 02:53:55,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's ludicrous for us to think that we can have a student sit in a chair for eight hours and be told

1742
02:53:56,218 --> 02:53:58,460
[SPEAKER_00]: what is happening and what's going to be on the test.

1743
02:53:58,920 --> 02:54:06,888
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've been trying to do this year and in the past few years is to encourage faculty and students to get outside and to have learning outside.

1744
02:54:07,388 --> 02:54:10,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not utilize the Fells Reservation, collect data.

1745
02:54:10,671 --> 02:54:15,416
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had teachers go out there and have poetry readings and discussions and our teachers go out and draw

1746
02:54:16,176 --> 02:54:21,378
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, and science teachers collect data from a variety of sources.

1747
02:54:21,719 --> 02:54:22,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to be creative.

1748
02:54:22,819 --> 02:54:31,543
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we made clear to the faculty two years ago was that 50% of learning should take place out of the chair.

1749
02:54:31,963 --> 02:54:32,863
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be getting up.

1750
02:54:32,903 --> 02:54:33,884
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be moving around.

1751
02:54:34,404 --> 02:54:36,005
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing healthy about sitting down.

1752
02:54:36,565 --> 02:54:37,046
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that.

1753
02:54:38,007 --> 02:54:47,676
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because teachers tend to, we end up teaching in these professional developments where teachers sit down for four hours and listen to a presentation and I'm always shaking my head thinking, no, this isn't right.

1754
02:54:48,037 --> 02:54:53,162
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still do it because it's easy and it's sort of structured in a way that we have control over.

1755
02:54:53,642 --> 02:55:00,409
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to let go of that control a little bit and understand that only by doing that will we be able to really engage students in a healthy way.

1756
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:16,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know over the recent years you have made some changes to the homework policy.

1757
02:55:17,049 --> 02:55:20,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you go over your beliefs in that and why you've made those changes?

1758
02:55:21,690 --> 02:55:23,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1759
02:55:23,972 --> 02:55:29,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the biggest change would be that I had instituted a homework-free Thanksgiving break.

1760
02:55:30,156 --> 02:55:30,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're referencing?

1761
02:55:31,537 --> 02:55:33,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's really the only major change.

1762
02:55:33,918 --> 02:55:40,963
[SPEAKER_00]: The other changes that we've probably put in place is that just more communication regarding how teachers plan and schedule homework and assignments.

1763
02:55:41,383 --> 02:55:48,609
[SPEAKER_00]: and be conscious of the fact that other teachers are also giving students hour and a half assignments as well.

1764
02:55:49,089 --> 02:55:53,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have five teachers giving an hour and a half assignment clearly that's not something that's doable or reasonable.

1765
02:55:54,713 --> 02:56:04,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So regarding the Thanksgiving break holiday what happened was I remember I had a couple conversations with parents about they were frustrated that their kids were coming home with

1766
02:56:05,933 --> 02:56:08,295
[SPEAKER_00]: with bagfuls of homework over Thanksgiving break.

1767
02:56:08,395 --> 02:56:16,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And one said to me, I always like Thanksgiving to be sort of a relaxing long weekend where we can enjoy family.

1768
02:56:16,321 --> 02:56:17,982
[SPEAKER_00]: And it struck me as true.

1769
02:56:18,162 --> 02:56:19,843
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel the same way.

1770
02:56:19,903 --> 02:56:21,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we do need breaks.

1771
02:56:21,765 --> 02:56:23,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's not too much to ask.

1772
02:56:24,807 --> 02:56:29,169
[SPEAKER_00]: for faculty members to let go and say, you know what, this is Thanksgiving break.

1773
02:56:29,189 --> 02:56:34,811
[SPEAKER_00]: And we picked Thanksgiving break not because of any special piece to that holiday, but it was early in the year.

1774
02:56:35,191 --> 02:56:39,793
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't going to impact AP testing and MCAS testing later in the year.

1775
02:56:39,833 --> 02:56:45,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know stakes get higher, but we wanted to give them a little break to sort of

1776
02:56:46,505 --> 02:56:48,686
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to them, to hear them, and say, you know, you deserve a break.

1777
02:56:48,866 --> 02:56:49,566
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a challenge.

1778
02:56:49,686 --> 02:56:50,086
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.

1779
02:56:50,106 --> 02:56:55,949
[SPEAKER_00]: The first few years, I had, you know, people telling me, oh, yeah, he gave us a break until Tuesday.

1780
02:56:56,229 --> 02:56:57,810
[SPEAKER_00]: We had all the assignments due on Tuesday.

1781
02:56:58,370 --> 02:57:01,051
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sometimes they would, you know, I see Justin now on his head.

1782
02:57:01,371 --> 02:57:03,452
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a challenge to negotiate that.

1783
02:57:03,472 --> 02:57:05,453
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could, I don't feel comfortable

1784
02:57:06,693 --> 02:57:09,516
[SPEAKER_00]: going into a teacher and say, I'm telling you, you are not to do this.

1785
02:57:09,556 --> 02:57:13,760
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do tell faculty members is, this is what parents think is important, and I think it's important.

1786
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:22,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell the community that this is something that we do as a gift to the students, as a break for them, and a break for the family, and a gift for them as well.

1787
02:57:26,351 --> 02:57:26,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1788
02:57:30,754 --> 02:57:32,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to talk to you about budgeting.

1789
02:57:33,036 --> 02:57:35,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So community engagement is critical to a successful budget.

1790
02:57:36,418 --> 02:57:41,041
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, how would you construct your first draft of next year's school budget?

1791
02:57:41,782 --> 02:57:45,465
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts?

1792
02:57:46,465 --> 02:57:50,228
[SPEAKER_05]: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?

1793
02:57:50,688 --> 02:57:54,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And how would you hold your administration responsible for the budget itself?

1794
02:57:56,823 --> 02:58:04,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first budget I would, I believe I would have the capacity to work with the superintendent presently.

1795
02:58:04,070 --> 02:58:10,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was part of the future budgeting plans and I think that's important.

1796
02:58:10,297 --> 02:58:13,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I think not so much because for him to dictate what the budget should be.

1797
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:25,390
[SPEAKER_00]: but that the budget process is unique to each community and I think ultimately what we'd have to do is as a team, the school committee and myself, we'd have to identify how do we want to best approach this.

1798
02:58:25,710 --> 02:58:40,082
[SPEAKER_00]: It's again, it's about prioritizing, it's about having deep conversations about what is essential and what's discretionary, what is something that we need to do today and what is something we need to plan for in a year and two years from now and be aware of.

1799
02:58:41,979 --> 02:58:43,379
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would approach it in that way.

1800
02:58:43,399 --> 02:58:47,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd have to be sort of a continuous conversation.

1801
02:58:47,681 --> 02:58:49,441
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that doesn't happen only in the spring.

1802
02:58:49,941 --> 02:58:51,942
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that happens the whole year.

1803
02:58:53,382 --> 02:59:00,664
[SPEAKER_00]: It's continuous in the sense that I as a superintendent would have to be conscious of what's coming down the road as far as state

1804
02:59:01,124 --> 02:59:04,526
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations and budgetary changes.

1805
02:59:04,546 --> 02:59:10,510
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for instance, we don't know what the federal government's support to our school budgets is going to look like a year from now.

1806
02:59:10,590 --> 02:59:11,771
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be vastly different.

1807
02:59:12,311 --> 02:59:19,675
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to anticipate that so that we're not sort of sitting out on a limb by ourselves trying to figure out how to now make up money that we didn't anticipate not having.

1808
02:59:20,936 --> 02:59:25,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hold all members of the administration accountable to that budget because this is how we operate.

1809
02:59:26,239 --> 02:59:28,781
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also understand that a budget is fluid.

1810
02:59:29,781 --> 02:59:30,822
[SPEAKER_00]: in many ways.

1811
02:59:31,242 --> 02:59:36,905
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's put in like 10 commandments and here it is and we don't budge off it.

1812
02:59:36,965 --> 02:59:39,326
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we have to work with as best we can.

1813
02:59:39,746 --> 02:59:42,508
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key, I believe, is to be very transparent about that.

1814
02:59:42,688 --> 02:59:45,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are concerns in the community about that.

1815
02:59:45,209 --> 02:59:50,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the last thing we'd ever want is to be any doubt about our motives or our objectives.

1816
02:59:51,372 --> 02:59:51,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to

1817
02:59:53,573 --> 03:00:01,079
[SPEAKER_00]: be in constant communication and just make sure that we share the same priorities and that whatever the priorities the school committee decides, I make them happen.

1818
03:00:03,561 --> 03:00:09,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you engage with the community to do presentations for the budget and how would you receive their input as you move along?

1819
03:00:11,414 --> 03:00:12,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.

1820
03:00:12,594 --> 03:00:16,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I anticipate and plan to engage with the community in lots of ways.

1821
03:00:16,576 --> 03:00:30,840
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I'm very excited about is getting out there and being a face for the school departments, especially in the elementary and middle schools where I don't know as much and I'm excited to be walking around elementary schools to be honest with you.

1822
03:00:31,780 --> 03:00:33,682
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the laughter and to see what's happening there.

1823
03:00:34,622 --> 03:00:35,723
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.

1824
03:00:35,923 --> 03:00:39,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to understand what the community feels.

1825
03:00:39,786 --> 03:00:48,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's part of the role of the school committee, right, is to sort of channel that, channel that if it's interest or if it's concern in specific areas.

1826
03:00:48,933 --> 03:00:51,375
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to be a continuous conversation regarding it.

1827
03:00:51,675 --> 03:00:53,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we can work in a vacuum from the community.

1828
03:00:54,717 --> 03:00:56,318
[SPEAKER_00]: We represent the community.

1829
03:00:56,458 --> 03:01:00,101
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's essential that we understand what their goals and objectives are.

1830
03:01:00,851 --> 03:01:05,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and finally, how would you notice if there was a problem with the budget?

1831
03:01:05,420 --> 03:01:07,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it is, like you said, a fluid document.

1832
03:01:07,625 --> 03:01:12,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So what indicators would you look for when things start to go wrong, and how would you adjust it?

1833
03:01:13,863 --> 03:01:23,265
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would obviously be working hand-in-hand with our business manager to continuously review our financial situation and health.

1834
03:01:23,766 --> 03:01:26,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the financial health of a community is the utmost importance.

1835
03:01:28,227 --> 03:01:31,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything could collapse if it's not really taken care of.

1836
03:01:31,868 --> 03:01:39,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess indicators would be to truly understand what's coming in as far as revenue and what's going out as far as spending.

1837
03:01:40,170 --> 03:01:41,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to anticipate

1838
03:01:42,110 --> 03:01:45,092
[SPEAKER_00]: always for bad situations to take place.

1839
03:01:45,572 --> 03:01:52,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's storms, maybe it's a couple of blizzards in a row, or a roof breaking, or a variety of things.

1840
03:01:52,916 --> 03:01:59,579
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things the superintendent has impressed on me in the past few years is that you never know what's coming around the corner, so you have to be ready for that.

1841
03:01:59,659 --> 03:02:01,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have a reserve.

1842
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:03,061
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be a saver.

1843
03:02:03,161 --> 03:02:03,961
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be a planner.

1844
03:02:04,502 --> 03:02:09,164
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, and I suppose that's really for anybody who's budgeting in any organization.

1845
03:02:09,999 --> 03:02:11,960
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a home or if it's a school district.

1846
03:02:12,400 --> 03:02:13,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would take that approach.

1847
03:02:13,781 --> 03:02:20,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's essential that we continuously review it and realize that it's a critical component.

1848
03:02:21,023 --> 03:02:21,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1849
03:02:22,744 --> 03:02:23,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

1850
03:02:24,184 --> 03:02:24,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Any follow-ups?

1851
03:02:27,066 --> 03:02:27,506
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all set?

1852
03:02:28,706 --> 03:02:29,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin?

1853
03:02:30,747 --> 03:02:30,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1854
03:02:33,107 --> 03:02:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about the VOC and one of the biggest issues that we've seen with the integration of the VOC in high school is grade alignment.

1855
03:02:45,272 --> 03:02:53,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people who were in the top 10 in the VOC now find themselves in the top 100 at Medford High.

1856
03:02:53,696 --> 03:02:58,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people from the VOC do want to attend four-year institutions.

1857
03:02:58,939 --> 03:03:02,762
[SPEAKER_03]: They rely on their GPA, their ranking.

1858
03:03:02,982 --> 03:03:06,304
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you attempt to balance the situation or solve this?

1859
03:03:06,564 --> 03:03:17,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second part to this question is, how would you make sure that VOC students overall do feel like they're part of the Medford High community and not overshadowed by Medford High students?

1860
03:03:19,841 --> 03:03:25,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So the site council actually is, has identified this same exact concern you're presenting.

1861
03:03:26,169 --> 03:03:34,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we put a group together called a vocational student, I forget the term we used, but it's basically

1862
03:03:35,319 --> 03:03:37,761
[SPEAKER_00]: put together to address those concerns.

1863
03:03:38,961 --> 03:03:41,943
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we look at the integration from the vocational student's perspective?

1864
03:03:42,143 --> 03:03:44,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of perspectives in integration.

1865
03:03:44,065 --> 03:03:51,309
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at it from the community, from the faculty members, from administration, from how DESE reviews us, but how do we look at it from the student's perspective?

1866
03:03:51,970 --> 03:03:53,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to

1867
03:03:54,491 --> 03:04:03,215
[SPEAKER_00]: typically focus on the positives, that they're getting expanded foreign language offerings and they're able to integrate in the building freely.

1868
03:04:04,016 --> 03:04:11,419
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to take fine art courses and orchestra courses and things of that nature.

1869
03:04:11,759 --> 03:04:16,041
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no denying that there are costs to these changes.

1870
03:04:16,502 --> 03:04:23,425
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need to do is be aware of them, be sensitive to them, and to listen to those students about how they feel and how we can actually

1871
03:04:23,985 --> 03:04:25,927
[SPEAKER_00]: make changes to address those concerns.

1872
03:04:26,628 --> 03:04:31,594
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the long run, I think there are growing pains to the integration process.

1873
03:04:32,215 --> 03:04:33,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 10 years from now, for instance,

1874
03:04:34,335 --> 03:04:38,979
[SPEAKER_00]: People will look back and not really be aware of some of the growing pains, but they exist.

1875
03:04:39,019 --> 03:04:44,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we need to do is address them with sincerity, like we are doing now.

1876
03:04:44,583 --> 03:04:45,464
[SPEAKER_00]: We're listening to students.

1877
03:04:45,484 --> 03:04:47,245
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to understand what those problems are.

1878
03:04:47,725 --> 03:04:50,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific to the GPA, that's a concern.

1879
03:04:50,687 --> 03:04:51,568
[SPEAKER_00]: We are one building.

1880
03:04:52,109 --> 03:04:56,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're one building, how do we separate those students and different rankings?

1881
03:04:56,952 --> 03:05:02,116
[SPEAKER_00]: The compromise we created this year was to create a separate sort of identity as a program or a school

1882
03:05:03,357 --> 03:05:07,904
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could list that, but to be honest with you, that's a temporary solution.

1883
03:05:08,285 --> 03:05:12,171
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot continuously divide the building out like that.

1884
03:05:13,217 --> 03:05:19,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, I expect that the top ten students in the vocational program will be commonplace.

1885
03:05:20,139 --> 03:05:30,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the bioengineering programs, for instance, all those academic programs that you're referencing, those are going to draw on some of the higher achieving students in the building.

1886
03:05:30,563 --> 03:05:34,604
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a valedictorian a few years back that would have been the perfect student for bioengineering.

1887
03:05:34,964 --> 03:05:36,685
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified and said she would have been perfect for this.

1888
03:05:37,545 --> 03:05:39,027
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't exist at the time.

1889
03:05:39,147 --> 03:05:43,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was a traditional high school student and probably lost out on some opportunities because of that.

1890
03:05:43,831 --> 03:05:49,295
[SPEAKER_00]: But we hope to create a system that sort of engages all students in that way.

1891
03:05:49,695 --> 03:05:50,996
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you bring up a really good point.

1892
03:05:51,056 --> 03:05:53,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes beyond sort of the GPA concern.

1893
03:05:53,338 --> 03:05:55,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are also concerns that came up this year.

1894
03:05:56,180 --> 03:06:02,886
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need to do is to be sensitive to those concerns and to identify ways that we can resolve them.

1895
03:06:05,494 --> 03:06:06,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Justin.

1896
03:06:06,875 --> 03:06:09,317
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we'd like to open it up for a closing statement from you.

1897
03:06:10,378 --> 03:06:10,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1898
03:06:12,168 --> 03:06:18,450
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to really heartfully thank this committee for this opportunity.

1899
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:22,551
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I probably will never forget.

1900
03:06:24,071 --> 03:06:28,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cherish that opportunity to speak to you like this and to be challenged by your questions.

1901
03:06:29,393 --> 03:06:36,915
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to leave you with three attributes that I hope you take home with you to convey why I'm the guy for this job.

1902
03:06:37,035 --> 03:06:39,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the person that you want to hire for this job.

1903
03:06:41,795 --> 03:06:47,858
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'm an educational expert in urban education and leadership.

1904
03:06:49,518 --> 03:06:55,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a vision, I have a plan, and I have the means to achieve it.

1905
03:06:57,062 --> 03:07:01,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, I have an effective educational leadership style and approach.

1906
03:07:02,512 --> 03:07:11,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly hope you have an opportunity to talk to stakeholders that I interact with on a daily basis, and I believe that they will echo much that you have heard here tonight.

1907
03:07:12,994 --> 03:07:22,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, organizational change and progress takes patience, it takes strategic planning and thinking, and it takes time.

1908
03:07:24,896 --> 03:07:30,417
[SPEAKER_00]: You've invested in me in the past six years as your headmaster, and I've invested in this community.

1909
03:07:31,789 --> 03:07:37,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And if given the opportunity to be the superintendent of this school system, I will see this through to the end.

1910
03:07:38,616 --> 03:07:43,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will remain a Method Mustang as long as you'll have me.

1911
03:07:45,283 --> 03:07:45,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1912
03:08:28,993 --> 03:08:29,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
