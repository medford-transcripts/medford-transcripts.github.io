1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:01,053
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:02,396
My name is Andre LaRue.

3
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,781
I'm the chair of the Medford Community Development Board.

4
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:10,312
This is the September 22nd Community Development Board meeting.

5
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:12,874
and I call this meeting to order.

6
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:19,539
Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this hearing of the Medford Community Development Board will be conducted via remote means.

7
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:24,462
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein.

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:30,487
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting

9
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,448
shall be by remote means only.

10
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:46,457
Reminders to participate during the meeting outside of the Zoom platform, questions and comments may be emailed to OCD at Medford-MA.gov or submitted via phone to 781-393-2480.

11
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,398
So that's OCD at Medford-MA.gov or 781-393-2480.

12
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:05,581
2480.

13
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:05,581
The meeting will not be live streamed, but will be recorded and made available for viewing afterwards at Medford Community Media.

14
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,662
All votes will be roll call votes.

15
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:13,985
So please, board members and members of the public, please introduce yourselves when you speak.

16
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:24,010
First item on the agenda is approval of minutes for both July and August.

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,431
Are there any

18
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:31,829
questions, comments, edits for the July CD board minutes.

19
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,250
Andre, this is Jackie Furtado, vice chair.

20
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:50,835
I have already spoke to Amanda offline about this, but I only feel it appropriate in the minutes for me to be approved, to me to be referred to as vice chair as I was voted in and has since served in that for the last year, as opposed to board member.

21
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,256
That's my only contribution.

22
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:55,337
Good reminder.

23
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:59,174
Can you make those changes, Amanda, in the documents?

24
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,476
Thank you.

25
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:06,279
Any other comments, edits?

26
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:10,122
Seeing none.

27
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:12,103
Yeah, are there any?

28
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:13,104
Oh, sorry.

29
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:22,491
I just wanted to mention David Bloomberg had submitted a couple kind of grammatical and smaller edits, which will be included as well.

30
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:31,412
All right, do we have a motion to approve the July minutes?

31
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:37,313
This is David, I'd like to offer a motion to approve the minutes from our July meeting.

32
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,874
Okay, with edits.

33
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,655
Is there a second?

34
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:43,815
No second.

35
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,095
Great, thanks class.

36
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:48,236
Roll call vote.

37
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,416
Deanna Peabody.

38
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:51,517
Aye.

39
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:53,317
Christy Dowd.

40
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:54,397
Aye.

41
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:55,718
David Blumberg.

42
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:56,478
Aye.

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,693
last address and Jackie Furtado.

44
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:06,157
The minutes for July unanimously approved.

45
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:11,882
Any questions, comments, edits on the August CD board meeting minutes?

46
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,308
Is there a motion to approve?

47
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:25,579
Andre David, I'd like to offer a motion to approve the August minutes or the minutes from our August meeting.

48
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:32,920
I'm not sure if Jackie's title needs to be updated there as well, but of course that would, I think go without saying to make that adjustment if necessary.

49
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,181
Thank you, David.

50
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,961
I actually abstain from the August minutes.

51
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,341
I did not attend the meeting.

52
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:41,482
But we will include that.

53
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:42,022
Yes.

54
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:46,843
So, okay.

55
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:47,543
Is there a second?

56
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,740
This is Christy Dowd, I second.

57
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,023
A roll call, Deanna Peabody?

58
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:55,843
Aye.

59
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:57,284
Christy Dowd?

60
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,024
Aye.

61
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,325
David Blumberg?

62
00:03:59,765 --> 00:03:59,906
Aye.

63
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:01,567
Klaus Andresen?

64
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,669
I don't believe I was at that meeting either.

65
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:06,530
I could be wrong.

66
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,952
So abstain, I believe.

67
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,474
And Jackie Furtado?

68
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:14,875
I abstain.

69
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,402
And Klaes and I both were out, I recall.

70
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,884
We were both unavailable for that meeting.

71
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:31,191
Amanda, since we only have three, wait, one, two, no, we got four.

72
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:36,074
Is that enough to approve those minutes?

73
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,637
Yes, yeah.

74
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:44,580
Four out of the, even if there were seven full members would still be fine.

75
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:45,881
Okay.

76
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:47,913
Thank you.

77
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:51,201
Minutes are unanimously approved.

78
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,397
for both July and August.

79
00:04:57,937 --> 00:05:05,099
Next item on the agenda is the site plan review recommendation to the Board of Appeals for 200 Boston Avenue.

80
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,400
Just a reminder that the Zoning Board of Appeals, the ZBA, is a special permit granting authority.

81
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:17,722
So this board, the Community Development Board, is charged with providing a set of recommendations to the ZBA.

82
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:23,853
My understanding is that they'll be opening their hearing on this project soon.

83
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:29,958
So we are hoping to send them some recommendations at this meeting.

84
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,020
Andre, this is David.

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:32,860
Yes.

86
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:39,846
As I did with the July meeting, I'll have to recuse myself as the applicant is my employer.

87
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:46,432
I'll go ahead and mute myself and turn off my video and not participate in this part of our meeting.

88
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:49,116
Thank you.

89
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:10,468
So the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on September 15th, 2021 after 6 p.m.

90
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:29,598
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review submitted by Simmons Properties LLC and represented by Cummings Properties to construct a three-story addition and perform renovations to an existing non-conforming structure at 200 Boston Avenue to be used as a research and testing laboratory facility.

91
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:33,020
This is an allowed use in an industrial zoning district.

92
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:46,238
The project is subject to a site plan review special permit as per the City of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 section 94-331 and requires approvals from the Board of Appeals.

93
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:52,963
So we will have a site plan review as already noted.

94
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:56,286
I understand that

95
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:11,094
We have someone from representing Cummings Properties, Micah Avini, the senior project architect, who will be able to give us a presentation about the changes that have been made to the project since we saw it last time.

96
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:14,334
Thank you, Chair LaRue.

97
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:19,516
Thank you to Community Development Board for having us this evening, and the public for joining us.

98
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:24,697
I will ask Amanda if I can share my screen.

99
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,338
Yep, you should be good.

100
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:31,474
screen, screen one, share.

101
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:35,236
Can you see it?

102
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:36,957
Excellent.

103
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:38,598
We can see it.

104
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:41,219
Okay.

105
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,340
Can you hear me?

106
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:44,702
Awesome.

107
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,411
Um, thank you again.

108
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:48,812
Thanks for having us this evening.

109
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,012
Um, again, my name is Michael Levine.

110
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:56,413
I'm a senior project architect with Cummings properties with me this evening is, um, Michael Maduno.

111
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:58,614
He's an architectural designer with Cummings properties.

112
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:06,756
Um, Jim Trudeau, who's the chief design officer with Cummings properties and Eric Anderson, who's the president of Cummings properties.

113
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,597
Following up our July 21st community development board meeting.

114
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:25,151
and subsequent communications with various Medford officials, we are here to ask the board to reconsider its previous recommendation to construct an addition to the existing building at 200 Boston Ave.

115
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:39,395
More specifically, since our last appearance, circumstances have changed and the proponent seeks to downsize the building addition, eliminating a floor and reducing the mass of the parking structure.

116
00:08:42,743 --> 00:09:00,568
The previously recommended project proposed redevelopment of a single level parking structure into a five story structure consisting of approximately 67,000 gross square feet of mixed use research and testing laboratory with 133 additional structured parking spaces.

117
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:13,940
This included approximately 6,100 gross square feet of ground level space that could be purposed as commercial slash retail slash community amenity space.

118
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:29,433
The revised project before the board this evening proposes redevelopment of the single level parking structure to a four story structure of approximately 41,000 gross square feet of mixed use research and testing space.

119
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,556
with an additional 40 structured parking spaces.

120
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:44,441
This proposal includes up to 2000 gross square feet on the ground level that is intended for the commercial retail community amenity space.

121
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:50,764
We have a short presentation that I'd like to share with the board and the public.

122
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,786
It's a combination of the information shared at the various meetings.

123
00:09:55,792 --> 00:10:01,275
we've had to this point in the municipal, the latest set of municipal approval documents that we submitted.

124
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:18,546
So screen one, as you can see here, and I hope you can see the, as I move my cursor around, not to make anybody motion sick, but as you can see, this is what we propose the revised project to look like.

125
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:20,467
It will be

126
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:22,984
The previous project had three stories.

127
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:35,907
This project would be two stories above the existing parking space, really with the same architecture, as was presented at the previous meeting, but the previously recommended structure.

128
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,208
Let me see how I can.

129
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:42,579
Okay, good.

130
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,901
This is a similar view of the garage.

131
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:51,246
As I mentioned earlier, we are looking to remove some of the structured parking.

132
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:56,190
The structured parking that we proposed last time, we're looking to downscale that as well.

133
00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:02,355
So this would be our vision of the project, south looking north.

134
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:08,445
Again, very similar to the last project, the massing and the scale was reduced.

135
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:25,298
And actually, let me let me step back 111 step here, you know, part of the probably the biggest question that might be asked is what why are we looking to reduce the size of this project, as we introduce this project to the city.

136
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:45,662
I think it was probably last December, it was done as partially speculative but really very significantly we had a client who's in the building now who was looking to expand and had done everything but you know signed on the dotted line to commit for this project.

137
00:11:47,904 --> 00:12:03,033
Literally, we met on the 21st it was wasn't but two or three days and the 21st of July was a Wednesday it might have been that Friday, the client informed us that indeed they were going to look elsewhere that this campus as a whole, didn't have enough space to suit them.

138
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:12,407
We took this opportunity to say, okay, well, does this size of a building still make sense?

139
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:31,743
And that information combined with some of the comments that we, some of the feedback that we did get at that July 21st meeting made us think, okay, maybe we should take a quick relook at this and maybe we could downsize it, come up with a product that still serves the needs of

140
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:41,546
of the community still serves the needs of the project proponent and makes sense, and still fits in the scale of the neighborhood.

141
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:47,448
So, I'm sure you've never heard this before I don't know how many times a developer has come and asked.

142
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:51,770
a project proponent has come and asked to make it smaller, but that's what we're here to do this evening.

143
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,672
It's totally new to me, 35 years doing this, first time ever.

144
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,113
We're all going to have a different experience here for sure.

145
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:01,694
So that really is kind of in a nutshell.

146
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:09,558
We're very much still committed to making something happen here at this particular site.

147
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:14,100
We believe that regardless of the potential

148
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:19,388
that the existing client that we were looking to build this for is going to move on.

149
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:25,972
We believe that this is still a very viable project and we're looking to move forward and very excited about it.

150
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:30,834
So enough with that, I'll share with you some of the documents that I have here.

151
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:41,275
Again, another view of the north end of the building looking south, very similar to what we presented at the last meeting.

152
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:49,656
Still with the connector bridge that helps it become an addition, retains the addition value of the building.

153
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:56,778
Again, if you were to compare the two packages, I think you'd see that they're very exactly the same.

154
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:22,041
Again, I'll quickly go through some of these other documents because we're getting into the this is the package that the revised package that we submitted to the Community Development Board as part of this very similar, you know, looking existing conditions looking south looking east looking north, the locus plan, nothing changes the building is going to be in the exact same spot that we had proposed it to be the first time around.

155
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:27,066
As you can see here, down at the bottom right-hand corner, the existing parking structure.

156
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:30,547
I'm going to build right on top of that as we had previously proposed.

157
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,770
Again, cover sheet, nothing but the date changed here.

158
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,272
Again, very similar to what we had shown last time.

159
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,053
Actually, the sheet is exactly the same.

160
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:46,176
The yellow highlight shows the existing parking structure.

161
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:51,819
The green shows what would be the roof where

162
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:55,130
Um, here on the north end is the proposed commercial part of it.

163
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:06,575
And this piece, um, this, this piece that goes to the south would be, um, where the additional parking, the one level of parking structure is going to go above the existing parking that's there now.

164
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:19,480
Um, again, this it's interesting, this, another important thing to, um, that we thought about when we were doing this is again, this is a pretty in our, in our experience, a dense urban site and.

165
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,603
To downsize it will certainly simplify it for us.

166
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:31,228
It will certainly make it less intrusive, not only to the rest of the site, but the neighborhood.

167
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:39,995
And we think we can do it much more efficiently and potentially do it as one operation.

168
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:43,338
I think last time we discussed this, we had a phasing plan.

169
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:49,563
and it was going to be, we were thinking about the garage first and then the commercial aspect of it second.

170
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:56,027
And one of the comments, oh, what if the garage got built and you decide you didn't need the commercial zone?

171
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:57,628
That was never gonna happen.

172
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:01,911
We're not looking to build more of a garage here, but I think this might help us.

173
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:10,837
And I'm not gonna say for certain, but it'll help us make this a lot easier to construct based on the tight site that we have here.

174
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:16,486
Um, again, this is, uh, I'm going to kind of breeze through the utility plans here.

175
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:21,290
Nothing changes regarding the utilities, um, the water and the sewer.

176
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:31,276
I think subsequently to subsequent to our last meeting, we did meet on site with Peter Kerger and we're able to kind of nail down how the water and the sewer work on the site.

177
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,918
So we're, um, we're kind of on track with that.

178
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:34,778
Nothing changes.

179
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:41,563
Um, the gas and the electrical all going to come from the same, same locations that we thought they were going to come from when we met.

180
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:42,828
back in July.

181
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:46,370
Again, grading and drainage, nothing changes.

182
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,531
The footprint doesn't change.

183
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:51,953
We'll address the grading and the drainage exactly the same as we had proposed in the past.

184
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,795
I'm sorry, let me go back one here.

185
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:57,873
landscape plan, interestingly enough.

186
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:05,898
So with the downsized project, it may or may not be less disruptive to the existing.

187
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:10,981
It certainly will in front of the commercial spot here on the northern part of the site.

188
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:16,964
We won't be doing as much work in the buffer between the existing building and the sidewalk.

189
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:21,567
So to the extent that the landscape will be revised, my guess it will be

190
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:29,216
We will probably unfortunately destroy some of it building this, and I expect we'll do somewhat of a replacement.

191
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:44,804
The new landscaping area here on the North end, which will be the outdoor space attached to the amenity or the outdoor space attached to the campus really, is where the focus of the landscaping will be.

192
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,285
And it will be very similar to what we proposed last time.

193
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,246
I don't expect it to be much different.

194
00:17:51,307 --> 00:18:01,112
specific plants and specific expansion of that program might happen depending on the time of year that we can get the plants.

195
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:17,361
One of the other things that we had mentioned last, one of the things that came up last time, and if I can, if you can point your direction here to the, I'm going to say the southwest corner of the site, we added some, when you pull into that southern driveway, we added some landscaping in that area.

196
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:18,682
One of the comments was to

197
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:23,746
Um, pull the parking potentially a little away from the street.

198
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:30,072
So we have eliminated a couple of parking spaces and added landscaping there to make that transition a little smoother.

199
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:42,503
This slide is shows you the ground floor plan and in red on the bottom left hand corner.

200
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:48,082
would be the amenity space that's proposed for that area.

201
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:59,632
Again, indoor bicycle parking space right here, and we're gonna maintain the existing indoor bicycle parking space that's currently in the garage as well.

202
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:04,756
So we believe there will be ample bicycle accommodations.

203
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:08,780
And then this is very similar to

204
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:26,364
What we had proposed in July, the footprint of this doesn't stay the same it's still roughly, I think this is about 19,000 square feet per floor might have been really run 20 before we've tweaked it a little bit but I don't think there's much to it.

205
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:29,066
Really, virtually the same footprint.

206
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:35,763
Again, second and third floor, this would be the proposed third floor proposed roof plan.

207
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:47,367
Again, as we're looking for this to be a really kind of a life science research and testing facility, we do expect there'll be some equipment on the roof and much like was discussed last time.

208
00:19:48,307 --> 00:20:01,112
And one of the conditions of the recommendation from the community development board back in July was to make sure that we considered low zone equipment, low zone fans

209
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:09,663
equipment that would be not so noisy, and we will continue to, we agree with that, and we will continue to work towards that.

210
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:22,312
On the southern end of this is where we expect there will, the roof is solar ready, and we will work within the solar ordinance to comply with that.

211
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:29,817
We work with the community development department to comply with the solar ordinance in the city of Medford.

212
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:44,081
Again, these are sections that, just some schematic sections of how this will all together, this cut through if you're looking, at this point, you'd be looking from east to west, leasable space here.

213
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:49,422
Again, previous one had an extra story here and a full couple of levels of garage.

214
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:56,405
We're able to downsize it so that everything should work in this configuration.

215
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:00,446
Schematic elevations.

216
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:04,167
Again, the architecture is very similar.

217
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:17,538
I know there were some comments about the architecture, which we can get to if the board so chooses, but the, you know, the architecture was intended to be mimic what we had done the previous submission.

218
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,602
Again, just a kind of an isometric of what the building will look like.

219
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:27,446
Again, there's the, again, a kind of a,

220
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:42,941
Google Earth version with the building loaded right into there, very similar to last time, a little smaller than the adjacent building, larger building in the background, a little smaller, so it kind of steps down as you reach the street.

221
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:48,744
And again, this is just the rendering package that we had shared before.

222
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:56,088
Shadow study, good thing about this project is obviously with it being less massive, the shadows will

223
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,204
be even less intrusive if not at all intrusive on the neighbors.

224
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:07,927
And again, I think that's the same rendering that we had shared with you in the past.

225
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:13,349
North looking south and I'd be happy to open it up to any questions.

226
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,191
Thank you, Mr. Vaney.

227
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:35,527
I know we have the city's director of transportation and traffic, Todd Blake, and I think he has to leave soon so I'm going to invite him to make any, any observations if he's here and wants to do that.

228
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:40,874
Hi, thank you, Mr. Chair.

229
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:50,642
So, I just want to comment on the memo that was submitted with the estimate of how they would tackle the formally agreed upon mitigation items.

230
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:57,208
It seemed like my recollection from the first meeting was that the

231
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:14,362
There was a trade off between doing certain mitigation on DCR roadways that may be safety related or signal related to doing more on city owned roads, but it didn't seem like the memo necessarily reflected that the equivalent dollar amount.

232
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:37,878
So for instance, the green improved markings for the bike lane in the vicinity of the site stated for crossings but I think to get up to the equivalent amount, it would extend much further up Boston Ave so we're just looking for some clarity on that and make sure we're all on the same page with expectations of the board as well.

233
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:42,234
Yeah, I could.

234
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:47,358
Mr. Avini, would you also mind stopping your screen sharing just so we can see everybody?

235
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:48,619
Okay.

236
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:49,419
Stop share.

237
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:51,100
Thank you.

238
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,460
Excellent.

239
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:54,803
Oh, does that, I didn't realize that impacted how everybody saw things.

240
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:55,603
Interesting.

241
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:56,804
Okay.

242
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:58,345
Yeah.

243
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,266
So thank you, Mr. Blake.

244
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:02,048
Yeah, it's interesting.

245
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:08,412
I was looking at the, when we looked at how we were gonna,

246
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:14,416
well, not how we're gonna, the things that wanted to be addressed as the traffic mitigation.

247
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:24,142
I didn't have a chance to look back at the notes and I wasn't sure, I think from your original comment letter,

248
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,072
it suggested some of these things, but it wasn't clear how far we're going to go.

249
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:35,636
And then I went back and I was able to see some of the meeting minutes and we clearly talked about up to Winthrop street.

250
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:39,258
So absolutely we'll go up to Winthrop street and I've actually revised it.

251
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,460
I have it in my hand.

252
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,543
I was looking at that recently and we'll be happy to revise that and share it.

253
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:49,844
It's kind of scribbly now, but I'll be happy to revise that and share that with you.

254
00:24:51,864 --> 00:25:07,298
If we carried all nine intersections and that's what it is, we would very much be up at the, not that it was a magic number, but it would be very close if not exceeding, actually exceeding that $20,000 that we talked about last time.

255
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:13,224
And obviously we're downsizing the building, but we'd be happy to kind of still work in that frame.

256
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:33,048
Yeah, I mean, if that's the case I mean even if it went eight intersections versus nine we don't want to know be, you know, go beyond what may have been agreed to either so, and then the city does have some work going on, potentially going on the next year so at winter street anyway so I would just say, whatever.

257
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:40,332
I would recommend whatever number of intersections reaches the, you know, kind of equivalent amount, I think, would be.

258
00:25:41,432 --> 00:25:44,434
I don't defer to the chair but that's what I would be looking for.

259
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:50,058
And that works with us obviously we've, we've put it out and get some.

260
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:58,709
some pricing on just really understanding the cost and what it entails to do the green pieces.

261
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:00,269
Very rough stuff.

262
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:02,490
Actually, I got it from our traffic engineer.

263
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:09,894
We haven't really put it out to bid yet, but that is something that we could be happy to work with our office to make that happen.

264
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:14,236
I just want to add in one other thing as well on this topic.

265
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:16,337
I was able to speak with

266
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:29,988
an official from the city of Somerville, George Proakis, who's the, I'm going to say, forgive me for not knowing his title, he's probably the Victor Schrader equivalent.

267
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:38,556
And he was very happy with the project and only asked that we don't leave that little Irvington Street in Somerville out.

268
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,918
And I said, absolutely, we'll start there and work our way up.

269
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:49,182
And I mentioned that Todd, as you had mentioned earlier, you would be happy to help coordinate this stuff with the city of Somerville.

270
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:50,803
And they were thrilled.

271
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,664
So I think we're on the right track.

272
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:58,587
And that actually, that conversation with George, Mr. Proakis happened subsequent to our

273
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,591
July 21st meeting.

274
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:05,015
So I think the city of Somerville is happy with it as well.

275
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,808
So Director Blake, do you have suggestions as to condition language that you'd like to see?

276
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:30,168
So, my, so my understand, based on the last meeting the way we kind of fluctuate between items and it was an overall kind of target number, but to achieve that number there are many different ways to get there.

277
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,510
So we were, we had been hoping that.

278
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:40,298
The proponent would outline what those are to achieve that and it sounds like they're saying basically the list that was provided.

279
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:45,564
But in addition to the four of the green markings it looks like maybe eight intersections.

280
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:53,473
So, it was hard for me to articulate exactly how far to go until they provide that estimate random numbers so.

281
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:55,054
So I guess.

282
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:58,068
I would say it depends.

283
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:06,592
I think it depends on what the estimate is to reach that recommended agreed upon kind of number from last time.

284
00:28:07,613 --> 00:28:09,314
So, yeah.

285
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:18,398
Mr. Chair, if the proponent is suggesting that nine intersections would be amenable to them, then we would just include that, right?

286
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:23,520
Because normally we do this based on the work, not the cost of the work.

287
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:41,923
So we're amenable to that I would only ask that if winter streets going to be with the streets are kind of a big one if winter sheets going to be revisited at some point in time soon then we could easily spend more than enough money on the eight.

288
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:56,223
There was also a couple other things that we were going to include in that mitigation, including some static, highly reflective pedestrian warning signs at the crosswalks that were in front of the building that added some cost to the project.

289
00:28:56,744 --> 00:29:06,469
And the engineering support for the timing changes that our friends at the DCR are going to enact, we committed to.

290
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:12,526
securing rod to help them execute that as well.

291
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:14,487
So, right.

292
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:28,373
So, you know, for the, to be as expeditious as possible, you know, we have a set of conditions that we approved it for the last time we saw this project, the proponent has offered some suggested revisions.

293
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:32,075
And so I'd like to really start our conversation with those revisions.

294
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:37,157
And I'm wondering whether this is changing those conditions and if so, how.

295
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:42,205
Um, so we'll do one.

296
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:44,186
I'm sorry.

297
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:47,347
If we go right to that condition which I think was condition 11.

298
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:51,408
Yeah.

299
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:04,112
I'm wondering if it's just more of a clarification than a change, that would be up to you guys.

300
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:27,049
Mr Vini, this is a, why don't you go and say what you were saying about how you know condition number 11 because basically condition number 11 just says, you know, proponent to perform work in compliance with the recommendations by the following department headliners.

301
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:29,991
Right.

302
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:37,754
So the only clarification I was really looking for there how we were thinking about there was regarding the city engineers.

303
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:39,887
comment letter.

304
00:30:41,168 --> 00:30:44,330
So the condition says, hey, you have to comply with these letters.

305
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:45,811
Totally get it.

306
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:58,061
On the traffic part of that, it wasn't clear to me or to us that

307
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:16,188
There was a separation between all of the recommendations or thoughts that Mr. Blake had added to that letter and the conditions that the Community Development Board picked.

308
00:31:16,648 --> 00:31:21,013
So it was almost like Mr. Blake had a menu there, right?

309
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:35,931
After a conversation with some Medford officials after that, we realized that okay, the Community Development Board picked a couple of things out of those menu that they wanted to see that were important to the Community Development Board that happened.

310
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:36,932
So they did the work.

311
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:40,475
Basically they said hey these are the, these are the two things we want you to do.

312
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:43,633
we're okay with that.

313
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:56,742
I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't gonna come back on a technicality or something that we said, okay, yeah, we picked those two things, but there were still five other things that were in that letter that also need to be done.

314
00:31:57,023 --> 00:32:08,991
So we just wanted to make a clarification that in fact, the items that the community development board identified in the conditions were in fact the items that we were going to act upon.

315
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:11,053
in Mr. Blake's letter.

316
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:13,234
Subsequently, I understand that.

317
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:19,838
And so I'm wondering whether the comments that we've been having tonight is affecting the conditions above that.

318
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,338
So conditions one through 10.

319
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,402
Um, no, I don't think so.

320
00:32:29,023 --> 00:32:30,664
I think that so the proponent.

321
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:32,805
So if you look at the,

322
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:39,542
The condition number three enhancement of the uphill bike lanes Yep, we're, we're doing that.

323
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:48,850
It just wasn't clear what, what the, what the scope of that was and that's why there was, as Mr. Blake mentioned, I talked about four to get to a certain place.

324
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:58,700
If it wants to be 45678 whatever it is to get to what, what the city intended the board intended, that's fine I just wanted some clarity.

325
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:03,906
Yeah, I would tend to agree with that.

326
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:08,828
It's basically a clarification of condition number three.

327
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:11,509
And you're right.

328
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:14,850
And I hope this is okay the way it was presented last time.

329
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,031
It was a menu of options.

330
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:21,473
If you collected all of them together, it would be far exceed the recommended value.

331
00:33:21,573 --> 00:33:26,115
So we had that thoughtful conversation about which ones would be appropriate.

332
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:29,857
And then this was just a clarification to make sure

333
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:39,785
that the chosen options from that menu add up to the recommended value, roughly.

334
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:41,167
Right.

335
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:48,774
So director Blake condition number three currently states enhancement of the existing uphill bike lanes with increased information at the cross streets pending Somerville approval.

336
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,377
The proponent has suggested revising the condition to

337
00:33:52,898 --> 00:34:03,044
proponent to enhance the existing uphill bicycle lanes at street crossings by painting standard green pavement markings to emphasize conflict areas between vehicles and bicyclists.

338
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:09,288
Work to be performed at the Irvington Road, Stoughton Street, Harris Road, and Pinkham Road crossings.

339
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:13,131
All work in Somerville to be coordinated with the Medford Director of Traffic and Transportation.

340
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,592
That's four.

341
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:22,657
So are we gonna call out, Director Blake, are you gonna call out, should we call out four additional

342
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,789
intersections and would you like to specify what those are?

343
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:32,433
Yeah, I would say yes to the four additional eight.

344
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:40,957
It sounds like based on the estimate that the proponent just mentioned, I don't have, I'm pulling up the map right now to see what those four are.

345
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,597
I have the map.

346
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:44,478
North street.

347
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,399
West Quincy.

348
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:47,840
Hillside.

349
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,622
And there might be one I don't know.

350
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,981
Adams as well.

351
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:56,947
Okay, so North Quincy Adams hillside.

352
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,689
Yeah, those are the other four.

353
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:04,036
And I guess one additional point of clarification would be the memo says.

354
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:10,547
standard green markings, standard in style and material.

355
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:13,029
So there's two different types of material for bicyclists.

356
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:19,694
So there's green paint, and then there's the slip-resistant green paint material.

357
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:24,057
And that's much, there's a big difference in cost between the two.

358
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:31,563
We'd prefer the slip-resistant style, which ends up to the eye, it looks kind of like green sandpaper.

359
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,485
But you wouldn't necessarily.

360
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:39,327
So in terms of the typical markets, it wouldn't necessarily be solid all the way across the side street.

361
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:42,288
It's a skip across the side street.

362
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:46,270
So you save on material in that regard, but it's more expensive material.

363
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,279
Yes, it goes between the two white dashes.

364
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,279
I have some pictures.

365
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,421
Amazingly, I was in Boston one night and I saw it and that's what we have to do.

366
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,601
Took a picture of it, understood.

367
00:35:58,981 --> 00:35:59,542
Yeah, and it's fine.

368
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,582
It's whatever the appropriate material is.

369
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:16,147
And again, we had discussed that with our traffic consultant and he shared with us what he thought the cost might be, but I just haven't gone deep into it, but we're fine with that if those intersections are the ones that we're talking about.

370
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:18,858
and it's slip resistant.

371
00:36:18,938 --> 00:36:19,439
That's fair.

372
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,179
Absolutely.

373
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,601
I just wanted that and just that clarification.

374
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:24,783
Right.

375
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:26,565
Thank you, Director Blake.

376
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:27,946
Any other comments?

377
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:29,007
I know you have to leave soon.

378
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,631
No, I think that covers.

379
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:36,072
Thank you very much for your time.

380
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:36,873
Great.

381
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,134
Thank you so much for joining us.

382
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:42,198
All right.

383
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:48,253
board members, let me open it up for questions and comments by all of you.

384
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:57,758
One moment, Andre, I think we also have a member from the Historical Commission here to provide some feedback.

385
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,200
Would now be the right time.

386
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:05,302
I was going to get comments from the board members before doing that.

387
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:09,385
So I was just taking Director Blake first to

388
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:17,588
So if you don't, if you don't mind holding on Doug to that'd be great.

389
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:25,492
Any, any questions and comments before we go to the car from the historic commission.

390
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:28,374
Yes, class.

391
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,800
Hi, I have two questions.

392
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:47,828
First one is, could you go through and describe the way that the edges of the property are being treated, especially the ones that are up by any neighbors?

393
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,690
And the second question is, can you describe

394
00:37:51,581 --> 00:38:00,585
the design intent behind changing the red brick to another material or a dark brick on the new design.

395
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,169
So thank you for the questions.

396
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:10,810
How we address the neighbors, there are some neighbors to the north.

397
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,732
I believe there is fencing there right now.

398
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,594
We're not intending to do anything in that direction.

399
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,935
If in fact,

400
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:30,356
It made sense in the landscape area to add some, some more of a buffer, we'd be a vegetative a buffer we'd probably be amenable to that.

401
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:35,919
To the, to the host residential development directly to the north.

402
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:39,782
And regarding the red brick.

403
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:46,685
I'm going to actually defer that.

404
00:38:46,745 --> 00:38:56,434
I'll ask the chief design officer here at Cummings Properties to maybe Jim Trudeau, if I can introduce Jim Trudeau and ask him to weigh in on that.

405
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,016
Sure.

406
00:38:59,076 --> 00:38:59,497
Thanks, Mike.

407
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:00,417
Everyone hear me okay?

408
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:18,407
So the, I assume that the question is regarding red brick that at one point, the base of the building had red brick veneer around a significant amount of the base of the building, and as the property as the project scale

409
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:35,474
as the amount of ground floor construction changed, it was determined that it would be, that also would be scaled back and to use a simpler construction methodology and to maintain more of the existing construction.

410
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:42,958
So it was simply a function of the economics of a much smaller site, excuse me, much smaller construction.

411
00:39:43,598 --> 00:40:02,703
construction project and I think there was some there was some screening used shown here that it was probably worth some more development but in light of the time it took to you know we must admit we scrambled to to reconsider in light of the the time frame that Mike Avaney referred to earlier that

412
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:21,971
The changes came on very quickly and working with the various boards in Medford, they helped us chart a path how we could revise our submission, but we had to put a significant amount of work into revising these renderings in particular.

413
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:27,353
And so the, again, it was a project scale item.

414
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:28,894
Does that answer the question?

415
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:33,692
What is the answer?

416
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:39,114
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that very well.

417
00:40:39,154 --> 00:40:41,175
I assume that was an acknowledgment.

418
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:45,516
No, I was asking if it's not brick, then what is it?

419
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:47,517
Oh, OK.

420
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:50,858
So I can share my screen if that's OK.

421
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,158
I have one of the renderings up.

422
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:56,060
Does that make sense to be able to point out with the cursor here?

423
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,880
Yes, please.

424
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,060
Let me do that.

425
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,641
All right.

426
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,740
disabled screen sharing method.

427
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,062
I don't know if that, oh, here we go.

428
00:41:05,602 --> 00:41:05,922
Thank you.

429
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:13,929
So can everyone see this rendering of the project that's on my screen here?

430
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,873
I'll zoom in a little bit, get a little closer.

431
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:23,437
So previously there was, we had shown some brick on this lower section.

432
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:28,722
And so right now we have probably most likely a synthetic stucco facade

433
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:58,757
We've extended, because of the lower height, we've extended this glazed section, which previously was floating up more as a lantern design, but it was too small in the revised scale, so we decided to land it at street level, and unfortunately our rendering doesn't really play correctly with what's going on.

434
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:03,895
no floor here, this would come down or be revised.

435
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:05,136
Thanks, Jim.

436
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:22,043
Can I jump in just because I think you're bringing up something that maybe even is more maybe of concern to me is that in the previous rendering, it seemed that the retail space was sort of holding the corner in a sort of very civic way.

437
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:25,905
I don't know that, you know,

438
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:46,519
I know, or rather I know that this retailer and that retailer would ultimately, like I say, in how their sort of retail space looks, but are you suggesting in this that the retail space now moves down away from the main street?

439
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,384
Because I think that's actually pretty problematic, because if you want any chance of this retail space

440
00:42:54,045 --> 00:43:01,348
I think it needs to be on that corner and address the main street that's there.

441
00:43:01,808 --> 00:43:16,973
To me, I don't know any retailer who would look at this space and say, sign me up, because it's just not going to get the looks that it should.

442
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:35,318
I was saying about the reduction in height of the building and the lantern and all that, but I think from a civic point of view, removing the amenity space from the corner is a problem.

443
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:44,944
Unless you have some more design to do on this corner and you're in fact suggesting that, it's just that the lantern's part of it.

444
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,581
Well, we haven't removed the space from the corner.

445
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:49,782
I see Mike has his hand up.

446
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:52,083
I'll defer to him if he wants to comment.

447
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:53,403
Thank you, Jim.

448
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:56,145
Amanda, can I share my screen again?

449
00:43:56,165 --> 00:44:02,007
Yep, you can go ahead once Jim takes this down.

450
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:05,129
All right, I've got to find my unshare button here.

451
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:05,529
Sorry.

452
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,731
You will stop others sharing the screen.

453
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:10,271
Yes, OK.

454
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:11,891
All right, screen one.

455
00:44:14,513 --> 00:44:15,293
Screen one, share.

456
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:20,700
So I want to go back to one of the slides that's in the package here.

457
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:30,288
And this red space in the corner to answer your question is the public amenity space will indeed be right up to the front of the building.

458
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,129
It's not being pushed back like it shows.

459
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,872
That was just a sign location potentially.

460
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:43,779
Of course, if somebody wanted to use this space and have a sign location on the front in the glass area,

461
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:52,544
We would certainly make an accommodation for that, but by no means were we intending to push the amenity space back from the corner.

462
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,685
Absolutely, it's engaging the corner.

463
00:44:56,386 --> 00:44:58,628
I think that's good.

464
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:02,890
To me, I still think the previous version was much stronger.

465
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:13,136
The red brick, we're in a neighborhood of mostly wood frame homes, but I still think that the red brick has a real

466
00:45:15,703 --> 00:45:19,384
it speaks to the scale of the neighborhood better than a big glass box.

467
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:28,446
And for that matter, the retailer sort of clad in that red brick seems to me to be very, like much more welcoming.

468
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:39,448
And it's a gesture that speaks more to integrating into the community than a retailer inside of a big glass box coming to the ground.

469
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:43,089
And I think there's probably different ways

470
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:48,932
to achieve what I'm suggesting.

471
00:45:49,713 --> 00:46:06,564
Maybe not going all the way back to what you had, but that was sort of why I asked about the brick originally, because I felt like it was, the building's a lot colder and more sort of,

472
00:46:09,748 --> 00:46:13,370
I feel like it doesn't integrate into the neighborhood quite as well in the new design.

473
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:18,212
So I would urge you to take a second look at that or a third look.

474
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:30,738
And then my comment about the property lines is I just think, you know, really this board is for site plan review.

475
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,320
And I think it's very important that you carefully consider how your,

476
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:49,210
your edges are meeting the neighbors and as much as you can be sympathetic to the scale of the homes on either side of you.

477
00:46:49,330 --> 00:47:00,621
And probably I would suggest some landscaping, some serious landscaping along those edges as well as a,

478
00:47:03,022 --> 00:47:10,291
a nicer fence so that those properties are protected and don't feel like they're just the back of a parking lot.

479
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:16,638
Because I know you do a parking pretty close to the property line in those areas.

480
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,081
All fair points.

481
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:20,342
Thanks.

482
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:32,909
Yeah, just looking at kind of Google Street View there is a small strip of landscaping with some hedge, although the hedge seems to be intermittent.

483
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:37,250
maybe fixing up that edge would be helpful.

484
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:49,983
And also I think appreciate the southern end, what you've done to take a parking space or two and add a little bit of landscaping there to get the parking off of the street.

485
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:58,352
Is there any chance you could do the same thing at the other entrance, the one which is kind of the main entrance where the retail is going to be?

486
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:00,584
Yeah, for sure.

487
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:03,906
I think we could absolutely look at that and consider that as well.

488
00:48:04,066 --> 00:48:08,909
Obviously we're right up against the parking number, but I don't think the parking's an issue here at all.

489
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:13,011
So we could absolutely consider softening that corner if that makes sense.

490
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:29,202
And yeah, landscaping and considering our neighborhood right directly to the north is something that we're very much open to and would probably have done it had you said not, had it not come up here for sure.

491
00:48:33,396 --> 00:48:33,996
Kristi Dowd.

492
00:48:35,197 --> 00:48:36,297
Hi, thank you.

493
00:48:37,277 --> 00:48:50,282
So I think just sort of extending a little bit of what Claes was saying, what I noticed is really the change in the base, and I think what's being lost in this new design is that

494
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,463
pedestrian activation at the bottom.

495
00:48:53,523 --> 00:49:00,011
I understand that, you know, the amenity space has reduced in size with the overall reduction of the building.

496
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:06,498
And now it's more focused on the corner where it had extended up further on Boston Ave.

497
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:07,620
And now it appears to be

498
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:12,202
being replaced with just a mesh cover of parking.

499
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:27,787
So I just raise that as something that I think that makes it that base of the building now looks like it's a rear of the building and Boston Ave is a pretty important street.

500
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:31,888
And so if there's some consideration on how you treat that,

501
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:41,415
Aesthetically, as you advance this design, I would highly recommend that you look at that closer because it does look now like it's a back of building.

502
00:49:43,476 --> 00:49:49,040
And I'm having a hard time understanding where the primary entrance of the building is in the updated plans.

503
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,981
It was very clear in the last ones.

504
00:49:51,982 --> 00:49:55,464
Is that the same entrance next to the amenity space?

505
00:49:57,436 --> 00:50:01,539
just bear with me one second, let me go back a couple of slides here so I can remember one.

506
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,242
So yes, it was gonna be adjacent to the amenity space.

507
00:50:06,262 --> 00:50:22,174
So it's interesting, really the entrance to the amenity space can be almost anywhere along the front or the side piece of the north face there, just depending on how the end user wants to break that up.

508
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:25,857
The entrance to the two-story structure above

509
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:29,966
really is from inside the garage, the existing garage.

510
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:33,288
And that remained unchanged.

511
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:42,513
We had always expected that there was going to be, you know, the users of the space above were really going to wind up parking in the parking garage and work their way up.

512
00:50:44,065 --> 00:51:02,877
But there is opportunity to potentially address the amenity space on the front, the Boston Ave facing side, similar to how we looked at it last time, maybe carving it out a little bit and engaging the street a little more for sure.

513
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:06,139
I will mimic a little what Jim said.

514
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:21,539
like I said, we hastily put this together, but we, we thought, okay, this, you start with a simple concept and you kind of get here and, um, you know, these are at that concept plans and we, we haven't spent a lot of time working out the details and certainly.

515
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,863
Jim and I spoke about this today, that there's a lot of little tweaks that'll happen when we kind of detail this out and figure out how it all is gonna go together.

516
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:39,586
And when the architectural team now, or the build part of the architectural team, let's just say, gets to it and picks out things that need to be thought through.

517
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:48,129
So it's a concept, it's definitely a work in progress, but we will certainly consider all of these comments going forward.

518
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:59,312
Yeah, I think part of the point is making that block, you know, breaking up the block a little bit so that the garage section looks distinct.

519
00:52:00,213 --> 00:52:06,676
And I know you're trying to do that, but on the first floor now it may blend together, which is where the pedestrian experiences.

520
00:52:06,716 --> 00:52:16,502
So I was trying to make that first floor of the mixed use section a little bit more, look more like the mixed use part of it.

521
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:21,879
It's funny you say that because Jim and I were looking at the renderings today.

522
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:29,825
The first thing he said was, how come, how come the vertical element didn't go all the way down and we absolutely.

523
00:52:30,405 --> 00:52:33,968
And to the point you said I didn't approve.

524
00:52:35,658 --> 00:52:37,759
And he's probably right.

525
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:48,586
And again, we agree 100% and we can reconsider how that really is separate and engages the street level.

526
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:52,089
I think we can do a better job of that, sure.

527
00:52:56,591 --> 00:53:00,474
Other comments by board members before we go to Doug Carr with the historic commission?

528
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:05,883
All right, Mr. Carr.

529
00:53:07,003 --> 00:53:08,224
I just had one quick question.

530
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:15,749
So there's no way to get into the building except for going through the garage, like the parking garage?

531
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:18,490
Correct.

532
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:21,812
You had no way to get into the upper level.

533
00:53:22,272 --> 00:53:22,853
That's correct.

534
00:53:25,614 --> 00:53:32,979
I just think that if you are walking, that that could be not the most pleasant experience.

535
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:45,933
But, well, correct me if I'm wrong, there will be an entrance on Boston Avenue, which will go into the bottom floor of the garage where there'll be access to the top floor.

536
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:56,420
So there is an entrance there, and then there is gonna be an entrance, a pedestrian entrance to the garage on the north side of the building, the other retail space as well, right?

537
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,923
I'm gonna share my screen again just to,

538
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,130
to address that.

539
00:54:03,191 --> 00:54:04,271
So everybody can see the screen again.

540
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:21,137
So yes, right here, there's an awning and we expect that there'll be two doors, one that can lead you into the amenity space theoretically, and one that leads you into an opportunity to get to the, not very far to get to a set of stairs, which goes up to the upstairs.

541
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:27,659
There is also an existing stairwell here on the Boston Ave side that will lead you to the second set of stairs.

542
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:29,920
Obviously this can be dressed up a little more

543
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:39,946
And we can add, add some features that screams that that's kind of where you wanted to go if you were walking into the building.

544
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:41,447
Fair point.

545
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:45,009
Yeah, this is Christy got the.

546
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:49,612
That's why I asked about the building main building entry because in the last

547
00:54:50,736 --> 00:55:04,883
iteration, it was very clear that there was a main entry right there with an awning, which made that portion of the facade, you know, look look more pedestrian friendly.

548
00:55:04,903 --> 00:55:09,805
Yep, we share that view, and we will, we will absolutely

549
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:26,687
One other thing I'll throw in is that it goes back to the heart that this building is an addition to the main building, and a lot of the main services are provided out of the main building, and we have a multi-story bridge connecting two.

550
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:37,395
So notwithstanding that there is a population of pedestrians, even the cyclists are parking in the building, and there's certainly the number of garage and

551
00:55:37,815 --> 00:55:43,157
So we watch where people come from currently, and a lot of them are not pedestrians.

552
00:55:43,857 --> 00:55:50,199
And so they're finding their way in through the main entry, which is off the center drive section.

553
00:55:50,279 --> 00:55:53,341
So there's that aspect as well.

554
00:55:57,462 --> 00:56:02,204
Andre, before you go to Doug, I just wanted to clarify one thing with the proponents.

555
00:56:03,504 --> 00:56:03,704
Sure.

556
00:56:03,804 --> 00:56:04,525
Go ahead, Director Hunt.

557
00:56:06,383 --> 00:56:06,863
Thank you.

558
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:20,285
I noticed in different iterations of the renderings and versions of the site plans, there was different sort of treatment of the plantings in front of the building.

559
00:56:21,106 --> 00:56:34,168
And my feeling was, I like to think the best of everybody, that it was just sort of this rendering issue and that the intention was to keep all the plantings that are currently there, enhance them,

560
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:45,004
as possible, like you're not planning to clear cut everything out front in order to do your project, but you couldn't quite tell that.

561
00:56:45,064 --> 00:56:53,627
So I just thought I would ask you to just address and confirm what your plans were with the plant material plantings in the front of the building.

562
00:56:53,647 --> 00:56:57,548
Fair question, and that was brought to my attention as well.

563
00:56:57,568 --> 00:56:58,369
So

564
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:13,607
The, it's funny because the original set showed everything really dark and it looked like the set and it was all going to be, our intention is that obviously we're going to have to, we will lose some plant material that's there now that will be replaced.

565
00:57:14,188 --> 00:57:17,650
It'll just be a casualty, unfortunately be a casualty of the construction.

566
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:19,492
We will be as careful as possible.

567
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:23,034
My guess is this stuff will be dug up.

568
00:57:23,354 --> 00:57:26,136
We'll find a nice place for it and we'll try to put it back.

569
00:57:27,597 --> 00:57:41,466
We will treat the entire facade, the entire engaged part at Boston Ave with the same care that we will treat the patio at the amenity space in the same care that we do now.

570
00:57:43,608 --> 00:57:50,032
I had a conversation with one of your colleagues today and I said, you know, that's one of the things that I think we do a really nice job with.

571
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:54,615
It makes no sense to clear cut it and make it look awful where we're

572
00:57:55,698 --> 00:58:01,099
We're trying to make this a building that everybody can use and is happy to engage in.

573
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:05,920
And as you can see on one of the renderings, we obviously have, we planted a row of trees.

574
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,661
This will look more like the renderings than it will the plans.

575
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:14,822
Thank you, I appreciate that.

576
00:58:15,182 --> 00:58:21,103
Having seen many Cummings buildings, I didn't imagine that you were planning to like make it look bad.

577
00:58:21,788 --> 00:58:26,492
you know, lack of plantings, but I wanted that on the record too, that you're planning to do it.

578
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:28,213
Appreciate it, thank you very much.

579
00:58:28,754 --> 00:58:40,723
And Mr. Avini, are you suggesting though, there are some, you know, I'm not worried about the bushes and hedges and stuff, but there are some trees that are there that are quite close to the garage edge.

580
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:49,030
And, you know, they're not, they might have like 20 years worth of growth, which are you suggesting those are going to have to be cut down?

581
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,391
or do you think some of those can be saved?

582
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:56,495
I think we'll save as much as we can and what will have to be removed will be removed and replanted.

583
00:58:58,336 --> 00:59:04,120
It will be, I will say this, it'll be a lot easier to save them in this scheme than it would have been in the past scheme.

584
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:12,245
I think if we were building the garage up to five stories, no way those things would have survived, but I think, you know, we could take a shot.

585
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:17,489
There are a couple of, there are some street trees to differentiate between

586
00:59:18,328 --> 00:59:19,448
the trees that we're talking about.

587
00:59:19,749 --> 00:59:22,009
There are some street trees that obviously will remain.

588
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:29,612
There are a couple of older mature trees that are in the landscaping, more self adjacent to the garage.

589
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:34,773
What can be saved will be saved and what can't be will be supplemented with new trees.

590
00:59:38,194 --> 00:59:39,775
All right, Mr. Carr, let's go to you.

591
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:43,336
Thank you Chairman LaRue, I appreciate it.

592
00:59:44,096 --> 00:59:45,216
My name is Doug Carr.

593
00:59:45,336 --> 00:59:46,257
I'm speaking on behalf of the

594
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:53,185
I actually live at 124 Boston Ave, just a few blocks away, but I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the commission.

595
00:59:54,366 --> 01:00:00,030
We sent a four page letter that tried to talk about ways to improve this project.

596
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,271
We think it's a great project.

597
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:05,575
We think it's a really excellent addition to the streetscape.

598
01:00:05,615 --> 01:00:08,477
The scale being reduced is important and a good move.

599
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:11,159
The reduced garage is also excellent.

600
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,701
We think it does create more of a campus atmosphere.

601
01:00:14,466 --> 01:00:26,113
And we do think that with the hopeful extension of the green line to the U-Haul building, the phase two that's been under consideration for almost a decade now, that that will eventually happen.

602
01:00:26,733 --> 01:00:31,596
And that will make this part of Medford much more of a transit-oriented development than it is now.

603
01:00:31,656 --> 01:00:32,977
And I know we're getting there.

604
01:00:33,017 --> 01:00:34,978
That's part of the reason this project is on the table.

605
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:39,180
So to try to sum up our letter, I hope the commission,

606
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:42,645
community development board had a chance to look at it.

607
01:00:43,285 --> 01:00:49,207
We think there's a couple of ways to improve this because the design has changed, you know, it was two buildings side by side previously.

608
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:53,867
And that's still true, but they're not the same anymore.

609
01:00:54,447 --> 01:01:07,790
Because, you know, before, there was really no chance we were ever going to add on to that garage where when I look at this building, as an architect or any as an owner, I see that there's clearly a large potential that someday in the future,

610
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:11,372
that lab portion of the building could be extended over the entire building.

611
01:01:11,432 --> 01:01:32,427
And what the emphasis of the letter was that the design of the building should be looking at that appropriately and treating the parking garage enclosure two very different ways under the lab building and only the parking garage building, even though they're very similar right now in terms of their plan.

612
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:44,770
I did have a question because the elevations say it's an enclosed screen mesh to allow for an open non-mechanical system below the office lab space.

613
01:01:45,971 --> 01:01:57,336
I know from experience that that is something that is extremely open and it's not very concealing to the cars versus the colored panels that you have.

614
01:01:57,836 --> 01:02:00,858
Obviously, you know it's a garage, but you don't actually see

615
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:05,770
the grills and the headlights, et cetera, of those because it's enclosed more.

616
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:09,091
So could you at least, let's just start with that question.

617
01:02:09,131 --> 01:02:11,892
Could you address that and maybe ways we can improve that?

618
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:18,395
Can you clarify what the question is?

619
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:29,499
So are you suggesting that the mesh, even if it was a more dense mesh, would be insufficient to shield the

620
01:02:30,383 --> 01:02:32,004
shield the view of the vehicles?

621
01:02:32,784 --> 01:02:33,665
Yes, I am.

622
01:02:33,765 --> 01:02:41,349
And I think the elevations say one thing and the perspectives actually show what it looks to me like to be a storefront system on the renderings.

623
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:45,991
It looks to me like there's, and this may be part of what you referred to earlier, is just the accelerated timeline.

624
01:02:46,031 --> 01:02:58,938
But I think we definitely want something that looks more like a building than an open mesh where you'll clearly see the garage because the amount of openness that needs to happen on there is upwards of 90% to get the airflow through there that you need to have no mechanical system.

625
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:04,638
I don't understand why you would do that, because you're not doing that in the majority of the garage, but you're doing it under the building.

626
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:09,802
I can jump in here.

627
01:03:10,122 --> 01:03:10,702
Please, thank you.

628
01:03:11,283 --> 01:03:13,124
Yeah, I mean, we've dealt with the same issue.

629
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:17,847
We're familiar with the, you know, the calculations needed for fresh air.

630
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:28,755
And we've on many garages, you know, added, you know, either glass or screening to create the image that, oh, that's not a garage back there.

631
01:03:29,615 --> 01:03:31,056
space or occupied space.

632
01:03:31,116 --> 01:03:44,647
So that's the intention of the intermediate level is to show some vertical mullions, whether it's glass or whether it's some type of screen, whether a nylon or an aluminum.

633
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:46,268
So we've had pretty good luck.

634
01:03:46,728 --> 01:03:48,069
you know, getting the screening.

635
01:03:48,109 --> 01:03:51,172
We're not representing that it's 100%, you know, opaque.

636
01:03:52,213 --> 01:04:05,004
You know, as Mike said earlier, you know, the screen on the Boston Ave facade specifically, you know, that didn't get the attention that I certainly felt it deserved.

637
01:04:05,684 --> 01:04:14,112
And, you know, we do a lot with, you know, whether it's a historical mural, we recently, you know, wrapped a staircase at our Cummings Center in Beverly,

638
01:04:15,553 --> 01:04:17,434
with a historical mural.

639
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:32,047
So we haven't determined what that is gonna be exactly, but the intention is to, we have an existing garage, it's still there, the same garage that's been there for 20 plus years is still behind that.

640
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:39,353
There's obviously a significant amount of landscape there that acts as a buffer and that will still,

641
01:04:40,194 --> 01:04:45,181
be existing or be retained or replaced, as Mike mentioned earlier.

642
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:54,495
So our intention is to create a better looking screen than this sort of generic gray that's shown there.

643
01:04:56,747 --> 01:05:08,270
I appreciate those comments and I don't disagree with them, but I think to echo what both board member Dowd and Andreas said earlier, the previous scheme was more pedestrian friendly.

644
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:17,832
And what I see here with so much garage that is minimally screened or barely screened, I think is an opportunity to improve that.

645
01:05:17,992 --> 01:05:23,333
And I would argue that what you have in the ground floor with the bike storage room, for example,

646
01:05:24,317 --> 01:05:43,937
is really the way the way that's designed that could certainly be expanded by the four spaces next to it and create what I would call kind of this fake retail approach that would more activate that street because that bike we often design in my profession in multifamily and office buildings we design bike storage rooms that are not storage rooms they're like lounges they have color

647
01:05:44,477 --> 01:05:45,457
high quality lighting.

648
01:05:45,477 --> 01:05:54,319
They have, you know, car bike repair stations, you can make that look like retail, even though it's not in function like that with light at night.

649
01:05:54,339 --> 01:06:04,902
There's a lot of things that can do that what might you might shave a few spaces, but give a much more pedestrian friendly approach to that Boston Ave streetscape, which is so critical, which is I know your intent as well.

650
01:06:07,895 --> 01:06:11,496
Um, sure, as Mike mentioned, you know, we're open to suggestions.

651
01:06:11,836 --> 01:06:22,599
Obviously, in light of the scale back, that's, you know, that was one of the casualties was putting that, you know, keeping a simpler, you know, lower section of the building.

652
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:32,422
One other thing I'll mention is that previous retail design, we had to really take out the entire landscaped area there.

653
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:34,762
That is below grade.

654
01:06:34,902 --> 01:06:37,023
I know Mike probably has commented this

655
01:06:39,716 --> 01:06:46,418
move up, Boston Avenue raises in elevation as you head south and you're several feet below grade.

656
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:56,341
So to excavate that, there's a significant amount of retaining walls, HP access, drainage, challenges, foundation modification because you've lost frost control.

657
01:06:56,381 --> 01:07:07,005
So notwithstanding how quote unquote nice it would have been, it was also very expensive to achieve and also at the expense of the distinct landscape.

658
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:07,165
So

659
01:07:07,645 --> 01:07:20,599
So I think we, you know, as Mike has said, we will take your comments and see if we can improve that facade element to, you know, to create a sort of vibrant streetscape.

660
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:24,383
I mean, we, Mike, I know this talked about, you know, benches and seating.

661
01:07:24,403 --> 01:07:26,045
We want to create, you know, engagement.

662
01:07:26,265 --> 01:07:28,027
We have a program out here in the

663
01:07:28,453 --> 01:07:43,683
more suburban world or creating little park labs, creating spots for some more human engagement, you know, along that street edge, and, you know, creating, you know, using some of that, you know, urban infrastructure to, you know, create a great walkable environment.

664
01:07:49,347 --> 01:07:50,588
Just a few other comments.

665
01:07:50,628 --> 01:07:54,991
Could you address my, my, again, I just want to emphasize these are

666
01:07:55,798 --> 01:07:58,520
These are constructive criticisms to try to improve the project.

667
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,522
I am 100% behind this project.

668
01:08:00,562 --> 01:08:03,965
So I'm just trying to make it better, as everyone on this column sure is.

669
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:17,115
Could you address the fundamental critique of the letter from the historic commission about the fundamental change in the design and how a future expansion doesn't look like it's being set up by this design?

670
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,897
Sure.

671
01:08:20,778 --> 01:08:22,119
You want me to take that, Mike?

672
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:23,520
You want to go ahead?

673
01:08:25,455 --> 01:08:30,276
Yeah, well, you're talking to the guy that proposed this project six or seven years ago.

674
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:45,920
So just to give you a little perspective, and it was only recently as the lab desirability became so great that the company said, you know what, maybe we should look at that.

675
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:51,341
And we had proposed some pretty significant and large schemes.

676
01:08:51,401 --> 01:08:55,182
And as we dove into it, we really looked at, hey, it's a challenge.

677
01:08:55,202 --> 01:08:56,683
challenging spot to build.

678
01:08:56,923 --> 01:09:00,564
There's not a lot of lay down area, there's not a lot of prep area.

679
01:09:01,465 --> 01:09:12,270
And when, as Mike mentioned, when a real candidate to take the larger amount of space that we originally proposed, they kind of stepped away from the table, that reassessment came in.

680
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:17,252
So, hey, we can't say what the future will hold.

681
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:25,019
It's a significant economic challenge to modify the existing garage.

682
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:30,300
You'll see this new scheme is really, we've created a sort of aesthetic front end on the garage.

683
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:37,682
We're not putting a roof, so it's called, or solar support structure over that second level, the existing level of the garage.

684
01:09:37,842 --> 01:09:40,023
It's an economic issue for us.

685
01:09:41,103 --> 01:09:47,366
to create, to build another floor atop this across the existing roof.

686
01:09:48,947 --> 01:09:50,368
That's an expensive build.

687
01:09:50,468 --> 01:09:54,510
It's gotta be insulated below.

688
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,691
I'm not sure the footings are gonna hold up.

689
01:09:56,771 --> 01:09:59,532
I don't know if you've looked closely at the documents that we're preparing.

690
01:10:00,853 --> 01:10:08,497
In our efforts to maintain some of the existing garage there, we are doing some significant structural,

691
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:13,164
you know, invasions of that building.

692
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:18,365
We've got to try and hold up the existing structure and get the new structure to come down around it.

693
01:10:18,485 --> 01:10:20,946
And it's challenging.

694
01:10:21,026 --> 01:10:27,567
And to do it again at the other side for one single floor, I don't think that we would see that happening.

695
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,608
Again, I don't know what's going to happen.

696
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:35,416
And I would say that, okay, if it does happen in the future, you know, I think we can make it look good.

697
01:10:35,456 --> 01:10:40,224
I mean, if I could share my screen again, if that's okay.

698
01:10:45,590 --> 01:11:03,780
So, so this this screen to, you know, this is an addition that we did on on the original building many years ago and, you know, we've got a lot of positive, you know, comments for that and that was over a single story like was the boiler room for the building and it's got a contemporary edge compared to the traditional part of the building so.

699
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,920
I think we'd make it work.

700
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:08,782
Again, we have about 20 people involved in design.

701
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:14,264
We put a lot of effort, we take pride in putting out a good product.

702
01:11:14,324 --> 01:11:19,966
I mean, obviously there are some, what we call the business side of the company, sometimes that limits us.

703
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:25,868
There's a lot of aspects that go into a development and certainly the design team loves to put our best foot forward.

704
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,429
And sometimes that's either deemed to be,

705
01:11:29,649 --> 01:11:34,554
it can happen because of whether it's funding or some other practical aspects of it.

706
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:35,895
So I hear you.

707
01:11:37,316 --> 01:11:44,063
I just think that that's a tough thing to say to predict that far ahead and not think that we couldn't make it work at that time.

708
01:11:45,944 --> 01:11:54,893
I appreciate that comment and I'm not unfamiliar with economic challenges for clients and developers and owners for sure.

709
01:11:55,754 --> 01:12:14,979
I guess that, you know, at a fundamental level, and this was something the historic commission said in its original letter is that the way the garage is designed right now is obviously completely dictated by the garage that was built 50 years ago, because you're limited because you're stuck with the ramping, you're stuck with the geometry, you're stuck with the foundations.

710
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:23,321
And it's a somewhat, it's unfortunate in some way, because obviously, it's it's urban design one on one to put the flat

711
01:12:24,138 --> 01:12:31,321
portion of the garage not the ramp portion on the public face and here you can't do that because of the existing geometry of the garage.

712
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:40,045
You know, we would normally if we're facing a railway or a highway we would put the sloping ramps on that face is a, we put the public face to the

713
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,350
to be the flat area.

714
01:12:43,011 --> 01:12:49,313
We can't do that here because this garage is dictating the geometry of the garage tapping above because you're limiting by that.

715
01:12:49,973 --> 01:12:57,456
But what that means is that we're, we're, we're kind of stuck here a little bit because, you know, I would envision in the future.

716
01:12:57,476 --> 01:13:08,661
If with the green line comes here that the parking demand for this project would go down dramatically, and you may not need that much parking but then converting that to non parking use would be

717
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:11,735
very challenging with this scheme because of the way it's designed.

718
01:13:12,595 --> 01:13:27,940
I know you guys think for the head, you know, and what I'm saying may never happen, but I, I'm sure if buildings just don't get smaller, they get bigger over time, whether it's a single family residence or an office building, if it can, it will with economic incentives.

719
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,881
And obviously, a green line coming here would be a game changer and change your campus.

720
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:38,763
So at a minimum, I think we want to make sure that we don't do anything in this design to preclude

721
01:13:39,598 --> 01:13:53,446
that potential future expansion and have a treatment at least at the garage under the building that is that is doesn't isn't dictated by McKenna ventilation, but the architecture of the street more than anything else.

722
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:56,688
Yeah, I mean, I hear you.

723
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:59,950
I'll start my second, I guess one thing where, you know,

724
01:14:01,011 --> 01:14:05,934
We were very intrigued by the notion of articulating this angled facade of the street.

725
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:10,857
I mean, I think an urban environment, one of the most exciting aspects is that mix of history and modernity.

726
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:20,583
And our hope here is that we've created a little tension maybe, but hopefully not something that doesn't have a dialogue with the other aspects of the neighborhood.

727
01:14:20,723 --> 01:14:27,667
Our goal is to create something exciting and sometimes new that doesn't blend in, you know,

728
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:29,188
it's a fine line.

729
01:14:29,308 --> 01:14:32,572
Hopefully we can make that, reach that goal.

730
01:14:34,254 --> 01:14:37,098
And we did, you know, we have had internal discussions of how we could

731
01:14:37,622 --> 01:14:45,149
in the future as, let's say, not only the Green Line comes in, but let's say more automated transit options, ride sharing, what have you, come in.

732
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:49,033
There are a couple of flat spots on that floor that we've talked about.

733
01:14:49,053 --> 01:14:59,363
We could expand into it on a much smaller scale, but that whole notion of how you can convert garage, I think, will certainly be a real viable issue in the future.

734
01:15:00,374 --> 01:15:03,076
It's a substantial investment in that existing garage.

735
01:15:03,156 --> 01:15:10,962
And it just, the amount of money to tear it down, you know, we talk internally here about the sustainable side of that.

736
01:15:11,002 --> 01:15:15,906
You know, there's an intrinsic amount of energy that goes in taking something down and building something new.

737
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:26,115
Notwithstanding the new might be great and awesome and great for long-term, but what's that, the energy that you put into doing that, you know, you've thrown a lot of good away.

738
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:29,057
So hopefully we can find the balance between the two.

739
01:15:29,812 --> 01:15:31,233
appreciate those comments.

740
01:15:31,273 --> 01:15:33,235
Look, this is a quality garage quality building.

741
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:35,978
I really think that we're not far apart.

742
01:15:36,038 --> 01:15:41,542
I think the city will see these comments are primarily focused on the land on the on the public realm around the building.

743
01:15:41,562 --> 01:15:43,124
And I agree with most of those comments.

744
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:46,347
So I look forward to seeing the next iteration and appreciate your time.

745
01:15:47,187 --> 01:15:47,468
Thank you.

746
01:15:48,308 --> 01:15:48,969
Thank you very much.

747
01:15:53,213 --> 01:15:55,174
But Jim, can you stop your screen sharing?

748
01:15:55,254 --> 01:15:55,734
Oh, sorry.

749
01:15:56,294 --> 01:15:57,255
The green hog here.

750
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:05,558
Sorry about that.

751
01:16:06,378 --> 01:16:06,878
That's okay.

752
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:07,398
Thank you.

753
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:10,499
So I'd like to move this along.

754
01:16:10,519 --> 01:16:19,343
I'd like to review the conditions and the proposed revisions to the conditions that the proponent has made.

755
01:16:19,423 --> 01:16:20,103
And then in light of

756
01:16:20,547 --> 01:16:26,670
the conversation we've had, identify whether there's any further tweaks that we're incorporating.

757
01:16:27,451 --> 01:16:30,172
So let me just pull that up.

758
01:16:37,596 --> 01:16:46,140
Okay, so condition number one, we had provision of bus stop benches and bus shelters if accessibility allows.

759
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:49,682
The proposed revised condition from the proponent is

760
01:16:50,135 --> 01:16:54,839
Proponent to provide a bench in the landscape area at the outbound bus stop adjacent to the property.

761
01:16:55,319 --> 01:17:05,827
Applicant to consult with the Medford Engineering Department to determine if adequate space exists within the Boston Avenue right of way to install a bench at the inbound bus stop adjacent to Harris Road.

762
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:10,725
Yeah, you want me to comment.

763
01:17:10,745 --> 01:17:15,649
Yeah, I mean, unless anybody else does I'm happy to let someone else go.

764
01:17:16,129 --> 01:17:29,880
Yeah, we just want to make sure that if, if we're gonna do something across the street it's done in connection with the city and we make sure that there's an appropriate landing spot for that we can dictate where it is on on the outbound side.

765
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,001
because we can put it on our property, but we don't have any control of what's across the street.

766
01:17:34,061 --> 01:17:39,842
So we just wanted to add some clarification to that to make sure that we're all on the same page.

767
01:17:41,242 --> 01:17:41,422
Right.

768
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:48,083
And I think the idea is just if I think in the renderings, we saw like a bench, but it's just kind of floating on the green edge there.

769
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:55,324
So making sure that it's landscaped and maybe connects to the walkway that you're building to the retail area.

770
01:17:55,664 --> 01:17:55,844
Yep.

771
01:17:57,185 --> 01:17:57,565
Fair enough.

772
01:17:58,745 --> 01:17:59,005
Thank you.

773
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:11,428
Condition number two additional bike racks in proportion to the rentable square footage of the addition, and the proponents suggesting a proponent to continue to monitor demand for and maintain sufficient bike racks at the property.

774
01:18:11,448 --> 01:18:15,889
Yeah, we have added bike racks there.

775
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:22,132
As time has gone on a little different in the last year and a half or so, but that's something that.

776
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:24,762
I can say with certainty.

777
01:18:25,522 --> 01:18:26,703
I've ridden my bike over there.

778
01:18:26,763 --> 01:18:28,164
I know Jim probably has too.

779
01:18:28,644 --> 01:18:30,706
And we're, we're, we're into the bike thing.

780
01:18:30,746 --> 01:18:32,727
So we, um, as a company we are.

781
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:37,792
Um, so we have all the bike racks, sorry, internal to the garage.

782
01:18:38,572 --> 01:18:40,253
No, there was actually a couple extra ones.

783
01:18:40,373 --> 01:18:44,294
Um, there's a couple exterior ones is one next to the one 96 building that's outside.

784
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:53,476
There was also one, um, in the addition that Jim referred to earlier, the 2011 edition of back, uh, adjacent to the tracks it's underneath.

785
01:18:53,936 --> 01:18:58,437
It's open to the sides, but it's underneath the, the overhang adjacent to the loading dock.

786
01:18:58,457 --> 01:19:00,518
So there are one, two, three.

787
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,746
There are three places on the site that have bike racks.

788
01:19:03,986 --> 01:19:08,008
There is more concentrated in the garage, but they are available to everybody.

789
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:27,161
I don't know if you have any, if they're hard to see or whether they need any like little wayfinding, maybe especially for folks who may be going to the retail, you know, if there's a little, a little signage for bike parking so that they can go inside the garage.

790
01:19:27,702 --> 01:19:28,482
Yeah.

791
01:19:28,822 --> 01:19:31,064
That's totally can be added to that for sure.

792
01:19:35,546 --> 01:19:40,782
Just board members, feel free to jump in at any point if you have additional comments.

793
01:19:43,115 --> 01:19:48,838
Condition number three, we already talked about with Director Blake about the bike lanes.

794
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:50,759
So I don't think we need to talk about that.

795
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:59,404
Condition number four, pedestrian warning signs at the existing unsignalized crosswalks at Harris Road and Irvington Road pending Somerville approval.

796
01:20:00,245 --> 01:20:10,731
Proponents suggesting language saying, proponent to install static highly reflective pedestrian warning signs at the existing unsignalized crosswalks at Harris Road and Irvington Road.

797
01:20:11,211 --> 01:20:11,832
four total.

798
01:20:11,852 --> 01:20:15,835
I'll work in Somerville to be coordinated with the Medford Director of Traffic and Transportation.

799
01:20:15,855 --> 01:20:18,697
That seems fine.

800
01:20:22,576 --> 01:20:41,525
Condition number five that the proponent work with DCR to improve single timing at Mystic Valley Parkway and Boston Avenue and Mystic Valley Parkway and Auburn Street proposed revision to proponent to supply DCR with recommended timing modifications and on site engineering support to improve signal timing and Mystic Valley Parkway and Boston Avenue.

801
01:20:42,025 --> 01:20:44,587
and Mystic Valley Parkway and Auburn Street.

802
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:51,170
All control work on DCR equipment to be performed by DCR or its approved contractor.

803
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:53,031
Again, that seems fine.

804
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:55,072
Any comments by anyone?

805
01:20:55,092 --> 01:20:57,453
Okay.

806
01:20:57,513 --> 01:21:09,700
Condition number six, provision of occupancy sensors throughout the building with the suggested revision proponent to install Occupy sensors throughout the building addition in compliance with applicable building codes.

807
01:21:10,675 --> 01:21:12,035
also seems fine.

808
01:21:13,616 --> 01:21:16,856
Condition number seven, that any exterior lighting will be downlighting.

809
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:24,938
A proposed language by the proponent is proponent to use downlights in any new exterior light fixtures installed on the building addition.

810
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:37,181
And I'm wondering if there was a concern there about, are you gonna have some like uplighting, like spot uplighting, or you wanted to make the distinction between on the building versus exterior?

811
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:51,252
No, the only thing I think is we could potentially, we have done some enhancement lighting in the past, which is really kind of nice.

812
01:21:51,973 --> 01:22:04,103
We'd like to be able to potentially do that as well, but we're thinking, you know, the lighting to the security lighting and the, you know, the safety lighting, if you will, would be all down light on the building.

813
01:22:04,143 --> 01:22:04,643
That's fine.

814
01:22:06,345 --> 01:22:06,565
Yeah.

815
01:22:07,546 --> 01:22:09,528
Any concerns by board members about that?

816
01:22:09,568 --> 01:22:09,868
Are we good?

817
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:13,315
All right, hearing none.

818
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:19,057
Condition number eight, provision of additional trees to shade the patio area and sidewalk trees as appropriate.

819
01:22:19,097 --> 01:22:24,518
The proponent will work with the tree warden on selection of appropriate trees with height, but that will not disrupt sidewalk.

820
01:22:25,699 --> 01:22:37,502
Proposed revision stating proponent to install trees to shade the onsite amenity patio area as appropriate and to replace any dead or derelict trees existing in the tree wells adjacent to the property.

821
01:22:38,516 --> 01:22:44,240
to consult with the Medford Tree Warden to select species of trees which will not disrupt the sidewalk at maturity.

822
01:22:46,282 --> 01:23:01,413
And maybe we should add some language there just saying that if any trees are, existing trees on the property are removed as a result of the construction, that they will be, you know, at a minimum replaced.

823
01:23:03,574 --> 01:23:04,455
Totally fine with that.

824
01:23:08,247 --> 01:23:20,741
Condition number nine, the proponent will ensure that pedestrian crossings across the driveways remain at grade from sidewalk to sidewalk, either by painting crosswalks across the driveways or by making the crossing concrete match the sidewalk.

825
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:25,747
In the event that the driveways are reconstructed, the pedestrian crossing shall be maintained at the sidewalk level.

826
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:30,978
Proponent is agreeable that that stays as is.

827
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:37,724
Condition number 10, ensure that the rooftop equipment will be as low noise as is feasible and include appropriate noise screening.

828
01:23:37,984 --> 01:23:40,646
Again, proponent says that condition is agreeable as is.

829
01:23:41,827 --> 01:23:50,895
And then the final condition is compliance with the recommendations by the department headletters with a few clarifications, which

830
01:23:54,548 --> 01:23:57,250
want a couple with the fire chief's letter.

831
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:09,439
So the clarification of the proponent to consult with chief Giliberti regarding code compliant rooftop fall protection and the clear width of parking lot travel lane shall not be reduced from the current existing conditions.

832
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:22,169
And then we already discussed the city engineers letter, which included the traffic conditions saying that the community development board has identified in the above conditions one through 10,

833
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:26,400
traffic and transportation improvements to be implemented by the proponent.

834
01:24:28,382 --> 01:24:35,972
And then the final condition is just that the project subject to the city's solar ordinance and linkage fees, again, that language would stay the same.

835
01:24:38,902 --> 01:24:46,731
So a few things I think that we've covered at the meeting today, though, to include into the conditions.

836
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:55,121
One is to strengthen the landscaping at the north edge of the property.

837
01:24:57,992 --> 01:25:07,139
along the Butters line, also at the North end of the property to strengthen the landscaping at the entrance.

838
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:17,367
So to the extent possible, mirroring what you're doing at the Southern entrance.

839
01:25:17,787 --> 01:25:22,431
I think in terms of the facade, there's been a strong discussion on that.

840
01:25:22,551 --> 01:25:26,174
And so I think we should have

841
01:25:27,425 --> 01:25:52,096
include in the conditions language saying that the facade treatment will, at least along Boston Ave, will go down to the, be continued down to the ground level so that we don't have, again, some different kind of like just grayish or garage-like treatment at the bottom.

842
01:25:54,457 --> 01:25:54,637
Is that?

843
01:25:56,373 --> 01:25:57,075
Does that make sense?

844
01:25:57,095 --> 01:25:59,684
Is that your intention anyways from what I was hearing?

845
01:26:00,286 --> 01:26:01,149
Yes, I think.

846
01:26:02,988 --> 01:26:04,309
That makes sense.

847
01:26:04,469 --> 01:26:09,311
I just want to clarify it, though, that it's going to be kind of in the southern half of the building.

848
01:26:09,391 --> 01:26:12,032
We're still looking to kind of treat them as two separate.

849
01:26:12,052 --> 01:26:19,955
We're going to continue to treat the garage-only section as it has been, with obviously some modifications as we detail it.

850
01:26:20,015 --> 01:26:29,599
But if you're looking specifically at the lower section under the occupiable space, if you will, that's... Yeah, the mixed-use part of the building.

851
01:26:29,739 --> 01:26:30,340
Yeah, that's good.

852
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:31,641
application.

853
01:26:31,961 --> 01:26:42,932
Um, and I think there's, you know, there's a desire to see the wrapping of the garage section to be as opaque as possible.

854
01:26:43,673 --> 01:26:49,359
I know there's still some design work that you guys are going to be doing around both of these things, but Yep.

855
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:50,700
Fair enough.

856
01:26:52,222 --> 01:26:52,322
Um,

857
01:26:56,505 --> 01:27:07,230
And I think we wanted to also make sure that the Boston Avenue pedestrian entrance to the building was strengthened.

858
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:22,058
Board members, any other additions?

859
01:27:33,303 --> 01:27:35,064
Okay, seeing none.

860
01:27:35,704 --> 01:27:39,447
Oh, yes, Mr. Carr, I see you'd like to make a comment.

861
01:27:40,407 --> 01:27:54,916
Just real briefly, I assume that the changes to the Boston Ave elevation, these tweaks would be handled by Alicia at the staff level, it'd be something you'd have to work out with the planning board, is that correct?

862
01:27:56,057 --> 01:27:59,359
Yes, they wouldn't be coming back to us for that.

863
01:28:00,059 --> 01:28:00,879
Very good, thank you.

864
01:28:03,262 --> 01:28:04,523
Thank you, that's an excellent point.

865
01:28:04,783 --> 01:28:07,064
I appreciate that clarification.

866
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:23,371
All right, seeing no other hands raised for comments, then is there a motion by a board member to

867
01:28:25,057 --> 01:28:33,723
recommend approval of the project at 200 Boston Ave with the conditions that we've just outlined.

868
01:28:33,743 --> 01:28:41,769
This is Deanna.

869
01:28:41,809 --> 01:28:42,749
I'll make the motion.

870
01:28:42,769 --> 01:28:44,491
Thank you, Deanna.

871
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:45,331
Is there a second?

872
01:28:49,194 --> 01:28:50,035
This is Christy Dowd.

873
01:28:50,095 --> 01:28:50,595
I will second.

874
01:28:51,856 --> 01:28:52,616
Thank you, Christy.

875
01:28:53,276 --> 01:28:54,737
All right, going to a roll call vote.

876
01:28:54,977 --> 01:28:55,657
Deanna Peabody.

877
01:28:56,558 --> 01:28:56,658
Aye.

878
01:28:57,738 --> 01:28:58,378
Christy Dowd.

879
01:28:59,178 --> 01:28:59,319
Aye.

880
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:06,641
David Blumberg has recused himself, so Kless Andreasen.

881
01:29:07,781 --> 01:29:08,062
Yes.

882
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:09,882
Jackie Furtado.

883
01:29:13,743 --> 01:29:17,865
I wasn't sure that I was a yes, but I trust in the process and I'm a yes.

884
01:29:18,805 --> 01:29:18,925
Aye.

885
01:29:20,726 --> 01:29:21,086
Thank you.

886
01:29:21,579 --> 01:29:22,620
I think I got everybody.

887
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,341
All right, and I'm a yes as well.

888
01:29:26,582 --> 01:29:29,964
The motion unanimously passes with one recusal.

889
01:29:32,185 --> 01:29:34,446
So thank you very much for the effort that you've put into this.

890
01:29:36,423 --> 01:29:37,864
appreciate the improvements.

891
01:29:39,324 --> 01:29:43,386
Thank you to the board and for the patience with us here.

892
01:29:43,547 --> 01:29:52,591
We didn't mean to exercise anybody with this, but we very much appreciate all the effort that everybody collectively and individually has put into this.

893
01:29:52,711 --> 01:29:55,753
And we'll see where it goes.

894
01:29:56,713 --> 01:29:57,013
Awesome.

895
01:29:57,053 --> 01:29:57,754
Thank you so much.

896
01:29:58,034 --> 01:29:58,494
Have a great evening.

897
01:29:58,514 --> 01:30:00,195
Good luck with the project and with the ZBA.

898
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:01,396
Thank you so much.

899
01:30:01,836 --> 01:30:02,176
Thank you.

900
01:30:02,816 --> 01:30:03,136
Good night.

901
01:30:10,612 --> 01:30:19,794
All right, the next item on the agenda is site plan review recommendation to the Board of Appeals for 16 Foster Court.

902
01:30:20,534 --> 01:30:28,596
Again, the ZBA is the Special Permit Granting Authority, so we would be charged with providing a set of recommendations to the ZBA.

903
01:30:28,616 --> 01:30:34,937
Let me just call out the notice here.

904
01:30:42,616 --> 01:30:49,978
Okay, the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on September 15th, oh, no, 22nd, 2021, after 6 p.m.

905
01:30:49,998 --> 01:30:59,860
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for a site plan review submitted by Ari Goldschneider to construct a new structure at 16 Foster Court.

906
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:09,703
Scope of work for this project consists of a four-story building containing eight residential dwelling units in an apartment two zoning district, which is unallowed use.

907
01:31:10,707 --> 01:31:19,133
This project is subject to site plan review special permit as per the city of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94, section 94-332.

908
01:31:19,914 --> 01:31:22,576
Project also requires approvals from the board of appeals.

909
01:31:25,818 --> 01:31:32,523
Could the proponent Mr. Goldschneider make a presentation about the project?

910
01:31:33,292 --> 01:31:35,833
Good evening, Chairman LaRue and board members.

911
01:31:35,873 --> 01:31:41,076
Kathleen Desmond here from Conway Law on behalf of the proponent, Ari Goldschneider.

912
01:31:41,456 --> 01:31:58,905
In addition to Mr. Goldschneider, we have the project architect with us, Adam Glassman of GCD Architects of Cambridge, the project engineer, Guillermo Beltran of Spruhan Engineering located in Newton, and our traffic engineer, Steven Siragusa of Design Consultants of Somerville.

913
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:10,199
At this point, I know that most, if not all, of the board members are somewhat familiar with the outline of the proposed project, as we did have an informal meeting and able to discuss the overall design.

914
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:16,542
Following that meeting and the comments received, the team did go back and revise the plans to incorporate comments.

915
01:32:16,982 --> 01:32:23,385
I'll provide a little background for those viewers that may not be familiar with the scope of the project and then turn the presentation over to the design team.

916
01:32:24,059 --> 01:32:35,727
The subject site is situated on foster court, which is private way, located off of Riverside Avenue, within a half a mile of public parks and shopping areas, such as the medical mall and the fellows way Plaza.

917
01:32:36,167 --> 01:32:41,691
The property is located within an apartment to district and as you had indicated is allowed to use.

918
01:32:42,371 --> 01:32:46,894
At present there's a two family structure, which sits on an approximately 13,696 square foot parcel of land.

919
01:32:50,148 --> 01:33:02,058
The proposed project calls for the demolition of the two family structure, and in accordance with the plan submitted the construction of a residential building that is comprised of a garden level, three above grade floors and a penthouse level.

920
01:33:02,558 --> 01:33:05,501
The overall height of the building will be approximately 48 feet.

921
01:33:06,381 --> 01:33:13,587
When completed the proposed structure will include eight residential units consisting of two 62 bedroom units and two three bedroom units.

922
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:17,570
The two bedroom units will be approximately 1160 square feet of living space.

923
01:33:20,115 --> 01:33:26,918
and the two third floor bedroom units will be a slightly larger consisting of approximately 1730 square feet.

924
01:33:27,538 --> 01:33:34,480
The units will be distributed evenly between the floors of the building, including the garden level, each of the units will have some exterior living space.

925
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:39,622
The total gross floor area of the building as proposed will be approximately 11,511 square feet.

926
01:33:39,642 --> 01:33:40,903
In terms of zoning relief briefly.

927
01:33:45,415 --> 01:34:06,846
of the proposed uses of permitted use within the S apartment to district, the zoning relief side is modest requiring dimensional relief by way of a variance of finding as to the left yard setback lot with usable open space parking, and due to the cover nature of the porch, a finding of not substantially more detrimental, because with the covered porch.

928
01:34:07,926 --> 01:34:11,348
It then encroaches into the, into the front yard.

929
01:34:12,282 --> 01:34:20,186
with that brief overview, I'll turn the presentation over to the project architect, Adam Glassman, and he can run through the plans in more detail for the board.

930
01:34:20,887 --> 01:34:21,087
Sure.

931
01:34:21,127 --> 01:34:22,608
Could I have permission to share the screen?

932
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:35,735
Should be good now, Adam.

933
01:34:37,903 --> 01:34:42,526
So can everybody see what I'm sharing, the street Google view of Foster Court?

934
01:34:43,327 --> 01:34:43,527
Yes.

935
01:34:44,147 --> 01:34:49,671
Okay, I'd like to take everyone on a brief tour just to clarify the context for everyone.

936
01:34:50,692 --> 01:34:55,315
This is the intersection of Riverside and Foster Court.

937
01:34:55,975 --> 01:35:05,842
You can see the existing housing stock, mainly two and a half story to two story wood frame structures.

938
01:35:07,616 --> 01:35:10,397
on this, this is the north side of our site.

939
01:35:10,617 --> 01:35:15,819
And this is where we've got this older housing stock, extensive asphalt paving.

940
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:25,363
We have no sidewalks.

941
01:35:26,184 --> 01:35:30,745
Many of the homes have no front landscape buffers.

942
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:34,107
This takes us to

943
01:35:36,645 --> 01:35:41,867
Our site, 16 Foster Court, which everyone's probably familiar with the structure.

944
01:35:44,068 --> 01:35:49,410
More local context, what we've got to respond to.

945
01:35:51,091 --> 01:35:55,533
Again, this is a neighborhood that I would say could use some improvements, and I think we offer that.

946
01:35:56,914 --> 01:36:04,477
The south side, we have the Medford Housing Authority with longer two, two and a half story

947
01:36:05,732 --> 01:36:15,841
residential structures, and on the perimeter of the site, we've got a mix of one-story structures.

948
01:36:22,286 --> 01:36:33,155
We have walkability on the north side, or on the south side with the sidewalks here, and the sidewalks terminate at the Medford Housing Authority.

949
01:36:36,593 --> 01:36:39,594
We'll now, let's see, share a different screen.

950
01:36:44,076 --> 01:36:46,157
Okay, can everyone see the cover sheet to our plans?

951
01:36:49,658 --> 01:36:50,059
No, Adam.

952
01:36:50,459 --> 01:36:52,239
All right, here we go.

953
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,201
How about now?

954
01:36:55,241 --> 01:36:58,142
You probably shared just that window.

955
01:36:58,842 --> 01:36:59,462
We got it now.

956
01:37:00,183 --> 01:37:00,643
Oh, you got it.

957
01:37:00,663 --> 01:37:01,163
Okay, hold on.

958
01:37:04,244 --> 01:37:05,105
Sometimes there's a delay.

959
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:06,971
Sorry about that, you see it now?

960
01:37:08,252 --> 01:37:08,392
Yep.

961
01:37:08,993 --> 01:37:16,118
Okay, all right, so existing- Hey Adam, can you close the right side so the screen just gets a little bit bigger, hit that arrow all the way in the middle.

962
01:37:16,138 --> 01:37:16,199
Oh.

963
01:37:16,759 --> 01:37:17,780
Down, right in the middle.

964
01:37:19,121 --> 01:37:20,302
Gotcha, okay, thank you.

965
01:37:20,942 --> 01:37:32,152
Okay, existing foster court, one and a half story structure, and our proposed three story, eight unit, three story plus penthouse, eight unit new construction.

966
01:37:34,751 --> 01:37:36,052
Cathy, did you want to go through the zoning?

967
01:37:39,274 --> 01:37:39,775
Oh, you're muted.

968
01:37:43,918 --> 01:37:48,961
As I indicated previously, we're in compliance with all but the left side yard setback.

969
01:37:50,182 --> 01:37:56,266
The, the width of a lot because it varies from place to place.

970
01:37:57,411 --> 01:38:00,472
parking because we have 10 spaces required would be 16.

971
01:38:01,253 --> 01:38:10,957
And the covered porch, because it's covered, it encroaches into if it was an uncovered porch, it would not be considered a zoning violation, but there is a bit of an encroachment.

972
01:38:11,697 --> 01:38:18,020
But that's essentially what we will be seeking relief for under the zoning ordinance.

973
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:19,841
Thanks, Kathy.

974
01:38:20,921 --> 01:38:23,883
The existing site plan, almost 14,000 square feet,

975
01:38:25,298 --> 01:38:28,359
the existing structure to be removed.

976
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:41,182
Some of the design constraints or challenges that we have would be A, the geometry of the lot, it's long, narrow, almost trapezoidal.

977
01:38:42,282 --> 01:38:49,064
We did design to fit originally the entire structure responding to these setbacks.

978
01:38:50,064 --> 01:38:53,745
Outside of the required setbacks, however, in response to some CD comments,

979
01:38:54,773 --> 01:38:57,836
We did add a covered front porch, which was a good addition.

980
01:38:58,296 --> 01:38:59,157
It does require relief.

981
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:10,506
We're offering 10 parking spaces, two of which can be made into handicap use spaces when required, when needed.

982
01:39:11,066 --> 01:39:14,469
We've got a 20 foot wide fire lane on the south side.

983
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:21,214
So between the fire lane and the setbacks, we're constrained to a very small portion of this site.

984
01:39:21,275 --> 01:39:22,916
We're squeezed in from the parking on the right,

985
01:39:23,947 --> 01:39:27,068
and the left side setback.

986
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:32,871
Overview of the, uh.

987
01:39:33,771 --> 01:39:41,014
Local housing types building types that we are trying to respond to in a sensitive way, uh, directly behind foster court.

988
01:39:41,955 --> 01:39:42,675
Uh B is the

989
01:39:51,248 --> 01:39:54,592
Lots of brick, not much detail, lots of asphalt.

990
01:39:56,113 --> 01:39:57,675
Here is Foster Court, obviously.

991
01:39:58,155 --> 01:40:03,701
We've got the mix of very small housing types, any of which precede the zoning code.

992
01:40:04,242 --> 01:40:09,527
Then we've got these monsters that kind of loom over this area.

993
01:40:10,628 --> 01:40:12,170
Mystic apartments, I think.

994
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:20,245
of the intersection visually a lot of these housing types, uh, and we're trying to bridge them.

995
01:40:20,846 --> 01:40:21,266
Visually.

996
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,790
Uh site plan.

997
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:27,634
Um This describes, uh,

998
01:40:29,317 --> 01:40:30,658
that we're removing all asphalt.

999
01:40:30,698 --> 01:40:32,979
There'll be no asphalt used on this site at all.

1000
01:40:33,299 --> 01:40:54,591
We've got pervious pavers for parking, a 24 foot wide parking lane, pavers for the parking in the rear, paver pathways around the building, landscape areas around the building, along Foster Court, along the left side property line.

1001
01:40:54,891 --> 01:40:57,653
We're introducing a sidewalk on

1002
01:40:58,732 --> 01:40:59,493
will be.

1003
01:40:59,533 --> 01:41:02,616
Uh 16 foster court property, uh, bill be, um.

1004
01:41:03,316 --> 01:41:06,379
Open and available per easement to the public.

1005
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:17,188
This will connect to the, uh, uh, sidewalks at the Medford Housing Authority, so be improving the connectivity or the walk ability of the

1006
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:26,559
Um, we've added.

1007
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:30,621
Uh garden areas that are towards the front of the building towards Foster Court.

1008
01:41:31,141 --> 01:41:35,062
We've landscaped wherever we can, uh, in the remaining areas.

1009
01:41:35,082 --> 01:41:40,524
Uh existing trees in the rear to remain with additional trees added.

1010
01:41:41,264 --> 01:41:44,125
Again all humane paving design.

1011
01:41:44,705 --> 01:41:45,466
No asphalt.

1012
01:41:46,386 --> 01:41:47,546
Uh.

1013
01:41:47,586 --> 01:41:49,667
Wood fence, not a stockade style, but

1014
01:41:55,824 --> 01:41:56,064
that we have.

1015
01:41:56,224 --> 01:41:57,606
Low level exterior lighting.

1016
01:41:57,626 --> 01:42:03,592
On all this would be a massive improvement to what exists there now.

1017
01:42:07,656 --> 01:42:08,658
As Kathy said, we have eight

1018
01:42:17,996 --> 01:42:19,117
to 1100 square feet.

1019
01:42:19,597 --> 01:42:28,822
The top two units that have duplex penthouse spaces can accommodate three bedrooms at approximately 1700 square feet.

1020
01:42:29,242 --> 01:42:37,486
And that third bedroom has the diversity of who can live here, who we can appeal to, families, perhaps larger families.

1021
01:42:38,847 --> 01:42:41,308
But these are all modest size two and three bedroom units.

1022
01:42:45,288 --> 01:42:48,811
I don't know how far you want to get into the floor plans are pretty straightforward.

1023
01:42:48,931 --> 01:42:52,994
Each each unit aside from the penthouse has two bedrooms, open living.

1024
01:42:54,235 --> 01:42:55,016
Two bathrooms.

1025
01:42:55,617 --> 01:43:04,064
This is the garden level, which would be accessed by a lift at a main entry at grade.

1026
01:43:06,866 --> 01:43:10,189
These renderings are a good representation of the

1027
01:43:11,493 --> 01:43:16,456
the quality of these units, the livability, the natural light, the materials.

1028
01:43:17,476 --> 01:43:32,304
Often we hear garden level and people assume it's a non-desirable housing, but contrary, these would be comfortable, functional, delightful units.

1029
01:43:35,245 --> 01:43:36,926
First floor, we have a central entry.

1030
01:43:37,473 --> 01:43:37,773
the first floor.

1031
01:43:37,813 --> 01:43:42,617
Into a common hall with common stare that brings us up to the first level, which is six ft above grade.

1032
01:43:44,959 --> 01:43:50,503
Unit number three facing Foster Court has an exclusive use farmers porch.

1033
01:43:53,965 --> 01:43:56,047
And then the second and third floors

1034
01:44:07,085 --> 01:44:10,587
where these units all each have a roof deck.

1035
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:26,097
I should back up and just say all units have exclusive outdoor space, generous sized balconies that are also life safety feature desired by the fire department, but mainly it's an amenity to enjoy an exterior connection.

1036
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:34,943
All units have these balconies, aside from, you know,

1037
01:44:36,335 --> 01:44:38,435
the more unique farmer's porch for unit three.

1038
01:44:39,336 --> 01:44:52,398
Unit four does not have balconies and neither do the garden level units, but they could have exclusive use yard space.

1039
01:44:52,438 --> 01:44:56,079
Proposed materials, image of the street view.

1040
01:44:57,079 --> 01:45:02,780
We're using mainly traditional language, high quality materials.

1041
01:45:03,808 --> 01:45:03,908
with.

1042
01:45:03,928 --> 01:45:05,288
Aluminum clad windows.

1043
01:45:06,169 --> 01:45:09,330
Um you know, heavy detailing at.

1044
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:10,790
The roof edge.

1045
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:14,451
Covered farmer's porch landscaping.

1046
01:45:17,912 --> 01:45:19,452
Penthouses set back far enough.

1047
01:45:20,113 --> 01:45:21,333
That really from the street view.

1048
01:45:21,353 --> 01:45:24,374
This reads more as a. Three story

1049
01:45:32,488 --> 01:45:38,833
view from the left side shows how we've broken up the massing, responding to the setback envelope, responding to the narrowness of the site.

1050
01:45:38,973 --> 01:45:41,715
But this is not a monolithic box.

1051
01:45:41,795 --> 01:45:54,184
I say we try to break this up into visually digestible parts, break up the scale and respond well to the context of the neighborhood.

1052
01:45:56,526 --> 01:45:57,587
More exterior views.

1053
01:46:00,108 --> 01:46:01,610
The massing is in three main parts.

1054
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:01,910
The two

1055
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:21,761
let's call them the residential ends, and then the common stair, an entry in the middle, and then the penthouses on the roof, with the roof decks on either end, and on top of the penthouse level, screened solar panels and mechanical units.

1056
01:46:27,544 --> 01:46:28,324
Some of the positive

1057
01:46:30,256 --> 01:46:30,496
neighborhood.

1058
01:46:30,516 --> 01:46:37,478
Contributions to this neighborhood that we believe the project brings would be additional or increased improved walkability.

1059
01:46:38,178 --> 01:46:39,098
Handicap mobility.

1060
01:46:40,038 --> 01:46:41,699
For the new sidewalk.

1061
01:46:43,139 --> 01:46:43,859
Landscaping.

1062
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:46,960
Where there currently is none.

1063
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,180
This is.

1064
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:49,961
I'd say

1065
01:46:57,248 --> 01:47:04,509
farmer's porch as a level of neighborhood connectivity between people on the street.

1066
01:47:05,229 --> 01:47:09,570
The people in this unit who can enjoy farmer's porch ties into the farmers.

1067
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:13,231
There are some farmer's porch elements on the street that we're picking up on.

1068
01:47:14,571 --> 01:47:23,053
Again, there'll be no new asphalt, all existing asphalt will be removed, bringing high quality construction to a neighborhood that hasn't seen any in a very long time.

1069
01:47:24,233 --> 01:47:25,633
Our emphasis on traditional

1070
01:47:26,528 --> 01:47:26,988
of the building.

1071
01:47:27,169 --> 01:47:29,330
Textures colors window patterns.

1072
01:47:32,293 --> 01:47:39,138
Again the modestly sized 2 to 3 bedroom units are appealing to, uh, we think families younger families growing families.

1073
01:47:40,299 --> 01:47:40,379
Um.

1074
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:45,263
We can talk about the building

1075
01:47:54,674 --> 01:47:59,277
This diagram on the left is the allowable building height for an apartment use, which is 75 feet.

1076
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:14,725
We are proposing a high, the penthouse roof to be 48 feet, substantially lower than what's allowed and not substantially higher than what one could build with a two or three family with a gable roof.

1077
01:48:15,766 --> 01:48:22,650
And dormers, essentially very similar massing, similar volumes, foster court, which,

1078
01:48:24,557 --> 01:48:29,401
is completely undersized for this zone and for modern living.

1079
01:48:31,643 --> 01:48:49,120
Again, the housing types we have around us that we're trying to bridge the monsters at the perimeter and some of these maybe less thoughtfully designed multifamily that abut 16 Foster Court, smaller two and a half story

1080
01:48:49,966 --> 01:48:53,807
structures, blend of styles, scales, sizes, colors, materials.

1081
01:48:54,568 --> 01:49:09,013
And we're trying to bring something that maybe could be a new something, a new scale to the site, but using traditional materials.

1082
01:49:10,954 --> 01:49:13,855
Elevations, again, call out materials that we're using.

1083
01:49:15,935 --> 01:49:16,115
the front.

1084
01:49:16,135 --> 01:49:20,299
Two traditional ends with a more contemporary central connector.

1085
01:49:21,079 --> 01:49:23,581
Uh cementitious panels grid system using.

1086
01:49:24,863 --> 01:49:26,204
Field color and accent color.

1087
01:49:28,285 --> 01:49:30,848
Sense of balconies, French doors, double hung windows.

1088
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:34,691
The backside or the left side.

1089
01:49:37,053 --> 01:49:37,293
The new

1090
01:49:42,677 --> 01:49:47,001
bringing sidewalks and landscaping to a neighborhood that needs both.

1091
01:49:50,203 --> 01:49:52,525
Civil plan remain points to make.

1092
01:49:53,806 --> 01:50:04,155
We are bringing in a new sanitary service connection, new copper four inch fire protection service, two inch copper domestic service, subsurface infiltration pipe and crushed stone.

1093
01:50:06,757 --> 01:50:09,900
Should I take any questions or should I move into the shadow study?

1094
01:50:12,092 --> 01:50:14,974
You can move into the shadow study.

1095
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:19,458
Okay, so summer 10 a.m.

1096
01:50:19,558 --> 01:50:27,204
existing, between the existing and the proposed shadows, there are no shadows cast on abutting properties.

1097
01:50:30,886 --> 01:50:39,613
Summer 2 p.m., the summer solstice, casting more shadows than we do currently, but the shadows for the most part are contained within the site.

1098
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:44,104
Summer solstice, 5 p.m.

1099
01:50:44,124 --> 01:50:47,905
The shadows are directed directly behind the building.

1100
01:50:48,465 --> 01:50:49,926
Shadows again contained to the site.

1101
01:50:51,907 --> 01:50:52,667
Fall equinox.

1102
01:50:54,548 --> 01:50:58,489
Shadows cast slightly over the edge of our left side property line.

1103
01:50:59,269 --> 01:51:02,230
This is actually the garage for our abutter.

1104
01:51:02,751 --> 01:51:04,251
This is a garden shed.

1105
01:51:05,031 --> 01:51:11,654
Each of these abutting structures are approximately 50 feet away from our actual building.

1106
01:51:14,994 --> 01:51:17,196
Fall Equinox, 2 p.m.

1107
01:51:18,277 --> 01:51:19,998
Existing shadows contained on the lot.

1108
01:51:20,138 --> 01:51:24,542
We do have shadows here cast in the backyard of our abutter.

1109
01:51:25,443 --> 01:51:30,427
That's a rare moment of shadow casting, a rare and brief moment.

1110
01:51:33,249 --> 01:51:44,038
Fall Equinox, we've got very similar shadow cast on the abutters between the existing and the proposed

1111
01:51:46,871 --> 01:51:52,314
Winter solstice, some shadows cast, again, minimal and brief.

1112
01:51:55,856 --> 01:52:00,939
Winter solstice, noon, again, some shadows cast.

1113
01:52:03,401 --> 01:52:05,282
Winter solstice, 3 p.m., no change.

1114
01:52:07,043 --> 01:52:08,784
Very little change, spring equinox.

1115
01:52:11,325 --> 01:52:13,987
Modest change, spring equinox, midday.

1116
01:52:16,042 --> 01:52:18,983
and shadows cast at 3 p.m.

1117
01:52:21,865 --> 01:52:27,467
So the image that I will end the presentation on is just a view from Foster Court from the right side.

1118
01:52:28,548 --> 01:52:44,796
We've got the existing structures on the left, our emphasis on traditional materials, masonry veneer at the garden level, substantially sized garden level windows, farmer's porch with a screened underneath,

1119
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:51,722
our balconies, and that's what we got.

1120
01:52:56,544 --> 01:52:56,744
Great.

1121
01:52:57,165 --> 01:52:59,646
Thank you very much, Architect Glassman.

1122
01:53:01,426 --> 01:53:06,989
I do want to recognize the fact that you put a lot of work into this.

1123
01:53:07,009 --> 01:53:12,611
I appreciate the fact that we had an opportunity to have a preliminary conversation at a prior meeting.

1124
01:53:13,563 --> 01:53:18,985
I does have to recognize that you took a lot of that feedback into into account.

1125
01:53:19,005 --> 01:53:20,826
So we we do appreciate that.

1126
01:53:20,846 --> 01:53:26,728
Mr. Chairman, our traffic expert is here as well.

1127
01:53:26,768 --> 01:53:31,490
And he can take you through the site plan as to parking and vehicle.

1128
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:34,571
Okay, that would be great.

1129
01:53:34,751 --> 01:53:35,391
Thank you.

1130
01:53:35,691 --> 01:53:36,311
Steve, could you?

1131
01:53:38,092 --> 01:53:38,552
Absolutely.

1132
01:53:38,572 --> 01:53:39,352
Can everybody hear America?

1133
01:53:40,353 --> 01:53:40,533
Yes.

1134
01:53:41,188 --> 01:53:44,850
All right, never too sure with a new computer and new headphones, anything can happen.

1135
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:47,971
So my name is Steve Sergus.

1136
01:53:48,031 --> 01:53:49,372
I work for Design Consultants.

1137
01:53:49,672 --> 01:53:52,493
We're at 120 Middlesex Avenue in Somerville.

1138
01:53:53,934 --> 01:53:57,755
So we put together a memorandum that basically has three parts.

1139
01:53:57,775 --> 01:54:05,339
There's a trip generation part, a parking section, and a site distance section that I know I believe was requested.

1140
01:54:07,329 --> 01:54:11,832
The parking section is more robust, so I will go through that last.

1141
01:54:13,512 --> 01:54:21,396
The trip generation, so we did this in coordination with Todd Blake, who is the director of traffic in Medford.

1142
01:54:23,397 --> 01:54:33,322
And so the way we did the trip generation is we calculated using the ITE trip generation manual and census track data, which is industry standard practice.

1143
01:54:34,262 --> 01:54:35,643
And those calculations

1144
01:54:37,082 --> 01:54:42,667
gave us an estimated two vehicle trips in the weekday a.m.

1145
01:54:42,707 --> 01:54:47,230
peak hour and three vehicle trips during the weekday p.m.

1146
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:47,811
peak hour.

1147
01:54:48,671 --> 01:54:51,674
So those peak hours occur between 7 and 9 a.m.

1148
01:54:52,775 --> 01:54:53,675
or 4 and 6 p.m.

1149
01:54:54,216 --> 01:55:01,802
as again is defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers as ITE as I will refer to them.

1150
01:55:02,935 --> 01:55:04,056
So that's the trip generation.

1151
01:55:04,176 --> 01:55:14,122
Again, it was done in coordination with Director Blake, and I know that he had mentioned in his letter that he agreed with the way that we did that.

1152
01:55:14,943 --> 01:55:22,147
The second section is the site distance, which I believe was requested in addition to the original memo we did.

1153
01:55:23,188 --> 01:55:24,489
And so the way we looked at that

1154
01:55:25,422 --> 01:55:26,823
was also industry standard.

1155
01:55:27,903 --> 01:55:32,446
So AASHTO is the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials.

1156
01:55:33,006 --> 01:55:47,973
They put out recommendations of site distances that they need to see, that driveways or intersections should, or recommended distances that a vehicle, a driver needs to see in order to safely enter a roadway.

1157
01:55:49,094 --> 01:55:52,336
And so again, we did that, industry standard practices.

1158
01:55:54,293 --> 01:56:03,104
And we really only looked at a right turn from the driveway onto Foster Court since there's no through connectivity south on Foster Court.

1159
01:56:03,624 --> 01:56:06,628
It is just to the housing that is there.

1160
01:56:07,429 --> 01:56:11,875
We believe, you know, vehicles are really only coming out of this site making a right turn towards Riverside.

1161
01:56:13,733 --> 01:56:33,432
The recommended sight distance at 25 miles an hour, which, you know, Foster Court, maximum hopefully 25 miles an hour, is a sight distance 240 feet for a driver to safely enter the roadway without anybody needing to brake.

1162
01:56:34,052 --> 01:56:36,273
or swerve or anything like that.

1163
01:56:37,013 --> 01:56:44,757
And the measured sight distance that we got from this proposed driveway is greater than 250 feet looking south onto Foster Court.

1164
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:59,703
And with no addition of any high trees or anything like that adjacent to the driveway, the sight distances will be safe for drivers exiting the driveway.

1165
01:57:00,784 --> 01:57:03,125
The third section is the parking section.

1166
01:57:03,935 --> 01:57:09,381
which was the more robust in the report, had a lot of numbers, big table with a lot of numbers.

1167
01:57:11,243 --> 01:57:19,511
So the way that we did that is we reviewed two different manuals.

1168
01:57:19,571 --> 01:57:25,437
So the first one was a perfect fit parking initiative, which was done by the MAPC.

1169
01:57:26,658 --> 01:57:32,201
and they have about 50 to 100 sites that they study.

1170
01:57:33,002 --> 01:57:38,224
And what comes out of that is an average of parking demand.

1171
01:57:38,264 --> 01:57:42,666
So basically occupied parking spaces per unit for each of these sites.

1172
01:57:43,587 --> 01:57:55,053
And what we did is we filtered out from all of those sites that we only looked at sites with less than 25 units, which is what this is being proposed as, and which is more than

1173
01:57:55,853 --> 01:58:05,442
half a mile from a rapid transit station, which there's bus lines that go along Riverside Drive, but rapid transit is not within a half a mile.

1174
01:58:05,522 --> 01:58:21,996
So we looked at only those sites, and there was an average of 0.78 parking spaces per unit, which, if applicable to this site for eight units, would be a demand of about 0.6 parking spaces, and we are providing 10.

1175
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:28,221
For comparison, we looked at the three sites in this study from Medford.

1176
01:58:29,181 --> 01:58:36,822
Those average about 240 units, and they were within a half a mile, so slightly larger than the eight units that are here.

1177
01:58:37,543 --> 01:58:51,205
But we wanted to get just a comparison of Medford units, and they average 1.02 parking spaces per unit, which again would be a demand of about nine parking spaces here, which is still less than the 10 that are being provided.

1178
01:58:52,515 --> 01:58:57,336
And then the second report that we looked at is the ITE parking generation manual.

1179
01:58:57,376 --> 01:59:00,037
So same idea as the trip generation manual.

1180
01:59:01,037 --> 01:59:04,658
They give average rates for each land use.

1181
01:59:05,239 --> 01:59:09,500
So we took the applicable land use here, which was for an apartment complex.

1182
01:59:10,747 --> 01:59:16,534
And their average demand during the day was 1.31 parking spaces per unit.

1183
01:59:16,574 --> 01:59:20,659
So that comes out to about 10 and a half parking spaces per unit.

1184
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:25,304
But that is just slightly over what is being provided here.

1185
01:59:26,653 --> 01:59:48,065
All in all, given the demand of a lot of sites within Arlington, Chelsea, Watertown, Melrose, and Malden, which is what that perfect fit parking initiative looked at sites from, I do believe that this site will be providing enough parking for the units that are there.

1186
01:59:48,945 --> 01:59:52,607
So I will end it there, and I'm more than happy to answer any questions anybody has.

1187
01:59:56,463 --> 01:59:56,703
Thanks.

1188
01:59:56,763 --> 02:00:01,288
Mr. Saragusa, how would the parking units gonna be allocated among the units?

1189
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:07,994
I will leave that question to either Kathleen or our developer.

1190
02:00:09,535 --> 02:00:10,876
At least one per unit.

1191
02:00:11,657 --> 02:00:16,201
I'm not sure how the extra two units, two parking spaces will be allocated yet.

1192
02:00:24,911 --> 02:00:27,632
These are, remind me, these are ownership units?

1193
02:00:28,412 --> 02:00:28,952
Will this be?

1194
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:38,134
I suspect so, but to be determined, I suspect there'll be ownership units, yes, but subject to market change.

1195
02:00:43,255 --> 02:00:45,776
Would you be able to stop sharing your screen?

1196
02:00:49,952 --> 02:00:55,795
One thing before we go Mr. Chairman on that screen just to put before you, in terms of the engineers comments.

1197
02:00:56,596 --> 02:01:06,761
We did include electric charging stations which was one of the requests and you'll see that as he would position that closest to the building in the traffic report.

1198
02:01:07,401 --> 02:01:19,047
There was also a question as to the pinch point the 12 feet, going from the larger parking area to the, the ingress, those spaces are handicapped but they can convert to

1199
02:01:19,564 --> 02:01:26,386
normal spaces in the event that there's no need for the handicap use, in which case that pinch point will be greater.

1200
02:01:26,406 --> 02:01:37,989
And we also have an X where there would be signage so that cars would be warned that there's cars coming in and out of that reduced way.

1201
02:01:39,169 --> 02:01:41,450
And I just want to point that out before the screen disappears.

1202
02:01:50,746 --> 02:01:52,267
Audrey, this is Jackie.

1203
02:01:52,767 --> 02:02:00,211
If the proponent can remind us, are you applying for a special exception for the parking requirement?

1204
02:02:00,811 --> 02:02:03,573
It's 1.5 from Medford.

1205
02:02:03,613 --> 02:02:04,733
Am I correct, Alicia?

1206
02:02:06,274 --> 02:02:08,655
It's two parking spaces per dwelling unit.

1207
02:02:08,775 --> 02:02:11,177
So we are seeking a variance for the parking.

1208
02:02:11,617 --> 02:02:13,638
The required would be 16, and we have 10.

1209
02:02:14,438 --> 02:02:16,760
When we were at the preliminary meeting,

1210
02:02:18,218 --> 02:02:23,483
There is the availability of two spaces on that front curb, but nobody really wants to do that.

1211
02:02:23,943 --> 02:02:27,626
So we're going to go forward with the 10 spaces and look for variance.

1212
02:02:30,509 --> 02:02:32,150
Kathy is correct about the zoning.

1213
02:02:35,893 --> 02:02:36,834
I mean, it's preferable.

1214
02:02:36,854 --> 02:02:40,277
I just know that it's Medford's policy.

1215
02:02:40,877 --> 02:02:41,518
I was just wondering.

1216
02:02:46,498 --> 02:02:52,263
We also, I know we have some comments that have been emailed from residents.

1217
02:02:52,403 --> 02:03:03,772
So we can take those now before we start a conversation or if we have, why don't we take any members of the public who have comments who are actually on the Zoom.

1218
02:03:03,792 --> 02:03:06,114
Let's do that first and then we'll read the emailed comments.

1219
02:03:07,955 --> 02:03:10,617
Yes, my name is Tom Sowers.

1220
02:03:10,638 --> 02:03:11,218
Can you hear me?

1221
02:03:12,059 --> 02:03:12,339
Yes, sir.

1222
02:03:12,927 --> 02:03:16,490
Oh, thank you, I'm new to Zoom here, so forgive me.

1223
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:22,736
I'm an owner, one of the 16 owners at 305 Riverside Avenue.

1224
02:03:25,678 --> 02:03:39,471
I have serious concerns about the size of this building in terms of virtually eliminating much of the green space, certainly all the green space adjacent to our property.

1225
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:59,978
I am concerned that about drainage, which hasn't been discussed here and looking over the plans, concerned about potential impact on drainage with the cash basin as described, parking situation.

1226
02:04:00,178 --> 02:04:01,939
We have a lot of experience in our building.

1227
02:04:03,099 --> 02:04:06,080
We only have one parking space per unit.

1228
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:14,447
And we have serious problems because we have people that come in that have two cars, and there's problems with that.

1229
02:04:14,587 --> 02:04:16,568
And there's no parking on Riverside Avenue.

1230
02:04:17,289 --> 02:04:19,991
So people have to try to find parking somewhere in the neighborhood.

1231
02:04:20,432 --> 02:04:23,714
One of the places people have parked is on Foster Court.

1232
02:04:25,616 --> 02:04:29,760
I was over there on Foster Court on Sunday.

1233
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:31,601
Both sides of the street fully parked in.

1234
02:04:35,773 --> 02:05:03,675
In our opinion, a two to three family building that is consistent with other structures in the neighborhood would eliminate problems, basically eliminating all the green space and paving it over right up to our property, probably would ameliorate drainage problems and would also

1235
02:05:04,925 --> 02:05:06,386
reduce parking problems.

1236
02:05:06,426 --> 02:05:07,327
We have parking problems.

1237
02:05:08,187 --> 02:05:10,849
Other people from the neighborhood come and park and aren't a lot.

1238
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:16,532
That's how serious the parking situation is in the neighborhood.

1239
02:05:17,933 --> 02:05:23,096
So I'd like to raise all those questions for consideration by the board.

1240
02:05:23,296 --> 02:05:23,616
Thank you.

1241
02:05:25,457 --> 02:05:26,057
Thank you, sir.

1242
02:05:28,619 --> 02:05:32,441
Are there other members of the public who wish to comment?

1243
02:05:36,374 --> 02:05:38,175
I see a call on people.

1244
02:05:38,235 --> 02:05:41,297
So yes, so I see William Navarri.

1245
02:05:41,397 --> 02:05:43,379
Sorry if I said your name incorrectly.

1246
02:05:43,459 --> 02:05:44,559
You're welcome to comment.

1247
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:48,302
And if you could state your name and address for the record.

1248
02:05:48,322 --> 02:05:49,583
Yeah, you got that right.

1249
02:05:49,643 --> 02:05:50,043
Thank you.

1250
02:05:50,063 --> 02:05:55,266
William Navarra at A V A R R E 108 Medford Street number one B.

1251
02:05:56,600 --> 02:06:01,603
And I submitted a written comment, which I'll begin by reading that or at least an excerpt of that.

1252
02:06:02,003 --> 02:06:08,426
And basically I said, please support housing at 14 Foster Court to help combat sprawl and help alleviate the housing crisis.

1253
02:06:09,727 --> 02:06:14,149
I find that such a blessing to live in the city rather than in an automobile oriented sprawl.

1254
02:06:14,469 --> 02:06:17,390
And I want more people to be able to have the opportunity to have what I have.

1255
02:06:17,811 --> 02:06:21,993
Please support this housing that we need to go up if we want to be a welcoming city.

1256
02:06:23,404 --> 02:06:24,705
And so I hope you'll approve this.

1257
02:06:25,265 --> 02:06:30,549
And I actually do share some of the concerns about the green space and so on.

1258
02:06:30,649 --> 02:06:32,490
I visited the site and I saw the trees.

1259
02:06:33,291 --> 02:06:41,576
And I would offer that the problem with the green space is that so much parking is required, there's no room for green space.

1260
02:06:42,998 --> 02:06:47,864
So I would say that if we want the green space which is something I 100% support.

1261
02:06:48,605 --> 02:06:50,367
We asked them to put it even less parking.

1262
02:06:51,147 --> 02:07:02,020
And we make that trade off we say are we a city for housing and green space or are we a city for for an apartment with a with a parking lot that uses up all the green space, and we got to make that trade off.

1263
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:15,467
because saying that we're a city that asks people to drive, you know, to Belrica or something on I-93 in order to find housing because we're not going to build it here in Bedford, I don't think that goes with our values.

1264
02:07:15,627 --> 02:07:24,211
So we have a trade-off here and we need to make a decision that reflects our values and we can't say no to everything, we got to give somewhere.

1265
02:07:24,591 --> 02:07:31,435
So it would be lovely to have, I agree with that, the drainage, the green space, I'd love to have more green space here, but it's got to,

1266
02:07:31,735 --> 02:07:33,476
That means there's got to be less parking, right?

1267
02:07:33,496 --> 02:07:35,698
The parking requirement is why there's no green space.

1268
02:07:38,559 --> 02:07:38,840
Thanks.

1269
02:07:40,761 --> 02:07:41,661
Thank you, Mr. Navarro.

1270
02:07:44,383 --> 02:07:47,985
Amanda, I'll let you call on the next folks because you can see the hand raised.

1271
02:07:50,167 --> 02:07:50,507
Sure.

1272
02:07:51,027 --> 02:07:56,431
So I see here Doug Carr from the Historical Commission has his hand raised.

1273
02:07:57,491 --> 02:07:58,392
Would you like to go ahead, Doug?

1274
02:07:59,498 --> 02:07:59,678
Sure.

1275
02:07:59,698 --> 02:08:00,399
Thank you, Amanda.

1276
02:08:00,899 --> 02:08:03,821
Thank you again, Chair.

1277
02:08:05,322 --> 02:08:08,245
The Historical Commission sent a two-page letter.

1278
02:08:09,906 --> 02:08:18,352
I won't read it, obviously, go through it, but we essentially are saying that the project, we disagree with the project, not the overall project.

1279
02:08:18,372 --> 02:08:19,453
There should be a project here.

1280
02:08:19,493 --> 02:08:26,298
We agree with that, I think, once the idea that the existing house is not going to be saved, which the owner has made that decision clearly.

1281
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:29,651
But what I see here is not a three-story plus penthouse.

1282
02:08:29,731 --> 02:08:31,472
I really see almost a five-story building.

1283
02:08:31,552 --> 02:08:35,713
I see a building that is really, really tall for this context.

1284
02:08:36,714 --> 02:08:42,536
And a penthouse is a legal definition under most codes and state code.

1285
02:08:42,576 --> 02:08:45,857
It's only about a third the size of the footprint.

1286
02:08:45,897 --> 02:08:48,678
And this one is obviously much more than that.

1287
02:08:48,718 --> 02:08:52,800
This is really four and a half story building, which is dramatically bigger.

1288
02:08:53,586 --> 02:08:55,307
in scale than most of the neighborhood.

1289
02:08:55,387 --> 02:09:11,775
Obviously there's larger buildings further away that are much taller, but to say that the Boston Court building, the original building of this street was undersized is kind of a laughable comment since it predates every single building on this street for sure.

1290
02:09:12,755 --> 02:09:18,278
So we just disagree that this building, it just feels almost like a 40B project to me.

1291
02:09:18,338 --> 02:09:20,079
It feels like it's maxed within an inch of

1292
02:09:20,815 --> 02:09:22,376
potential for what could be built there.

1293
02:09:22,396 --> 02:09:29,801
It feels very, very inflated and as big as it possibly could be, which drives the green space down, the parking up.

1294
02:09:30,522 --> 02:09:32,383
And just one comment about the parking.

1295
02:09:32,443 --> 02:09:35,526
I'm a big fan of not having more parking than you need.

1296
02:09:35,606 --> 02:09:36,406
It's a waste of money.

1297
02:09:37,607 --> 02:09:43,591
But I see a spot there for ADA parking that looks like it's conditional in the drive lane, the 20-foot drive lane.

1298
02:09:43,611 --> 02:09:46,113
And I've never seen that before.

1299
02:09:46,153 --> 02:09:47,254
It seems odd to me that

1300
02:09:47,931 --> 02:10:05,460
that would even be allowed by the fire department or, or the city engineer or this board, it just seems like that's a weird thing 88 spots are kind of sacred there, they're there or they're not, and I don't see why that one would be something that's conditional if I'm reading that correctly if I'm not I apologize.

1301
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:10,182
But just the summation if you've all seen the historic commission letters that we think it's.

1302
02:10:12,753 --> 02:10:16,416
doesn't really fit in with the details and the massing and the scale of the neighborhood.

1303
02:10:17,837 --> 02:10:26,785
You know, it could be it could be a three story building and be well detailed and it would fit fine, but this is really almost it's four and a half stories.

1304
02:10:26,805 --> 02:10:28,466
There's no other way to objectively look at it.

1305
02:10:32,129 --> 02:10:32,870
Thank you, Mr. Carr.

1306
02:10:37,110 --> 02:10:43,878
I see David Walker, if you'd like to share and if you could state your name and address for the record.

1307
02:10:45,159 --> 02:10:46,801
Yeah, David Walker 38 Brooklyn Street.

1308
02:10:48,862 --> 02:10:53,024
just wanted to say, you know, I walk and cycle through this area frequently.

1309
02:10:53,124 --> 02:10:59,706
I live sort of on the opposite side of Medford Square and shop at the Meadow Glen Mall frequently.

1310
02:10:59,726 --> 02:11:04,988
And I use the park along the river there frequently.

1311
02:11:05,028 --> 02:11:06,829
So I'm through this area often.

1312
02:11:07,809 --> 02:11:11,590
And I'd also like to note that, you know, we are in the midst of a regional housing crisis.

1313
02:11:12,411 --> 02:11:13,571
And so I really applaud

1314
02:11:14,817 --> 02:11:21,481
the effort to provide so many more units of housing to maybe put some downward pressure on the prices of housing in our region.

1315
02:11:21,501 --> 02:11:28,324
And I'd also like to note that this location is a really great location for some dense multifamily housing.

1316
02:11:28,445 --> 02:11:32,607
It's about a 15-minute walk from Medford Square, about a 10-minute walk over to the Meadow Glen Mall.

1317
02:11:32,627 --> 02:11:34,087
There's a bus line right along there.

1318
02:11:34,728 --> 02:11:37,549
Wellington Station is maybe about a mile away, straight line distance.

1319
02:11:37,569 --> 02:11:38,650
So I think it's really, really great

1320
02:11:40,389 --> 02:11:42,791
I do share some concerns about the parking.

1321
02:11:42,811 --> 02:11:47,616
I think there was a little bit too much parking, and I think it encourages too much auto oriented sprawl.

1322
02:11:48,677 --> 02:11:51,580
So I think you know if we could replace some parking with green space that would be great.

1323
02:11:52,401 --> 02:11:59,908
But I think overall I think it's great that we're going to get a whole bunch of more units of housing here in Medford to put some downward pressure on the prices.

1324
02:12:00,752 --> 02:12:06,576
of housing in our community, and my only regret is that we can't get a few more units and a little bit less parking.

1325
02:12:07,537 --> 02:12:22,887
But I would like to wholeheartedly express support as a member of the community and as a member of the community who travels through the region frequently, that I hope we can move forward with this project and get some more units of housing in our community.

1326
02:12:22,907 --> 02:12:23,608
Thanks a lot.

1327
02:12:27,687 --> 02:12:28,087
Thank you.

1328
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:31,990
I see that Tom has his hand raised again.

1329
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:46,018
I think should we read some of the resident comments that were emailed to us first and then go and see if Tom would still like to provide additional comments and anyone else would like to?

1330
02:12:47,346 --> 02:12:48,246
Yes, that makes sense.

1331
02:12:48,667 --> 02:12:49,347
Thank you, Amanda.

1332
02:12:49,827 --> 02:12:50,067
Great.

1333
02:12:50,248 --> 02:13:02,834
So we received six emailed comments, two of which were already kind of shared virtually now by David Walker and William Navar.

1334
02:13:03,935 --> 02:13:09,037
So I'll start with, there was a comment from Jennifer Keenan, who was at 305 Riverside Avenue.

1335
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:15,944
They say dear sir or madam, I am an owner at 305 Riverside Avenue.

1336
02:13:16,004 --> 02:13:19,908
I'm strongly against the project proposed at 16 Foster Court.

1337
02:13:20,368 --> 02:13:29,057
It is far too large, the entire southwest side of our building will lose its natural sunlight, our abilities to have container gardens on our balconies will disappear.

1338
02:13:29,718 --> 02:13:38,541
In addition, the loss of the green space between our building and Foster Court will greatly diminish our tranquility, both during the construction phase and after it's built.

1339
02:13:39,242 --> 02:13:44,944
16 addition cars in a parking lot on Foster Court at the expense of our trees and yard is a travesty.

1340
02:13:45,484 --> 02:13:50,106
I urge you to force the developer to significantly reduce the number of units in this project.

1341
02:13:52,947 --> 02:13:56,468
Next, there was a comment from Dave McKenna.

1342
02:13:57,802 --> 02:14:05,029
do your community board community development board members, I am writing to support the approval of new development at 16 foster court.

1343
02:14:05,450 --> 02:14:19,725
I live nearby and walk and bike past Foster Street, almost on a daily basis, adding new housing to this area will be a great addition to our community, it will grow Bedford's tax base and help us pay for road and sidewalk improvements that are desperately needed in this area.

1344
02:14:20,365 --> 02:14:30,608
This housing is near a major bus route to shopping centers downtown Medford in the orange line so it will not increase traffic significantly and will support the revitalization of our local businesses.

1345
02:14:31,228 --> 02:14:42,512
Being so close to transit businesses schools and the riverfront bike path means this will help us lower the carbon footprint as a community dense walkable development is essential to improve our local and global environment.

1346
02:14:42,972 --> 02:14:48,396
Furthermore, the cost of housing has doubled in Medford in the past 10 years while the population has remained stagnant.

1347
02:14:48,816 --> 02:14:51,217
The average home price in Medford this year is more than 700,000.

1348
02:14:51,678 --> 02:14:56,601
New housing units will ease the upward pressure on rents and sales prices.

1349
02:14:57,281 --> 02:15:06,187
I know there will be opposition because there always is and I wonder if one way to address is to get an agreement from the developer to contribute funds to repay Riverside Ave.

1350
02:15:06,627 --> 02:15:12,751
Riverside from the Andrews to the Felsway is one of the worst roads in Medford due to the potholes and crumbling sidewalks.

1351
02:15:13,171 --> 02:15:16,994
Yet the development on Locust Street around the corner did a beautiful job fixing up the street.

1352
02:15:17,514 --> 02:15:21,797
Fixing up this area might help show our community the benefits of your new development.

1353
02:15:22,077 --> 02:15:22,858
Thank you for your time.

1354
02:15:25,337 --> 02:15:32,659
And one more, two more, sorry, two more comments to read.

1355
02:15:33,719 --> 02:15:38,300
Judy McLaughlin of Thomas Street, Medford.

1356
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:49,302
To whom it may concern, I'm writing to express my trepidation regarding the proposed development at 16 Foster Court, which is scheduled for discussion at tonight's meeting.

1357
02:15:49,662 --> 02:15:59,831
To place a luxury apartment complex smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood not only serves only to create an eyesore, it decreases the integrity of the neighborhood in a variety of ways.

1358
02:16:00,812 --> 02:16:07,317
The Foster Court neighborhood is already congested with existing traffic and the additional units will only exacerbate the parking challenges.

1359
02:16:07,878 --> 02:16:15,984
The proposed building's architectural design isn't congruent with the neighborhood, which is primarily filled with single family homes and its height would obscure the skyline in view.

1360
02:16:16,825 --> 02:16:34,523
The eight units will likely rent for $3,000 per month making them hardly affordable to say nothing of the proverbial slap in the face to residents of the low income housing adjacent to the proposed structure viable green space space would be destroyed by the paving the lot surrounding the building.

1361
02:16:35,444 --> 02:16:43,934
residents in neighboring homes will lose valuable shade affordable afforded by existing trees and likely end up paying higher energy bills.

1362
02:16:44,454 --> 02:16:49,019
Please consider these factors and their impact on Foster Court neighborhood and the Medford community.

1363
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:55,967
We need affordable housing and discussions around equity in our community, not more gentrification by virtue of luxury housing.

1364
02:16:57,605 --> 02:17:03,990
And then one last comment from Joyce Davis of 305 Riverside Ave.

1365
02:17:04,951 --> 02:17:17,262
Hello, I'm a unit owner at Riverside Condominium, who is opposed to the construction of the five-story structure, which would create a paved driveway and parking lot, which could raise potential drainage issues that would impact our property.

1366
02:17:20,433 --> 02:17:24,237
Okay, and I see there are two hands raised.

1367
02:17:24,717 --> 02:17:30,642
I'm going to move first to David button if you could state your name and address for the record.

1368
02:17:30,662 --> 02:17:34,166
Hi, thank you for having me.

1369
02:17:34,726 --> 02:17:42,353
I, my name is David button, I live it, but I don't live there but I own a two family property at 263 Riverside out.

1370
02:17:43,634 --> 02:17:46,657
And I strongly support this project.

1371
02:17:48,567 --> 02:17:52,569
The value of property has increased so much and it's good for me.

1372
02:17:53,510 --> 02:17:58,553
And the rents have gone up so high that people are getting pushed out.

1373
02:17:58,633 --> 02:18:05,137
So the whole community of Medford, people who want to live there, families that live there are getting pushed out.

1374
02:18:05,697 --> 02:18:15,123
I have a tenant that I am charging 2350 for a three bedroom apartment, way below market value.

1375
02:18:16,465 --> 02:18:19,606
And the only reason I do that is because they're a family.

1376
02:18:20,167 --> 02:18:27,489
And they have a son who is entering his junior year and would like to graduate with the rest of his class.

1377
02:18:27,570 --> 02:18:28,970
They're a part of the community.

1378
02:18:29,450 --> 02:18:34,712
And I know based on their finances, if I raise their rent, they're going to have to leave Medford.

1379
02:18:35,013 --> 02:18:36,113
She's told me that.

1380
02:18:37,059 --> 02:18:42,322
So there's a major housing problem, and we need more inventory of housing.

1381
02:18:43,342 --> 02:18:46,744
So I strongly support it for that reason.

1382
02:18:47,524 --> 02:18:48,885
The other is the driveway.

1383
02:18:49,605 --> 02:18:54,828
You know I have seven spots at my unit for a two bedroom and a three bedroom.

1384
02:18:55,408 --> 02:18:58,830
For the past 10 years, I have seven spots available.

1385
02:18:59,575 --> 02:19:03,736
past 10 years, never more than two spots ever been used.

1386
02:19:04,037 --> 02:19:10,899
People use the bus, they use the commuter rail, the transit on Riverside Ave is amazing.

1387
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:16,041
The other reason is the neighborhood that it's in.

1388
02:19:16,721 --> 02:19:18,262
Has anybody driven through it?

1389
02:19:18,722 --> 02:19:19,242
Because

1390
02:19:20,584 --> 02:19:25,106
I'm not going to disparage it, but it's really, it needs some investment.

1391
02:19:25,146 --> 02:19:26,166
It needs improvement.

1392
02:19:26,586 --> 02:19:30,288
There is not a lick that isn't paved as you drive through.

1393
02:19:30,308 --> 02:19:36,410
You know, the driveways, the front of the house, I mean, it looks like one giant parking lot.

1394
02:19:37,590 --> 02:19:41,592
And to have low income housing,

1395
02:19:42,747 --> 02:19:53,733
nearby is a benefit, because when you build something nice in the whole neighborhood, it'll be like a seed that will encourage more investment in the neighborhood.

1396
02:19:55,110 --> 02:20:16,403
Yeah, it's okay for people of moderate means to move in, because the only way to uplift people who are in housing, you know, the housing projects, is to show and become part of the community who has something, they can, it raises all boats.

1397
02:20:17,952 --> 02:20:24,197
And it's just gonna increase property values, you know, everywhere in that neighborhood, which is depressed.

1398
02:20:24,537 --> 02:20:28,180
If you go in Zillow, those numbers are not accurate.

1399
02:20:30,722 --> 02:20:31,643
And that's pretty much it.

1400
02:20:31,683 --> 02:20:36,386
I mean, you can go on with, it increases tax base.

1401
02:20:36,967 --> 02:20:39,429
There's taller buildings all over the place.

1402
02:20:39,469 --> 02:20:43,332
There's not a, you know, some neighborhoods have,

1403
02:20:44,955 --> 02:20:47,395
all these beautiful farmhouse and colonials.

1404
02:20:48,136 --> 02:20:55,837
You drive into that neighborhood and there's like a single family, then there's a colonial, then there's a tall building.

1405
02:20:56,537 --> 02:21:04,658
There isn't any continuity to what the neighborhood has for, you know, a community.

1406
02:21:04,718 --> 02:21:06,099
It's all over the place.

1407
02:21:06,459 --> 02:21:08,059
And that's basically it.

1408
02:21:09,219 --> 02:21:12,160
You know, I strongly support the project and those are my reasons.

1409
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:12,960
Thank you.

1410
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:14,100
Thank you for my time.

1411
02:21:15,658 --> 02:21:16,438
Thank you, Mr button.

1412
02:21:18,259 --> 02:21:18,899
And we have.

1413
02:21:19,919 --> 02:21:23,000
Oh, Tom, your hand is raised, would you like to provide.

1414
02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:23,660
Yes.

1415
02:21:25,161 --> 02:21:25,921
Yes.

1416
02:21:26,021 --> 02:21:26,481
Thank you.

1417
02:21:26,501 --> 02:21:30,943
I don't, I haven't heard that this is going to be low income housing.

1418
02:21:32,823 --> 02:21:39,285
But that's not what I really because I'm focused on this point on the drainage.

1419
02:21:42,675 --> 02:21:45,858
Right now in the back, we have a natural environment, a lot of green space.

1420
02:21:46,438 --> 02:21:47,559
Drainage is not a problem.

1421
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:53,965
We have below ground units in our building.

1422
02:21:54,525 --> 02:22:09,358
And the drawings, as I understand them, are going to drain the water off to the southeast into a catch basin that is placed right adjacent to our property.

1423
02:22:11,044 --> 02:22:23,935
uh, with a system that quite frankly, I don't understand, uh, with the water going into the catch basin and therefore somehow draining through it back in under the parking lot.

1424
02:22:24,756 --> 02:22:31,902
Um, I just don't understand how that is going to be effective, uh, in

1425
02:22:32,981 --> 02:23:02,061
uh, preventing the possibility with, uh, uh, we are now in, um, with global warming and the increased amount of rain as we had this summer, possibly a rising water table, um, concerns that, um, in the future, um, this setup, uh, with what I consider to be, um, be paved over backyard, uh, required by the fact that we're going to have a five story building, um,

1426
02:23:03,897 --> 02:23:22,609
it's going to just needlessly be environmentally unsound, take out, replace what is now almost 80% green space with down to 20% landscape space, and a lot of that being on the north side of the proposed building.

1427
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:29,473
But again, I would like to have some explanation, for example,

1428
02:23:30,101 --> 02:23:36,125
It's not clear now whether this building is going to be condominiums or whether it's going to be an apartment building.

1429
02:23:37,726 --> 02:23:48,894
And in either case, I would like to know who is going to be responsible for maintaining and cleaning out that catch basin so that we don't have an overflow and a flooding problem.

1430
02:23:49,314 --> 02:23:51,096
I understand how condominiums work.

1431
02:23:51,396 --> 02:23:58,601
I'm on the board at my condominium and to allocate the money and whatever to do and maintain that.

1432
02:24:00,052 --> 02:24:04,194
can be problematic, but again, just raising some questions.

1433
02:24:05,214 --> 02:24:07,255
We'd like to hear some answers to some of these issues.

1434
02:24:07,615 --> 02:24:12,316
We'd like to hear them addressed very much.

1435
02:24:15,317 --> 02:24:15,737
Thank you.

1436
02:24:16,698 --> 02:24:22,020
Could the proponent talk a little bit more about the drainage on the site and the infrastructure?

1437
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:24,560
Yeah, Adam, want to take a shot at that?

1438
02:24:24,580 --> 02:24:25,861
Then we can pass it over to Guillermo.

1439
02:24:26,727 --> 02:24:29,629
Yeah, Guillermo, we are going to pass this on to you in a second.

1440
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:31,191
I'm not a civil engineer.

1441
02:24:31,211 --> 02:24:40,238
I can say that what they do is taper grades and regrade as necessary to direct water to keep it on the site.

1442
02:24:40,538 --> 02:24:45,382
And their job is to make sure there is no stormwater runoff onto abutting properties.

1443
02:24:46,362 --> 02:24:48,564
We've got as much landscape buffer as we can.

1444
02:24:48,584 --> 02:24:53,708
And in addition to that, you're using all hard surfaces of permeable paver.

1445
02:24:54,615 --> 02:24:59,899
Um, water absorbs through that, um, absorbs through the landscaping.

1446
02:25:00,679 --> 02:25:06,844
The site will be, uh, sloped and tapered and graded to direct the water away from the abutters.

1447
02:25:07,884 --> 02:25:11,907
Um, Guillermo, if you can speak a little bit more about the design.

1448
02:25:11,927 --> 02:25:14,729
Hello.

1449
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:15,690
Can you hear me?

1450
02:25:16,611 --> 02:25:17,111
Yes, we can.

1451
02:25:17,911 --> 02:25:18,332
Hi, everyone.

1452
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:21,314
My name is Guillermo and I'm representing Spruh and Engineering.

1453
02:25:22,670 --> 02:25:31,476
Yeah, regarding drainage, we are proposing to capture the whole roof and the parking space into a two feet deep rush system.

1454
02:25:33,897 --> 02:25:50,248
We have provided a stormwater report with calculations that prove that we have our overall reduction in runoff post construction for different rain events, including the 100 year storm, which is like a very rare event.

1455
02:25:51,425 --> 02:26:02,107
So also as Adam mentioned before, no asphalt is being proposed on the site, which will help to mitigate the runoff from the site.

1456
02:26:04,307 --> 02:26:17,350
Also regarding the catch basin, the results of the calculations show that the peak elevation at the catch basin on a hundred year storm is one foot below

1457
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:20,561
rim of the catch basin.

1458
02:26:20,801 --> 02:26:34,112
This means that the infiltration system is capable to handle the 100-year storm without overflowing or without any runoff being, will cause a problem to the neighbors.

1459
02:26:36,254 --> 02:26:38,115
So basically that's it.

1460
02:26:38,916 --> 02:26:40,117
If you have any more questions.

1461
02:26:41,675 --> 02:26:55,185
Mr. Beltran, could you just talk about the pavers and whether they need to be maintained or cleaned on a regular basis to maintain that filtration?

1462
02:26:57,166 --> 02:26:58,727
Yeah, yeah.

1463
02:26:58,747 --> 02:27:01,929
Pavers require maintenance, of course.

1464
02:27:03,170 --> 02:27:09,975
Actually, DPW has requested an operation and maintenance plans on their comments, and we're planning to present

1465
02:27:11,565 --> 02:27:17,169
the maintenance plan for the permeable pavers and for the catch basin, as Tom asked.

1466
02:27:18,491 --> 02:27:23,895
So that will be represented in the operation and maintenance plan, and that has to be approved by DPW.

1467
02:27:23,955 --> 02:27:35,304
And that should be included, I think, in any, you know, if this becomes a condo and any condo association documents as well.

1468
02:27:36,105 --> 02:27:36,565
Correct, yeah.

1469
02:27:41,161 --> 02:27:41,461
Thank you.

1470
02:27:41,501 --> 02:27:46,484
Let me, uh, open it up to board members for any questions and comments.

1471
02:27:47,865 --> 02:27:48,105
Andre.

1472
02:27:48,125 --> 02:27:48,885
This is Jackie.

1473
02:27:48,945 --> 02:27:49,866
I just wanted to go back.

1474
02:27:49,906 --> 02:27:52,307
There was a trend in statement amongst the, um.

1475
02:27:53,268 --> 02:27:57,390
The public actually that I actually want to clarify and we touched base on a little bit.

1476
02:27:57,710 --> 02:28:04,094
One of the things that I've I'm a fan of this that I know well is that parking minimum shape of neighborhood and

1477
02:28:09,065 --> 02:28:10,245
reference and things like that.

1478
02:28:10,425 --> 02:28:11,305
And Ms.

1479
02:28:11,345 --> 02:28:26,408
Kathleen Desmond in a pre-application meeting that we held earlier in the year, on behalf of the proponent, she demonstrated an intent for the proponent to actually try to swap out some spaces for green space in a seeking that variance.

1480
02:28:26,428 --> 02:28:35,990
And if she can actually go into detail or if the proponent can go into detail to sort of answer those concerns by the public again here, I think that would be beneficial.

1481
02:28:37,559 --> 02:28:37,899
Sure.

1482
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:55,693
So in terms of the parking spaces, at that preliminary meeting, as you know, we had an additional curb cut on the left side of the property and had proposed two additional spaces that we would put in so that there would be 12 spaces rather than 10.

1483
02:28:55,733 --> 02:29:03,939
At the board's urging, we took those two spaces out, did not include a curb cut.

1484
02:29:04,439 --> 02:29:05,580
That is now green space.

1485
02:29:05,927 --> 02:29:10,871
and actually it contributes to the open space area that we have and went to 10 spaces.

1486
02:29:11,572 --> 02:29:31,849
It's always a difficult dance between the CD board and the zoning board in terms of parking and what is allowed, but the city engineer and the traffic engineer for the city in his report said that the numbers that our traffic consultant, Steven Seguso came up with were justified by surrounding use.

1487
02:29:33,241 --> 02:29:35,562
That's what we've done is to reduce it to 10 spaces.

1488
02:29:35,762 --> 02:29:40,384
That way each unit has a space and the larger units have two spaces available to them.

1489
02:29:41,805 --> 02:29:46,347
So that was the analysis that we went through from the preliminary to this public hearing.

1490
02:29:47,427 --> 02:29:48,548
I hope that answers your question.

1491
02:29:50,228 --> 02:29:51,869
I hope it answers the question for the public.

1492
02:29:51,909 --> 02:29:53,310
I was just having you rephrase.

1493
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:54,170
Thank you so much.

1494
02:29:55,070 --> 02:30:00,513
Right, and the other thing to bring up, Jackie, just to remind everybody is that

1495
02:30:01,644 --> 02:30:12,249
You know, I think we were all a little disappointed that the fire lane requirement is so significant, which really constrains what can be done on the site.

1496
02:30:12,969 --> 02:30:15,230
And I think, what is the fire lane?

1497
02:30:15,270 --> 02:30:16,011
Is it a 24 feet?

1498
02:30:16,091 --> 02:30:19,452
Right, which is kind of, imagine having a 24 foot wide driveway.

1499
02:30:27,369 --> 02:30:28,229
very, very large.

1500
02:30:28,469 --> 02:30:38,773
And if that wasn't the case, which is requested by the fire department, there'd be a lot more room for landscaping and moving things around.

1501
02:30:38,873 --> 02:30:40,374
So that's a real challenge.

1502
02:30:40,434 --> 02:30:51,798
The other thing that I just want to remind everyone here today and members of the public is that this board is only a board that can provide recommendations to the ZBA.

1503
02:30:52,338 --> 02:31:01,245
The ZBA, the Zoning Board of Appeals is ultimately the board that is going to issue the permit for the project or not, including the variances.

1504
02:31:01,325 --> 02:31:05,528
So just so that everyone is clear on that.

1505
02:31:06,809 --> 02:31:17,938
One thing that I would say, given the comments that have come up today from the public around the buffering the back area from the apartment building at 305,

1506
02:31:19,658 --> 02:31:24,664
the condo building at 305 Riverside, you know, there's some mature trees back there.

1507
02:31:24,724 --> 02:31:35,317
I'm wondering if there's, you know, what did you look at in terms of being able to accommodate, you know, retain one or both of those trees back there?

1508
02:31:35,597 --> 02:31:38,040
I can't tell how many there are, but I think there's at least a couple.

1509
02:31:38,922 --> 02:31:44,763
Yeah, I had an arborist go out and scope the lot, identify trees that could be saved.

1510
02:31:44,843 --> 02:31:50,164
And I think we're saving most of the trees in the back portion of the lot.

1511
02:31:50,184 --> 02:31:52,605
So those will remain those mature trees.

1512
02:31:53,385 --> 02:31:54,805
Oh, that's great, okay.

1513
02:31:54,985 --> 02:31:56,265
I thought they were coming down, so.

1514
02:31:56,805 --> 02:32:05,527
No, so on the landscape plan, there are three existing trees that are marked existing and those are remaining, they're tall trees.

1515
02:32:06,607 --> 02:32:07,569
Okay, great.

1516
02:32:07,689 --> 02:32:10,315
Could actually someone put that up on the screen just so we could see it?

1517
02:32:17,201 --> 02:32:29,230
While you're doing this, I actually because can you clarify because I feel like I heard conflicting concerns from some of the members of the public from the building that's directly behind there.

1518
02:32:29,891 --> 02:32:34,574
And one of some of the concerns was we were going to lose the trees in our shape screening.

1519
02:32:35,175 --> 02:32:39,438
And the other was that we were going to have too much shade from the new building.

1520
02:32:39,458 --> 02:32:41,640
And we won't be able to grow things on those

1521
02:32:42,533 --> 02:32:44,114
on the balconies.

1522
02:32:44,574 --> 02:32:53,578
So if the trees are staying, then they'll have the screening, but it means they'll have shade, which is what I would assume they currently have.

1523
02:32:53,778 --> 02:32:54,859
Do we know this?

1524
02:32:56,159 --> 02:33:05,383
I was there yesterday trying to take photographs of that property from the back of Foster Court, and there's no clear view because of their own mature trees.

1525
02:33:05,463 --> 02:33:07,584
That side of their building is completely in shade.

1526
02:33:08,585 --> 02:33:10,866
And the mature trees that we have, we're keeping.

1527
02:33:12,058 --> 02:33:16,241
their shade to sunlight ratio is not going to be affected by this project.

1528
02:33:18,822 --> 02:33:20,043
Thank you for the clarification.

1529
02:33:20,083 --> 02:33:22,425
Our building is 75 feet away from the property line.

1530
02:33:25,427 --> 02:33:32,511
Just maybe some misunderstanding about the trees that are there are certainly taller than what's going to be built.

1531
02:33:32,531 --> 02:33:33,972
They're very large trees.

1532
02:33:35,813 --> 02:33:36,174
Thank you.

1533
02:33:36,214 --> 02:33:41,057
I just wanted to clarify that because I feel like we got some mixed messages there.

1534
02:33:44,429 --> 02:33:51,933
So I'm just, I can't really see here on the screen, but if it could, I don't know, Adam, if this is your screen, could you just point out the trees that are going to remain?

1535
02:33:51,993 --> 02:33:52,113
Yep.

1536
02:33:52,633 --> 02:33:56,215
So these, these three are the existing trees to remain.

1537
02:33:58,556 --> 02:33:59,377
One, two, three.

1538
02:34:00,297 --> 02:34:00,597
Okay.

1539
02:34:00,657 --> 02:34:02,798
Now the one in the corner, that's a new tree.

1540
02:34:02,998 --> 02:34:06,740
So is there something, is there a tree in that corner that's coming down?

1541
02:34:10,448 --> 02:34:17,410
All of the trees that are in the back abutting the property that are healthy are remaining.

1542
02:34:17,890 --> 02:34:18,050
Yeah.

1543
02:34:18,931 --> 02:34:25,093
The arborist tagged the trees that were preferably left to remain and we left all those.

1544
02:34:25,113 --> 02:34:28,834
Okay.

1545
02:34:28,894 --> 02:34:30,114
I can comment on that.

1546
02:34:32,415 --> 02:34:33,215
Excuse me, sir.

1547
02:34:33,255 --> 02:34:34,215
Just hold on one moment.

1548
02:34:34,235 --> 02:34:35,096
I agree too.

1549
02:34:39,623 --> 02:34:50,192
And then the 305, Adam, I think you were saying that they also have trees on their property, is that correct?

1550
02:34:50,232 --> 02:34:51,514
Could you point out where those would be?

1551
02:34:52,815 --> 02:34:55,217
I can actually share a photo.

1552
02:34:57,099 --> 02:34:59,581
Well, just a minute.

1553
02:35:11,318 --> 02:35:11,698
Let's see.

1554
02:35:37,306 --> 02:35:40,207
Adam, I think unless it's a PDF, you're going to have trouble

1555
02:35:40,815 --> 02:35:41,075
sharing.

1556
02:35:41,095 --> 02:35:47,217
Yeah, I mean, this is gonna take me a while to set that up, but I can tell you I was there.

1557
02:35:47,237 --> 02:35:55,579
I tried to take a photo to show the view towards that building from Ari's site, and you can't really see the building because of mature trees on their side of the fence.

1558
02:35:56,340 --> 02:36:01,241
Adam, if you pull up Google Maps, you can see the trees that are in between the property.

1559
02:36:02,681 --> 02:36:07,943
There's a handful of trees on the backside of Foster that are remaining in there, a handful of trees.

1560
02:36:09,483 --> 02:36:13,706
This canopy are the trees on Ari's lot.

1561
02:36:15,308 --> 02:36:18,951
We're not seeing any screen sharing right now, so I don't know if you were.

1562
02:36:18,971 --> 02:36:19,691
All right.

1563
02:36:22,654 --> 02:36:25,156
This would be something that's better experienced in person, to tell you the truth.

1564
02:36:31,041 --> 02:36:32,802
Yeah, I can't make this happen right now.

1565
02:36:33,503 --> 02:36:34,264
Okay, that's fine.

1566
02:36:38,408 --> 02:36:40,369
Sir, I know Tom wanted to say something.

1567
02:36:43,611 --> 02:36:45,412
So I don't know, Amanda, if you could unmute him.

1568
02:36:45,432 --> 02:36:49,835
Am I okay?

1569
02:36:50,416 --> 02:36:51,957
Yes, we can hear you now.

1570
02:36:51,977 --> 02:36:53,038
Okay, thank you.

1571
02:36:57,100 --> 02:37:04,766
I believe that all the trees in that area, none of them are on our property, 305.

1572
02:37:08,667 --> 02:37:17,635
Some of the trees, I agree that there is no problem with a shadow from the building impacting the 305 property.

1573
02:37:18,035 --> 02:37:20,998
I mean, that's certainly the case and I don't understand that either.

1574
02:37:22,739 --> 02:37:28,364
Some of the trees have red bands around them and some don't.

1575
02:37:29,185 --> 02:37:35,851
And I don't know which is which in terms of whether the red band means it's gonna come down or the red band means this is the one that's gonna stay.

1576
02:37:37,636 --> 02:37:40,977
But I'd like to raise another question.

1577
02:37:41,017 --> 02:37:43,558
I'd like to hear about rodent control.

1578
02:37:44,059 --> 02:37:48,021
This house has been there, I understand, since around 1870.

1579
02:37:49,561 --> 02:38:03,228
And I would like to hear what kind of measures are going to be taken to prevent rodents in the neighborhood.

1580
02:38:06,028 --> 02:38:06,528
Thank you, sir.

1581
02:38:06,608 --> 02:38:08,510
Could one of the proponents respond to that?

1582
02:38:13,533 --> 02:38:16,815
We'll work with a professional to make sure that the rodents are addressed.

1583
02:38:16,875 --> 02:38:20,858
I'm not a rodent expert, but we can put bait traps out there or deal with

1584
02:38:22,028 --> 02:38:24,749
take their advice and address the rodent situation.

1585
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:32,753
I think that maybe one of the reasons why there's rodents right now is because you've got overgrown grass and large open space in the back.

1586
02:38:33,434 --> 02:38:39,797
And you're gonna have more formally manicured grounds, which will provide less cover for rodents.

1587
02:38:39,877 --> 02:38:46,160
But in addition to that, we can work with a professional to address rodent concerns.

1588
02:38:47,101 --> 02:38:50,982
And that's commonly a condition.

1589
02:38:51,063 --> 02:39:00,966
One moment, I'll just say that the Department of Public Health routinely requires that roading control is a condition for significant construction projects.

1590
02:39:01,086 --> 02:39:04,908
And so if that's not in DPH's letter, we will make that a condition.

1591
02:39:06,308 --> 02:39:07,689
Director Hunt.

1592
02:39:07,749 --> 02:39:09,249
Right, it is in the letter.

1593
02:39:09,329 --> 02:39:16,172
The Department of Public Health requires pre-demolition and pre-construction integrated pest management plans.

1594
02:39:16,899 --> 02:39:21,321
and they are a mandated requirement by the city's rodent control ordinance.

1595
02:39:22,681 --> 02:39:29,823
These must be submitted 14 days before the start of the project and require monthly reports from a licensed pest control company.

1596
02:39:31,104 --> 02:39:35,485
Increased frequency and product use may be required based on findings and inspection.

1597
02:39:35,906 --> 02:39:42,948
So the board of health is very aware of this issue and will be monitoring it as they do for every construction project now, currently.

1598
02:39:44,137 --> 02:39:44,777
Thank you, Director Hunt.

1599
02:39:45,078 --> 02:39:47,399
Attorney Desmond, you wanted to say something?

1600
02:39:47,839 --> 02:39:55,523
I was going to just mention that it's in the department head's comments that there has to be a rodent plan in place for the Department of Health once construction starts.

1601
02:39:55,883 --> 02:39:56,984
So it was taken care of.

1602
02:39:58,385 --> 02:40:03,648
Can anyone just, one of the proponents, just speak to whether the red bands mean the trees are staying or going?

1603
02:40:04,008 --> 02:40:04,848
That was the other question.

1604
02:40:05,729 --> 02:40:11,072
I can't remember on the colors, but the trees that are noted in the plan are the ones that are staying.

1605
02:40:11,092 --> 02:40:13,753
I believe the tag trees are to remain.

1606
02:40:15,192 --> 02:40:18,935
Okay, and all the trees in the back are, I believe, remaining.

1607
02:40:20,536 --> 02:40:26,140
And if you bring it up on Google Maps, there's a significant buffer that those trees provide currently, which will remain.

1608
02:40:29,963 --> 02:40:30,624
Board members.

1609
02:40:30,644 --> 02:40:32,785
Sorry, who was that?

1610
02:40:33,526 --> 02:40:35,888
I actually have that image to share.

1611
02:40:37,309 --> 02:40:39,390
So everyone see the shot of 305?

1612
02:40:42,122 --> 02:40:42,282
Yes.

1613
02:40:42,862 --> 02:40:47,404
All right, so this is facing 305 from the fence.

1614
02:40:47,424 --> 02:40:49,204
It's further away than it looks.

1615
02:40:49,264 --> 02:40:55,867
I was trying to zoom in to get a good shot of this, but these trees that you see here, both of these are not on Ari's property.

1616
02:40:55,887 --> 02:40:57,687
Those will stay.

1617
02:40:58,188 --> 02:40:58,348
Yeah.

1618
02:40:58,408 --> 02:40:58,688
Okay.

1619
02:41:00,208 --> 02:41:01,429
That's helpful.

1620
02:41:04,310 --> 02:41:08,911
Adam, did you want to address, there was a comment by the public around height.

1621
02:41:09,812 --> 02:41:10,872
Do you want to address?

1622
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:28,216
Yeah, I would say what I was trying to say in the beginning of my presentation is that we, and David Button actually kind of hit the nail on the head with, we don't have a cohesive architectural language and expression going on in this neighborhood.

1623
02:41:28,496 --> 02:41:29,837
We're trying to bridge the different

1624
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:34,002
Um, scales the different styles in a sensitive way.

1625
02:41:34,543 --> 02:41:37,124
Our height is far below what the zoning allows.

1626
02:41:38,045 --> 02:41:44,109
Um, I certainly wasn't saying that the existing foster court was was undersized in the time that it was built.

1627
02:41:44,449 --> 02:41:47,891
It's far undersized for the zoning use now for functionality.

1628
02:41:47,912 --> 02:41:50,133
Uh, habitable housing.

1629
02:41:50,833 --> 02:41:55,356
Um, The shadows casts are minimal.

1630
02:41:55,817 --> 02:41:55,917
Um,

1631
02:41:57,003 --> 02:41:58,244
It's not a five-story building.

1632
02:41:58,324 --> 02:42:03,486
It fits the definition of three plus a penthouse.

1633
02:42:04,026 --> 02:42:06,227
You can call it a four, I suppose, with a penthouse.

1634
02:42:09,388 --> 02:42:18,652
But really, we're not much taller than a one or a two family would be with a high cable roof and dormers.

1635
02:42:19,212 --> 02:42:21,773
And with those dormers, you'd be essentially squaring off the building anyway.

1636
02:42:24,043 --> 02:42:25,504
One more note about height.

1637
02:42:26,524 --> 02:42:47,013
If you look in the zoning code, if an apartment two zone abuts a non-apartment two zone, so SF1, SF2, general residence, apartment one, if the building is within 100 feet of that zone, then the height can't be greater than 50 feet, and it can't be higher than four stories.

1638
02:42:47,678 --> 02:43:07,984
So we are under 50 feet, and we are not more than four stories here which I, which I think the reason that was put in is so that a large building in an apartment to doesn't dwarf, you know, a building in a different district and the zoning code outline that 50 feet and four stories is that threshold.

1639
02:43:09,445 --> 02:43:16,287
It's also an eclectic district, because you have many uses that are allowed in that district from single to multi

1640
02:43:17,265 --> 02:43:19,186
to six stories 75 feet.

1641
02:43:20,346 --> 02:43:24,147
And when you look if I could share my screen because I just, I just think it's a little bit helpful.

1642
02:43:27,749 --> 02:43:28,769
Oops.

1643
02:43:29,949 --> 02:43:32,890
The zoning map of the interactive map.

1644
02:43:35,351 --> 02:43:40,373
There aren't that many apartment two districts, and the apartment two districts are.

1645
02:43:41,935 --> 02:43:48,338
are pretty much placed near thoroughfares and also, I'm sorry, too big.

1646
02:43:49,478 --> 02:43:52,880
Also, maybe I need to stay at 26.

1647
02:43:55,581 --> 02:43:58,982
Also, amenities such as parks and whatnot.

1648
02:43:59,082 --> 02:44:09,467
And if you look at the districts, our district is right here, the apartment two district, which is again, close to the Fellsway and the shopping areas and then the park areas.

1649
02:44:09,833 --> 02:44:12,494
There's an apartment two over here on the Malden line.

1650
02:44:13,455 --> 02:44:16,496
And then there's one over here off of the high street.

1651
02:44:16,556 --> 02:44:24,019
So they're very small districts targeted for, I think, density of population, and there aren't that many of them.

1652
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:32,043
And they seem to be located near major routes and thoroughfares and also recreational activities.

1653
02:44:32,903 --> 02:44:38,305
So we think that this project fits what the zoning was intended to be,

1654
02:44:40,333 --> 02:44:46,014
you know, not what has been there because it was there in the 1800s, but what was what they wanted to move towards.

1655
02:44:46,754 --> 02:45:03,097
And, and this apartment, you know, meets the meets the requirements of the, the apartment to zone and it's within what the height requirements would be if in fact you abutted an SF to a general residence or an SF one zone.

1656
02:45:03,978 --> 02:45:05,958
So it's not, it's not maxing out.

1657
02:45:06,657 --> 02:45:15,763
of the size, and it falls within the restriction, if you would, within 100 feet of an SF2 general residence SF1 zone.

1658
02:45:17,925 --> 02:45:18,345
Thank you.

1659
02:45:19,786 --> 02:45:20,326
Mr. Carr?

1660
02:45:22,228 --> 02:45:27,671
Attorney Desmond, you still need significant relief to build this project, right?

1661
02:45:29,673 --> 02:45:29,893
No.

1662
02:45:30,994 --> 02:45:35,957
We have a side yard setback of nine feet that we need to comply with.

1663
02:45:36,490 --> 02:45:38,030
The width is a varying width.

1664
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:43,691
So, we need a relief for a width parking, obviously which we've talked about.

1665
02:45:43,711 --> 02:45:52,493
And, and then the city had requested the CD board that we consider a porch for the front to make it look more residential.

1666
02:45:52,933 --> 02:46:06,315
So putting that covered porch on as opposed to a uncovered porch requires relief, but it's probably a finding because the, the structure as it stands now is, is within the front yard setback

1667
02:46:07,295 --> 02:46:14,940
So it would be an extension of what is non conforming, and that would be the same with with as well with this non conforming currently.

1668
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:17,621
So it would be a possibly a finding on that.

1669
02:46:18,101 --> 02:46:28,227
So I think the only two variances, really that we're looking for is the parking variance, and the left side yard setback which relates to the shape of a lot, it's 200 feet in depth.

1670
02:46:30,392 --> 02:46:39,056
which is 100 over what's required, and that makes for a very long and somewhat narrow lot.

1671
02:46:39,696 --> 02:46:46,299
At the street level, the width is 89 feet, but it varies from place to place because the line jogs.

1672
02:46:46,479 --> 02:46:52,502
So no, in terms of the scope of relief that one could ask for, this isn't asking for a lot of relief.

1673
02:46:56,598 --> 02:47:00,882
The balcony extensions around the building, do any of those fall within the setback?

1674
02:47:01,922 --> 02:47:05,385
No, because they're on the driveway side, which is 24 feet.

1675
02:47:06,146 --> 02:47:07,107
What about the other side?

1676
02:47:07,727 --> 02:47:09,328
There are no balconies on that side.

1677
02:47:09,348 --> 02:47:10,369
I see.

1678
02:47:12,691 --> 02:47:24,761
And this is a question for Chair LaRue is, you said you've had previous meetings, is the board, if you could speak for them generally, is the board generally satisfied with the masking scale of this project?

1679
02:47:26,751 --> 02:47:31,472
Well, they haven't had the chance to speak too much tonight, so we're going to go and find out.

1680
02:47:32,692 --> 02:47:33,193
Thank you, sir.

1681
02:47:34,033 --> 02:47:37,474
Thank you.

1682
02:47:37,914 --> 02:47:45,756
So I think this is a good segue to the board members and what you all think about the project.

1683
02:47:51,377 --> 02:47:55,238
Obviously, we did see this project, and again, I do want to point out,

1684
02:47:57,002 --> 02:48:09,011
appreciate the fact that the proponent came to us and had a meeting ahead of time that was one of our regular public meetings to discuss the project.

1685
02:48:10,032 --> 02:48:11,613
We have a lot of issues with it.

1686
02:48:12,414 --> 02:48:15,696
A lot of those issues were addressed.

1687
02:48:15,937 --> 02:48:19,679
For example, the porch, there was no front entrance to the building.

1688
02:48:21,101 --> 02:48:23,562
That was added, the balconies were added.

1689
02:48:23,582 --> 02:48:32,149
The parking spaces in front were removed and landscaping was added there.

1690
02:48:32,189 --> 02:48:38,654
The permeable pavers were put in throughout the site with no asphalt around.

1691
02:48:40,568 --> 02:48:49,280
The windows, window treatments were were definitely improved I think including at the garden level.

1692
02:48:49,661 --> 02:48:52,725
So those are just some of the things that I that I remember we did point out.

1693
02:48:54,926 --> 02:49:10,599
But as we look to make a recommendation on this project, are there things that we should be looking at or additional conditions that we might want to require or recommend?

1694
02:49:16,303 --> 02:49:17,384
Les, I see you're unmuted.

1695
02:49:17,424 --> 02:49:19,986
I don't know if you want to say something.

1696
02:49:26,434 --> 02:49:32,197
I appreciate all the work that the proponent has put into the project.

1697
02:49:35,038 --> 02:49:43,683
The reason I'm struggling is I'm feeling like my comments, my feelings are mostly subjective.

1698
02:49:45,688 --> 02:50:00,653
Uh, you know, to me, the building feels really tall and narrow and, um, I appreciate that it, uh, you know, it's height is by right, but, um, you know, I live around the corner.

1699
02:50:00,673 --> 02:50:06,914
And sorry about that.

1700
02:50:06,954 --> 02:50:07,915
I'm glad you heard that too.

1701
02:50:08,915 --> 02:50:09,175
Um, um,

1702
02:50:14,369 --> 02:50:27,893
I, you know, it's a hard, it's a hard thing to comment on, you know, I appreciate the work that they did, but the building feels tall and it feels narrow.

1703
02:50:27,913 --> 02:50:33,494
It feels like proportionally, it doesn't feel quite right.

1704
02:50:33,614 --> 02:50:41,857
And I, you know, I would venture to guess that if I really, if Mr. Glassman was being completely honest, he would agree.

1705
02:50:46,003 --> 02:51:01,530
The issue of the driveway is, for me, I think it's ridiculous, and I think it has put an undue design restraint on this project, which I don't totally agree with.

1706
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:08,153
I think a fire truck is, I don't know, 10 feet wide.

1707
02:51:09,114 --> 02:51:10,975
I don't know why we need 24 feet there.

1708
02:51:11,015 --> 02:51:12,695
I think that's unreasonable, and it's

1709
02:51:16,294 --> 02:51:23,299
It has shaped where we are now with this project, which I feel is pretty unfortunate.

1710
02:51:23,619 --> 02:51:32,526
That 24 feet, some of it could be given back to a little bit of landscaping and a little bit of width in the building.

1711
02:51:33,006 --> 02:51:38,591
I think that would go a long way, but that bridge has probably been crossed already.

1712
02:51:41,673 --> 02:51:42,554
You know, it's...

1713
02:51:43,979 --> 02:52:03,549
It feels like, you know, you have a street of a certain proportion and you have a book standing up, you know, it's like a bunch of books on their sides, like behind Andre, and then all of a sudden there's one standing up and it just, it just seems like the scale is, doesn't seem quite right.

1714
02:52:03,889 --> 02:52:12,353
I'm also sort of against the amount of parking, you know, I know you went down, you removed the ones at the front, but I,

1715
02:52:13,072 --> 02:52:17,654
Frankly, I don't know why we need more than one space per unit.

1716
02:52:19,755 --> 02:52:24,578
There's not enough buffering along the property lines.

1717
02:52:27,119 --> 02:52:38,405
I know these comments are kind of all over the place, but I guess my main comment is that it just, it doesn't quite feel right in that spot.

1718
02:52:42,651 --> 02:52:56,068
Well, we could recommend less parking or a smaller driveway, but it'll be up to the ZBA board to really decide whether to listen to us or the fire chief, and I can guess which way that would go.

1719
02:52:56,809 --> 02:53:01,635
Yeah, and I would be surprised that the proponent would want to, you know.

1720
02:53:03,147 --> 02:53:08,409
a narrower driveway would allow for some more landscaping, which I think would help.

1721
02:53:08,489 --> 02:53:23,613
I think that whole, that 24 foot wide width, almost right up against the building and the garden unit windows, like right up against that driveway, that just feels very awkward to me.

1722
02:53:25,374 --> 02:53:28,375
Can I respond since my name was mentioned in that?

1723
02:53:29,445 --> 02:53:31,026
Of course, architect Glassman, please.

1724
02:53:31,546 --> 02:53:33,567
So I'm going to share my screen.

1725
02:53:35,568 --> 02:53:40,250
And I am being honest when I say that the building is not too tall.

1726
02:53:40,751 --> 02:53:42,912
We intentionally broke the massing up.

1727
02:53:42,952 --> 02:53:49,815
So it primarily reads as a three story building, which is certainly consistent with the neighborhood.

1728
02:53:50,395 --> 02:53:55,758
The penthouse is set back far back from the front and the rear elevations.

1729
02:53:55,918 --> 02:53:57,339
It steps in from the side.

1730
02:53:58,159 --> 02:54:08,921
The main volumes, what pops out will be these three-story traditionally clad volumes.

1731
02:54:09,241 --> 02:54:12,722
This is not a monolithic box.

1732
02:54:14,742 --> 02:54:15,922
It is broken up.

1733
02:54:16,342 --> 02:54:17,523
The scale is broken up.

1734
02:54:17,883 --> 02:54:24,264
And the fourth story is set so far back that it will not really be perceived from the street view of Foster Court.

1735
02:54:25,575 --> 02:54:37,123
I also want to say that I don't know if you've all had a chance to meet the fire chief, but we all did on site, and he made clear that this 24-foot width, which none of us want, was non-negotiable.

1736
02:54:38,464 --> 02:54:42,386
He did say we could reduce the width at the far end of the building.

1737
02:54:43,888 --> 02:54:48,170
That's as far as he was willing to go, as far as reducing the 24 feet, but that

1738
02:54:50,140 --> 02:55:01,242
No matter what is built here, what sort of multifamily is built here on this very long, narrow lot, there will be a driveway, a fire lane that extends as far back as the rear of the building.

1739
02:55:01,262 --> 02:55:02,322
It'll be 24 feet.

1740
02:55:07,243 --> 02:55:08,103
Thank you, architect.

1741
02:55:08,183 --> 02:55:17,665
And I think at some point, no, we are open to fewer parking spaces, but again, this is responding to these conflicting kind of rules and regulations of the city.

1742
02:55:19,738 --> 02:55:32,420
I just, I think it's interesting that you are mentioning, you know, you're using this view to mention how the street won't be affected, but from this neighbor.

1743
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:34,321
Well, let's go to another view.

1744
02:55:34,861 --> 02:55:35,121
Yeah.

1745
02:55:35,681 --> 02:55:40,122
Well, but no, my point is from that neighbor's side, it's going to be a big wall.

1746
02:55:40,142 --> 02:55:46,583
You know, I wasn't talking about just how it feels from the street and how it, how it feels from, you know, all four sides.

1747
02:55:49,204 --> 02:56:02,108
And if I could, I think we talked about this originally in the pre-file, but this is a situation where you have houses that predate what the zoning is that came into this, which is an apartment two.

1748
02:56:02,228 --> 02:56:10,790
So it's always kind of difficult to be the first parcel that's within line of what the zoning is for the apartment two district.

1749
02:56:11,370 --> 02:56:16,492
And this is, and there are some other parcels that are larger in this neighborhood

1750
02:56:16,980 --> 02:56:20,042
where you're probably gonna see requests for size.

1751
02:56:21,063 --> 02:56:36,654
So it then becomes a question, you know, policy question to an extent or whatnot is whether are you going to, is this an area of density that you want to increase the size and number of units where it calls for it by the apartment two district?

1752
02:56:37,234 --> 02:56:43,019
Or, you know, are we gonna be left, is it gonna be left to the twos and the single families?

1753
02:56:43,059 --> 02:56:44,900
Which, you know, that's what the general residents

1754
02:56:45,435 --> 02:56:59,172
district really is so you know it's hard to be the first one to make any change in an area where the zoning allows it, but there aren't too many examples of, of what that uses.

1755
02:57:04,933 --> 02:57:08,415
just to reiterate, I appreciate the work you've done.

1756
02:57:08,515 --> 02:57:10,776
I've been in this position before myself.

1757
02:57:10,816 --> 02:57:16,740
So I know that like there are constraints that drive you to certain things.

1758
02:57:16,820 --> 02:57:34,170
And I don't wanna get too much into the weeds of sort of the personality of these buildings, but, and I appreciate Mr. Glassman, what you're saying, but you've also been working on this

1759
02:57:35,557 --> 02:57:43,561
a couple of years and, you know, you have a bit of Stockholm syndrome and we're all sitting here looking at it and saying, you know, it feels a little strange on the site.

1760
02:57:43,621 --> 02:57:46,583
And to your point, Ms.

1761
02:57:46,603 --> 02:58:00,470
Desmond, if you took this building and in this view, and then you did three more down the street with this sort of perpendicular tall orientation, I think that would feel equally as odd if there was another building, you know,

1762
02:58:01,912 --> 02:58:05,295
50 feet down the street that looked exactly the same.

1763
02:58:05,335 --> 02:58:14,342
You'd have these cabinet spaces between them without any landscaping because we have a 24 foot driveway that prohibits any of that.

1764
02:58:15,543 --> 02:58:21,768
It would feel really weird if you just built the same building right next to it on the left or right.

1765
02:58:21,848 --> 02:58:29,554
You'd have dark shadowy spaces that

1766
02:58:30,799 --> 02:58:32,459
would be completely uninviting.

1767
02:58:34,820 --> 02:58:36,641
And I like the idea of density.

1768
02:58:36,721 --> 02:58:41,822
I really appreciated what you said about how this district has been earmarked for this kind of density.

1769
02:58:41,862 --> 02:58:43,883
I think it's a great idea.

1770
02:58:43,903 --> 02:58:46,803
This area doesn't have a lot of character.

1771
02:58:46,843 --> 02:58:49,484
I think this kind of development could help in that.

1772
02:58:52,325 --> 02:58:55,006
But subjectively, I'm feeling like this building doesn't fit.

1773
02:58:57,306 --> 02:59:00,267
Andre, this is Jackie Furtado, and I just want to reiterate

1774
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:02,001
basically what Clayce has been saying.

1775
02:59:02,121 --> 02:59:13,767
I, for one, fully and wholly appreciate what the proponent has tried to do under the restrictions of the area, the rules and regulations and so forth.

1776
02:59:13,967 --> 02:59:20,910
And I was excited during the pre-meeting because hopefully, you know, certain things could be moved around and we could all have a balance.

1777
02:59:20,970 --> 02:59:27,073
But one of the things that I'm conflicted with, and I guess this is subjective too, is it does not fit the scale of the neighborhood.

1778
02:59:27,093 --> 02:59:29,174
And I understand that the proponent wants to sort of

1779
02:59:30,920 --> 02:59:40,463
fill in a gap, but I almost think that it exacerbates just the fact that we're all sort of piecemeal in that area.

1780
02:59:42,064 --> 02:59:58,469
And it's unfortunate, everything that the proponent has tried to do, and one of the greatest things that I appreciate is that that is a lower income area over there with the Medford Public Housing Authority, and the proponent was not shied away and actually

1781
02:59:59,375 --> 03:00:04,657
Um, was able to produce this housing in that area as opposed to run away from it.

1782
03:00:04,717 --> 03:00:10,019
So there's so many great aspects, but when it comes down to it, it's that the restrictions.

1783
03:00:10,119 --> 03:00:11,439
And I agree with Ms.

1784
03:00:11,479 --> 03:00:15,520
Desmond on, you know, um, we need, we're, we're in the process.

1785
03:00:15,540 --> 03:00:20,062
The city is in the process of a zoning recodification for so many reasons to sort of bring things together.

1786
03:00:20,102 --> 03:00:24,163
But as of right now, this building does not fit.

1787
03:00:24,503 --> 03:00:28,945
Um, and I'm so conflicted because I definitely see all the efforts and

1788
03:00:29,690 --> 03:00:41,455
And all the, all of the benefits that this housing such as this can have, but when it comes down to it, um, the board exists for a reason to just to make sure that things conform.

1789
03:00:42,195 --> 03:00:47,478
And I just don't see this building as conforming to this area.

1790
03:00:47,958 --> 03:00:49,439
It conforms to this zoning code.

1791
03:00:49,899 --> 03:00:53,560
It conforms to the zoning code, but we're here in the public's interest.

1792
03:00:57,602 --> 03:00:59,263
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

1793
03:00:59,915 --> 03:01:04,477
And that's why I'm conflicted.

1794
03:01:05,317 --> 03:01:11,279
I guess are there other considerations that the board has that would make it more palatable?

1795
03:01:17,401 --> 03:01:20,862
Mr. Glassman, can you just stop sharing your screen so we can see everyone?

1796
03:01:27,945 --> 03:01:28,285
Thank you.

1797
03:01:29,157 --> 03:01:30,257
May I just make a comment?

1798
03:01:30,437 --> 03:01:33,819
I think it is in the public's interest that we approve more housing.

1799
03:01:35,019 --> 03:01:48,703
I understand there are concerns and confliction with the size and the scale of what exists today, but we are moving forward to establish a new precedent.

1800
03:01:49,464 --> 03:01:56,666
And I think that they have done a tremendous job taking into account all of the comments that we provided

1801
03:01:57,645 --> 03:02:05,687
at the preliminary meeting to try to make it as compatible as possible to what exists there today.

1802
03:02:05,747 --> 03:02:14,909
But we do have to recognize that this is a new path forward for this area.

1803
03:02:16,390 --> 03:02:19,991
So I'm not as conflicted.

1804
03:02:23,292 --> 03:02:25,133
completely in support of this project.

1805
03:02:25,453 --> 03:02:33,616
And I think we just have to think of, we still have to think forward and not so much of only what exists there today.

1806
03:02:35,237 --> 03:02:36,818
Yeah, I would agree with Christy.

1807
03:02:37,098 --> 03:02:42,820
I see Clay's and Jackie's concerns and I see, but I agree as well.

1808
03:02:45,881 --> 03:02:47,042
David, would you like to comment?

1809
03:02:47,718 --> 03:02:48,439
Sure.

1810
03:02:49,180 --> 03:02:51,602
I thought the presentation was pretty compelling.

1811
03:02:51,682 --> 03:02:56,087
I thought the difference between the initial presentation and this one was sort of night and day.

1812
03:02:56,107 --> 03:02:59,751
A couple of additional items that they were sensitive to, the fencing,

1813
03:03:05,237 --> 03:03:05,918
edge of the lot.

1814
03:03:06,178 --> 03:03:16,726
And also, I think the building materials, they really made an attempt to match some of the existing materials, including especially the building that's directly across the street.

1815
03:03:17,427 --> 03:03:20,890
So, I was much less troubled by what I see today.

1816
03:03:20,930 --> 03:03:25,013
I mean, certainly, it's larger than what is on that street currently.

1817
03:03:25,833 --> 03:03:27,575
It's just hard, you know, I try to think about

1818
03:03:28,872 --> 03:03:35,153
about, you know, we have to come up with specific findings not to recommend something like this.

1819
03:03:35,533 --> 03:03:38,374
And you just, I know there are concerns.

1820
03:03:38,414 --> 03:03:39,614
We've talked about parking.

1821
03:03:39,654 --> 03:03:40,834
We've talked about drainage.

1822
03:03:43,715 --> 03:03:48,596
We've talked about that fire lane and how we don't like that to be a much different situation.

1823
03:03:49,896 --> 03:03:58,498
But I do feel like other than making some recommendations attached to an approval, I feel like we should approve the project.

1824
03:04:01,542 --> 03:04:11,910
I just want to make one more comment because I am generally for this project and I think they've done a good job.

1825
03:04:12,691 --> 03:04:17,915
I have aesthetic concerns that the building doesn't seem to fit.

1826
03:04:18,075 --> 03:04:26,742
But I think, I hope you're not characterizing my comments as not being in sort of support of this kind of,

1827
03:04:28,012 --> 03:04:31,894
density or height or any of that, because that's not what it is.

1828
03:04:32,255 --> 03:04:55,389
I'm making a comment about the sort of scale and appropriateness of the design in this context, which I started by saying was very subjective, but I think it's harming you in your petition to get this building built.

1829
03:04:58,022 --> 03:05:06,889
And I guess I would just urge the proponent and the architect to just think about how this building looks.

1830
03:05:08,750 --> 03:05:16,235
And if there's something that they can do to try to make it fit a little bit better in its context.

1831
03:05:18,897 --> 03:05:26,043
And to me, that doesn't mean making it smaller or less dense or reducing the number of units.

1832
03:05:27,669 --> 03:05:32,412
or even the height, you know, because I think to Ms.

1833
03:05:32,432 --> 03:05:37,074
Desmond's point, the density here could be a good thing.

1834
03:05:40,796 --> 03:05:41,156
Jackie.

1835
03:05:42,397 --> 03:05:48,741
I just wanted to reiterate that I've been for this project since I first heard it, but I'm one person, right?

1836
03:05:49,241 --> 03:05:52,623
And for our recommendation, we have to take into the public's interest.

1837
03:05:52,683 --> 03:05:53,763
And that's what I was speaking on.

1838
03:05:53,823 --> 03:05:54,344
And when I met,

1839
03:05:55,357 --> 03:05:59,858
referring to clays in pretty much in how the height does not fit.

1840
03:06:00,198 --> 03:06:10,001
And I was trying to sort of get you to look at it in a different light to better fit the area so that we can add on these, so that we can have a better recommendation.

1841
03:06:10,201 --> 03:06:15,342
It's just that I didn't want to loosely recommend it in a state that it's in with the concerns that surround it.

1842
03:06:17,002 --> 03:06:23,604
But other than that, I think I've pretty much, I hope I've pretty much communicated my support for the project.

1843
03:06:25,715 --> 03:06:28,596
Yeah, I mean, there's obviously.

1844
03:06:30,517 --> 03:06:51,507
So, you know, I think that there's trade-offs, but there's also, you know, what we as a board, sort of the parameters of our job here, you know, it would be, I'm ambivalent myself in terms of the design, you know, especially about the garden level units and would that, you know, could we bring that down a little bit more?

1845
03:06:51,967 --> 03:06:53,568
But at the same time, I'm not,

1846
03:06:53,928 --> 03:07:02,430
Personally, my opinion is I'm not going to tell a developer to get rid of two units when those are two families that could be living in Medford.

1847
03:07:03,550 --> 03:07:08,611
I don't think that the aesthetic consideration probably outweighs the housing need.

1848
03:07:09,332 --> 03:07:14,213
I would love to see one of these units be affordable, but again, that's not something we have control over.

1849
03:07:17,089 --> 03:07:27,799
So given all of that, the one thing that I would say in terms of conditions, I think you addressed everything that I saw in our first meeting.

1850
03:07:28,200 --> 03:07:34,866
The one thing I did notice was that the sidewalk that you're putting in, I didn't understand whether,

1851
03:07:36,718 --> 03:07:44,962
It's our policy as a community development board to make sure that the pedestrian level of the sidewalk remains the same across the curb cut.

1852
03:07:45,142 --> 03:07:56,187
So I would just want to be really clear that that's happening, that people are not stepping off and down into the driveway and then back up again.

1853
03:07:56,207 --> 03:08:00,209
So we have some work to do with the engineering department in that regard.

1854
03:08:00,249 --> 03:08:02,930
And we did have an initial meeting with engineering on that.

1855
03:08:03,762 --> 03:08:04,923
This is a private way.

1856
03:08:05,443 --> 03:08:12,228
So in looking at Tim McGibbon's comments, he indicated that he would prefer that the sidewalk be in the way.

1857
03:08:12,828 --> 03:08:21,994
But when we had our land surveyor go back and look at where the sidewalk is at the affordable housing units, it actually runs across their property line.

1858
03:08:22,595 --> 03:08:26,478
So we have some work to do in that respect with the engineering department.

1859
03:08:26,918 --> 03:08:31,621
And I know his comments indicated that he wanted that to be resolved prior to the special permit.

1860
03:08:32,620 --> 03:08:53,451
So it would involve, you know, doing the sidewalk to the specifications that the engineering department wants us to, but also if it's on our property there's going to need to be a right of way agreement, allowing public access to that, that kind of needs to be nailed down the street as best we can tell is 28 feet across at that point so we could probably jog it into the public way.

1861
03:08:53,852 --> 03:08:56,113
It's just a question of what the engineering department wants to do.

1862
03:08:57,296 --> 03:09:11,279
Okay, so we would, I think, just have a condition stating that the proponent would work that out to the satisfaction of the city's traffic director and engineering department.

1863
03:09:15,420 --> 03:09:15,520
Okay.

1864
03:09:15,821 --> 03:09:24,603
Along those lines, Andre, the engineering letter has a long list of plan provisions that they'd like to see.

1865
03:09:26,551 --> 03:09:33,553
In the terms of conditions, we need to have the written responses to that, at least before the ZBA.

1866
03:09:33,593 --> 03:09:34,914
We're not issuing a permit.

1867
03:09:34,974 --> 03:09:43,737
If we were issuing a permit, I wouldn't be comfortable with the board moving forward without having those responses in writing here.

1868
03:09:44,197 --> 03:09:47,018
Because this board is making a recommendation to the ZBA,

1869
03:09:47,543 --> 03:09:58,727
I just want to sort of go on the record advising the proponent that the ZBA is going to need all of that either done, resolved in writing for their meeting.

1870
03:09:59,507 --> 03:10:10,050
And then we would appreciate being copied on that because we'll hold that for when we do occupancy permit reviews to ensure that you're complied with everything they've asked for.

1871
03:10:10,070 --> 03:10:11,571
And that's fine.

1872
03:10:11,711 --> 03:10:15,052
You've resolved it to their satisfaction.

1873
03:10:15,975 --> 03:10:25,099
We're now working on the hydrant and doing the scoping that was requested, whether that will be done by the ZBA hearing, but we'll agree to put it in writing and deal with that issue.

1874
03:10:26,179 --> 03:10:32,062
And is there anything else that were in the department head letters that we need to discuss?

1875
03:10:35,003 --> 03:10:38,405
Or can you meet all the conditions?

1876
03:10:39,185 --> 03:10:42,246
We're willing to meet all the conditions of the department head letters.

1877
03:10:44,848 --> 03:10:52,371
The one that was a little just I want everybody to be clear on because it's important to this board that hold the pervious pavements.

1878
03:10:52,451 --> 03:10:54,252
The pavers was a big deal.

1879
03:10:54,512 --> 03:10:55,713
We really care about that.

1880
03:10:56,313 --> 03:11:01,515
And the city engineer is pointing out that they have to be properly maintained to remain pervious.

1881
03:11:02,035 --> 03:11:11,660
And so for there to be a operations maintenance plan, and if there are to be condo documents that that should be

1882
03:11:13,772 --> 03:11:17,815
solidified in there that they have to maintain this as pervious pavement.

1883
03:11:18,696 --> 03:11:20,958
They can't just ignore that in the future.

1884
03:11:21,459 --> 03:11:23,240
Right, that would be one of our conditions as well.

1885
03:11:24,501 --> 03:11:33,589
Okay, I know, Tom, member of the public, you, sorry, I don't know your last name, it's not part of your thing there, but you have one more comment?

1886
03:11:36,712 --> 03:11:39,334
Thank you, my last name is Sowers, S-O-U-E-R-S.

1887
03:11:41,206 --> 03:11:45,289
I was going to comment in response to Ms.

1888
03:11:45,309 --> 03:12:00,258
Desmond about the relief that needs to be sought because my reading is that the usable open space is also requiring a variance.

1889
03:12:01,559 --> 03:12:02,980
You're correct.

1890
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:03,600
I left that out.

1891
03:12:03,660 --> 03:12:04,200
I apologize.

1892
03:12:04,300 --> 03:12:07,282
Usable open spaces is one of the requirements.

1893
03:12:08,243 --> 03:12:08,523
Thank you.

1894
03:12:14,097 --> 03:12:18,059
Board members, other final comments or thoughts?

1895
03:12:20,201 --> 03:12:27,045
I sense that there's seem to be general support, so we may be close to a motion.

1896
03:12:27,665 --> 03:12:31,127
I think a couple of the conditions that we heard is,

1897
03:12:32,200 --> 03:12:48,715
One, the sidewalk needs to be maintained at pedestrian level and worked out with the city's engineering department that the, what was the other one that we just,

1898
03:12:53,661 --> 03:13:05,167
The maintenance plan for the impervious pavers needs to be incorporated into any condo association documents or management plan.

1899
03:13:06,408 --> 03:13:10,030
Those are the two conditions that I heard.

1900
03:13:10,050 --> 03:13:12,932
I don't know if we want to add extra language.

1901
03:13:14,135 --> 03:13:22,266
You know, those mature trees at the lot line that have been indicated will be maintained, will be actually be, you know, preserved.

1902
03:13:25,751 --> 03:13:26,993
And Amanda, did you have something?

1903
03:13:27,577 --> 03:13:56,756
Yeah, I don't know if this wants to be a condition or if it's understood, but just to reiterate that, that the concerns resolved, or sorry, the concerns raised in the engineering letters would be resolved or responded to in writing ahead of the ZBA meeting and that those, whatever is submitted there, like whatever written resolutions or responses would also be submitted to our office planning, development and sustainability.

1904
03:13:58,222 --> 03:13:58,602
Thank you.

1905
03:13:59,703 --> 03:14:07,105
All right, any final conditions or thoughts?

1906
03:14:08,165 --> 03:14:22,530
Andre, David, should we include recommendations to reduce the fire lane, to reduce the number of parking spaces to one per unit?

1907
03:14:25,100 --> 03:14:31,042
Didn't sound like there was general optimism that anything could be done about any of those things, but just to get a record our view.

1908
03:14:32,243 --> 03:14:49,350
Right, I would certainly be fine, I think, going on record at least saying that, so that there is a record of that and we can maybe at some point have a conversation with the fire department about how we design projects.

1909
03:14:51,982 --> 03:14:55,284
Would other board members be amenable to that as well?

1910
03:14:55,304 --> 03:15:01,869
Okay.

1911
03:15:01,889 --> 03:15:02,429
Director Hunt?

1912
03:15:02,550 --> 03:15:09,335
I think that I was just sort of thinking about some framing because we're making recommendations to the DBA rather than

1913
03:15:10,005 --> 03:15:11,606
that we would recommend fewer parking spots.

1914
03:15:12,026 --> 03:15:17,228
Conditioning a permit that if we were to say that we would recommend fewer parking spots and that we would.

1915
03:15:17,709 --> 03:15:22,831
It is the opinion of this board that the driveway does not need to be so wide.

1916
03:15:23,632 --> 03:15:23,792
Um.

1917
03:15:24,752 --> 03:15:28,574
You know, we could even say, um, but will defer to the fire chief's

1918
03:15:36,511 --> 03:15:50,535
If there were to be changes in the future that would allow where if perhaps the fire department were to change its perspective on this before construction that there'd be space for that.

1919
03:15:51,815 --> 03:15:53,536
Yeah, that was my thinking as well.

1920
03:15:53,616 --> 03:15:54,436
And I think that we can

1921
03:15:56,813 --> 03:16:21,389
you know, final language, we can workshop a bit, but I was thinking something along the lines of, you know, we understand that the fire chief's letter strongly, you know, I mean, requires the 24 foot width, but, you know, it's our opinion that projects like this don't need,

1922
03:16:23,252 --> 03:16:33,542
such a large fire lane, and should that change, we welcome more landscaping and permeability.

1923
03:16:34,563 --> 03:16:40,448
I don't know, we can work on the language a little bit, but I think that that's the thought.

1924
03:16:44,031 --> 03:16:47,775
Is there a motion on the floor?

1925
03:16:49,010 --> 03:16:58,173
to recommend approval of the project with the following recommendations that we've discussed.

1926
03:17:00,934 --> 03:17:05,556
So we've included all of the department head letters, right, including traffic and engineering?

1927
03:17:06,436 --> 03:17:06,656
Yes.

1928
03:17:14,039 --> 03:17:15,579
Would you like to make the motion, Deanna?

1929
03:17:16,360 --> 03:17:17,400
Sure, I'll make the motion.

1930
03:17:18,603 --> 03:17:19,684
Thanks, is there a second?

1931
03:17:21,665 --> 03:17:22,686
Andres, David, all second.

1932
03:17:24,788 --> 03:17:25,569
A roll call vote.

1933
03:17:26,890 --> 03:17:27,570
Deanna Peabody.

1934
03:17:28,531 --> 03:17:28,671
Aye.

1935
03:17:29,932 --> 03:17:30,512
Christy Dowd.

1936
03:17:31,253 --> 03:17:31,393
Aye.

1937
03:17:32,534 --> 03:17:33,235
David Blumberg.

1938
03:17:33,815 --> 03:17:33,915
Aye.

1939
03:17:34,816 --> 03:17:35,617
Jackie Furtado.

1940
03:17:36,537 --> 03:17:36,657
Aye.

1941
03:17:37,938 --> 03:17:38,719
Les Andresen.

1942
03:17:39,620 --> 03:17:39,720
Aye.

1943
03:17:41,696 --> 03:17:42,477
I'm an eye as well.

1944
03:17:44,238 --> 03:17:48,200
Thank you very much to the proponent for the work that you put in.

1945
03:17:48,281 --> 03:17:54,465
And we again, appreciate you meeting with us beforehand to work out, you know, to surface a lot of these issues that you addressed today.

1946
03:17:55,165 --> 03:17:55,465
Thank you.

1947
03:17:55,505 --> 03:17:57,847
And it was very helpful that first meeting to all of us.

1948
03:17:57,907 --> 03:17:59,708
And we greatly appreciated it as we do.

1949
03:18:00,729 --> 03:18:01,009
Thank you.

1950
03:18:01,830 --> 03:18:02,050
Good night.

1951
03:18:02,070 --> 03:18:02,550
Best of luck.

1952
03:18:03,751 --> 03:18:05,812
Have a good night.

1953
03:18:06,493 --> 03:18:06,773
You too.

1954
03:18:10,807 --> 03:18:18,850
All right, next item on the agenda is our much delayed rules and regulations.

1955
03:18:20,450 --> 03:18:34,055
It is another late evening tonight, so I'm wondering whether we should postpone this once more, and maybe we can explore with the CD board staff, you know, whether we should find a,

1956
03:18:35,657 --> 03:18:42,845
you know, look at the meetings, get agendas going forward and seeing if there's a meeting that is going to be light where we can really address this appropriately.

1957
03:18:46,575 --> 03:18:51,538
David, I know you've put more work into this than anybody, so would you be all right with that?

1958
03:18:52,058 --> 03:18:55,600
Yeah, I just wanted to add, Andre, that we have talked about it a couple of times.

1959
03:18:56,060 --> 03:19:06,587
So if folks were to read through them and offer comments to me in advance or something like that, or maybe there aren't any comments, that's totally fine.

1960
03:19:06,627 --> 03:19:07,727
It might not take that much.

1961
03:19:08,308 --> 03:19:12,150
I just, like you, I feel like I'm out of gas by the time I go through a couple of projects.

1962
03:19:12,930 --> 03:19:17,432
So I'd be happy to offer a motion to table this.

1963
03:19:17,492 --> 03:19:18,192
Is that the right verb?

1964
03:19:18,493 --> 03:19:20,794
To table this to a future meeting?

1965
03:19:25,095 --> 03:19:25,556
Second on that.

1966
03:19:25,576 --> 03:19:29,958
I don't know if we need a formal motion, but... Okay.

1967
03:19:30,838 --> 03:19:31,818
I'll definitely second that.

1968
03:19:37,261 --> 03:19:39,442
Well, I guess let's do the roll call since we started that.

1969
03:19:40,462 --> 03:19:41,082
Deanna Peabody?

1970
03:19:41,903 --> 03:19:42,003
Aye.

1971
03:19:43,090 --> 03:19:43,791
Leslie Andresen.

1972
03:19:44,391 --> 03:19:44,731
Hi.

1973
03:19:45,432 --> 03:19:46,212
Jackie Furtado.

1974
03:19:46,773 --> 03:19:47,053
Hi.

1975
03:19:47,713 --> 03:19:48,434
David Blumberg.

1976
03:19:48,694 --> 03:19:48,914
Hi.

1977
03:19:49,715 --> 03:19:50,235
Christy Babb.

1978
03:19:51,096 --> 03:19:51,316
Hi.

1979
03:19:52,077 --> 03:19:52,817
I'm an aye as well.

1980
03:19:52,997 --> 03:19:53,338
Thank you.

1981
03:19:53,678 --> 03:19:56,420
And again, Amanda, maybe we can find a time.

1982
03:19:56,920 --> 03:20:03,365
If it looks like our meetings are pretty packed, maybe we can find like a meeting where we can just have this on the agenda and it can be pretty quick.

1983
03:20:05,386 --> 03:20:05,647
All right.

1984
03:20:06,107 --> 03:20:06,767
Absolutely.

1985
03:20:09,149 --> 03:20:12,732
Alicia, did you have something you wanted to jump in on there or did that take care of it?

1986
03:20:13,784 --> 03:20:19,870
I was actually gonna, it sort of merges right into the miscellaneous and other updates.

1987
03:20:21,512 --> 03:20:32,723
And that is sort of this idea that the city or the city council is hoping to vote their zoning out of committee next week.

1988
03:20:33,224 --> 03:20:37,468
And then it'll go to the city council for them to refer to this board.

1989
03:20:39,013 --> 03:20:42,655
So I honestly expect, well, let's put it this way.

1990
03:20:43,376 --> 03:20:55,983
The city council president is hoping that that will move forward quickly and that he'll be referring it to this board by the first week of October, which means we then have 65 days to open the hearing.

1991
03:20:56,003 --> 03:20:58,565
It will need to be duly noticed and advertised.

1992
03:20:59,527 --> 03:21:13,975
I have actually reached out to KP Law to provide some assistance to this board, because I feel that as you review things, you'll want to say like, are we allowed to do that in zoning?

1993
03:21:14,615 --> 03:21:28,583
I'm not questioning anything the city council's putting forward, but rather you may want to make changes or suggestions, and it doesn't make sense for us to suggest anything that a zoning lawyer would say is not allowed.

1994
03:21:29,423 --> 03:21:34,308
So I have reached out to them and they are prepared to provide some assistance to this board.

1995
03:21:36,390 --> 03:21:51,683
The other thing is that in order to have hearings as they come up for development and to go through the zoning, we may need to consider meeting twice a month in order to have one for development projects and one for zoning.

1996
03:21:53,254 --> 03:22:00,439
I'm certain you guys feel like I do and that we couldn't start dealing with zoning after hearing two development projects.

1997
03:22:01,180 --> 03:22:03,001
It's too overwhelming.

1998
03:22:04,182 --> 03:22:14,449
So I just wanted to put that out there because that's kind of, and to sort of think about it, look at our calendars, how are we going to make that work?

1999
03:22:14,770 --> 03:22:21,775
There are a lot of other public meetings that members of this board want to attend and that Amanda and I need to be at.

2000
03:22:24,317 --> 03:22:35,494
And do we know, by the way, is attorney Bobrovsky going to present the recommendations of the city council to us or who will actually do that presentation?

2001
03:22:35,514 --> 03:22:38,959
I do not believe that that is in his scope.

2002
03:22:40,248 --> 03:22:46,851
Um, he's being paid to help the city council, and I'm not clear about that.

2003
03:22:46,931 --> 03:22:50,632
So I think that's something that we need to work out with the administration.

2004
03:22:52,013 --> 03:22:58,875
What could we ask KP law to help with doing increase attorney to grow ski scope to do that.

2005
03:22:59,836 --> 03:23:03,237
Did I do I and our staff presented to this board.

2006
03:23:05,038 --> 03:23:06,659
I just, I don't want to be misleading.

2007
03:23:06,739 --> 03:23:12,223
There are certain things in there that we're wildly in favor of, but this is not our project.

2008
03:23:12,243 --> 03:23:14,105
This is the council's project.

2009
03:23:14,985 --> 03:23:26,454
That's why I'm wondering, it would be kind of difficult for us to hold public hearings if we can't actually ask anybody what the intent was or why they solved problems in a certain way.

2010
03:23:26,474 --> 03:23:28,155
Yeah.

2011
03:23:28,856 --> 03:23:29,116
Okay.

2012
03:23:29,936 --> 03:23:43,440
And actually, with that phrasing, that sort of perspective on it, that may help us sort of have that conversation and see what would make sense.

2013
03:23:44,021 --> 03:23:50,323
And it may be that we have a meeting or two, and we compile some questions.

2014
03:23:51,043 --> 03:23:56,945
And then there's some follow-up, either in writing or we meet with Attorney Bobrowsky.

2015
03:23:58,189 --> 03:24:06,291
I mean, I can't imagine that this board could dispose of that in less than multiple meetings, and I hesitate to say how many, but it's

2016
03:24:09,571 --> 03:24:11,512
He is providing us with two copies.

2017
03:24:11,772 --> 03:24:15,374
One is completely clean, so you can see what the zoning would look like.

2018
03:24:15,894 --> 03:24:28,742
And one is extremely redlined, so it shows you old text crossed out, new text highlighted inserted, and then sort of text that just remained from one version to the next.

2019
03:24:30,283 --> 03:24:35,006
That document with all those pieces in it is 144 pages.

2020
03:24:40,699 --> 03:24:52,026
Well, let me know if you need any assistance in talking to the city council or the administration about this to figure out the way forward.

2021
03:24:52,906 --> 03:24:59,030
And so I will tell you all that that meeting they are planning to hold is next Wednesday, the 29th.

2022
03:24:59,170 --> 03:25:02,212
It's not publicly posted anywhere.

2023
03:25:02,392 --> 03:25:03,813
It's not formally announced.

2024
03:25:04,253 --> 03:25:07,375
I've actually only been told that verbally by the council president.

2025
03:25:08,495 --> 03:25:14,482
But if any of you do wanna hear or see that last meeting, it'll be next Wednesday.

2026
03:25:14,502 --> 03:25:16,904
I don't have a time even for it yet.

2027
03:25:16,924 --> 03:25:19,607
I assume six, but I don't know.

2028
03:25:19,627 --> 03:25:21,669
All right, thank you.

2029
03:25:21,689 --> 03:25:23,010
That's all helpful information.

2030
03:25:23,311 --> 03:25:25,893
Anything else on miscellaneous before we close the meeting?

2031
03:25:25,913 --> 03:25:29,657
I just wanna let you know about the comprehensive plan.

2032
03:25:30,657 --> 03:25:31,738
meeting coming up.

2033
03:25:32,358 --> 03:25:45,624
Obviously Jackie was invited to the steering committee meeting, but we do have now scheduled a steering committee meeting and that is Wednesday the 6th of October.

2034
03:25:46,544 --> 03:25:50,586
And then the public meeting is planned for Wednesday, October 20th.

2035
03:25:52,006 --> 03:25:53,967
I would encourage you all to come to the public meeting.

2036
03:25:55,788 --> 03:26:00,050
I also wanted to let you know we've been doing a redesign for Carr Park with

2037
03:26:00,767 --> 03:26:02,549
That's a major thing.

2038
03:26:02,969 --> 03:26:10,035
We'll be presenting the schematics for that on Saturday at the Mystic River celebration.

2039
03:26:10,075 --> 03:26:11,456
We'll be there from noon to four.

2040
03:26:11,897 --> 03:26:14,179
We'll also have the comp plan consultants there.

2041
03:26:14,239 --> 03:26:17,762
If anybody wants to talk to them one-on-one, they'll be there.

2042
03:26:18,694 --> 03:26:34,205
Um, and I, um, and then also the car park from 4 to 7 next Wednesday, the 29th, the consultant will be at car park to show the schematics and to talk to people about it.

2043
03:26:34,625 --> 03:26:36,846
And there will be additional tabling after that.

2044
03:26:37,467 --> 03:26:42,310
Um, I think Amanda, we should try and put together an email with all of these dates for them.

2045
03:26:42,330 --> 03:26:43,771
That's what I was going to say.

2046
03:26:43,791 --> 03:26:44,512
That would be helpful.

2047
03:26:45,356 --> 03:26:52,211
Yeah, there was one other thing that I was gonna... Sorry, as I was thinking... Oh, the...

2048
03:26:58,282 --> 03:26:59,143
Sorry, it's late.

2049
03:26:59,383 --> 03:27:01,444
The Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

2050
03:27:02,364 --> 03:27:05,726
I'm actually expecting to release the draft.

2051
03:27:05,746 --> 03:27:10,069
So we're gonna be releasing a draft plan for public comment for a few months.

2052
03:27:10,749 --> 03:27:14,311
The executive summary draft, I hope to have out by Monday.

2053
03:27:15,612 --> 03:27:21,916
And then we'll follow that pretty shortly with the whole plan and the strategies and actions.

2054
03:27:22,564 --> 03:27:24,886
And then we'll have that available.

2055
03:27:25,526 --> 03:27:31,311
And Saturday, October 16th is the Harvester Energy Festival, which our office runs.

2056
03:27:32,012 --> 03:27:34,974
But we will have the comprehensive plan consultants there.

2057
03:27:34,994 --> 03:27:37,976
I think the car park consultants will be there.

2058
03:27:38,357 --> 03:27:40,418
The climate plan consultants will be there.

2059
03:27:40,839 --> 03:27:43,121
So it's actually a planning fest.

2060
03:27:43,701 --> 03:27:44,682
If you want to like

2061
03:27:45,950 --> 03:27:53,076
you know, color any of those and have a little one-on-one October 16th from noon to three in Riverbend Park.

2062
03:27:53,256 --> 03:27:55,017
Plus, you know, like 30 other exhibitors.

2063
03:27:55,037 --> 03:27:56,879
Okay.

2064
03:27:56,899 --> 03:27:57,459
Well, thank you.

2065
03:27:57,719 --> 03:28:02,443
And yeah, Amanda, if you could circulate those dates in an email to us, that would be really helpful.

2066
03:28:03,264 --> 03:28:03,804
Absolutely.

2067
03:28:03,824 --> 03:28:06,426
And I just have, there was one last thing.

2068
03:28:07,747 --> 03:28:13,552
So, and I think Alicia could speak more specifically to what this project entails, but

2069
03:28:14,753 --> 03:28:27,893
Our office has been working with a group of MIT students I think on a feasibility study relating to affordable housing, and they've requested that we set up a meeting with the CD board.

2070
03:28:29,535 --> 03:28:39,802
to kind of review their mid-semester conditions and findings.

2071
03:28:40,622 --> 03:28:49,227
They envisioned having something maybe 45 to 60 minutes of presentation and then opening up to questions from both the board and the public.

2072
03:28:49,808 --> 03:28:52,730
And they envisioned this being maybe early November.

2073
03:28:52,850 --> 03:28:57,793
So I just kind of wanted to put that on the board's radar and we can schedule

2074
03:28:58,640 --> 03:29:00,081
we get more information, but.

2075
03:29:01,801 --> 03:29:04,282
Thank you, David.

2076
03:29:05,123 --> 03:29:07,844
7th member terms updates.

2077
03:29:09,784 --> 03:29:12,285
We discussed that with the mayor's office last week.

2078
03:29:12,486 --> 03:29:14,746
There was confusion.

2079
03:29:14,926 --> 03:29:17,267
They keep I'm hoping to get that.

2080
03:29:18,128 --> 03:29:19,368
Resolved shortly.

2081
03:29:27,755 --> 03:29:28,415
see what happens.

2082
03:29:29,436 --> 03:29:34,920
I have one quick addition.

2083
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:40,884
We have an open urban, our city planner position as well.

2084
03:29:41,165 --> 03:29:47,069
So if you know of anyone that's qualified and that you'd love to work with, please send them our way.

2085
03:29:47,089 --> 03:29:51,292
It's a competitive market right now and I think we're having trouble getting interest.

2086
03:29:51,312 --> 03:29:55,155
Is this a new additional position?

2087
03:29:56,007 --> 03:30:02,470
to be clear, this is actually Annie's position, and it would be staffing this board and managing the land use stuff.

2088
03:30:02,911 --> 03:30:10,815
Amanda's passion is to work with us actually on other projects that we've been doing, other open space and more climate and stuff related thing.

2089
03:30:10,835 --> 03:30:12,516
And she has been

2090
03:30:13,013 --> 03:30:26,099
kindly providing amazing organization and staffing to this board, but she has actually stated that she would prefer that we hire for that position and she would continue with the other role she had been filling with the city.

2091
03:30:26,859 --> 03:30:28,600
Okay, just wanted to clarify that.

2092
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:31,161
Help find us a land use planner.

2093
03:30:31,341 --> 03:30:32,842
It is a tough market.

2094
03:30:33,022 --> 03:30:37,744
Every community in Massachusetts seems to be hiring for planners right now.

2095
03:30:38,498 --> 03:30:41,699
both Alicia and Andre, you're on the mass planners listserv, right?

2096
03:30:41,719 --> 03:30:49,142
I was going to say, I think there's a conflict of me because we're also hiring at the state within for us, um, for the opera money and things like that.

2097
03:30:49,542 --> 03:30:58,585
I think it would be perfect for you to add your hat there because people really are in the mass planners, um, listserv people really are picking up on that.

2098
03:30:58,605 --> 03:31:01,526
And I know it's competitive, but we've gotten a ton of hits.

2099
03:31:01,626 --> 03:31:04,707
I just don't know if it's, it just seems, um,

2100
03:31:05,518 --> 03:31:18,486
difficult, it just seems like it's a conflict if I try to- I think I sent something there yesterday, but I gotta tell you, I'm like tossing things out so fast that I could be wrong.

2101
03:31:18,506 --> 03:31:19,586
Okay.

2102
03:31:19,926 --> 03:31:25,350
Vic posted on MassAPA yesterday on their job board.

2103
03:31:25,370 --> 03:31:30,513
So are you seeing on the job, you're seeing the Mass Planners email list.

2104
03:31:31,114 --> 03:31:33,836
Yeah, I thought I emailed it yesterday.

2105
03:31:33,876 --> 03:31:47,967
But if Victor already had, and just to let you all know, in my planning world, I will be, my term starts on January 1st, 2022, but I was elected as treasurer for the Mass APA.

2106
03:31:48,948 --> 03:31:54,252
And I think I can sort of solicit things from there, but I'm not sure.

2107
03:31:54,352 --> 03:31:58,134
I'm just, conflict of interest has me by the chokehold.

2108
03:31:58,175 --> 03:31:59,836
But if Victor has already taken care of that,

2109
03:32:00,615 --> 03:32:09,998
And I also know the president who was just elected and I believe she works with Christie, but yeah.

2110
03:32:11,838 --> 03:32:14,339
So- We'll make sure it gets posted there.

2111
03:32:17,280 --> 03:32:19,101
Anyone wanna make a motion?

2112
03:32:22,602 --> 03:32:26,243
To end, I'll make the motion to end our meeting tonight.

2113
03:32:27,736 --> 03:32:28,996
Sorry about being so subtle there.

2114
03:32:29,416 --> 03:32:30,217
Thank you, Jackie.

2115
03:32:30,417 --> 03:32:30,837
Thank you, David.

2116
03:32:30,857 --> 03:32:31,897
I'll second the motion to adjourn.

2117
03:32:33,758 --> 03:32:34,758
All right, roll call vote.

2118
03:32:34,818 --> 03:32:35,478
Deanna Peabody.

2119
03:32:35,498 --> 03:32:36,458
Aye.

2120
03:32:37,499 --> 03:32:38,279
Glesson Dreyson.

2121
03:32:38,299 --> 03:32:42,200
Aye.

2122
03:32:43,320 --> 03:32:44,100
Jackie Furtado.

2123
03:32:44,781 --> 03:32:44,901
Aye.

2124
03:32:45,581 --> 03:32:46,301
David Blumberg.

2125
03:32:46,661 --> 03:32:46,761
Aye.

2126
03:32:47,641 --> 03:32:48,262
Christy Dowd.

2127
03:32:49,422 --> 03:32:49,522
Aye.

2128
03:32:50,474 --> 03:32:51,215
I'm an eye as well.

2129
03:32:51,695 --> 03:32:52,876
All right, meeting adjourned.

2130
03:32:53,076 --> 03:32:57,299
Thank you everyone for your help, Amanda, Alicia, the whole team.

2131
03:32:58,080 --> 03:32:58,720
Really appreciate it.
