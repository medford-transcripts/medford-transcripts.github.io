[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's everybody.

14
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:33,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Used to having more people in the room.

15
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:38,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can get started.

16
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:39,615
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have quorum.

17
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:42,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, can you read the first case?

18
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:48,183
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 Pleasant Street, case number A-2024-23.

19
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:49,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Applicant and owner, Phil Messina.

20
00:00:51,883 --> 00:01:00,427
[SPEAKER_04]: To rebuild the house at three pleasant street with front porch within the front yard setback, which is not allowed for the city zoning chapter, 94 table be able to mention requirements.

21
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior structure was also was also within the front yard setback.

22
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a representative for 3 pleasant street?

23
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:12,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, there I'm still missing 1 of the owners.

24
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:16,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Phil, if you could just give me a name and address for the record and.

25
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, the Medford address, the house that's being rebuilt or where I'm living now?

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,200
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford address is fine.

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my name is Phil Messina, 5 Pleasant Street, Medford, Mass.

28
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:32,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

29
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have anything to share?

30
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have anything that you want Dennis to share for you?

31
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:41,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everything was in the submission.

32
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:50,783
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what we're doing, as I think you guys saw from the materials, the house burned down in February and we're in the process of rebuilding.

33
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:54,046
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly in the same footprint.

34
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:55,928
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the front porch

35
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:10,740
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make it slightly wider, if you look at the plan, extend it towards Riverside, but we're also making it a little bit more narrow, like it's moving a little bit further away from the street.

36
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that while we're making it wider, that's not the side that we're extending into isn't the side with the setback issue.

37
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:20,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually making the setback a little less.

38
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:31,776
[SPEAKER_08]: For those folks that have joined the meeting that have not received the documents, I can have either Dennis if you want to share or I can share and which content you want us to show, Phil.

39
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:34,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, uh, you know what?

40
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:46,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have what I submitted in front of me, but it was, I think there's a site plan that, uh, has an inset that shows the proposed building versus the, uh, versus the yep.

41
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe it's there.

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to, I think it's the third page of that maybe.

43
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:56,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yep.

44
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,567
[SPEAKER_01]: The, Oh, maybe it's the second page.

45
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:04,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, that's two.

46
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:04,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so good.

47
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:15,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to go to page three, over there, that inset box in the left shows the existing versus proposed building footprints.

48
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:38,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and the one item that we're addressing as part of the request is for the front yard setback because of the porch.

49
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:40,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, yeah.

50
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:46,099
[SPEAKER_01]: The only change that we're making, everything else the building will be within the existing or the pre-existing footprint.

51
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:53,761
[SPEAKER_01]: But that front porch, we want to extend it a little bit further out towards Riverside Ave than it is currently.

52
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:57,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look, the shaded line is the existing porch.

53
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:03,814
[SPEAKER_01]: and the dark line, the solid black line is the proposed porch.

54
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:19,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually pushing it back, I think it's six or seven inches from the Pleasant Street property line, which is the I believe the nonconforming one.

55
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,951
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're hoping to extend out to it's basically there's a window.

56
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:36,782
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're standing on the stairs looking to the right, there's a little bit of space and then a window and we just want to extend that front porch a little bit further to the right, basically where that dot is where it says proposed expanded porch.

57
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:48,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

58
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:51,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody from the board have any questions?

59
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:58,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking at the Google map.

60
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,131
[SPEAKER_06]: It says three and five.

61
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I looking at the proper address?

62
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:04,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

63
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's there are two condo.

64
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,175
[SPEAKER_01]: There were there were two condo units.

65
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:11,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a two family that was converted to condominiums in, I think, 2011.

66
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at five, which is the upstairs unit and three Pleasant Street is downstairs.

67
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:18,564
[SPEAKER_01]: So the building is three dash five.

68
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:22,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So

69
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,456
[SPEAKER_06]: the extension we're talking about is on the first floor.

70
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:28,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

71
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:37,141
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that the front porch where the front stairs go in, there's a small porch and then the doors into the units are inside that porch.

72
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:45,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping to basically, so if you're looking at the Google Maps or the Google Earth photo, I think is the old house, the blue house.

73
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:50,168
[SPEAKER_01]: We're basically looking to extend that porch basically out to where that window is on the right.

74
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the extension is, it says three.

75
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct?

76
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I looked at the door.

77
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:06,012
[SPEAKER_06]: So to the right, it says three.

78
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:14,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, if you, I'm facing from the, if I look from the door of the house, the left side is three, the right side is five.

79
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:21,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And the extension is on the three side because there's no porch right next to the three.

80
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:27,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure what hold on, let me try to let me pull up that Google that Google Earth photo.

81
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:31,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So originally, that porch was a shared porch.

82
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:34,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that front door was for both three and five.

83
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:41,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you went into that porch, there were then two unit doors, one that went to unit three, and one that went to the stairs that went up to unit five.

84
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:43,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that's it.

85
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:43,498
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

86
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:44,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, yep.

87
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:51,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me see three pleasant street just so that I can look at the okay.

88
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:51,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

89
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I see what you're looking at from the street view.

90
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:56,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

91
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:57,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So yep.

92
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:02,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so three and five on those columns, that door in the middle led to a shared porch.

93
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And then inside that white door, there were two doors from that porch leading into the house.

94
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

95
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:15,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, and that porch kind of extended off to the left where you see in the driveway and then went further back.

96
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:17,307
[SPEAKER_01]: So it went up the driveway.

97
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:19,949
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be a shared porch.

98
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:24,752
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing with the new place is the front part will be exclusive use for Unit 3.

99
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:31,276
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a door in that driveway that also goes into the porch.

100
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:35,078
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be exclusive use for Unit 5, and we're basically going to wall them off.

101
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of us having a shared entry, we'll each have our own entry.

102
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:52,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing that, we were hoping because that space right next to that column where it says three, basically from where the porch is over to that window, is just kind of wasted space at this point.

103
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:57,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping to just widen that porch, extend it out basically to where that window is.

104
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:58,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.

105
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

106
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:04,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that way when he opens up the door, there's not a wall just to your right, you'll have a little bit of space.

107
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:07,079
[SPEAKER_01]: You can walk a couple steps, maybe put a coat rack or something like that.

108
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:14,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's extending from where the number three is towards the window.

109
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:15,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

110
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:16,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

111
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:20,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And it stops at that window, right?

112
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:20,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

113
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:21,872
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't go the full length of the house.

114
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:25,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically just goes to that window and kind of makes use of that empty space there.

115
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:28,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

116
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:28,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

117
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:29,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mary.

119
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:35,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from the board?

120
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to clarify, it's going to be enclosed, right?

121
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:43,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like it is now?

122
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

123
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:45,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

124
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,613
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be an enclosed porch.

125
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:51,074
[SPEAKER_01]: The door will be, you know, pretty much where it is there.

126
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:54,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the stairs are a little bit more, I think the new stairs are going to be a little bit more narrow maybe.

127
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will be an enclosed porch just like it is there.

128
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:05,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Andre.

129
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, you had your hand up?

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes.

131
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:11,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

132
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:26,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chair, through you to the building commissioner, is this, that's the only part of the nonconformity from the prior use that they need to seek relief from?

133
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,184
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, they can rebuild on the same footprint, but that is a variation, correct?

134
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:35,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

135
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,266
[SPEAKER_07]: My question for now, thank you.

136
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:44,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chris.

137
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:48,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from the board?

138
00:09:52,630 --> 00:10:00,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and Dennis, if you can confirm for me, I believe we do have two letters on the record in support, correct?

139
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:04,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

140
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can call them up.

141
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,658
[SPEAKER_04]: One was from 15 Pleasant Street.

142
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:22,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other is at 150 Riverside, so both abutting properties or, you know, neighboring properties, I should say.

143
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:26,968
[SPEAKER_04]: But 1 of them is to direct to butter and I think.

144
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:31,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, one was across the street.

145
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:39,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, so their door looks directly at, they're the people that are basically directly across from where the porch is.

146
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:42,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we walk out that door, we look at their house.

147
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:46,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Messina.

148
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we will open it up for public comment.

149
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, if you could put your email in the comments in the chat.

150
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:05,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And if anybody from the public would like to ask a question, if you could please raise your hand on Zoom or drop an email to Dennis.

151
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:06,855
[SPEAKER_08]: He's putting that in the chat now.

152
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:17,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And that email is dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

153
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:25,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's D-M-A-C as in Mac, D-O-U-G as in Doug, A-L-L as in all, dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

154
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dennis.

155
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:40,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any hands raised on Zoom.

156
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:46,874
[SPEAKER_08]: For this update, I think I've got everybody on my screen.

157
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:52,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you have any emails, Dennis?

158
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not received any further emails, just the ones that we received prior to the meeting.

159
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

160
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:03,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion to close public comment and enter deliberation.

161
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:07,953
[SPEAKER_08]: So moved.

162
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:11,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a second?

163
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:12,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

164
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:14,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Andre.

165
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:15,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mary.

166
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:19,496
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take roll call.

167
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:19,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre?

168
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:21,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

169
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:22,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris?

170
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:23,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

171
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:24,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Yvette?

172
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:25,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

173
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:26,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary?

174
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:27,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

175
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:28,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie, aye.

176
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,280
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

177
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,540
[SPEAKER_08]: What does everybody think?

178
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go first, I guess.

179
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:42,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Chris.

180
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:46,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's fine.

181
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:53,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have a question sort of possibly for Dennis.

182
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:23,293
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of route that this goes through isn't is this area considered the historic district or one of the few that we have in the city and does that does it require some other sign off on um it actually went in order to demo it i can't believe phil can correct me if i'm wrong i believe it actually had to get

183
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:34,402
[SPEAKER_04]: expedited through the historical commission because it was building older than 75 years, but due to the nature of the damage, it was given permission to demo, but post that, it's not a historic district.

184
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:41,767
[SPEAKER_04]: The only historic districts are near the library and then down along Winthrop and High around that intersection.

185
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:47,510
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a historic shipyard district sign there, but that's not a city historic district.

186
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a state one and doesn't apply for any work in this case.

187
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:54,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that that was probably my confusion.

188
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that sign.

189
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:56,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah. 100.

190
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jamie.

191
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll just say this makes a ton of sense.

192
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I live just down the street.

193
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:15,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Really was sorry to see the house go up in flames.

194
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that the owners, you guys are coming back and you're rebuilding.

195
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:24,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is very sensible.

196
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're being asked tonight is just to make a finding that it's not going to

197
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:34,114
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, extend any, you know, inconformity.

198
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:46,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly endorse that since it's going to be slightly less, you know, wide on the, you know, on the side.

199
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:54,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it doesn't, certainly doesn't do any, you know, doesn't have any negative effects towards the Riverside F side.

200
00:14:59,602 --> 00:14:59,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Andrew.

201
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:10,146
[SPEAKER_08]: No, or Mary, do you have anything else you'd like to add?

202
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:13,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I think aesthetically, it looks better.

203
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It will look better with the extension.

204
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's more balanced.

205
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:22,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm in agreement with Andre.

206
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,257
[SPEAKER_05]: No detriment to the neighborhood.

207
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

208
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:31,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Move forward.

209
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

210
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:36,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, and I agree with it as well.

211
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:42,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pulling it a little bit back from the curve, and obviously extension is not an issue towards Riverside.

212
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:53,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe... Actually, Dennis, this is just a variance, correct?

213
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:00,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see the actual request.

214
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a finding, Jamie.

215
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guys, so it's an existing nonconformity.

216
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:18,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when I filled out the application, I didn't see when I spoke to the building inspector, it said, you'll probably need to go in front of the ZBA for a finding.

217
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:21,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see that as an option on the paperwork.

218
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,704
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only, I think, special permit or variance.

219
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:35,209
[SPEAKER_01]: But but from what I understand, yes, it's just a finding that that we need just to allow that the porch to be constructed.

220
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, we sometimes conflate the two.

221
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:49,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it used to be purely finding now it's basically special permit, so special permit to keep the existing, you know, change a change to the existing nonconformity to the new property.

222
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's

223
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I can work on the language fully in the decision, but that's basically they need a special permit to build the porch within the front yard setback.

224
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a it's a pre-existing nonconformity.

225
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:07,050
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an extension alteration of pre-existing nonconformity.

226
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,993
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a special permit since we no longer have findings directly.

227
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:17,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Commissioner, I appreciate it.

228
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:37,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for reference, before we vote, obviously, special permit is going to fall into any impacts to natural environment, socioeconomic community needs, traffic flow, adequacy of utilities, compatibility with size, scale, and structure, or any impacts to the natural environment.

229
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've gone through our conversation through all of that.

230
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:47,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So the chair awaits a motion.

231
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:55,337
[SPEAKER_08]: to approve the special permit for 3 Pleasant Street in Medford.

232
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:57,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion.

233
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:01,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a second?

234
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:02,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded.

235
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:03,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

236
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: And roll call vote.

237
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:06,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Yvette?

238
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:07,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

239
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary?

240
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:09,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

241
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:11,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris?

242
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

243
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:13,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre?

244
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

245
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,253
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie?

246
00:18:15,273 --> 00:18:15,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

247
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:19,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mister Messina.

248
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:24,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, if you could walk through the next steps for the approval.

249
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:25,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys.

250
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Phil, I'm going to write up the decision as quickly as I can.

251
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:37,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once it's written, then it gets to get checked by our legal counsel just to make sure that everything's proper and that.

252
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:42,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they approve it, then it gets signed by the members and then it gets filed with the city clerk's office.

253
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,567
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, there's a 20 days appeals period.

254
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once that 20 days appeals period has ended,

255
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,041
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can actually get your building permit for the porch.

256
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:53,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

257
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:57,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do I need to file this special permit after the appeals period?

258
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to file that with the registry?

259
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:00,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

260
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:01,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

261
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:02,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets filed with them.

262
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:03,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

263
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:05,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

264
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:05,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

265
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to go to the commissioner real quick.

266
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:27,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't want to confirm once the 21 days appeal period is has elapsed, you go to the city clerk, they give you the approval letter, you take that to the registry, you get that stamped, it's the stamped and recorded copy that we want for the building permit to verify that is now a legal decision.

267
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:29,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

268
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:30,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Scott.

269
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:35,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everybody.

270
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:43,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, if you could read the case for 97 Winchester Street.

271
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:46,157
[SPEAKER_04]: 97 Winchester Road, case number 8-2024-24.

272
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:58,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Applicant and owners Stephen Kelch and Susan Wilson to build an addition at 97 Winchester Road within the rear yard setback, which is not allowed per the City of Memphis Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

273
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dennis.

274
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:02,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And do we have a representative for the applicant?

275
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I'm Robert Caruso.

276
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the builder and designer for this project.

277
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:10,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Robert.

278
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:11,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go ahead.

279
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:12,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

280
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to share my screen, if that's all right.

281
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:17,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

282
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me one second, and you are good to go.

283
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:23,920
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

284
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see my screen?

285
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:29,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

286
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:29,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

287
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:49,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, does this look like it's, I'm not sure I'm doing this right, but the,

288
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:03,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert if you want to if you want to tell me which one of the ones that you sort of send me I can call it up just.

289
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd like to look at the plans on the front.

290
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:12,852
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so there's the plot plan and the architectural plans, which one do you prefer?

291
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,873
[SPEAKER_02]: The cover sheet to start with?

292
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:18,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

293
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a sheet before that?

294
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:40,838
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one I had was just this, but let me... The architectural plans?

295
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, this is the first page of the architectural plan, sorry.

296
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:54,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it goes down further, but that was... The first page was the page showing the existing property and then the add-on, where the addition would be.

297
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:56,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so...

298
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:01,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you go down?

299
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:07,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, we can start here.

300
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:19,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So the house is a classic mansard house built around the beginning of the 20th century.

301
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,954
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, probably after World War II,

302
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:35,737
[SPEAKER_02]: a solarium was built on the back, or initially probably a sun porch that then got closed in.

303
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:44,641
[SPEAKER_02]: That sun porch, which is here, did not have a full foundation under it.

304
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:54,286
[SPEAKER_02]: When I investigated that, it's built on hollow cinder blocks that go down about maybe 18 inches.

305
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:02,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an underbuilt situation.

306
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:11,715
[SPEAKER_02]: The house is a small house, maybe 1,700 square feet with three bedrooms and one bath.

307
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:25,571
[SPEAKER_02]: and a toilet in the basement that's not up to code at all.

308
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:31,455
[SPEAKER_02]: The owners just had twins in June.

309
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:34,477
[SPEAKER_02]: They both worked from home.

310
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:44,064
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted some additional space for an office and to correct some of the deficiencies in the house.

311
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:55,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So I developed this plan that didn't have any impact on the street view of the mansard.

312
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,711
[SPEAKER_02]: The mansard stays the same.

313
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:07,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It uses the existing roof line of the sun porch, which already extends and cantilevers to the width of the house.

314
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:14,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And that projects out a little bit further.

315
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:21,216
[SPEAKER_02]: to contain a stair to get down into the basement.

316
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:34,483
[SPEAKER_02]: It made sense if you're going to put a full foundation below the sun porch and you're going to get that heavy equipment in there and so forth to create additional space under there.

317
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:40,466
[SPEAKER_02]: The basement currently doesn't have a full headroom, so it's not really

318
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:45,446
[SPEAKER_02]: that usable as living space, it's under seven feet.

319
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:52,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So this addition solves several problems.

320
00:24:52,551 --> 00:25:04,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a code compliance stair to the basement, creates an office space for the owners who both work from home much of the time.

321
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:09,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a mudroom entrance,

322
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:19,296
[SPEAKER_02]: and creates the foundation to make that back porch more stable.

323
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:38,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the house was built in a position where it's rotated on the lot, when we project this addition back, which is really only an additional 100 square feet, the very corner of it,

324
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:48,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's less than 10 square feet, project beyond the setback.

325
00:25:49,858 --> 00:25:59,700
[SPEAKER_02]: The back of this house faces the kidney dialysis clinic, some HVAC equipment, and a parking lot.

326
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really no impact on any neighbors.

327
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:08,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The one abutting neighbor has sent in a letter of support.

328
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:16,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's basically it.

329
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:22,065
[SPEAKER_02]: The owners have lived in this area for about 20 years.

330
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,526
[SPEAKER_02]: They've owned the house since 2017.

331
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:24,908
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a child in daycare.

332
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:38,170
[SPEAKER_02]: going into grade school soon, and would like to stay and raise their kids.

333
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:45,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The proximity to the T is very important to them, and the community is very important to them.

334
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:49,733
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it in a nutshell, really.

335
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:56,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Caruso.

336
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from the board?

337
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:15,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And just for qualifying, we're looking at, I believe, is a 1.8 foot difference on that rear yard setback.

338
00:27:17,183 --> 00:27:22,366
[SPEAKER_08]: And Commissioner, if you can correct me, I believe we're going with, this is a request for a variance.

339
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:27,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so they're extending into the existing setback.

340
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:31,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, it's a variance rather than extending alongside the existing.

341
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:33,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically the difference to it.

342
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:44,690
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, no questions from the board.

343
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,574
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll move it to public comment.

344
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:59,842
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone from the public would like to speak, please raise your hand on Zoom, or again, send an email in to Dennis at DMACCDMO at Medford-MA.gov.

345
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:11,932
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe Mr. Caruso did comment, we do have one letter of support that we received from 91 Winchester Street.

346
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:23,523
[SPEAKER_08]: A quick correction, 97 Winchester Street.

347
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:25,264
[SPEAKER_08]: The application for 97, correct?

348
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:26,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

349
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:32,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the letter from the support was from 91 Winchester Street.

350
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:39,134
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I don't see any hands raised on Zoom.

351
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, do you have any additional emails?

352
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:43,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not.

353
00:28:44,712 --> 00:28:45,553
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

354
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:48,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion to close public comment and enter deliberation.

355
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:53,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion.

356
00:28:55,962 --> 00:28:56,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

357
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:58,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

358
00:28:58,484 --> 00:29:00,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion from Mary, second from Andre.

359
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, Yvette.

360
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:04,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

361
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:05,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris.

362
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:07,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

363
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:08,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre.

364
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:08,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

365
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:09,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary.

366
00:29:10,454 --> 00:29:10,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

367
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:11,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie, aye.

368
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:20,147
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, again, so we are looking at a rear yard setback difference of 1.8 feet.

369
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:39,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a variance, again, owing to the circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape, topography of the land or structures, enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner, and that the granting of the desirable need would not be a substantial detriment.

370
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:46,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Any comments from the board?

371
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:47,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I can start.

372
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:53,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the way the house is situated on the plot of land.

373
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:59,193
[SPEAKER_05]: One, it doesn't look like it'll be a detriment to the neighborhood by adding this.

374
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:01,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It adds the integrity of the house.

375
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:08,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And clearly, for safety reasons, the stairwell rate would be needed to access the basement.

376
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:20,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But because of the way the property is situated on the land itself, I think it would be an improvement that would work well for both the owners and the neighborhood.

377
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:28,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Yvette.

378
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:29,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other comment from the board?

379
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:54,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just comment that there seems to be no detriment at all, and it's what I would call an improvement, certainly based on what the architect said that the foundation appeared like in the discovery

380
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,031
[SPEAKER_07]: period.

381
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:59,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could be an innovation.

382
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:03,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chris.

383
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Andre.

384
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:12,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll just say, I think, given the way that it's laid out, it is very unique.

385
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:25,306
[SPEAKER_00]: The house is really kind of at a diagonal angle to the street, which means that to do any kind of improvement to the house, you're going to have that corner inevitably.

386
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:27,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Brush up against that setback.

387
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:33,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's reasonable and in agreement with the other board members.

388
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:37,836
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not detrimental right on the other side, as has been mentioned.

389
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:42,640
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of a cement block wall.

390
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is really.

391
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:51,046
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really an improvement for a family that's that for them to be able to stay in the neighborhood.

392
00:31:51,106 --> 00:32:00,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And and if anything, it really improves some of the make some of the building code fixes, you know, for the house, for the future.

393
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:01,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

394
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:06,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Andre.

395
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:10,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other discussion?

396
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:23,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely an agreement thing, and with the positioning of the property, if it were flat to the street, the extension wouldn't even enter the setback, that corner, to your point.

397
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:39,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely creates a challenge there, and from the neighborhood perspective, and also with the letter of support, I don't believe the rear neighbor has any concerns, considering it's a larger building, their structure, and we did not get it from them.

398
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:47,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion to approve the variance for 97 Winchester Street.

399
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:50,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion.

400
00:32:53,115 --> 00:32:53,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

401
00:32:55,197 --> 00:32:55,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you both.

402
00:32:56,938 --> 00:32:58,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll do a roll call.

403
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris?

404
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:00,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

405
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:01,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary?

406
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:02,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

407
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:03,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Andre?

408
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:04,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

409
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:05,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Yvette?

410
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:06,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

411
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:07,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie, aye.

412
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:16,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everybody, and to the applicant, Mr. Calpurnis-Wilson, you have approval.

413
00:33:16,818 --> 00:33:21,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, similar to what you heard earlier, but I'll let Dennis go through the process for you.

414
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to reiterate, so I'll write the decision.

415
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:27,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll go be checked by our legal counsel.

416
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:30,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once that's done, it'll get filed on the clerk's office.

417
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:33,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you know what it is, and you'll get an original copy.

418
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,151
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after 21 days have passed,

419
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:42,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to the clerk's office and you basically get a letter saying there's been no appeal of this.

420
00:33:43,275 --> 00:33:48,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You take the decision, go to the registry, file it there, and then come back to the building department and get your permit.

421
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:52,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

422
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

423
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:00,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all for your time.

424
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, do we have any administrative updates?

425
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, nothing really to speak of right now.

426
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, nothing that I can think of.

427
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:23,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, oh, just, I think we sort of did sort of double check, but just to confirm, I know some people said they couldn't do the second, but I believe we have enough because Mike said he could do the second and I'm just checking now.

428
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:27,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yvette said she couldn't, but Andre, Chris or Mary, does the second work for you all?

429
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, second works for me.

430
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I had responded was that... Oh, correct.

431
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:35,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry.

432
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:41,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that it's possible I would be away, but I probably won't.

433
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,663
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably is fine.

434
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:47,184
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if you might want to make sure you have Warren without me.

435
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:49,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll double check with Jim.

436
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:52,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he mentioned earlier that he could.

437
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:55,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we can probably do that.

438
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:59,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll just, you know, as long as we have four, that's kind of...

439
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:03,269
[SPEAKER_00]: but it shouldn't be a problem.

440
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:07,713
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like I'm going to be away.

441
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:08,593
[SPEAKER_04]: We already have a few cases.

442
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:21,383
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a few filings in, so we definitely got things to do, and including just as sort of a bit of an FYI, the most recent 40B-970 Fellsway, I think they mentioned during the hearing that they were going to split the property into two.

443
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:27,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really, there was going to be where the, the storage unit is going to be 1 property in the building is going to be another.

444
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And by doing that, they need to come before us for the storage unit.

445
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:33,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they actually did the actual physical lot.

446
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:34,772
[SPEAKER_04]: They would do that.

447
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:42,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the actual self storage lot, because of the splitting, they will need some legal split.

448
00:35:46,301 --> 00:36:09,035
[SPEAKER_04]: so that that that what that has been submitted so that'll be that's one of the items on the agenda just to give you guys a heads up that you know some properties we are never would have okay so at the moment we will look to january 2nd at 6 30 and barring any issues with attendance we can yes that i mean the only positive thing is that if

449
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It would never, it wouldn't be pushed earlier.

450
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:14,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it would only be pushed later if need be.

451
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:17,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we have time to deal with any sort of advertising and things like that.

452
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:18,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

453
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:24,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

454
00:36:25,064 --> 00:36:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no minutes for you.

455
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:26,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Apologies.

456
00:36:27,345 --> 00:36:29,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone was working on it, but then she got tied up in school.

457
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:34,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think she did mention that she was going to be here for a while over the Christmas break.

458
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:38,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think hopefully we can hunker down and get a bunch of them done for the January 2nd meeting.

459
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and we've got an item on there to discuss the rules.

460
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:44,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to get those done.

461
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:45,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

462
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:49,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,111
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
