Okay.

74
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:28,366
Um, so yeah, we met on movement last week, and we wanted to the purpose of the meeting was to identify the newly formed subcommittee, which is behavioral health and special education combined.

75
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:30,427
So we had a good turnout.

76
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:33,589
There was, you know, a number of people in the meeting over 25, I believe.

77
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:37,964
And we wanted to identify goals for the upcoming year.

78
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:53,571
And so we have identified for behavioral health, we wanna focus on trauma and for special education, we're wanting to focus on community friendships and relationships.

79
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:58,152
And we will be meeting every other, I mean, every third Thursday of the month.

80
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:01,694
And what we're gonna do is because there's such broad topics, obviously,

81
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,303
We're, um, staggering the meeting.

82
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:08,926
So one month, the subcommittee is open to everyone, obviously it's a public meeting.

83
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:20,292
Um, but one month we'll be, uh, specific to trauma and addressing, um, specific goals to trauma in our schools and what we want to achieve, um, and trauma awareness in our schools and what we want to achieve.

84
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:28,297
And then the second month will be related to, uh, community friendships for individuals with disabilities in our,

85
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:31,517
community and focus on our schools and community as a whole.

86
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:33,679
Any questions?

87
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,220
Great.

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,861

00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,026

91
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,107

92
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,369

Thank you.

95
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:57,395
Number six, do we have any community participation that is not related to any agenda item?

96
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:10,105
Hearing and seeing none, we will move on to report of the superintendent, Dr. Vincent.

97
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:13,206
Yes, good evening, everyone.

98
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:13,746
Oops.

00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:16,687

00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:17,827
I'm on, okay.

101
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:20,588
Good evening.

102
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,410
I wanted to share, today we hosted the middle school lottery via Zoom.

103
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:33,357
All of the numbers have been posted to our website and blog as of 1215 this afternoon.

104
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:39,842
We welcome all of our rising fifth graders to the Andrews and McGlynn middle schools in the fall.

105
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:53,535
Depending upon Governor Baker's decision, we will either go forward with orientations on May 6th or 7th, whether we are in school or not in school.

106
00:07:53,995 --> 00:08:06,844
Mr. Downs and Mr. Tucci will be working on special presentations to do a very welcoming orientation, even if it does need to be done remotely.

107
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:10,647
So please stay tuned to receive more information about that.

108
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:19,370
I want to extend a very special thank you to Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, our Director of Curriculum and Instruction, and to Ms.

109
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,613
Kim Miles, our Data Manager, for their tireless efforts in organizing and producing the lottery today.

110
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:41,343
I'd also like to thank Alison Goldsberry for creating a new tab on our website, which makes it very easily accessible for parents to log on to the website and review our lottery results.

111
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,956
So I want to thank them for that.

112
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:50,119
I also want to say that we have congratulations in order for our own librarian, Ms.

113
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:51,040
Maria Dorsey.

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:09:04,567
She's our Medford High School librarian, and she was named, Maria was named the 2020 recipient of the Super Librarian Award from the Massachusetts School Library Association.

115
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:09,716
The award honors excellence in school librarianship.

116
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:18,062
The Super Librarian works on the regional and state level to contribute to improving all school libraries.

117
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:22,785
Maria has been at the Medford High School since 2010.

118
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:26,908
She has worked hard to make it a welcoming place for students and staff.

119
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:33,032
She has weeded out old book titles and added diverse books for the student body.

120
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:42,839
Maria established a strong partnership with the Medford Public Library, where materials are shared and getting library cards for students.

121
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:53,786
Additionally, she formed a partnership with the Office of Prevention and Outreach to bring information on services and self-care for mental health and addiction.

122
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:07,008
She developed a relaxation station in the library that allows students to give their brains a rest and enjoy puzzles, chess, Legos, coloring books, and a chalk wall.

123
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:15,458
Maria also co-chairs the Metro West region of the Massachusetts School Library Association.

124
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,140
She truly demonstrates exemplary school library leadership.

125
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:21,701
Great job, Maria.

126
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,322
Congratulations.

127
00:10:23,702 --> 00:10:30,065
I'm sorry this is being done remotely, but we appreciate all of your wonderful contributions to Medford.

128
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:37,060
Additionally, during this time of school closure, I want to extend a special thank you.

129
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:50,207
We're very grateful to the Teamsters 25 and one of their partners who donated liquid hand sanitizer for all of our custodians, 375 milliliter bottles.

130
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:59,272
The hand sanitizer was made from a local distiller called MS Walker, which is a family owned business based in New England.

131
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:11,816
they stopped their production of alcohol and changed their business over to making a very strong alcohol-based hand sanitizer that can be used with a spray bottle.

132
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:15,797
So we want to just extend a very special thank you to M.S.

133
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:25,000
Walker and Teamsters 25 for going the extra mile and having a community partner support Medford Public Schools.

134
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,363
Additionally, according to our director of library media and technology, Ms.

135
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:44,493
Molly Layden, she has created a link that has been established that's going to help anyone who is in need of technical support during school closure.

136
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:49,717
So I'm going to encourage all families to please use tech support.

137
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:54,421
That's T-E-C-H-S-U-P-P-O-R-T.

138
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:59,864
techsupport at medford.k12.ma.us.

139
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:08,754
They are ready and willing to help you with any technological challenges that you may be facing during the school closure.

140
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:24,586
Additionally, while we're during this closure time, the college board has informed our guidance department that due to COVID-19, SATs will not be administered during the remainder of this school year.

141
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:28,570
So that is just an important update for all families.

142
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,133
SATs will not be administered.

143
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:38,845
At this time, I also want to just acknowledge one of our Mustangs who's doing an excellent job.

144
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:46,212
And we want to just say thank you to all of our health care professionals during this COVID-19 crisis.

145
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:59,062
Last Sunday in the Boston Globe, one of our own Mustangs, Ricky Cormio, a 2002 graduate, was featured as a paramedic on the front lines for Cataldo Ambulance.

146
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:06,510
Ricky is the son of vocational electrical teacher, Mr. Richard Cormier, and his wife, Teresa.

147
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:18,621
Ricky Cormier is just one of so many Mustangs that are currently serving us during this pandemic, whether in the medical field, in public safety, or in our grocery stores.

148
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,321
And even at my own home, my husband is a medical professional at Boston Medical Center.

149
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:29,283
So I know the dedication it requires and the long hours it demands.

150
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:32,564
We salute them all and pray for their good health.

151
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:43,367
Last week on Tuesday, we had the opportunity to enjoy an uplifting parade that the McGlynn teachers and staff hosted for their students.

152
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:55,996
This parade was led by the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and special guests, including Elsa from Frozen and Marshall from Paw Patrol.

153
00:13:56,576 --> 00:14:06,423
Principal Diane Garino, Assistant Principal Doreen Andrews, had a long line of cars filled with teachers, administrators, and well-wishers

154
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:07,885
who participated.

155
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:14,817
There were balloons, streamers, and posters beeping and waving to our students and the community.

156
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:22,422
assistant superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing, associate superintendent, Diane Caldwell.

157
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:27,546
We also were part of the parade and it was a wonderful time for all.

158
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:36,193
We did get to see the mayor and her family joining in and cheering the teachers on, on our route during the parade.

159
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:45,741
And I want to just extend a special thanks to our coach, Jack Dempsey, who filmed the parade, which was shown later on NBC 10 Boston News.

160
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:57,221
It was a bright spot in this time of social distancing and I know that the Brooks and Columbus schools hopefully are planning to host their parades in the near future.

161
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:01,655
So I just want to thank everyone for their participation and for that.

162
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:17,632
Additionally, I would like to say that I want to thank Mayor Lungo Kern for lifting our spirits with her Medford Strong video, which featured Medford residents indicating who they are staying home for, school children.

163
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:29,483
Parents, teachers, and residents are pictured with decorated signs and posters reminding all of us why it is so important to hashtag stay home.

164
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:34,287
We are Mustang strong, and we will get through this together.

165
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:45,757
On the academic side, there continues to be conversations with our commissioner of education and listening to what's being said by our governor.

166
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:56,092
We are awaiting an official decision from Governor Baker as to when schools will be able to resume.

167
00:15:56,593 --> 00:16:05,940
As it stands right now, the date is May 4th, but I'm told that we should be hearing an updated report from the governor sometime this week.

168
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:20,884
In addition to this extended closure, I just want to formally say that in light of the extended closure, the Commissioner of Education, the MCAS assessment has been officially canceled for this year.

169
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,204
It will not be given.

170
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:30,026
And that is something that we were waiting to find out if they were going to do it at a later point in time.

171
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:34,948
But again, based on this extended closure, the decision has been made to

172
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:41,774
cancel the MCAS completely for the entire year.

173
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:44,719
Yesterday evening.

174
00:16:45,059 --> 00:17:11,676
I am not aware uh, if some of you had the opportunity on fox 25 there was a um, A presentation in our own school nurse columbus school nurse Miss karen roberto was featured as one of the nurses talking about um how she is supporting our board of health additionally our mayor was on as well as showing what medford was doing to keep our community safe and

175
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:20,053
And so we do thank our nurses again for being part of the team and contributing to keeping our entire community safe.

176
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:37,180
The Medford Public Schools, our administrators, teachers, business staff, paras, librarians, nurses, along with the mayor and the entire school committee, are approaching this pandemic in a unified manner.

177
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,226
So for those of you who do have questions, concerns, or any other school-related issues, please do reach out to us.

178
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:53,113
And that email address is info at medford.k12.ma.us.

179
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:54,975
We are all here for you.

180
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:56,957
Thank you for listening this evening.

181
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:00,940
Thank you, Superintendent.

182
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:03,262
Great job.

183
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:12,012
Um, number two report on COVID-19 update from miss Tony Ray and miss Mary Ann O'Connor.

184
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,453
Tony, I know I saw you.

185
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:20,695
Oh, can you hear me?

186
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:21,355
Yes.

187
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,365
Good evening, everyone.

188
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:35,695
I just wanted to report that we've all been hearing in the news that Massachusetts is experiencing its surge in COVID-19 diagnoses.

189
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,197
We're seeing this in Medford as well.

190
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:44,723
As of today, we have 519 positive cases in Medford.

191
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:50,448
And the group that's been particularly hit hard has been our elderly population.

192
00:18:53,693 --> 00:19:03,242
As Dr. Edward Vincent said, many of our school nurses are helping in the Board of Health with contact tracing and checking up on families.

193
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:14,592
They've been serving meals at the McGlynn Educational Complex, and they've been connecting with elderly patients as part of the RUOK program.

194
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:29,664
We're following all the Department of Public Health and Department of Education information closely and waiting for updates about continuing school closures or when we can reenter school.

195
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,945
I do want to take this time to recognize the stress that everybody is under and experiencing.

196
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:44,711
I want to encourage everyone to continue the stay-at-home advisories and the social distancing measures that they've been doing.

197
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:50,296
This is critical at this time in our surge of cases.

198
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:56,820
Please follow the governor's advice and wear a mask when you're making needed trips outside of your homes.

199
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:05,706
Continue good hand washing and cough etiquette to control the spread of germs within your own home.

200
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:17,313
And please call your primary care physician if you're experiencing any symptoms of illness before you go into the emergency room or go into your doctor's office.

201
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:20,375
Thank you.

202
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,085
Thank you, Ms.

203
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:23,385
Ray.

204
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:33,550
I'm not sure, I don't believe Marian O'Connor is on, but I did speak to her today, and it's a lot of the same that Tony mentioned, 519 cases.

205
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:41,335
She wanted to give a special thank you to the six or seven nurses working on the contact tracing within the city of Medford.

206
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:45,317
That's what is giving us the ability to really try to slow this spread.

207
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:50,880
We also have the meals being served by a number of residents,

208
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,172
and members of the committee, as well as nurses.

209
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:59,277
And I thank them also for making calls on our UOK program.

210
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:02,440
11,000 seniors have been called.

211
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:09,047
Many of them are getting deliveries on a weekly or biweekly basis.

212
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,190
And the second round of those calls will be starting on Wednesday.

213
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,032
Member McLaughlin?

214
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:19,351
Yes, I just wanted to say thank you, Mayor Longo Kern, for doing the R U OK?

215
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:19,751
program.

216
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:23,633
We have members in our district that are volunteering.

217
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,735
I don't know why we're getting the echo.

218
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:29,357
We have members in our district, in our ward, that are doing a lot of volunteer work.

219
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,878
And I've done some of those calls as well.

220
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:38,723
And the constituents are just so happy and touched that this has happened, that this R U OK?

221
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:41,365
program is happening, and that people are calling out to them.

222
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:47,522
Some of them, it's kind of funny, the younger ones are like, you know, are you putting me in the elder category, which is kind of funny.

223
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:52,668
But there was somebody who wanted it to be made clear that they said,

224
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:59,118
We needed to tell you that there's a special place in heaven for Mayor Lungo Kern for doing this, which I thought was really sweet.

225
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,059
Reminded me of my Nana.

226
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:07,743
But it's a really great program and all of the volunteers in our community that are calling each other and just the neighborliness that it's creating.

227
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,684
People are bringing things to each other.

228
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:16,208
I have several folks who are delivering groceries on a regular basis, like on a weekly basis to people in the community.

229
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:19,930
And it's just really brought the community together in a way that's quite remarkable.

230
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,610
So thank you.

231
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,935
No, thank you for taking part in that.

232
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:31,821
I know that there was about 150 people, volunteers from the school committee, the city council, making those calls.

233
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:36,344
Now for the second round, we did take a little bit of time off so that we can make sure people are quarried.

234
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:44,930
And while we're on live, I'd like to just point out, if you're willing to make calls, please, all you need is a quarry check that's being run through my office.

235
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:48,433
And if you'd like to make deliveries, which we are gonna need some,

236
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:52,123
serious support there, because our few volunteers are getting a little overwhelmed.

237
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,464
You can be MRC certified.

238
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,565
I took the certification course myself.

239
00:22:56,665 --> 00:23:01,626
It took about an hour, and now I'm certified to make deliveries of medication and food.

240
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:05,448
So if anybody in the community is willing to help out with that, we are.

241
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:10,309
This is going to stretch for some time, and we are in need of some extra volunteers.

242
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:17,692
So thank you for everything you all have done, and we'll continue doing what we have to do to make sure everybody's fed and medicated properly.

243
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,701
And of course, our administration and school committee taking care of our kids as best we can.

244
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:22,821
Mayor?

245
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,302
Yes, Member Van de Kloet.

246
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:44,147
Yes, I just also wanted to add and echo Melanie's thoughts because I too made calls and I will say that the response was just so positive and I'm very appreciative for you to doing that, starting that program and all the things that you and our administration have been doing during this very difficult period.

247
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:45,347
Thank you so much.

248
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:46,393
Thank you.

249
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:48,514
It's the volunteers doing the work.

250
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:51,174
I delivered to 13 homes on Saturday.

251
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:54,135
That's because my husband wasn't feeling well, but he's been doing it too.

252
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:56,876
Everybody's just pulling their weight and it's going a long way.

253
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:57,596
So thank you all.

254
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:13,940
And I know Tony Ray also said, yeah, our hardest hit population is the elderly and our nursing homes are, you know, we're working very hard to get them help through DPH and Secretary Sutter's office between staffing and PPE and,

255
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,112
infection control, we're working hard.

256
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:23,594
Marianne is on the phone all the time, really trying to get those nursing homes as much help as possible.

257
00:24:23,674 --> 00:24:26,116
So that's what she wanted me to add.

258
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:37,421
If anybody has any other questions, if not, we can move on to number three, report on negotiated transportation contract payment for remainder of the school year 2020, Ms.

259
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:37,961
Christine Patterson.

260
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:41,786
Mayor.

261
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:53,032
So I provided documentation showing a calculation what the different phases of a potential cost breakdown would be.

262
00:24:53,712 --> 00:25:08,560
I can share that I've been on numerous calls with the Department of Education, and they have given direction to the 365 cities and towns to work with their local

263
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:21,538
yellow bus companies to maintain a payment structure to have our bus drivers intact when we do go back to regular school schedule.

264
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:33,120
So the Eastern Bus Company has a number of communities that they are working with, and I've been on subsequent conference calls with the groups as well.

265
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:34,521
And the

266
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:37,822
estimates that we have come up with.

267
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:59,160
Medford is on a low end of a per diem rate because we are in year five of a finalized five-year contract, which also leaves us a little bit open to some insecurity for a bid for this current year.

268
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,464
The bid is currently been pushed out to May due to the closure

269
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:26,450
And so we're hoping to mitigate this, but what the collective group has been negotiating with the bus contractor is between most of the cities are at the 70 to 75% reimbursement of the daily to and from school bus runs.

270
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:32,395
So the projection that I provided you is the base rate contractually

271
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:36,237
at 70% of that cost factor.

272
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:50,308
So I did negotiate that directly with the owner of Eastern Bus and for the Medford community, that's what he was looking at for our contract currently.

273
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:58,295
I also provided a sample letter that is a separate letter

274
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:10,501
memo of agreement because we do have a current contract and in order to pay on a different schedule, we would need a new pseudo contract.

275
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:18,567
And that has been vetted out through the resources of Brookline and their legal department through the schools.

276
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:26,532
So we have all been working in partnership as local schools in terms of trying to identify

277
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:32,264
a collaborative rate in order to maintain our bus drivers.

278
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:50,193
And what we have been insured and what is part of the separate side contractual agreement is that the bus drivers would be maintained payment or their regular salaries or hourly wages, they would be on a regular bus run.

279
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,955
So they are not filed for unemployment at this time.

280
00:27:54,949 --> 00:28:02,791
and the continued partial payment would ensure that they would be accessible.

281
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:08,712
And that's the hope, that they will be accessible when the closure ends.

282
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:23,095
So as reported, I have provided the information back for your consideration and hope that we can maintain this prorated

283
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:33,298
cost measure in the same effort to maintain an extension of our school day, which is the school bus drivers.

284
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:36,861
Thank you.

285
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:37,602
Member van de Kloot?

286
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:45,008
Yes, I wanted to thank you, Kirsteen, for working this out and for giving us the proposal.

287
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:48,470
I assume we need to take a vote to accept the MOA?

288
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,597
that would be correct, yes.

289
00:28:51,638 --> 00:29:00,144
I make a motion that we accept the MOA as negotiated by our business superintendent, Christine Patterson.

290
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:04,427
I have a question.

291
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,269
Thank you for doing this, Christine.

292
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:10,931
One second, I have to open my comments about this.

293
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,850
One, two, three.

294
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,511
And the fourth whereas, there is an asterisk in front of the word payments.

295
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:27,512
Does that mean something or is that just an asterisk that got left in there?

296
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:33,453
I'm sorry, which document are you referring to?

297
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:37,314
I'm in the COVID-19 agreement schoolbustransportation.pdf.

298
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:40,075
I know, there's so many documents.

299
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:41,295
Okay.

300
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:53,782
says, where is the Department of Development, DESE, and the Mass Department Division of Labor Services encourage districts to make asterisk payments?

301
00:29:54,903 --> 00:29:59,404
Oh, I believe that's in reference to an established payment.

302
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:05,105
So where we haven't formalized it yet, it was just a placeholder.

303
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,186
OK, great.

304
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:08,386
And then my other question was,

305
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:38,926
Under section three, considerations G, my question was, and I don't necessarily think it's a huge deal, but is there any way for us to know that, sorry, my notes keep moving, that they have received any grants or loans, and whether or not they've had to be repaid or not, are we just gonna trust them, which I'm not saying that's not okay,

306
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:47,070
So any of the federal or state grants will be public information, so we would have access to a listing.

307
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:55,520
And if they were recipients of a stimulus grant or loan, we would have knowledge of that.

308
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:56,701
Excellent.

309
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:57,842
And then my last question is, when

310
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:02,363
I hate the word when right now.

311
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:05,324
I feel like the answer to when right now is the most ridiculous question.

312
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:11,087
But when do you think we might know if we were going to be getting any revenues back?

313
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:19,670
Considering we may be looking at some rough times ahead, every little bit of potential revenue coming in might become very important.

314
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,928
revenue coming back, I'm sorry, from where?

315
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:33,630
For credits related to anything that they've received that's forgiven, any grants or loans that are forgiven.

316
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:47,553
So just given the timeline that we're on, I don't believe that they would be receiving federal grants or state grants until likely May or June.

317
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:56,225
So the form of a credit would be the next fiscal year that it would be counted towards.

318
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:56,965
Right.

319
00:31:57,185 --> 00:32:01,107
And do you know, would that likely come to the schools or to the city?

320
00:32:02,827 --> 00:32:12,611
If I may, I know the second stimulus package that the federal government is discussing and hopefully passing this week does not have anything for the cities and towns.

321
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:17,853
They're hoping to maybe take that up in the third, if there is a third stimulus bill.

322
00:32:22,268 --> 00:32:29,559
I think, oh, and then just at the very end, obviously, it accidentally says Brookline instead of us at the very end of that document.

323
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,981
Yes, thank you.

324
00:32:33,892 --> 00:32:34,112
I'm sorry.

325
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:34,332
I'm sorry.

326
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:34,972
I'm sorry.

327
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:35,273
I'm sorry.

328
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:35,953
I'm sorry.

329
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:36,353
I'm sorry.

330
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:36,613
I'm sorry.

331
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:37,394
I'm sorry.

332
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:38,214
I'm sorry.

333
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:38,614
I'm sorry.

334
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:39,134
I'm sorry.

335
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:39,875
I'm sorry.

336
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:40,195
I'm sorry.

337
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:40,575
I'm sorry.

338
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:41,295
I'm sorry.

339
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:41,996
I'm sorry.

340
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:42,296
I'm sorry.

341
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:42,656
I'm sorry.

342
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:42,876
I'm sorry.

343
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:43,196
I'm sorry.

344
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:43,876
I'm sorry.

345
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:44,136
I'm sorry.

346
00:32:44,156 --> 00:32:44,637
I'm sorry.

347
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:45,097
I'm sorry.

348
00:32:45,117 --> 00:32:45,457
I'm sorry.

349
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:45,777
I'm sorry.

350
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,678
I'm sorry.

351
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:47,198
I'm sorry.

352
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:47,758
I'm sorry.

353
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:48,458
I'm sorry.

354
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:49,279
I'm sorry.

355
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:49,599
I'm sorry.

356
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:49,999
I'm sorry.

357
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:50,419
I'm sorry.

358
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:50,939
I'm sorry.

359
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm sorry.

360
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,540
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,800
I'm sorry.

362
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,060
I'm sorry.

363
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,620
I'm sorry.

364
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,060
I'm sorry.

365
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,981
I'm sorry.

366
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:55,161
I'm sorry.

367
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:55,601
I'm sorry.

368
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:55,962
I'm sorry.

369
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:56,262
I'm sorry.

370
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:56,882
I'm sorry.

371
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:57,462
I'm sorry.

372
00:32:57,482 --> 00:32:57,782
I'm sorry.

373
00:32:57,862 --> 00:32:58,423
I'm sorry.

374
00:32:58,563 --> 00:32:58,923
I'm sorry.

375
00:32:58,943 --> 00:32:59,383
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:59,583 --> 00:32:59,963
I'm sorry.

377
00:33:00,023 --> 00:33:00,444
I'm sorry.

378
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:00,924
I'm sorry.

379
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:01,604
I'm sorry.

380
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:13,572
So the smaller trips and or if they had been for the prior service period, those are getting paid now.

381
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:15,692
We're on a delayed cycle.

382
00:33:16,372 --> 00:33:26,754
So you were likely seeing some that were directly from the service period of March, which we were still in session the first half of that timeframe.

383
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:33,015
So that is phase two of the discussions is working with the

384
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,461
special ed transportation providers as well.

385
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:39,001
Yes, correct.

386
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,242
So right now we haven't had that yet.

387
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,142
No, no, we haven't.

388
00:33:45,503 --> 00:34:03,047
The main issue that has been directed to us from the Department of Ed is to work out the large contracts, the yellow buses at this point in time, because that's the majority of what would be needed in order to

389
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:10,286
to provide the most service for the most population.

390
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:14,228
So they've encouraged us to do our yellow bus schedules first.

391
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:33,178
We are working with the other smaller bus companies as a subset, but we wanted to get this initial yellow bus side agreements completed and or approved and negotiated before we attempt the other categories.

392
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:34,459
Okay, thank you.

393
00:34:36,914 --> 00:34:37,674
Any other questions?

394
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:46,136
If I may ask a question, this will carry us through, Christine, if you could just give us the timeframe of when this will carry us through.

395
00:34:46,236 --> 00:34:52,818
And I only ask because the governor has stated that he is gonna decide on school by the end of this week.

396
00:34:52,918 --> 00:35:00,099
So just by chance, he says we're not going back to school, would our position be different?

397
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,820
And what timeframe does this carry us through?

398
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:12,924
No, so this particular agreement would be the end of this school year or when we would be allowed to return, whichever comes first.

399
00:35:14,686 --> 00:35:18,329
So it's strictly for the remainder of this school year.

400
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:30,280
And if the closure is lifted prior to June 15th, when our last day is, then the subsequent agreement would end as well.

401
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:48,633
And is this, if I may just follow up on that, is there, this what other school districts are following or are some school districts going through a certain timeframe and then figuring it out once the governor makes the decision?

402
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:57,920
So the school districts that I have been collaborating with that are all part of Eastern Bus are using the same format.

403
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,482
It was a template developed

404
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:05,773
through the school department of Brookline and vetted through their legal department.

405
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:08,854
Okay, thank you.

406
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:17,057
So we have a motion for approval by member Van de Kloet, seconded by member Kretz.

407
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,197
All those in favor?

408
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:19,678
I think it should be a roll call.

409
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:21,838
That roll call vote has been requested.

410
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:24,019
Member Graham?

411
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:24,879
Yes.

412
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,040
Member Kretz?

413
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,620
Yes.

414
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,080
Member McLaughlin?

415
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:28,880
Yes.

416
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:30,401
Member McStone?

417
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:35,106
I think she said yes.

418
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:35,606
Yes.

419
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,187
Member Rousseau?

420
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:37,508
We'll pull the thumbs up for her.

421
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:38,649
Member Rousseau?

422
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,309
Yes.

423
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,010
Member van der Kloot?

424
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,291
Yes.

425
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:42,492
Mayor Longo Kern?

426
00:36:42,812 --> 00:36:43,052
Yes.

427
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:44,613
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

428
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:45,434
The paper passes.

429
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:46,435
Thank you.

430
00:36:46,655 --> 00:36:50,238
Number four, report on kindergarten online enrollment.

431
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:50,598
Ms.

432
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:51,459
Diane Caldwell.

433
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,340
Good evening, everyone.

434
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,241
How are you tonight?

435
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:55,922
Thumbs up.

436
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:56,322
Good.

437
00:36:57,103 --> 00:37:01,867
So Medford Public Schools has developed an online kindergarten registration system

438
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,392
that has been up and running since April 7th.

439
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:12,238
This process will enable all our prospective parents to register their children remotely.

440
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:17,321
I have provided you with a document that has been posted online.

441
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,984
And as you can see, the application requirements are the same.

442
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:30,812
Maria Ibrahim, our Parent Information Center coordinator, will communicate with families if parents are missing information.

443
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:39,892
Stephanie McCann, a nurse at Medford High School, will coordinate and check the various documents required for health registration.

444
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:52,561
Kim Miles, our data manager, will check school brains regularly to ensure the information provided is correct and will send notification of missing information.

445
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:58,965
Emails will be pushed out to families if the application or health information is incomplete.

446
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:08,447
So prior to March 13, we had 147 kindergarten students registered in our four elementary schools.

447
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:27,737
And then we had a gap of about three weeks, but since we posted the online registration process, we have enrolled 41, and I believe it's even higher than that now, students, which brings us to a total of 188 students registered for Medford's kindergarten classrooms.

448
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:34,320
Last year at this time, we had 237 kindergarten registrations.

449
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,901
This year we're at 188.

450
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:39,764
So it's about a difference of 49 students.

451
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:51,213
We are certain that our number of registrations will increase during the spring and summer and the gap between last year's numbers and this year's numbers will diminish.

452
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:57,078
Our plan is to roll out the grades one through 12 registrations

453
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:09,778
by May 4th, and then after that we need to do our MEEP classrooms, of which we have about 10, to get the applications and the lottery process started on that as well.

454
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:23,801
So I just want to send out a huge thank you to Tony Ray and her staff, Stephanie McCann, Maria Ibrahim, Kim Miles, who have been working tirelessly and collaboratively to register all of our families.

455
00:39:24,621 --> 00:39:27,622
And in addition to that, we just want to

456
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:34,906
remind parents that just because they register on School Brains doesn't mean they're complete and they're finished.

457
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:42,251
So they need to check in with Maria or Kim or Stephanie to make sure everything has been passed in.

458
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:44,513
I'm happy to take any questions.

459
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,282
Mayor, Member Rousseau, then Member McLaughlin.

460
00:39:58,341 --> 00:39:59,902
I think I'm looking at the wrong report.

461
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:00,802
I don't have a question on this.

462
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:01,182
Thank you.

463
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:01,823
Oh, okay.

464
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:04,144
Number McLaughlin.

465
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:05,204
Hi, thanks for the report, Ms.

466
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:05,644
Caldwell.

467
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:23,872
I was just wondering if registration continues, if we're going back, obviously, these are big ifs, all ifs, would there be an opportunity, especially in the parent room where folks are checking in all the time on the regular, would there be some, you know how we're seeing a lot of the

468
00:40:25,576 --> 00:40:34,538
plexiglass that we're seeing at the grocery stores and some ways that we can continue the social distancing if needed.

469
00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:38,440
Again, these are big Fs, but is there an opportunity for something like that?

470
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:47,462
I know that we'll have, I'm sure that we'll have hand sanitizer, what have you in the setting, but it's a small room and a lot of people will be coming in and out.

471
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:51,143
And I just wanted to make sure that there's some thought to that.

472
00:40:52,177 --> 00:41:02,645
So I haven't given that any thought at all because I'm worried about opening up our schools too soon, even though, you know, it's a small area, you're still in the foyer of the high school.

473
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:06,549
And, you know, I am concerned about the people that would be working.

474
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,851
Maria would be there, Kim, maybe some translators.

475
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:18,538
So I would obviously check with John McLaughlin, the superintendent would have to weigh in and Tony Ray, our director of nurses.

476
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,640
Thank you.

477
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,310
You're welcome.

478
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:29,333
Member Russo, then member Graham.

479
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:31,434
Thank you.

480
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:32,714
I did find my question.

481
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:37,176
In the documents required, there's an early childhood survey.

482
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:41,358
Is that a survey that's like a standard or we write it right around the survey?

483
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:49,982
It's a standard survey that we send out to preschools and to our Catholic schools just to see

484
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:55,828
that it helps us transition the children into kindergarten, but it's a standard survey.

485
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:57,733
Can we edit that survey if we want?

486
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:01,028
I mean, if you want to- I think it's a PDF form.

487
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:03,589
You mean, do you want to change some of the parts of it or?

488
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:20,155
Well, I wanted to see if we could add a question to it around whether a parent or older sibling has a diagnosis of dyslexia since 50% of kids who have a parent or child with a diagnosis of dyslexia absolutely will end up with that diagnosis themselves.

489
00:42:20,215 --> 00:42:24,296
And I just thought, as we address dyslexia in the fall,

490
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:37,127
you know, capacity might be an issue, but if we have a set of kids that we, you know, should we be prioritizing some kids that have this known diagnosis in their family ahead of time?

491
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:42,870
It seems like the right time to ask them that question, but maybe there's another appropriate place too.

492
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:43,511
I don't know.

493
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:47,633
But let me check on that for you, Mr. Oso and I'll get back to you.

494
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:48,534
Thank you.

495
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:53,117
I mean, if there's another spot that it belongs or there's a kindergarten, you know, I understand.

496
00:42:53,157 --> 00:42:54,437
Thank you.

497
00:42:54,918 --> 00:42:55,258
Thank you.

498
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:56,125
Thank you.

499
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:56,746
Member Graham.

500
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:59,068
Thanks, Diane.

501
00:42:59,668 --> 00:43:00,609
Sure.

502
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:05,993
I am excited that we are offering online registration.

503
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:10,617
And I hope that it's our plan to do that regardless of whether our buildings are open or not.

504
00:43:10,697 --> 00:43:24,388
Because I think there's a tremendous community of parents who getting to the Parent Information Center on a particular day or time is just not logistically feasible when you can do it

505
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:25,187
at home.

506
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:30,632
So I'm hoping that we can find ways to streamline this even further as we go forward.

507
00:43:32,013 --> 00:43:48,386
But I also wondered now that we have this online registration like have we done pushes out to all the area preschools to sort of make everybody aware that we want them to register as quickly as possible.

508
00:43:50,695 --> 00:44:04,246
given, especially given that they may not, you know, if they have a first kindergarten child, they may not be following the blog, or even if they have other children, they may not be following the blog to know that they still need to be doing this right now.

509
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:05,206
And the sooner, the better.

510
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:09,670
So I didn't make any formal pushes, not a bad idea.

511
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:19,658
We did prior to March 12th to us leaving, we made pushes to our private schools, but it might be a great idea just to remind parents.

512
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:20,605
Yeah.

513
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:21,246
Yep.

514
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:21,946
So I can do that.

515
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:22,806
Yeah.

516
00:44:22,966 --> 00:44:26,728
And then, um, I guess one other question and a comment.

517
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:36,653
Um, the comment is that before the school closure, we had a subcommittee meeting scheduled to talk about the kindergarten, um, onboarding and registration process.

518
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:41,616
And I'll circle back with you all on finding another date and time where we can do that.

519
00:44:42,336 --> 00:44:43,657
Um, and particularly.

520
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:58,719
wanting to make sure we get that meeting in before the end of the year so that all the institutional knowledge that Diane has in her head over her years of service can sort of be part of the conversation as we prepare to go forward.

521
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:04,162
And that will obviously, that meeting will continue next year, but I want to make sure we get that in this year for sure.

522
00:45:04,182 --> 00:45:08,445
So I'll reach out on the dates for that soon.

523
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:12,707
And then I think the other question I had was around,

524
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:15,530
kindergarten visiting day.

525
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:26,416
And I know, um, especially if you are a first time parent to be able to sort of touch and feel what school is like is super important.

526
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:34,460
And we may simply not have that option right now, but I was wondering what plan B is if we don't go back to school.

527
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:43,145
And we still want to provide our families some virtual way to touch and feel what school is like.

528
00:45:43,581 --> 00:45:45,142
and whether you guys have talked about that at all.

529
00:45:45,982 --> 00:45:52,285
So we really haven't had any formal conversations about that, Jenny, but we certainly can do a virtual.

530
00:45:52,325 --> 00:46:02,770
I know we can talk to the principals and they'd probably be happy to set up some kind of a Zoom or some kind of a meeting with all of their new students, the prospective kindergartners coming in.

531
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:07,453
And I know throughout the summer, there's all kinds of activities.

532
00:46:07,513 --> 00:46:12,095
And at some point, this is going to, I hope lighten up or let up a little bit,

533
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,673
that the activities that happens in the various schools will continue.

534
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:24,899
So there'll be play dates in the summer and some, you know, I know the Brooks has some food thing that they do with the kids as well.

535
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,782
So we will be able to do some activities during the summer.

536
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:31,384
And in addition to that, do some virtual.

537
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:34,387
And so I just wanna speak to a little bit.

538
00:46:34,847 --> 00:46:39,371
If I could say it's like a silver lining that we have this online kindergarten registration.

539
00:46:40,295 --> 00:46:42,116
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

540
00:46:42,196 --> 00:46:50,299
So I think this is filling a need for those parents who also work 12 hours a day and can't make it to the parent information center.

541
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:55,842
So I'm kind of happy that this is up and running and we'll be able to do it for the other grade levels as well.

542
00:46:56,422 --> 00:47:05,066
Yeah, I think, you know, none of this is good, but there's a lot of ingenuity that comes out of really, really bad situations.

543
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:08,327
So I'm really glad that we were able to move in this direction.

544
00:47:09,595 --> 00:47:10,356
Thank you.

545
00:47:11,277 --> 00:47:12,178
I agree, thank you.

546
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:15,742
Is there a motion for approval of report number four?

547
00:47:15,762 --> 00:47:17,324
Motion to approve.

548
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:21,188
By member Russo, seconded by member van de Kloet.

549
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:21,928
All those in favor?

550
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:23,770
All those opposed?

551
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:24,651
Paper passes.

552
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:28,656
Number five, report on student engagement during school closure.

553
00:47:29,176 --> 00:47:30,698
Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

554
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:38,073
Yes, and we're going to share just the first screen of data with you right now.

555
00:47:38,093 --> 00:47:41,120
In summation,

556
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:51,271
trying to contact, gather and curate all of this data, we have some good news.

557
00:47:52,531 --> 00:48:03,135
And we have, I would say the good news is out of all of our students, we have not been able to make contact approximately with 38 students.

558
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:21,136
So although that's very good in terms of what we haven't been able to make contact with about students that are not as engaged, that we are closely monitoring, that number is larger, about 10 times that number.

559
00:48:21,756 --> 00:48:22,517
So there are about 350 students.

560
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,662
that are being closely monitored.

561
00:48:27,884 --> 00:48:34,773
Total, that includes our general population, our special education population, and our EL population.

562
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:39,800
And so teachers have been working truly collaboratively with us.

563
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:59,013
um talking to their uh direct administrators and so um as a result of having this number we've also i've been in contact with our own chief jack buckley who is um committed to helping us make contact

564
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:01,242
with every single student.

565
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:13,947
And so those 38 students, we're going to put that information together to pass it on to see if we can have in partnership with our

566
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:20,459
police department, for them to go and do a wellness check, to check on our families.

567
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:30,365
And the 350 students that are not as engaged as we would like them to be engaged, we are looking at...

568
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:45,792
additional ways to support them, not excluding students that may be experiencing extreme anxiety or other needs around this extended school closure.

569
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:58,498
So we know that although the number is 350 students, the teachers, the administrators, assistant principals, all are really working diligently on trying to

570
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:09,750
re-engage the students that, for different reasons, are not as involved in the instruction that's being given to them at this point in time.

571
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:15,954
So as you can see, this report shows all of the schools.

572
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:24,199
And the first table shows the data district-wide.

573
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,022
I want to be able to thank Dr. Cushing for,

574
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:36,546
sending out a survey to all of our administrators that they filled that data.

575
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:39,227
And also I'd like to acknowledge Ms.

576
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:48,032
Kim Miles, our data manager, who took all of that data and produced these tables for us by school.

577
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:58,337
So that's the information that I have in a nutshell, and I'm open to any questions, if there are any.

578
00:50:59,272 --> 00:51:00,173
Yes, member Rousseau.

579
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:02,114
Thank you so much.

580
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,317
I'm very happy to see this report.

581
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:06,858
It's so important.

582
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,821
I guess my question was, what does engaged mean?

583
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:20,309
When I first read the report, I was completely confused how we could have more students not engaged than not contacted.

584
00:51:20,429 --> 00:51:23,431
I think engagement means something very different than contact.

585
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:34,850
Yes, so when we were trying to get the information, our first priority was to make contact with every single student.

586
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:45,977
Like, has a teacher, whether it's been by phone or by Zoom, by Google Classroom, have teachers been able to make contact with every single student?

587
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:48,515
so that we know that they are okay.

588
00:51:49,296 --> 00:51:58,324
And so the first ask was, have you, since school closed, since the 13th of March, have you been able to make contact with students?

589
00:51:58,664 --> 00:52:00,446
So out of the entire population,

590
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:15,606
38 students, for one reason or another, we have not been able to make any contact with them by phone, by email, by Zoom, by Google Classroom, by some type of communication.

591
00:52:16,186 --> 00:52:24,751
And so those 38 students are going to be the first set of students that we are going to be working collaboratively

592
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:34,315
with Chief Buckley to have him go and check on those families just to ensure, are they still living in Medford?

593
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:37,816
We could have some students that it's a transient population.

594
00:52:38,676 --> 00:52:46,900
Based on the survey data that was collected, one of the schools said they believed a student relocated to another state.

595
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:59,305
And they were still diligently trying to see if they could confirm that the child has relocated to another state and is no longer a student in Medford Public Schools.

596
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:04,647
But at this point in time, the child is still showing as a student.

597
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:15,612
The second number, where it's approximately 350 students, that number of students where they may have

598
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:34,021
joined one or two Zoom classroom sessions, but their participation, remote participation, has been very inconsistent to the point where the classroom teachers are concerned that, wait a minute, I'm not seeing

599
00:53:35,223 --> 00:53:38,045
Johnny, every time we have our Zoom meeting.

600
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:41,588
I've only seen Johnny three times in three weeks.

601
00:53:42,228 --> 00:53:45,631
And I've met with my other students, you know, multiple times.

602
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:53,416
And so those were what we were trying to figure out who haven't we had any contact with at all, which is the 38.

603
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:53,656
And then

604
00:53:56,308 --> 00:54:12,702
who has made contact, but it's so inconsistent that the teachers are truly concerned that it's not consistent interaction, consistent engagement in instruction and learning.

605
00:54:13,302 --> 00:54:20,968
So that's where we have the two numbers, and we are working to provide additional supports.

606
00:54:21,408 --> 00:54:31,516
So we can't say for every family that it's connectivity, because there could be some families that it is connectivity, but we've been able to connect with them by telephone.

607
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:39,162
There are other students where they have access to internet, but we haven't been able to completely unpack

608
00:54:40,513 --> 00:54:46,495
why they are not fully engaged in our distance learning that's currently being offered.

609
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,335
I hope that helps.

610
00:54:48,935 --> 00:54:57,558
That does help, except I feel like the numbers here are implying that there are no general ed students, i.e.

611
00:54:57,598 --> 00:55:05,620
students that are not getting special ed services, students that are not Yale students, that every one of those other students is engaged.

612
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,240
No, so 228

613
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:22,689
of the students that are being closely monitored, we could classify that as general population on the first table.

614
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:38,203
Specifically under the special education umbrella, we have 58 students that fall under the special education umbrella that have not been actively engaged.

615
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:47,464
And under our EL umbrella, we have 64 students that have not been actively engaged.

616
00:55:47,924 --> 00:55:53,929
And so we're closely monitoring and looking at what's going on with all of those.

617
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:58,973
Those are kind of like the key categories that we're continuing to look at.

618
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:02,156
But I'm trying to understand, so is there 106

619
00:56:04,463 --> 00:56:12,011
other students that are not engaged, or is there 228 additional students not engaged, not including the special ed and the EL students?

620
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,011
106.

621
00:56:13,272 --> 00:56:17,476
Well, 228 minus the 58 and minus the 64 is 106 students.

622
00:56:17,497 --> 00:56:20,339
So is 228 the total population of students that we're considering not engaged right now?

623
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:32,963
In my calculation, I'm doing it as 350.

624
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:39,867
What makes up that number, are you asking Mr. Member Russo?

625
00:56:41,306 --> 00:56:41,747
350.

626
00:56:41,326 --> 00:56:41,747
Okay.

627
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:42,667
I'm sorry.

628
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:43,007
Yes.

629
00:56:43,448 --> 00:56:45,089
228 plus 58 plus 64 is 350.

630
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:45,750
Got it.

631
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:46,330
Okay.

632
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:48,372
No problem.

633
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:48,892
Problem.

634
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,213
I have a question.

635
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:53,435
And by school, by school, it shows you.

636
00:56:53,496 --> 00:57:00,021
So as you can see specifically, um, Dr. Cushing, if you're able to screen scroll up,

637
00:57:00,821 --> 00:57:01,682
It's on your screen.

638
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:20,697
By school, you can see specifically that some schools have made, you know, 98% contact with, you know, I'm just looking at the Roberts, for example, very high engagement.

639
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:24,420
The McGlynn Elementary, 99, 441 students of their 443 students

640
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,306
they have been able to make contact with.

641
00:57:35,847 --> 00:57:42,839
And there were approximately two students that they were trying to nail down at that particular school.

642
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:46,141
I have a question.

643
00:57:47,161 --> 00:57:47,842
Member Van de Kloot.

644
00:57:48,362 --> 00:57:59,364
Yeah, I was just curious whether we've been able to go yet to the next level and find out, say, with the 38 students, is that 22 families?

645
00:57:59,704 --> 00:58:00,985
Are there multiple siblings?

646
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:07,086
Have we been able to look at the students?

647
00:58:07,706 --> 00:58:11,427
I would think that would be the next step and say if it hasn't been done yet.

648
00:58:12,608 --> 00:58:28,857
That is the next level of work now that we were able to, you know, I originally thought prior to the survey being done, I actually thought it was going to be, you know, I didn't know if it was going to be six, 700 families that we weren't able to

649
00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:30,397
hear from.

650
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:33,519
So I was really, um, excited.

651
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:38,482
And even when I, you know, spoke with chief Buckley, he said, you know, what numbers are you thinking?

652
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:50,048
I said, I'm, I'm really not sure because, um, some students they might like, uh, at the secondary level, for example, they may like a particular class better than another class.

653
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:55,772
So they have more active participation in one class and their MIA in another.

654
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:10,804
So trying, waiting for all of that data to kind of be sorted out and by each school to finally say, okay, this is the total number of students that we have not been able to make contact with.

655
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:13,487
And these are the ones we're closely monitoring.

656
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:17,710
So that is next layer of work that we are definitely doing.

657
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:19,452
And, um,

658
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:22,375
just trying to nail that down.

659
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:30,661
But it's, again, where you're not able to just physically reach that person.

660
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:31,241
We tried.

661
00:59:31,942 --> 00:59:41,868
And all the administrators, assistant principals, calling, texting, emailing, we finally got down to these numbers that you're looking at right now.

662
00:59:42,669 --> 00:59:47,332
And our next level of work is exactly what you were saying.

663
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:50,515
I think it's very valuable information for us to have.

664
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:54,318
As I know, it must have been very time consuming to get it.

665
00:59:54,698 --> 00:59:58,041
But it really gives us a good picture about where we're standing.

666
00:59:58,701 --> 01:00:09,150
And it also reassures us as committee members of knowing that all of this outreach and touch has happened in a very clear way that we can see on these tables.

667
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:12,533
It really sums it up nicely for us.

668
01:00:12,593 --> 01:00:13,834
So I appreciate it very much.

669
01:00:15,336 --> 01:00:15,656
Thank you.

670
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:20,536
Member Graham.

671
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:25,879
So I think I understand the numbers, but I just want to make sure I understand.

672
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:43,051
So if you take the McGlynn Elementary School, if we think of the kids that are sort of on watch in some capacity, we have two kids that we haven't made contact with, zero that are closely monitored, zero special ed students not engaged and zero EL students.

673
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,434
So for a total, for that whole school, there are two children

674
01:00:47,696 --> 01:00:49,017
in a concerned status.

675
01:00:49,337 --> 01:00:50,518
Is that accurate?

676
01:00:50,878 --> 01:00:51,739
That is accurate.

677
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,742
And I was going to say, I believe, I don't know if Diane Guarino is still on.

678
01:00:55,922 --> 01:01:11,433
It's so, um, uh, there's so many people on, but, uh, if Diane Guarino is still on, I was gonna unmute her because when we had our meeting, she's unmuted.

679
01:01:12,428 --> 01:01:13,588
Okay, Diane Garino.

680
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:14,569
I'm still here.

681
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:15,389
Yes.

682
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:16,690
Can you speak?

683
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,191
I'm happy to say it's only one child that we haven't heard from.

684
01:01:20,211 --> 01:01:23,292
Uh, one of them, the mom calls me over the weekend.

685
01:01:23,672 --> 01:01:24,973
We have her on board.

686
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:26,553
She spoke to the teacher.

687
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:27,874
She's been doing her work.

688
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:29,234
So I am thrilled about that.

689
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:31,395
So it's only one shot at the McGlynn elementary.

690
01:01:31,435 --> 01:01:33,296
We have not heard from excellent.

691
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:33,636
Great.

692
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:39,518
And just so everyone else on the committee is aware, we have many of the principals, um, and assistant principals on the call right now.

693
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:43,008
so that they can also provide more detailed information.

694
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:55,435
The other thing too is, is I was speaking with the middle school principals today and they had mentioned that their numbers had changed over the weekend as they were able to make more contact and able to do outreach throughout the weekend.

695
01:01:56,255 --> 01:02:02,278
So I really do applaud the efforts of the principals to really, from the high school all the way down through

696
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:14,020
All of our principals have really done a great job reaching out, making sure the students have what they need, are doing mailings home as necessary for students who may have connectivity issues.

697
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:23,382
And teachers, principals, assistant principals are really going above and beyond in this crisis to make sure that kids have what they need.

698
01:02:24,202 --> 01:02:27,563
Yeah, and I have to say, I wasn't exactly sure

699
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,811
what the numbers would look like.

700
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:34,095
So this is wonderful.

701
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:41,681
I think one question I have as we continue to refine these, I'm assuming that you'll give us an updated report.

702
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:48,026
If that can also include like what is the definition of a student that requires close monitoring?

703
01:02:48,106 --> 01:02:53,170
So I'm assuming we're all sort of using that same definition in terms of like,

704
01:02:53,628 --> 01:02:58,050
what does it mean to be in the category of needing to be closely monitored?

705
01:02:58,491 --> 01:03:04,054
I would just wanna make sure that all of our schools are using the same criteria to come up with that number.

706
01:03:06,175 --> 01:03:10,437
So hopefully you can add that to the next time that you provide this report to us.

707
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:21,023
And then the other question that I had around technology access, access to the internet, and whether there's like a one-to-one device available at home,

708
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:33,528
is whether there is a place where we're capturing this data from a sustainability perspective in school brains or wherever we capture this kind of data.

709
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:44,653
So if we're hearing from a family that they lack internet access, that's something that I think we're going to need to know in a systemic way ongoing.

710
01:03:44,773 --> 01:03:49,495
So is there a place that we're capturing that information or is that the next phase of this?

711
01:03:51,064 --> 01:03:56,769
So some of the principals I know and teachers have been gathering specific information.

712
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:12,463
We can specifically gather that information to get a closer number since we're down to a fairly manageable number of students that we haven't made contact with yet at all.

713
01:04:13,424 --> 01:04:18,790
and or the number of students that we are monitoring based on the specific school.

714
01:04:19,952 --> 01:04:33,327
Where you were talking about what does the closely monitoring mean, that definition was generated through working with the administrators, because we've been meeting on a weekly basis for a couple of hours.

715
01:04:34,248 --> 01:04:44,879
And that basically meant the students who were being closely monitored, there was a tiny asterisk due to sporadic work production in all or some classes.

716
01:04:45,439 --> 01:04:49,743
So again, it was specific students that were flagged.

717
01:04:51,245 --> 01:05:07,276
For not being consistently present during instruction and it could be for different reasons You know, we've been told some people are working right now and the fact that Instruction is happening at certain times.

718
01:05:07,877 --> 01:05:19,425
So again, we don't know the specific financial situation of every family, but we will do a better job of Trying to gather more data regarding that

719
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:34,704
Yeah, and I think having a place for it to live systemically is super important as we think about what the next several months and years looks like throughout the sort of ebb and flow of this virus.

720
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:45,827
I don't think there's going to be less need for us to be really clear about how many students lack internet access, how many students lack a device, those kinds of things as we go forward.

721
01:05:46,707 --> 01:05:46,867
OK.

722
01:05:47,723 --> 01:05:50,724
And I, yes, we can definitely do that.

723
01:05:50,844 --> 01:05:54,624
We can definitely gather more specific data on that.

724
01:05:59,065 --> 01:05:59,865
Member Russo?

725
01:06:01,706 --> 01:06:02,086
Hello.

726
01:06:02,286 --> 01:06:07,167
Member McLaughlin, I'm sorry, Member McLaughlin's had her hand up for like five, 10 minutes.

727
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:10,427
Member McLaughlin, Member Kretz, then Member Russo is what I saw.

728
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:12,988
Thank you, Mayor.

729
01:06:14,396 --> 01:06:16,057
Thank you for this information.

730
01:06:16,157 --> 01:06:22,079
And to all the staff members out there who took their time making these phone calls and reaching out to families, thank you very much.

731
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:23,740
I know that's a lot of work.

732
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,422
I'm wondering about the closely monitored category as well for the next step.

733
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:39,987
So if I'm hearing you correctly, Superintendent, for the folks that have not had contact, you're going to work with Chief Buckley for the non-contact folks, right?

734
01:06:40,468 --> 01:06:53,418
And so for the roughly 350 who are being closely monitored, I'm thinking about sort of the mass tiered systems of support and just that model and wondering how or what the closely monitored categories are gonna be.

735
01:06:53,458 --> 01:07:07,488
How are you gonna work that out so that you're getting some progress in terms of what you're seeing or is there a plan in terms of the remote learning plan, what closely monitored means in terms of what happens next.

736
01:07:07,508 --> 01:07:09,550
So I get what it means in terms of the definition,

737
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:13,270
But I'm wondering what it means in terms of what are the next steps.

738
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:19,435
Yeah, so we definitely, you know, data is knowledge, data is important.

739
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:26,100
And this data really let us realize that we are reaching the majority of the district.

740
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,362
However, the 38 that we haven't

741
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,745
I guess maybe 37 right now on, um, you know, principal Garino's updated number.

742
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:44,671
And then I haven't even been able to include the middle school administrators updated numbers, but the 350, that is our next

743
01:07:47,733 --> 01:07:48,554
layer of work.

744
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:55,417
And again, because it clearly stated that it was sporadic performance to try to unpack that.

745
01:07:55,497 --> 01:08:05,382
But a critical member of this would also be the work that's happening right now with Stacey Shulman, because we do know that this is a very stressful time.

746
01:08:06,202 --> 01:08:13,086
And I personally have received emails from students that have shared that this is just very stressful.

747
01:08:13,146 --> 01:08:14,487
Some of our secondary students

748
01:08:15,848 --> 01:08:23,197
And so we are working on also meeting the social emotional needs of students.

749
01:08:23,597 --> 01:08:24,859
So in that number of 350,

750
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:30,634
they may have different needs.

751
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:35,277
And so we are definitely willing to meet their needs.

752
01:08:35,518 --> 01:08:50,630
So if it is a social emotional challenge, next time when we, you know, if we're not back in school on May 4th, where I don't think we will be back in school on May 4th, but if in fact they extend it,

753
01:08:51,410 --> 01:09:12,595
than to take this exact data, run the report again, see what the numbers look like, and even be able to say, of this number of 350 students, we are now providing social emotional type supports for 120 students.

754
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:19,977
And to be able to say that we are monitoring them, but this is what we're doing to address their needs.

755
01:09:20,497 --> 01:09:27,041
And for others, it could be 50 students, 60 students having inconsistent internet availability.

756
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:33,346
Um, it could be, unfortunately they could have some members at home that are currently sick.

757
01:09:34,026 --> 01:09:43,452
And, um, also, you know, because they're working with their health right now, that school work is not a priority and that their health is a priority.

758
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:49,056
So we are fully aware that there could be some, um, very understandable

759
01:09:49,556 --> 01:09:55,579
concrete reasons that we would need to make the necessary accommodations for those students.

760
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:58,460
And we are definitely willing to do that.

761
01:09:58,621 --> 01:10:13,868
But based on what the original ask of this specific report, we wanted to at least be able to present this is what Medford Public Schools numbers look like in real time as of Friday of last week.

762
01:10:14,645 --> 01:10:16,727
So we'll continue to do that.

763
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:17,327
Thank you.

764
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:17,887
That's great.

765
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:24,432
And just the data collection around that narrative piece, I'm assuming will happen in terms of the reaching out, right?

766
01:10:24,492 --> 01:10:44,247
So just, and not that you need to report necessarily that to me or the personal circumstances to school committee, but just that there's some narrative there so that there's some documentation that, you know, if for example, it's, you know, again, a student with, you know, depression, anxiety, you know, that these are being documented so that there's some,

767
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:46,107
reference would be really helpful.

768
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:48,111
And thank you for all you're doing, we appreciate it.

769
01:10:48,131 --> 01:10:50,656
Thank you.

770
01:10:50,676 --> 01:10:52,019
Thank you, Member Guilfoyle.

771
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:53,862
Before Member Kretz, I don't know, Ms.

772
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,067
Galluzzi, do you have something you want to add to that answer?

773
01:10:57,343 --> 01:11:04,189
If it's okay, I just wanted to speak on the elementary level, going with what the superintendent said.

774
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:18,162
Part of the closely monitoring is also that some students, in addition to the elements that the superintendent mentioned, also may, at least for my school, may be attending meetings consistently.

775
01:11:18,462 --> 01:11:21,023
but maybe not doing the work consistently.

776
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:26,366
So we're monitoring the academic piece, but the social emotional is definitely the first.

777
01:11:26,926 --> 01:11:45,915
And just to highlight on your multi-tiered system and to chime in about what the superintendent said, at the elementary level, Stacey Shulman has been working with her staff and they are doing and continuing with lunch bunches virtually so that those students are being targeted and getting the support that they need.

778
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:46,945
Thank you.

779
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:48,807
That's really great.

780
01:11:48,827 --> 01:12:01,415
And we also had the opportunity on a personal level, I want to share with my daughter who has a disability to participate as not a district student in our in-district school with some morning meetings, some community stuff.

781
01:12:01,435 --> 01:12:02,856
So we really appreciate that too.

782
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:03,296
Thank you.

783
01:12:03,697 --> 01:12:04,257
Yeah, you're welcome.

784
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:05,270
Thank you.

785
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:06,352
Member Kretz.

786
01:12:06,972 --> 01:12:07,152
Yes.

787
01:12:07,773 --> 01:12:10,015
Thank you very much for the report, Dr. Edward Vinson.

788
01:12:10,636 --> 01:12:13,799
I also want to just thank Dr. Peter Cushing.

789
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:26,813
I know I reached out to him a couple weeks ago, because while I'm working remotely from home, I was on the phone with a teacher in another district, and we were just talking about, oh, you know, how are you reaching your families?

790
01:12:27,413 --> 01:12:31,796
She had mentioned that in her town, that that's exactly what they did.

791
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:38,600
They had to, um, enter, you know, with the partnership of their police department, do wellness checks at their houses.

792
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,263
And, uh, they were able to reach the families and identify and get the information out to everybody.

793
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:45,564
So I think it's just great.

794
01:12:46,004 --> 01:12:52,208
And I want to thank the administration and the Medford police department for their partnership and his and their team.

795
01:12:52,228 --> 01:12:53,629
It's just, that's going to be terrific.

796
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,149
And I can't wait to hear back on that.

797
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:55,910
Um,

798
01:12:56,547 --> 01:13:13,060
I did want to ask about, so as part of the number of students not engaged in the Zoom meetings, I know I had brought this up in another meeting that I've heard from some parents that don't want their child, for whatever reason, to participate in the Zoom meeting.

799
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,162
So, you know, I think that

800
01:13:15,802 --> 01:13:20,485
I think that, you know, some parents just don't want their children to be on the zoom meetings.

801
01:13:20,865 --> 01:13:31,032
So I just want to make sure that, you know, you know, once again like that, the students, it's not going to be held against them in terms of their grade is pass or fail.

802
01:13:31,052 --> 01:13:35,114
I just want to reconfirm that information, because it sounds like

803
01:13:36,135 --> 01:13:43,100
That information is being factored into whether or not the students are engaged or needing to be closely monitored.

804
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,142
So if you could maybe explain that a little bit.

805
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:55,738
So in regards to that, if with the pass fail piece, and it is true, we gave some guidance about that.

806
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,939
There was bombing that was taking place.

807
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:16,627
If there are specific families for personal reasons, they don't believe in the remote learning, or they don't want the video coming into their homes, there are options where you can

808
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:19,293
turn the camera off.

809
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:35,051
That's one thing I would encourage the teachers and or administrators to speak with some of the parents to say, you know, you can still speak without, um, you know, showing your home, your, your private space.

810
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:35,912
Um,

811
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:45,100
And now that we're all getting accustomed to Zoom, you even have the opportunity to create your own backgrounds.

812
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:47,622
You can be at the beach, you can be in the mountains.

813
01:14:48,023 --> 01:14:52,286
So you can be creative and create your own backgrounds if you so choose.

814
01:14:52,847 --> 01:14:59,113
So there are options, but again, I think some people don't trust the security.

815
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:02,516
And I know here we are, we're hosting this meeting,

816
01:15:03,236 --> 01:15:07,457
And we have, you know, 50 participants who are on with us right now.

817
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:17,339
But, um, unfortunately, there are, you know, there's concerns about will other people be looking at my child or whatever the case may be.

818
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:27,801
We would be willing to work with those families to find a way to get, um, assignments to their child if it was, you know, for that type of a reason.

819
01:15:28,461 --> 01:15:31,782
But, um, if we're not able to, um,

820
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:34,580
make contact with the family.

821
01:15:35,761 --> 01:15:47,596
And Chief Buckley, you know, goes to the house and ends up saying like the person, you know, is no longer living in Medford, then they really shouldn't even be carried on our rolls any longer.

822
01:15:47,616 --> 01:15:50,079
But if someone is, um,

823
01:15:51,610 --> 01:16:02,401
You know, it appears that they're in Medford, they're fully functioning, and they've made a decision to not participate in any work.

824
01:16:03,482 --> 01:16:07,547
And even with the teachers making their best effort

825
01:16:07,907 --> 01:16:19,201
to call, to email, to communicate with them, then when it comes time to giving that grade, we would have to say we weren't able to have anything to show that work was done.

826
01:16:19,661 --> 01:16:21,904
So that would end up having to be a failed grade.

827
01:16:22,064 --> 01:16:27,250
If we were not able to come up with, you know,

828
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:55,905
a medical reason, severe anxiety, hospitalization, medical illness, if we really weren't able to come up with a reason, it would be very difficult to say that the student passed and then you have, you know, our student Cindy, who's doing all of her assignments and responding and the teachers have something to look at to say, well, this is, you know,

829
01:16:56,885 --> 01:17:00,927
they've completed at least half of the assignments or half of the activities.

830
01:17:01,988 --> 01:17:12,554
So that is something that as administrators, we're gonna continue to talk about, but we're not gonna be able to just make up a grade if there's nothing to show as evidence.

831
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:19,218
So I don't want to send out a message that if you choose to do nothing, you're gonna pass.

832
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:21,460
Because that is not the case.

833
01:17:21,781 --> 01:17:23,002
You have to do something.

834
01:17:23,022 --> 01:17:23,882
You have to produce.

835
01:17:24,283 --> 01:17:32,931
You have to be in contact if there's a legitimate disability or something that we have to take into consideration.

836
01:17:33,564 --> 01:17:38,425
then you would be working with special educators who would be able to speak to that.

837
01:17:38,885 --> 01:17:42,866
If there's a medical need, we have access to our medical professionals.

838
01:17:43,366 --> 01:17:49,628
If it's a behavioral, social, emotional need, we have access to Stacey Shulman's team.

839
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:52,548
We have access to our guidance counselors.

840
01:17:53,029 --> 01:18:02,831
So we have the entire district that essentially is all working together to meet the needs of every single student in Medford Public Schools.

841
01:18:03,631 --> 01:18:14,620
So if for whatever reason we're not able to say when this is all said and done, then we're not going to be able to say that the student has passed.

842
01:18:15,341 --> 01:18:25,409
So I hope I'm being crystal clear for everyone here in the listening audience that the expectation is that you are producing something.

843
01:18:25,629 --> 01:18:32,475
And if there's a greater need, we the district are willing and able to provide those additional supports

844
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:35,316
to scaffold those individuals.

845
01:18:35,856 --> 01:18:50,381
But of that number, 350, as we diligently unpack that number and get it to a smaller number of people, I will be able to give more data regarding that later on in the year.

846
01:18:52,785 --> 01:18:53,946
I just had a follow-up.

847
01:18:54,246 --> 01:18:57,487
So I just wanted to just get some clarification.

848
01:18:58,148 --> 01:19:08,532
I know when we first talked about the distant learning plan, it was mentioned and I recall Bernadette Riccidilli mentioning that Zoom wasn't required.

849
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:14,675
So I just wanted to know, are we now requiring the Zoom communication or

850
01:19:15,935 --> 01:19:31,583
If the family or student are doing the other work, but they're just not wanting to participate in the Zoom classroom meeting on the phone, and they're doing everything else, would that pass fail be held against them?

851
01:19:34,329 --> 01:19:39,611
Well, we were using the Google platform and the Google classroom platform goes directly to the teacher as well.

852
01:19:39,771 --> 01:19:39,972
Okay.

853
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:44,274
I spoke already about some families don't have the connectivity, so they can't do that.

854
01:19:44,714 --> 01:19:49,556
But through email and or through communication with the classroom's teachers,

855
01:19:50,056 --> 01:20:00,066
And the teachers are diligently monitoring, closely monitoring their student participation and their involvement as they're planning activities on a weekly basis.

856
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:07,174
So where I'm talking about students not getting credit would be that there's no contact, no communication.

857
01:20:07,694 --> 01:20:17,145
So the case you're talking about where students are producing work, they're in communication with the teacher somehow, then they would be given credit for that.

858
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:21,249
This is where there's radio silence and we find out that, you know,

859
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:30,693
From all appearances, it was just a decision to not be involved or not be held accountable.

860
01:20:31,634 --> 01:20:35,215
We know that we're not in a traditional academic environment right now.

861
01:20:35,855 --> 01:20:43,877
DESE has given us clear guidance to try to provide students with at least half a day of instruction and or work.

862
01:20:44,317 --> 01:20:45,018
for them to do.

863
01:20:45,639 --> 01:21:04,818
So based on all of the content areas that they have, the way the teachers are planning, and what's being available, being presented to the community, there are a lot of options that are available for people to be able to respond and participate in some form or fashion.

864
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:12,047
Also, I think it would be good to encourage those parents to reach out to their school principal.

865
01:21:12,527 --> 01:21:16,048
So hopefully those fears could be allayed.

866
01:21:16,128 --> 01:21:34,133
There are a lot of security features that I know that teachers and principals and others are putting into place to make sure that Zoom, which unfortunately is a superior product to Google Meet, which is within our Google suite for education, but that we could allay their fears and really work to make sure that

867
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:38,406
Um, their students aren't missing out on something potentially beneficial.

868
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:44,487
Um, but as the superintendent said, there are other opportunities, um, for students to get the work done.

869
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:58,190
I just would like the, the people that you're speaking with to know that they can reach out to their principals and, um, you know, hopefully be reinforced and encouraged that, um, this is working for many students at this time.

870
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:09,454
Thank you, Kathy you all set or I just had a final, I just wanted to I did ask earlier, when Mr deliver was speaking about his committee the whole report.

871
01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:27,865
Are there any families that are still waiting for a device, and will there be a third deployment I know right now, the schools are closed, but I was just, you know, didn't know if that was maybe if schools going to be out, possibly longer, and we have families that are waiting for a device, will there be another deployment.

872
01:22:28,165 --> 01:22:29,826
So we did two deployments.

873
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:34,767
Um, we have actually, uh, some principals have delivered devices to homes.

874
01:22:35,447 --> 01:22:50,992
Um, but we made the decision about two weeks ago now, uh, where the public health professionals, um, the governor and others were really in, uh, Dr. Burks on the president's team said now is not the time to be going to the grocery store.

875
01:22:52,090 --> 01:23:00,176
So we took that into consideration for the health safety and welfare of our school leaders and the people who were doing these things.

876
01:23:00,236 --> 01:23:14,705
And having offered two, we will definitely offer another pickup if the data shows from the health professionals that the limit, that the danger to our staff is limited.

877
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:22,965
and that we have the personal protective equipment required to make sure that that is a safe pickup for our staff.

878
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:24,666
Thank you.

879
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:25,507
Thank you very much.

880
01:23:25,607 --> 01:23:28,289
Thank you very much for the updates and communication.

881
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:29,430
And thank you.

882
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:33,272
And we have some MRC certified people.

883
01:23:33,352 --> 01:23:37,795
Anybody needs a Chromebook delivered, so let me know.

884
01:23:38,856 --> 01:23:42,939
Kathleen, I think, did you want to answer anything for Kathy and then member Russo?

885
01:23:45,497 --> 01:23:45,717
Yeah.

886
01:23:45,757 --> 01:24:00,828
So I just wanted to add that, um, at the Columbus, when we talked about engagement, it wasn't just at zoom meetings, but it was work being returned, whether it's via email or snail mail, because a lot of the teachers to some families sent out packets.

887
01:24:01,789 --> 01:24:11,956
Um, and what, when we haven't, when we've had the radio silence, what we're doing now is sending a letter that comes from me with the teacher's name on it through the U S post office.

888
01:24:12,735 --> 01:24:17,685
And I just heard back from a teacher that once that letter was received at home, we got like 16 pages of work.

889
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:18,507
Wow.

890
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:19,429
That's fantastic.

891
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:30,317
And I know one thing that is frustrating for the teachers is that they are doing consistent daily contact on those that we're really not hearing from.

892
01:24:30,437 --> 01:24:35,319
And many times, family's phone inbox is not receiving messages.

893
01:24:35,379 --> 01:24:35,839
It's full.

894
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:45,124
So that's just one more thing we have to keep in mind when we're talking about not having contact back from families is that we can't get through because their mailboxes are full.

895
01:24:45,144 --> 01:24:46,885
So I just wanted to share that piece as well.

896
01:24:47,845 --> 01:24:48,266
Thank you.

897
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:48,886
Member Russo.

898
01:24:51,565 --> 01:24:52,648
if you want to unmute yourself.

899
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:53,210
Oh, there you go.

900
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:53,731
I did it.

901
01:24:53,751 --> 01:24:54,613
Thank you very much.

902
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:59,065
After the last meeting we had, I had sent a few emails about

903
01:25:00,455 --> 01:25:13,539
getting some Wi-Fi hotspots purchased, whether through the school or the city, so that we could provide them to students that we've identified don't have Wi-Fi at home.

904
01:25:13,579 --> 01:25:26,022
I think that the ask that they get Wi-Fi, even if it's free for a few months, is really not very considerate of what it's like to actually be living on a shoestring.

905
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:31,038
So I was wondering if there's any progress on looking at purchasing some of those.

906
01:25:31,358 --> 01:25:37,742
I mean, I'm completely unaware whether the companies that provide them actually would be sold out or not.

907
01:25:37,822 --> 01:25:46,987
But, you know, we could purchase them, which includes the actual internet service, and then distribute them as needed, and then collect them at the end.

908
01:25:48,127 --> 01:25:51,809
Leasing would probably be better, because we doubtfully will need a lot of those.

909
01:25:55,178 --> 01:25:55,558
long term.

910
01:25:55,718 --> 01:25:57,219
Has anybody made any progress on that?

911
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:10,968
Superintendent, I don't know if you have my I know my office did call Verizon and Comcast and maybe I think one other provider, but I will circle back.

912
01:26:11,008 --> 01:26:13,809
I'm not sure where we're at with that.

913
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:16,171
I know we did try a boat a couple weeks ago.

914
01:26:16,646 --> 01:26:19,828
Yeah, and I will follow up with Ms.

915
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:22,050
Leighton, Molly Leighton.

916
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:28,995
And we had also, I was given some information about hotspots being put on school buses.

917
01:26:29,575 --> 01:26:34,298
There are a lot of different ways that different districts are doing it.

918
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:40,523
I think it was somewhere in Texas, but what they did do was they sent like school buses to

919
01:26:41,584 --> 01:26:50,845
Um, it could be like a housing area neighborhood and they would say the time of day that they would be there and they just had to

920
01:26:51,442 --> 01:26:54,985
encourage the kids not to closely go to the school bus.

921
01:26:55,265 --> 01:27:03,912
So we did start looking at some of the ways in which these mobile hotspots could be used.

922
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:07,474
So I will definitely follow up with her.

923
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:14,540
And also based on the additional data that we're trying to find out about the 350 that are inconsistently

924
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:24,144
Involved to find out of that it is a significant number of them.

925
01:27:24,524 --> 01:27:27,406
Um, is it because of connectivity concerns?

926
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:45,700
so, um, I think if we can get a a firm handle on what the number of uh members of our community That really need that additional support with connectivity um that will That will help us because again Sorry.

927
01:27:46,201 --> 01:27:46,321
Yeah

928
01:27:47,235 --> 01:27:50,277
It's also, it's really identifying where the students are.

929
01:27:51,218 --> 01:28:04,867
And so doing single hotspots versus something like the superintendent mentioned on a bus that could have a broader spectrum to reach more students might be a better bang for the limited dollars that we have.

930
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:09,810
So identifying where the students are, how we can best get a spread of internet.

931
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:13,853
And then I would say a third piece is really planning for the future in this.

932
01:28:14,924 --> 01:28:20,465
Because if a situation like this happens once, the possibility, God forbid, that it can happen again.

933
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:39,648
So what are we doing as a school district community, those types of things to really contingency plan for how we can, I guess the best way that I've heard it described as a Tennessee Valley project for internet, because it is such a vital part of everyday life.

934
01:28:39,788 --> 01:28:42,669
And how do we make that a reality for our students?

935
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:49,972
Member Graham.

936
01:28:49,992 --> 01:29:01,538
I have been thinking a lot about the same thing when it comes to what happens in the future and the need for contingency planning.

937
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:15,987
And I'd like to make a motion that the engagement communications and strategic planning subcommittee work with the administration to develop plan to have a series of community roundtables in the month of May.

938
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:27,654
The plan would include a strategy to use the roundtables to develop possible fall 2020 back to school scenarios amidst our ever-changing environment.

939
01:29:27,714 --> 01:29:32,638
The subcommittee would provide a full plan to the school committee at our next meeting on May 4th.

940
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:39,984
And the roundtables sort of in my vision would be something that would be executed as committee of the whole meetings.

941
01:29:40,184 --> 01:29:46,469
But I want to totally appreciate all the hard work the administration has done

942
01:29:48,079 --> 01:30:03,022
so far, and I'm very concerned about the administration continuing to sort of take on the load of all of this on their own, especially as we look forward to fall 2020 and what that could mean.

943
01:30:03,082 --> 01:30:05,603
And it could mean we're all back to school and we're just behind.

944
01:30:05,683 --> 01:30:07,803
It could mean something else completely.

945
01:30:07,824 --> 01:30:14,145
I think there's a bunch of scenarios there that we need to sort of vet out in collaboration between the administration

946
01:30:15,281 --> 01:30:18,043
our teachers and the community.

947
01:30:18,203 --> 01:30:21,105
So I'd like to make that motion and hopefully have a second.

948
01:30:22,446 --> 01:30:23,227
Member McLaughlin?

949
01:30:24,788 --> 01:30:42,981
Yes, I wanted to second the motion and also add that in the upcoming presentation, which is coming up next with co-chairs of the CPAC, Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lorik, it's one of the recommendations that they have as well, that there are round tables and to have some stakeholder engagement.

950
01:30:43,321 --> 01:30:44,242
So I second the motion.

951
01:30:45,578 --> 01:30:48,499
motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

952
01:30:48,519 --> 01:30:49,339
All those in favor?

953
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:50,040
Aye.

954
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,240
All those opposed?

955
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:52,580
Paper passes.

956
01:30:54,681 --> 01:30:58,722
And motion to accept the report by Dr. Edouard Vincent.

957
01:30:59,123 --> 01:31:00,763
All those in favor?

958
01:31:01,143 --> 01:31:02,144
I move to accept the report.

959
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:04,324
Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Rousseau.

960
01:31:04,344 --> 01:31:05,125
All those in favor?

961
01:31:05,145 --> 01:31:05,725
Aye.

962
01:31:06,265 --> 01:31:06,805
All those opposed?

963
01:31:06,845 --> 01:31:07,565
Paper passes.

964
01:31:07,786 --> 01:31:10,807
Number six, report on CPAC survey.

965
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:13,047
Tanya Sullivan, CPAC co-chair.

966
01:31:14,448 --> 01:31:14,928
Hi, everybody.

967
01:31:16,313 --> 01:31:16,793
Thank you.

968
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:26,364
And first I wanted to start out, we'd like to thank the administration and the school committee and the mayor for what they've all done to create the distance learning plan so far.

969
01:31:27,405 --> 01:31:36,775
Having to hit the ground running during all of this has been challenging to say the least and whether on the giving or receiving end of distance learning, we are all learning as we go.

970
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:46,785
With CPAC's mission, including the role of advising the district, we put out a survey to families and caregivers on what's working and what could use improvement with the distance learning plan.

971
01:31:47,505 --> 01:31:50,987
We will make the survey results and this PowerPoint available after the meeting.

972
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:58,990
The description of the survey, our survey was made available in April through all of the regular electronic venues.

973
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:09,275
It was devised to get families engaged in providing administration and CPAC with clarity on the special education needs and supports that were being received or not being received.

974
01:32:10,175 --> 01:32:22,201
Even though 10% is considered a valid response rate, we've received a 28% response rate despite being in a pandemic, which speaks to all stakeholders wishing to contribute to a more encompassing distance learning plan.

975
01:32:25,753 --> 01:32:41,216
Because the survey was only distributed electronically, CPAC feels that a more robust strategy, including translating the survey, providing hard copy mailings, and making public electronics available, such as through the library, would result in an even clearer big picture.

976
01:32:45,518 --> 01:33:02,524
Most significant challenges, the data from the survey showed families felt that the most significant challenges of the current school closure to be lack of structure, social emotional needs, regression of academic skills, lack of therapeutic support, and lack of behavioral support among others.

977
01:33:04,865 --> 01:33:12,108
There are a couple quotes and I will mention a couple quotes from from parents and caregivers throughout the presentation.

978
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:14,369
A couple quotes, one is

979
01:33:15,051 --> 01:33:17,573
Worried about regression of skills falling behind.

980
01:33:17,753 --> 01:33:18,774
I'm a terrible teacher.

981
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:21,696
That's from a parent actually saying that they're a terrible teacher.

982
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:27,161
Another quote was I'm concerned about regression academically and social emotional regression.

983
01:33:30,283 --> 01:33:31,344
Contact with teachers.

984
01:33:31,384 --> 01:33:34,527
The responses regarding contact with teachers vary considerably.

985
01:33:35,085 --> 01:33:57,025
Some were receiving contact each day while others may have received contact once a week The contact occurred through several platforms including email zoom and google classroom There has been some contact with therapists a couple of quotes from parents amazing communication and community established through blooms and google where the children upload videos of things they want to share and

986
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:06,325
Another quote was, only regular school assignments through Google Classroom, nothing personalized, no checking in, no support with time management and no instruction.

987
01:34:06,365 --> 01:34:07,565
My child is overwhelmed.

988
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:12,208
Computer access and remote learning.

989
01:34:12,788 --> 01:34:18,071
This being an electronic survey, it was expected that the questions on the computer access would come back high.

990
01:34:18,991 --> 01:34:25,535
Academic materials have been shared primarily online and there were definitely printed materials that were shared initially.

991
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:31,378
Another parent quote is currently I'm using our one family computer to do my work on.

992
01:34:31,719 --> 01:34:33,480
So it is limited for my child's use.

993
01:34:34,141 --> 01:34:36,564
And another quote, continuity of assignments.

994
01:34:36,684 --> 01:34:40,708
I had to sit with my son for each assignment because the work was in different locations.

995
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:47,055
Person realized Google classroom, read works, and he didn't know how to get to each assignment.

996
01:34:50,062 --> 01:35:00,245
Some of the general concerns, and I think everybody's probably already aware of these concerns, and I'm sure this spreads globally, not just in families of kids with special needs.

997
01:35:01,105 --> 01:35:19,390
In summary, the general concerns consisted of overwhelm, regression, IEP meetings, continuity of assignments platforms, communication from central administration, community and social opportunities, week-to-week lesson plans and guidance,

998
01:35:20,162 --> 01:35:26,829
inconsistency with amount of work, 504 implementation, and office hours for phone communication.

999
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:34,517
Another parent quote, it's really hard, overwhelmed, do not know where to start, don't have the time to do anything but survive.

1000
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,082
Another quote, we are all concerned about regressions in all areas.

1001
01:35:39,282 --> 01:35:42,025
And additionally, how will IEP meetings and assessments occur?

1002
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:48,251
The parent caregiver suggestions.

1003
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:53,155
So there were several suggestions and I'm just going to sum them up in this paragraph.

1004
01:35:53,175 --> 01:35:55,817
Parents and caregivers have requested the following suggestions.

1005
01:35:56,578 --> 01:36:12,690
One-on-one remote meetings with teachers and specialists, IEP team meetings and or check-ins with ETLs, social pragmatic group meetings online, options for touchscreen laptops if needed, virtual support groups for family members,

1006
01:36:13,639 --> 01:36:27,350
differentiated curriculum from Gen Ed and Exploratory, uniform standards of communication, video consult time, online interaction three times a week, videos on how to address behavior needs.

1007
01:36:30,913 --> 01:36:34,516
And the Medford CPAC recommendations.

1008
01:36:36,198 --> 01:36:41,042
While this is a lot of information, CPAC would like to summarize our recommendations for the district.

1009
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:46,902
We recommend a webinar be provided to train families in addressing IEP needs.

1010
01:36:47,823 --> 01:36:55,470
We recommend regular communication from central administration, whether that be through weekly video, weekly email, or weekly robocall as examples.

1011
01:36:56,652 --> 01:37:01,596
We would recommend virtual support groups for families in cooperation with CPAC through a school Zoom account.

1012
01:37:02,497 --> 01:37:04,920
We recommend phone calls from ETLs or teachers.

1013
01:37:06,002 --> 01:37:11,944
And we recommend providing regular feedback to administration from parents and caregivers to improve Medford's remote learning plan.

1014
01:37:13,444 --> 01:37:14,905
I'm happy to answer any questions.

1015
01:37:24,608 --> 01:37:24,988
Thank you.

1016
01:37:28,569 --> 01:37:29,029
Thank you.

1017
01:37:29,449 --> 01:37:29,609
Ms.

1018
01:37:29,649 --> 01:37:31,730
Bowen, did you have anything to add?

1019
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:32,870
I know you have been working hard.

1020
01:37:33,452 --> 01:37:35,273
Yes, I did have can you hear me?

1021
01:37:35,693 --> 01:37:35,893
Yes.

1022
01:37:36,373 --> 01:37:38,675
Okay, so I just I just wanted to add a couple of things.

1023
01:37:39,435 --> 01:37:43,097
Thank you, Tonya and for Alex for your presentation.

1024
01:37:43,117 --> 01:37:48,940
I did want to just ask a couple of questions of when this survey was taken the two weeks.

1025
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:51,041
It was it started March 29.

1026
01:37:51,581 --> 01:37:54,722
But I wasn't sure how long it extended for.

1027
01:37:54,743 --> 01:37:58,805
It went until the Saturday this past Saturday.

1028
01:37:58,825 --> 01:37:59,745
Okay.

1029
01:38:00,846 --> 01:38:01,606
Um, so

1030
01:38:02,426 --> 01:38:13,113
During the time that the survey was taken, the district was doing a lot of work in rolling out the implementation of the distance learning plan.

1031
01:38:14,074 --> 01:38:21,378
So I feel like a lot of these questions and concerns may have been answered or addressed with the distance learning plan.

1032
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:26,702
But I feel like there are still some other areas that we could discuss.

1033
01:38:27,062 --> 01:38:31,525
And I don't know if that's something you wanted to do now or do more of a round table.

1034
01:38:32,106 --> 01:38:40,492
but there were a couple of points that, you know, the regression, people are very concerned about regression.

1035
01:38:41,172 --> 01:38:49,418
We're feeling the same way, but this week the special education department is rolling out the remote learning plans.

1036
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:53,951
So these are individualized plans for each of our special education students.

1037
01:38:54,431 --> 01:38:56,992
We just received guidance from DESE.

1038
01:38:57,452 --> 01:39:09,656
We were provided a template that will be coming out to all of the special education families that'll have a specific who the contact people are, what your individual child's schedule looks like.

1039
01:39:10,296 --> 01:39:13,617
I know that's been a lot for families to manage that.

1040
01:39:14,108 --> 01:39:17,411
You know, my child's special ed reading teacher is meeting this day.

1041
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:18,953
We have a Zoom that day.

1042
01:39:19,193 --> 01:39:24,117
I'm trying to keep up with when the classes or Zoom meetings or Google Hangouts are happening.

1043
01:39:24,638 --> 01:39:32,485
So there'll be specific schedule that's outlined, what it's going to look like for each of your individual children.

1044
01:39:32,565 --> 01:39:38,711
So that will be rolled out and you will be hearing from your special education teachers

1045
01:39:39,244 --> 01:39:44,287
and evaluation team leaders from your respective buildings about what those individual plans will look like.

1046
01:39:44,668 --> 01:39:46,609
And then you can call and have questions.

1047
01:39:47,169 --> 01:39:50,672
And those are a work in progress.

1048
01:39:50,752 --> 01:39:52,413
So it's not set in stone.

1049
01:39:52,573 --> 01:40:02,559
We will look at what each individual child is doing and how we can better improve those remote learning plans as they roll out.

1050
01:40:02,659 --> 01:40:08,063
And as we continue to get updates on when we are going to return to school this year.

1051
01:40:10,874 --> 01:40:22,703
The IEP meetings, right now, through the guidance of Desi and our special education attorney, we are holding annual review meetings and transition meetings.

1052
01:40:23,264 --> 01:40:32,311
So those would be specific meetings for any students going from pre-K to kindergarten, fifth grade to sixth grade, and eighth grade to ninth grade.

1053
01:40:32,695 --> 01:40:36,677
Those are our priorities right now because those are big transitions for students.

1054
01:40:37,257 --> 01:40:46,942
And then once we do those meetings in the annuals, we'll work on all the other trying to fit in the other meetings and we will get further guidance from Desi regarding that.

1055
01:40:49,424 --> 01:40:54,727
We have heard a lot about increasing the telehealth services.

1056
01:40:54,847 --> 01:41:00,530
So we do have that waiver for our service providers that they are able to do that.

1057
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,961
based on an individual student's needs.

1058
01:41:04,441 --> 01:41:15,684
And we're hoping that you'll see with these remote learning plans that students are getting the one-to-one services or there's more ongoing communication with the teachers.

1059
01:41:16,004 --> 01:41:18,164
I think our teachers have really done a great job.

1060
01:41:18,985 --> 01:41:26,506
This is a whole new world that we're walking into, but I feel like they are really stepping up and communication is key.

1061
01:41:26,567 --> 01:41:28,387
So if you are struggling as a parent,

1062
01:41:28,922 --> 01:41:30,042
please reach out to us.

1063
01:41:30,143 --> 01:41:32,263
We want to make this work for you as well.

1064
01:41:32,704 --> 01:41:34,464
We don't want to overwhelm parents.

1065
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:36,885
A lot of us are working from home.

1066
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:39,887
We have the struggle with getting our own children to do their work.

1067
01:41:40,227 --> 01:41:43,168
So please reach out to us, reach out to me directly.

1068
01:41:43,988 --> 01:41:53,673
I've spoken to several other parents that are struggling and trying to coordinate with the other special education administrators to see how we could best meet everyone's needs.

1069
01:41:54,133 --> 01:41:57,014
So as we roll out the remote learning plans, I'm hoping that

1070
01:41:57,387 --> 01:42:07,313
This will alleviate a lot of the stress and make things more organized and manageable for the families in our community.

1071
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:09,774
So I didn't know if anyone had specific questions.

1072
01:42:11,155 --> 01:42:11,536
Melanie.

1073
01:42:14,998 --> 01:42:15,398
Thank you.

1074
01:42:16,206 --> 01:42:19,367
Thank you, Tonya and Alex, for the report.

1075
01:42:19,427 --> 01:42:21,407
Thank you, Joan, for the response.

1076
01:42:22,688 --> 01:42:30,730
So this will be made available on, what, the CPAC Facebook page and the district site, or both?

1077
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:31,110
Okay.

1078
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:41,633
And I think to what one of the conversations that was being had earlier that I thought was really interesting, particularly around, you know, getting back to that 350 number, Superintendent Edouard Vincent,

1079
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:52,806
and specifically the 58, if you will, student special education that have been closely monitored or need close monitoring.

1080
01:42:53,346 --> 01:43:00,709
There are, in some instances, I know that I've had families reaching out to me directly that are in the initial evaluation stage.

1081
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:10,214
So these are people who may have gotten neuropsychological evaluations back, feel like they really need a core evaluation for special education supports and services.

1082
01:43:11,754 --> 01:43:15,177
special education initial evaluations aren't happening right now.

1083
01:43:15,257 --> 01:43:16,478
Like that's DESE guidance right now.

1084
01:43:16,518 --> 01:43:17,379
It's not what's happening.

1085
01:43:17,799 --> 01:43:20,061
So we have these families that are in limbo, right?

1086
01:43:20,101 --> 01:43:22,523
There's this state of limbo and this state of feeling overwhelmed.

1087
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:26,867
And I think what I got from this survey more than anything was this real need to communicate.

1088
01:43:26,887 --> 01:43:36,416
And I appreciate what you were just saying, Joan, about how communication is really key and that with these being individualized, obviously education plans that every child has an individual need.

1089
01:43:36,436 --> 01:43:39,218
So they need to really, families really need to be able to communicate that.

1090
01:43:39,673 --> 01:43:44,814
with you and I get as varied phone calls from, I'm not getting enough work to, you know, we need more work.

1091
01:43:44,894 --> 01:43:47,974
I mean, it's like on both ends of the spectrum.

1092
01:43:48,014 --> 01:43:51,695
And so it's tricky to keep that information.

1093
01:43:51,735 --> 01:43:56,076
But again, getting back to what we were saying earlier with the superintendent about being able to document this.

1094
01:43:56,116 --> 01:44:00,397
And I know that special education is very documented so that this is being documented.

1095
01:44:00,917 --> 01:44:04,117
But I think that the report really gives us some quality data.

1096
01:44:04,297 --> 01:44:08,318
And to the point of you were saying, when was it taken in that two week or three week window?

1097
01:44:08,911 --> 01:44:18,117
I think that's also the point is that it could be run again, or it could be run translated, or it could be run in any manner that Alex has provided the survey itself.

1098
01:44:18,177 --> 01:44:24,361
And so the data can be rerun in any way that needs to be rerun, should you feel like you want more comprehensive data.

1099
01:44:24,421 --> 01:44:35,928
And I think to the folks that are on here that may not know, again, I'll just with a caveat that I was the co-chair of the CPAC prior to my time on school committee that the,

1100
01:44:37,432 --> 01:44:44,217
CPAC is a legal mandate that requires that there be advisory to the district.

1101
01:44:44,257 --> 01:44:48,500
So I really wanna encourage folks to use the CPAC for this advisory capacity.

1102
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:59,188
So when you're looking for a stakeholder group or a family engagement group or what have you, that's what Tanya and Alex and the rest of the folks that are around are able to do with these surveys.

1103
01:44:59,248 --> 01:45:02,850
And I wanna say, Alex, especially the nearly 30% response

1104
01:45:04,433 --> 01:45:09,196
for a survey during a pandemic, I think is really remarkable.

1105
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:14,840
And I want to thank you both for all your hard work and for all your support for our families out there.

1106
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:15,580
Thank you.

1107
01:45:17,462 --> 01:45:17,842
Thank you.

1108
01:45:17,982 --> 01:45:23,746
Member Graham, then Member Van de Kloot.

1109
01:45:24,166 --> 01:45:25,807
Thank you for the report.

1110
01:45:28,317 --> 01:45:31,358
It was a lot to digest, but I got through it.

1111
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:33,279
I did have one question though.

1112
01:45:33,299 --> 01:45:43,884
At the beginning of the report, it says there's 226 total responses, 102 complete responses, 61 partial responses, and 63 disqualified responses.

1113
01:45:44,484 --> 01:45:49,546
And I wondered if you could just clarify what a partial response means and what a disqualified response means.

1114
01:45:50,747 --> 01:45:52,308
Do you want to speak to that?

1115
01:45:53,303 --> 01:46:03,038
Yeah, so the survey had some questions, particularly multi-response questions, multiple choice questions.

1116
01:46:03,539 --> 01:46:04,741
Those were mandatory.

1117
01:46:05,122 --> 01:46:07,686
And then there were questions, we are asking for suggestions.

1118
01:46:08,556 --> 01:46:17,200
open-end questions and those were not mandatory because we felt that people might stop doing the survey if we create those breakpoints.

1119
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:28,906
So, this qualified response means that the survey was for parents who have children on IEP or 504 plans.

1120
01:46:29,586 --> 01:46:31,587
So, there was a question, does your child

1121
01:46:32,034 --> 01:46:33,795
has an IEP or 504 question.

1122
01:46:34,115 --> 01:46:36,655
If you would answer no, you would exit the survey.

1123
01:46:37,236 --> 01:46:39,236
So those were the end questions.

1124
01:46:39,696 --> 01:46:50,279
And then 102 completed responses mean that the parents went through every single question and they answered the open-end questions too.

1125
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:58,082
Whereas 62 partial responses, most likely parents only answered the multiple choice questions.

1126
01:46:59,002 --> 01:46:59,302
Got it.

1127
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:10,030
Thank you, and I think the other question that I had, I think I saw that you could answer the survey multiple times if you had multiple children.

1128
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:19,437
Do you have any sense of how many folks responded more than one time, or is the data not able to tell you that?

1129
01:47:20,257 --> 01:47:21,518
No, we don't have the ability to.

1130
01:47:21,598 --> 01:47:23,100
Okay, thank you.

1131
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:26,942
But I want to say that we followed, so we were considering

1132
01:47:28,349 --> 01:47:33,833
making one response per IEP address, kind of make sure that one response per family.

1133
01:47:34,153 --> 01:47:44,561
But we did follow the same model that Medford Public Schools did for their survey, the general access survey, and they allow people to answer for each child.

1134
01:47:46,262 --> 01:47:46,602
Thank you.

1135
01:47:46,642 --> 01:47:46,962
Thank you.

1136
01:47:47,062 --> 01:47:47,943
Member van de Kloot.

1137
01:47:49,153 --> 01:47:53,034
Yes, I just wanted to first, Tonya and Alex, I want to thank you very much.

1138
01:47:53,074 --> 01:47:56,075
I thought it was very, very interesting to read through all the responses.

1139
01:47:56,615 --> 01:47:59,696
And, you know, they kind of fell to me in two different categories.

1140
01:48:01,256 --> 01:48:05,378
One was the level that was heartbreaking when people just said, I'm struggling.

1141
01:48:06,178 --> 01:48:07,458
I'm having a really tough time.

1142
01:48:07,698 --> 01:48:10,079
And, you know, at one point, I just felt like

1143
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:11,360
tears coming to my eyes.

1144
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:14,821
I was sort of thinking of parents really in that situation.

1145
01:48:15,301 --> 01:48:25,646
But I also had a second feeling and that was there were many responses which really spoke to the dedication of our teachers and the positive interactions that had happened.

1146
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:32,530
And locally there's a child not far from where I live who

1147
01:48:33,715 --> 01:48:47,318
is in an out placement and I've spoken to his father and he has said so many wonderful things about the people who he interacts with for his special ed child.

1148
01:48:47,698 --> 01:48:53,860
And I really think that was brought home in the survey as well and want to thank our teachers for their dedication.

1149
01:48:57,223 --> 01:48:57,983
I agree, Paulette.

1150
01:48:58,044 --> 01:49:01,005
I think that the teachers have really gone above and beyond.

1151
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:03,607
You know, this is unprecedented.

1152
01:49:03,647 --> 01:49:05,368
We're all trying to navigate this together.

1153
01:49:05,468 --> 01:49:12,973
And, you know, we're gathering the information where people are struggling, but there is also a lot of really good feedback too.

1154
01:49:13,013 --> 01:49:17,215
So I just want to make sure that, you know, administration is aware of that.

1155
01:49:17,235 --> 01:49:21,838
The teachers, most teachers have really gone above and beyond.

1156
01:49:21,858 --> 01:49:24,059
So I just like to put that out there as well.

1157
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:24,840
Thank them.

1158
01:49:25,728 --> 01:49:31,874
And I want to jump in to say thank you for presenting the data.

1159
01:49:32,615 --> 01:49:36,719
Also in attendance this evening, we do have Ms.

1160
01:49:36,759 --> 01:49:37,599
Charlene Douglas.

1161
01:49:39,321 --> 01:49:46,948
And then later today, we have another report by Dr. Cushing about our efforts to try to communicate and reach families.

1162
01:49:47,769 --> 01:50:07,900
So as this survey was taken and there were new changes that are coming because we received greater guidance from DESE, I do feel that there's going to also be a shift in some of the feedback where there are areas for growth on the district side.

1163
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:14,544
But I just wanted to be able to recognize that in this unprecedented time,

1164
01:50:15,404 --> 01:50:28,676
You know people are definitely working in different ways in many of the conversations that we just had prior to the presentation of this report about consistency of contacting what's available or connecting with teachers

1165
01:50:30,476 --> 01:50:55,904
I think in this unprecedented time Medford Massachusetts in fact is being recognized on a national level and I know Charlene will concur with that that what we're doing in Massachusetts is probably like second in the nation right now in terms of distance learning plans and trying to meet the needs of families where it was something that was not

1166
01:50:58,105 --> 01:51:01,050
It wasn't something that we could have planned for in advance.

1167
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:05,378
So now that we have this new information and we're kind of

1168
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:24,292
you know, learning to ride the bicycle at the same time or learning how to, you know, build a plane and fly it at the same time, that we need to be able to continue to look at our challenges, but at the same time, say, you know, keep up the good work for what you're doing.

1169
01:51:24,332 --> 01:51:29,375
And I definitely applaud our teachers for all that they've been trying to do.

1170
01:51:29,435 --> 01:51:32,717
We know we've got more work to do ahead of us, but we will continue to work

1171
01:51:33,778 --> 01:51:34,998
collaboratively together.

1172
01:51:36,039 --> 01:51:40,660
The other question about this data and the report, everything is available.

1173
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,241
It's on our district website.

1174
01:51:43,721 --> 01:51:50,223
So the data and the slide deck is available under our school committee meeting for this evening.

1175
01:51:50,303 --> 01:51:52,783
So the community can access it right now.

1176
01:51:52,803 --> 01:51:57,044
Thank you so much.

1177
01:51:58,525 --> 01:51:58,725
Ms.

1178
01:51:58,745 --> 01:51:58,965
Bowen?

1179
01:51:59,423 --> 01:52:00,043
Yes, thank you.

1180
01:52:00,224 --> 01:52:14,113
Um, so Tanya and Alex, I was wondering if we could set up a time to schedule a time to go over the survey and what the district has put into place since this was taken and then we can, you know, sit down and meet and to discuss it.

1181
01:52:15,554 --> 01:52:17,115
Yeah, actually, I think that would be great.

1182
01:52:17,235 --> 01:52:23,560
And like you said, Joan, because this survey happened over a few weeks time and so much was

1183
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:32,797
Um, coming on board with the distance learning at that time, you know, I think that if we do another survey, um, I think that the numbers would be different.

1184
01:52:33,557 --> 01:52:41,841
Um, there might be, you know, newer concerns that, that we hadn't foreseen now that it's going into, you know, this many weeks, but yeah, most definitely.

1185
01:52:41,861 --> 01:52:42,641
Okay, great.

1186
01:52:42,801 --> 01:52:45,042
I can, I'll email you and we can coordinate.

1187
01:52:45,062 --> 01:52:45,862
That'd be great.

1188
01:52:45,922 --> 01:52:46,382
Thank you.

1189
01:52:46,402 --> 01:52:46,622
Great.

1190
01:52:46,702 --> 01:52:47,082
Thank you.

1191
01:52:47,463 --> 01:52:47,823
Thank you.

1192
01:52:47,843 --> 01:52:50,944
If there's no further questions, uh, member Russo.

1193
01:52:52,697 --> 01:52:53,618
Thank you so much.

1194
01:52:54,238 --> 01:53:03,104
It was, you know, reading the comments and, you know, it was 53 pages, so it was a lot, but it was, you know, highlighting the stuff that jumped out at me.

1195
01:53:03,144 --> 01:53:07,327
There was a couple of important perspectives that I thought I needed to

1196
01:53:08,377 --> 01:53:08,857
call out.

1197
01:53:09,638 --> 01:53:23,308
One was somebody actually had some – you know, I hadn't even considered that the pre-K staff would have really been included here as people doing – I don't really know how special ed works around pre-K, although I had it at my own home.

1198
01:53:24,769 --> 01:53:28,192
My husband dealt with that, so I sort of didn't understand it.

1199
01:53:28,332 --> 01:53:35,297
But the pre-K staff apparently is reaching out and doing stuff as well, which is fabulous and makes me really happy.

1200
01:53:37,777 --> 01:53:52,875
And there was one other perspective that I thought, you know, one of the comments was about working from, you know, 8 in the morning till 5 at night, and, you know, my own experience with a child with

1201
01:53:53,484 --> 01:54:05,762
with an IEP is that, you know, that was an early challenge we experienced where the 20 minutes of homework that came home was two and a half hours until we got on the same page with the teachers and the staff.

1202
01:54:06,964 --> 01:54:08,526
But I want to make sure that, you know,

1203
01:54:09,287 --> 01:54:18,914
there's at least some kind of a pushback, like nobody should be working that many hours, like no adult should even be working that many hours right now, let alone our students.

1204
01:54:19,194 --> 01:54:31,563
And I realized that the survey was anonymous, so we can't really reach right out to that person, but we need to make sure that we don't have any kids, any kids at General Ed or anybody else working.

1205
01:54:32,202 --> 01:54:35,243
eight or nine hour days in front of a laptop.

1206
01:54:35,283 --> 01:54:36,743
That's just not okay.

1207
01:54:37,143 --> 01:54:42,564
The emotional needs of all of us are too high for anybody to be putting that in.

1208
01:54:42,864 --> 01:54:45,605
And that kind of made me pretty upset.

1209
01:54:47,765 --> 01:54:51,086
And I had lots of other comments that were interesting, but I won't go on all night.

1210
01:54:51,506 --> 01:54:51,846
Thank you.

1211
01:54:54,547 --> 01:54:54,927
Thank you.

1212
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:59,648
Is there a motion to accept the committee report?

1213
01:55:00,088 --> 01:55:00,588
So moved.

1214
01:55:05,321 --> 01:55:06,722
seconded by member McLaughlin.

1215
01:55:07,943 --> 01:55:08,103
Ms.

1216
01:55:08,123 --> 01:55:09,424
Douglas did you have a comment?

1217
01:55:10,685 --> 01:55:27,317
I just wanted to add that I too had read the report and I want to thank Paulette and those acknowledging how hard teachers are working and there were many many positive comments within that report that teachers are reaching out to

1218
01:55:28,555 --> 01:55:34,697
the parents through emails, through Google Hangouts, through various methods.

1219
01:55:35,677 --> 01:55:43,719
It appeared from many of the comments that the teachers that were reaching out are reaching out two to three times a week, and so it was really positive.

1220
01:55:43,859 --> 01:55:48,481
I want to thank the CPAC group for doing that, for reaching out.

1221
01:55:48,981 --> 01:55:52,822
I do think everyone's working, but I also want everyone to take a deep breath.

1222
01:55:53,786 --> 01:56:12,753
and understand that, while, you know, we're with the students everything we have teachers to, we have teachers who are taking care of parents right now that are sick, they're in, you know, summary, there's one that's you know as many won't even go into the details, but I do want everyone to realize that so I think that as a community.

1223
01:56:13,373 --> 01:56:26,832
MedFed is working is light years ahead of some of the communities that I speak with some communities have just started remote learning last week and some is just starting this week, because they needed to negotiate this.

1224
01:56:28,258 --> 01:56:33,762
This union, this teachers, this group, the district, we've always prided ourselves on working together.

1225
01:56:34,142 --> 01:56:38,064
And through that, we are light years ahead of everyone else.

1226
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:47,290
And I just want to say that, and I want to thank, I want to reach out to Joan Bowen, who also, she and I have been talking, she's sharing, we're in constant communication.

1227
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:49,412
So I do want to thank you all for that.

1228
01:56:49,472 --> 01:56:54,635
Thank you, Paulette, for those wonderful comments, and member Roussel also, thank you.

1229
01:56:55,677 --> 01:56:56,098
Thank you.

1230
01:56:56,478 --> 01:57:00,805
Motion on the floor to accept the paper by Member Van de Kloet, seconded by Member Goughin.

1231
01:57:00,845 --> 01:57:01,646
All those in favor?

1232
01:57:02,868 --> 01:57:03,709
All those opposed?

1233
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:04,651
Paper passes.

1234
01:57:04,951 --> 01:57:10,941
On to number seven, which is report on MPS distance learning survey by Dr. Peter Cushing.

1235
01:57:13,328 --> 01:57:14,109
Good evening everyone.

1236
01:57:14,789 --> 01:57:18,912
So our survey started on March 27th.

1237
01:57:20,093 --> 01:57:34,403
We asked parents as we were in I believe the first two weeks at that time of our lead into the distance learning plan because the distance learning plan was not up and running at that point.

1238
01:57:34,443 --> 01:57:37,105
But this survey provided a tremendous amount of information.

1239
01:57:37,803 --> 01:57:42,899
for our staff and our teachers and everybody to really pull together that.

1240
01:57:45,478 --> 01:57:46,859
just move through these slides.

1241
01:57:47,139 --> 01:57:55,665
So the general overview, we were closed by the superintendent and the mayor, a little combination there due to COVID-19 starting March 13th.

1242
01:57:56,606 --> 01:57:59,007
Last day that students were in was March 12th.

1243
01:57:59,888 --> 01:58:04,831
We worked with the teachers union to have an initial contingency plan for learning.

1244
01:58:05,972 --> 01:58:09,014
Charlene Douglas and other members were there to assist with that.

1245
01:58:09,812 --> 01:58:13,115
It was a really great effort to really set forth.

1246
01:58:13,155 --> 01:58:17,899
The teachers came in on March 13th to start preparing two weeks of work.

1247
01:58:18,379 --> 01:58:19,420
I was really impressed.

1248
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:31,410
I was seeing a lot of high school teachers who had never used Google Classroom, who were jumping on board to really get up to speed as quickly as possible.

1249
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:32,811
And that was really impressive.

1250
01:58:34,017 --> 01:58:36,079
Chromebooks were distributed on two separate dates.

1251
01:58:36,119 --> 01:58:37,780
We talked about that earlier this meeting.

1252
01:58:38,621 --> 01:58:40,442
Teachers continue to mail packets home.

1253
01:58:40,462 --> 01:58:46,367
We also mentioned that this survey was done between March 27th and the last response was recorded on April 5th.

1254
01:58:46,907 --> 01:58:52,471
The survey itself was actually just closed on Thursday, but there were no responses recorded after April 5th.

1255
01:58:53,592 --> 01:58:54,933
So just some demographics.

1256
01:58:56,214 --> 01:58:59,697
So here you have the responses from the various schools.

1257
01:59:02,271 --> 01:59:06,292
And what's nice and what I think is really good is that we had responses from every single school.

1258
01:59:06,832 --> 01:59:08,552
So good cross section of the district.

1259
01:59:10,453 --> 01:59:10,793
Go ahead.

1260
01:59:10,813 --> 01:59:15,574
Okay, we had a total of 595 responses in total.

1261
01:59:16,754 --> 01:59:27,857
Parents were able to basically aggregate their children or they could fill it out multiple times depending on if they had a child at the high school, middle school, elementary, however they wanted.

1262
01:59:28,317 --> 01:59:29,397
Here's the grade breakdown.

1263
01:59:30,562 --> 01:59:33,744
for the grade that people's children were in when they were responding.

1264
01:59:35,525 --> 01:59:40,729
So social emotional, where one is low anxiety, five is high anxiety.

1265
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:47,594
We saw some students with some definite numbers in the three fours and fives.

1266
01:59:48,494 --> 01:59:58,361
That has definitely helped Stacy Shulman and others reach out and to do some outreach for families, as well as other staff members, including our principals and assistant principals.

1267
01:59:59,372 --> 02:00:15,083
But I would like to see us when we do another survey coming up here in another week or so, ask this question again and see where people are because as it goes on longer, we want to make sure that we're supporting our families as best as possible.

1268
02:00:15,984 --> 02:00:20,347
So communication, we asked three specific questions around communication.

1269
02:00:20,787 --> 02:00:23,549
How effective is the communication you receive from your

1270
02:00:25,684 --> 02:00:26,464
from your teachers.

1271
02:00:26,964 --> 02:00:32,607
And so we want a star rating here, one star, two stars, three, four, and five.

1272
02:00:32,627 --> 02:00:41,151
And the message clarity overwhelmingly came through as clear in the four and five range.

1273
02:00:41,252 --> 02:00:43,453
There was definitely some threes as well.

1274
02:00:44,333 --> 02:00:53,818
So we want to make sure that we're working with our staff to make sure that the purpose of the message, the overall effectiveness of the message, and how clear it is that people are understanding

1275
02:00:54,963 --> 02:00:59,606
in this asynchronous learning experience is definitely working.

1276
02:01:00,767 --> 02:01:05,831
School leaders, how effective is the communication you're receiving from your school?

1277
02:01:06,951 --> 02:01:14,136
Again, overall, the communication was receiving high marks from our school leaders.

1278
02:01:14,956 --> 02:01:18,059
And then we also asked a question around the district as well.

1279
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:23,262
So these data is there for you to see as well.

1280
02:01:25,522 --> 02:01:31,087
functionality, the functionality of distance learning is your child using Google Cloud Google Classroom.

1281
02:01:32,188 --> 02:01:45,039
So of the respondents, 58.3% said yes, no at all is about a quarter of the respondents, and some are and some not dependent on the teachers was 15%.

1282
02:01:45,079 --> 02:01:45,119
So

1283
02:01:48,845 --> 02:01:57,247
That is the district's preferred platform because it is the platform through which anything can be delivered to students.

1284
02:02:00,047 --> 02:02:03,168
On average, how much time is your child spending per day on academics?

1285
02:02:04,608 --> 02:02:12,010
I apologize, the color coding to the scale in Google Forms was different, but here's your numbers.

1286
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:15,290
More than three hours is 17.5 percent, two to three hours is 32.5 percent,

1287
02:02:18,683 --> 02:02:23,045
One to two hours is 37.6% and less than one hour is 12.3%.

1288
02:02:23,085 --> 02:02:31,368
This is another question I'd like to ask again to see how we would correlate with people moving forward.

1289
02:02:35,289 --> 02:02:37,450
What do you think has worked well with learning at home?

1290
02:02:38,713 --> 02:02:44,197
We had 60 responses of other, and I'm happy to put those together in a separate document.

1291
02:02:44,597 --> 02:02:46,398
I did not do that for this presentation.

1292
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:50,741
And I could definitely aggregate them into certain categories.

1293
02:02:51,882 --> 02:02:55,124
The teacher has held video conferences, video calls with the class.

1294
02:02:55,164 --> 02:02:56,104
That's about 300 responses or 50.8%.

1295
02:02:56,144 --> 02:02:57,245
Instructions are clear, again, 50%.

1296
02:03:01,553 --> 02:03:05,055
I know how to get support if I need it, 50%.

1297
02:03:05,275 --> 02:03:13,900
So those areas that I would definitely like to see us start to really pump out information to parents about getting support to make sure that they are.

1298
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,501
I'm using a district provided Chromebook or computer.

1299
02:03:16,941 --> 02:03:19,462
So that was 32 respondents for a total of 5.4%.

1300
02:03:23,571 --> 02:03:28,852
One of the biggest challenges you were facing with distance learning, I am still trying to work a full time job.

1301
02:03:29,332 --> 02:03:31,473
So that was the same as the previous 150.8%.

1302
02:03:31,613 --> 02:03:40,415
I will say this much having talked, having spoken to colleagues of my of mine, and living it with a one and a three year old.

1303
02:03:41,495 --> 02:03:42,715
This is an incredible challenge.

1304
02:03:43,075 --> 02:03:50,517
And so for any parents who are out there listening, I really feel what you're going through.

1305
02:03:53,987 --> 02:03:59,170
So, um, I just want to make sure that I'm still on with everybody.

1306
02:04:00,210 --> 02:04:04,553
Um, I need more and more computers to do all the work my family has.

1307
02:04:04,773 --> 02:04:06,074
So that's 6.2%.

1308
02:04:07,875 --> 02:04:09,776
I need help getting meals for my family.

1309
02:04:09,796 --> 02:04:12,477
Um, that was only four respondents.

1310
02:04:12,517 --> 02:04:14,098
So that's really a testament to the work.

1311
02:04:14,158 --> 02:04:20,902
I know a member of McLaughlin was really doing a lot, was there on the ground at the McGlynn helping out.

1312
02:04:21,429 --> 02:04:31,776
So out of 595 responses, the fact that there were only four, I think that's really a testament to what Medford is doing around food security.

1313
02:04:32,857 --> 02:04:35,879
I can't help my child with their work because I'm not familiar with the content.

1314
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:45,245
That's definitely something we want to pump out, maybe some more videos, Khan Academy, other supports, those types of things to really make sure that parents are feeling comfortable.

1315
02:04:46,325 --> 02:04:49,267
I'm struggling to support my child's special needs on my own.

1316
02:04:50,467 --> 02:04:59,612
I would say that goes to what the CPAC was just saying, that kind of heartbreaking aspect of where parents are with their child's special needs.

1317
02:05:01,052 --> 02:05:11,697
And then I would say this number was surprising, was 28.5% at this time during this survey listed that they were not having any challenges.

1318
02:05:13,614 --> 02:05:16,295
And then we had another 55 responses.

1319
02:05:17,595 --> 02:05:19,036
What do you think would be helpful for you?

1320
02:05:19,296 --> 02:05:22,097
Training for parents and caregivers around Google Classroom.

1321
02:05:23,418 --> 02:05:23,938
That was only 16%.

1322
02:05:26,199 --> 02:05:27,019
More communication.

1323
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:31,440
This was the one that I found interesting was we had more communication and less communication.

1324
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:35,702
So the number for more communication from teachers was definitely the overwhelming number.

1325
02:05:36,533 --> 02:05:39,896
But there were respondents who wanted less communication.

1326
02:05:40,176 --> 02:06:04,353
So I think it's finding that happy medium for certain parents and caregivers And then again more academic content and less academic content We can see 34% We're looking for more academic content and I think part of this goes to with the guidelines from the Commonwealth the guidelines from the Commonwealth right now have us in this review mode and You know, there's there's

1327
02:06:05,157 --> 02:06:10,780
I give our teachers credit because there's only so much you can do with a lot of review.

1328
02:06:12,141 --> 02:06:17,124
So I can understand where parents at this time we're looking at more academic content.

1329
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:27,451
Improved scheduling, I think that that has probably been addressed by the distance learning plan that Dr. Riccidelli worked with the union to pull together, not applicable.

1330
02:06:28,291 --> 02:06:31,313
Again, I was surprised that this number 17.7% and then another 49 different responses.

1331
02:06:36,824 --> 02:06:38,606
And I believe that is the last slide.

1332
02:06:40,388 --> 02:06:40,528
Yep.

1333
02:06:41,008 --> 02:06:41,769
Any questions?

1334
02:06:42,229 --> 02:06:43,430
Happy to answer any questions.

1335
02:06:44,371 --> 02:06:45,692
I can't see anybody yet.

1336
02:06:46,033 --> 02:06:46,313
Peter?

1337
02:06:46,733 --> 02:06:47,034
Mayor?

1338
02:06:47,894 --> 02:06:49,055
Yes, Member Van de Kloot.

1339
02:06:49,576 --> 02:06:51,498
Yes, I had a couple of questions.

1340
02:06:51,578 --> 02:06:57,083
First, could you please remind us, Peter, was this translated into a variety of languages?

1341
02:06:57,163 --> 02:07:01,787
And did we get any ones that were translated back?

1342
02:07:02,481 --> 02:07:05,982
So it was, and we're going to talk about the student opportunity act survey coming up next.

1343
02:07:06,602 --> 02:07:11,683
Um, what we did for this survey was it was all translated in line.

1344
02:07:12,203 --> 02:07:15,504
So it was not a separate survey for families.

1345
02:07:15,664 --> 02:07:22,685
It was one survey that we used Google translate to, um, translate the questions.

1346
02:07:22,845 --> 02:07:30,967
And, and we received one response, um, in Portuguese, uh, from, from what I recall.

1347
02:07:31,624 --> 02:07:39,391
Okay, my second question, or really just a comment, Peter, is on the slide where you ask about how much time.

1348
02:07:39,411 --> 02:07:47,217
That's a little misleading because you're, in terms of helpfulness, because it's K to 12.

1349
02:07:48,238 --> 02:07:53,962
And what my expectation might be for a high school student is very different than a kindergarten student.

1350
02:07:54,503 --> 02:08:03,270
So were we to do it again, if we could break it down at least into elementary, middle, and high school, for me, that would make more sense.

1351
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:08,754
But otherwise, I certainly appreciated the information and that you did this.

1352
02:08:11,102 --> 02:08:12,162
I'm writing that note down.

1353
02:08:12,322 --> 02:08:16,944
So if we, when we do something, cause I definitely foresee us doing something further.

1354
02:08:16,964 --> 02:08:26,627
You know, there've been some tweets and some articles published about where families are with distance learning at this time and the struggles that they're going through.

1355
02:08:27,547 --> 02:08:31,368
Nothing relating to Medford, but just the struggles that families are going through.

1356
02:08:31,608 --> 02:08:37,310
And we want to make sure that we're supporting them as best we can without being able to be right there with them.

1357
02:08:39,444 --> 02:08:54,710
The other thing which would be interesting, especially in the upper grades and perhaps middle school too, is at some point to ask kids how they're feeling and to return, you know, to see what kind of feedback we get from students.

1358
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:57,831
Okay.

1359
02:08:58,552 --> 02:08:59,092
Great idea.

1360
02:08:59,172 --> 02:09:00,933
Thank you, member van de Kloot.

1361
02:09:00,973 --> 02:09:01,793
Member McLaughlin.

1362
02:09:02,993 --> 02:09:06,015
Yes, thank you, Dr. Cushing for this survey.

1363
02:09:07,525 --> 02:09:13,827
I'm a definite data person and I love seeing the story that data tells and I think it's really important.

1364
02:09:14,407 --> 02:09:15,548
So I appreciate you sharing this.

1365
02:09:15,588 --> 02:09:16,908
I appreciate you running it again.

1366
02:09:16,928 --> 02:09:20,909
And I would also add to Ms.

1367
02:09:20,949 --> 02:09:31,973
Douglas' point around teachers who are working full time, who are also trying to teach their students and raise their families in their home while being quarantined.

1368
02:09:32,813 --> 02:09:34,714
I would also advocate for a question

1369
02:09:35,295 --> 02:09:40,977
or for teachers in the community as well that can share some of their struggle and experience, if you would.

1370
02:09:41,718 --> 02:09:42,898
But I think this is really great.

1371
02:09:42,998 --> 02:09:43,418
Thank you.

1372
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:51,001
Motion for approval to accept the report.

1373
02:09:51,822 --> 02:09:52,302
So moved.

1374
02:09:53,222 --> 02:09:53,522
Second.

1375
02:09:54,142 --> 02:09:56,844
Moved by member van de Kloot, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1376
02:09:56,864 --> 02:09:57,624
All those in favor?

1377
02:09:57,644 --> 02:09:58,444
Aye.

1378
02:09:59,184 --> 02:09:59,945
All those opposed?

1379
02:10:00,585 --> 02:10:01,385
Paper passes.

1380
02:10:02,386 --> 02:10:02,986
Number nine.

1381
02:10:03,918 --> 02:10:09,105
Oh, no, number eight, report on student opportunity SOA survey and application.

1382
02:10:09,205 --> 02:10:10,106
Dr. Peter Cushing.

1383
02:10:11,147 --> 02:10:12,169
Just give me one second.

1384
02:10:12,229 --> 02:10:14,672
I'm just switching between screens here.

1385
02:10:15,393 --> 02:10:15,613
Thank you.

1386
02:10:15,633 --> 02:10:16,454
Apologize for the delay.

1387
02:10:30,368 --> 02:10:37,450
All right, so back on March 9th, I came before the committee to report on the Student Opportunity Act.

1388
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:54,875
At that time, the Commonwealth had approved back in November, the Student Opportunity Act, which was designed to infuse much needed cash towards struggling school districts.

1389
02:10:54,895 --> 02:10:56,815
85% of the money was going to, I believe, 37 school districts.

1390
02:11:00,477 --> 02:11:10,721
And those school districts were deserving of those resources, just given the challenges that they face on a daily basis and to help close the achievement gaps.

1391
02:11:11,821 --> 02:11:13,882
Medford was receiving approximately $137,000-$138,000.

1392
02:11:13,902 --> 02:11:15,403
We're receiving the minimum based on $40 calculated per student.

1393
02:11:22,291 --> 02:11:32,760
Um, so, um, we are working on the short form, which you have in the, in the, uh, last two pages of the proposed survey.

1394
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:35,302
Uh, the survey was going to go out this past Saturday.

1395
02:11:35,322 --> 02:11:40,086
Uh, I had some home internet issues and was actually unable to get that done.

1396
02:11:40,106 --> 02:11:42,508
One of the pitfalls of working from home.

1397
02:11:43,549 --> 02:11:44,370
Um, so.

1398
02:11:45,709 --> 02:11:48,332
We have time if anyone wants to add a comment.

1399
02:11:48,572 --> 02:11:53,597
Now, this survey is going to be delivered as five separate surveys.

1400
02:11:54,578 --> 02:12:02,407
And so people will be able to say click for Haitian Creole, click for Portuguese, click for Arabic, click for Spanish, click for English.

1401
02:12:03,506 --> 02:12:08,507
I want to do it deliberately this way to see if we get better responses.

1402
02:12:08,527 --> 02:12:18,509
I wonder if the way we did the distance learning survey was confusing in the fact that it went in line.

1403
02:12:19,709 --> 02:12:24,870
So I just want to kind of experiment and see and provide the best options for families.

1404
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:28,431
So we were slated to receive that additional money.

1405
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:47,073
The Commonwealth reported, or it was reported during a conference call last week with the Massachusetts Association of Schools Superintendents, that right now, we've lost $5 billion in revenue for the Commonwealth.

1406
02:12:48,574 --> 02:12:58,702
And so there has been stated concern from the members of our Superintendents Association about the ability

1407
02:12:59,404 --> 02:13:04,167
for these funds to materialize.

1408
02:13:04,687 --> 02:13:07,489
That does not mean that we're not carrying through with the process.

1409
02:13:07,669 --> 02:13:09,110
That is definitely what we're doing.

1410
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:13,552
But the deadline has been pushed back.

1411
02:13:16,254 --> 02:13:20,796
And yes, that's where we are right now.

1412
02:13:20,916 --> 02:13:22,497
The survey is ready to launch.

1413
02:13:24,897 --> 02:13:30,003
but open to questions, suggestions, and other pieces as well.

1414
02:13:34,648 --> 02:13:35,209
Any questions?

1415
02:13:39,614 --> 02:13:40,174
Member Graham.

1416
02:13:41,196 --> 02:13:42,057
Just a quick comment.

1417
02:13:42,097 --> 02:13:45,020
This was another meeting that sort of

1418
02:13:45,453 --> 02:13:50,216
got held hostage to our school closure back in March.

1419
02:13:50,276 --> 02:13:52,717
So there were several meetings that need to be rescheduled.

1420
02:13:52,777 --> 02:14:00,261
And this meeting to refer this to the engagement and communications and strategic planning subcommittee is one of them.

1421
02:14:00,281 --> 02:14:10,066
And I will get something on the books shortly so that we can be prepared to look at the results once they come back.

1422
02:14:10,266 --> 02:14:11,587
So we'll find a time to do that.

1423
02:14:12,916 --> 02:14:13,896
Great, thank you very much.

1424
02:14:14,036 --> 02:14:15,557
Motion for approval.

1425
02:14:16,457 --> 02:14:17,118
Motion to approve.

1426
02:14:17,998 --> 02:14:20,219
By Member Graham, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1427
02:14:20,359 --> 02:14:21,179
All those in favor?

1428
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:21,719
Aye.

1429
02:14:21,739 --> 02:14:22,600
All those opposed?

1430
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:26,921
This will be referred to engagement subcommittee.

1431
02:14:27,462 --> 02:14:30,623
Number nine, report on senior class of 2020 events.

1432
02:14:31,443 --> 02:14:33,744
Mr. Paul DeLava and Dr. Peter Cushing.

1433
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:41,965
So I'll kick it off and then I'm really happy to have Nancy Donlan on the call as well with us.

1434
02:14:42,345 --> 02:14:44,166
She's one of the senior class advisors.

1435
02:14:45,227 --> 02:14:51,131
So there has been a lot of consternation by parents in the community and I think rightly so.

1436
02:14:52,352 --> 02:14:58,636
My niece is a senior in college and having gone to the same college that she's at, I know a lot of what she's losing right now.

1437
02:14:59,277 --> 02:15:03,760
And having been a high school principal and having been involved with

1438
02:15:05,298 --> 02:15:13,523
Students, since I was 22 years old, I feel awful for the members of the class of 2020 that are losing out on stuff.

1439
02:15:14,444 --> 02:15:29,712
As was stated in the letter that was sent out, I'm not saying things like, we're not saying, we as a group are not saying things like, we would like to do this, or we hope to do this, or no, we're saying we are committed.

1440
02:15:30,453 --> 02:15:33,314
An in-person graduation for the class of 2020

1441
02:15:35,183 --> 02:15:38,224
I think is what we owe our students after 13 years.

1442
02:15:39,525 --> 02:15:52,409
Doing everything that we can to reconsider prom and to think about what things we can do for our seniors, it's an obligation that we have.

1443
02:15:53,470 --> 02:16:04,554
And the call that I was on the other day with the headmaster, with Mr. Fallon, with Lisa, the principal of the Curtis Tufts, Nancy Donlan and others,

1444
02:16:05,312 --> 02:16:09,816
I just have to say that in talking to them, that commitment is there as well.

1445
02:16:10,156 --> 02:16:15,400
Our problem is, is we don't know what the timeline is.

1446
02:16:16,821 --> 02:16:30,032
We don't know if the timeline is going to be late June, if the timeline is going to be August, if the timeline is Columbus Day or Thanksgiving, or are we doing heaven forbid

1447
02:16:32,103 --> 02:16:38,008
the class of 2020 on Tuesday, next June and the class of 2021 on Wednesday.

1448
02:16:38,569 --> 02:16:40,170
Like we don't know.

1449
02:16:40,190 --> 02:16:41,051
All right.

1450
02:16:41,992 --> 02:16:55,043
And, but we are committed to doing it as soon as possible and as dedicated as possible to make sure that it is a phenomenal event or events, I should say.

1451
02:16:56,258 --> 02:16:58,899
And we're working behind them the scenes on a lot of stuff.

1452
02:16:59,199 --> 02:17:22,226
We we are I shouldn't say a lot of stuff We're working behind the scenes on some things So I want to turn it over to the headmaster who's done a lot of work and a lot of thought about this I've often said to people who bring this up to me I say on on March 12 one of the first conversations that Paul and I had was about graduation senior events and those types of things and

1453
02:17:25,075 --> 02:17:26,015
I'll turn it over to them now.

1454
02:17:28,736 --> 02:17:29,677
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1455
02:17:30,877 --> 02:17:34,819
I do want to recognize, again, what Dr. Cushing is saying.

1456
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:39,280
This has been a conversation that really did start at March 12th.

1457
02:17:40,501 --> 02:17:50,304
And I think the hard part for us is, like he said, we just don't know what time things are going to be updated.

1458
02:17:50,624 --> 02:17:51,705
If we go back May 4th,

1459
02:17:52,787 --> 02:17:58,168
We're going to have a different scenario than if we're not coming back this school year at all.

1460
02:18:00,229 --> 02:18:02,169
So we did have a lot of conversations.

1461
02:18:02,209 --> 02:18:05,770
I know there was some parents, I know there's parents that are currently on this call as well.

1462
02:18:07,470 --> 02:18:10,951
As Dr. Cushing said, we're reassuring that there is no cancellation.

1463
02:18:11,031 --> 02:18:12,971
I just want to make that very, very clear.

1464
02:18:13,711 --> 02:18:15,932
Sometimes misinformation gets out there.

1465
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:19,231
We're in a postponement kind of mode.

1466
02:18:19,431 --> 02:18:27,173
I think the two major events that we are focused, the culminating events for every senior is their senior prom as well as their graduation.

1467
02:18:27,193 --> 02:18:36,997
We do have our little things as well that we'll try to work in, but we're trying to focus in on how to kind of get those things in place for our seniors.

1468
02:18:39,838 --> 02:18:43,679
The thing that I most want to know is exactly

1469
02:18:44,810 --> 02:18:53,975
And I know it'd be another survey, but I do want to also hear from our students I know a lot of parents are advocating for their students as well But I want to hear from them as well.

1470
02:18:53,995 --> 02:18:55,936
I think isabelle is on this call as well.

1471
02:18:56,016 --> 02:19:11,003
She's our student rep um for the school committee and The idea is to also see what they would look like so if we find out that we're not coming back you know at the end of the year if again, we're all living in ifs

1472
02:19:12,023 --> 02:19:14,504
then what is it that the students would like?

1473
02:19:14,624 --> 02:19:16,184
With obviously the parent input.

1474
02:19:16,244 --> 02:19:27,748
That being said, the letter that was sent out on Thursday has a Zoom meeting for families on Wednesday, this Wednesday at five o'clock as well.

1475
02:19:27,828 --> 02:19:32,829
Because we want, I know all the parents are, really want to do whatever they can for their seniors.

1476
02:19:32,889 --> 02:19:35,610
And I totally understand that.

1477
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:38,231
My heart breaks for the class of 2020, as Dr. Cushion said.

1478
02:19:41,899 --> 02:19:47,844
I'm happy to answer any questions, but that's sort of where we're at at this point in time.

1479
02:19:49,485 --> 02:19:51,126
Member van de Kloet and member Russo?

1480
02:19:51,146 --> 02:19:56,310
Hold on, can I unmute you?

1481
02:19:57,208 --> 02:20:00,790
I had received several letters as well.

1482
02:20:00,830 --> 02:20:01,651
I think we all did.

1483
02:20:02,131 --> 02:20:08,214
And I think we all feel the same way, the same as Peter and Paul have just conveyed.

1484
02:20:09,015 --> 02:20:11,336
It's important that we will celebrate this class.

1485
02:20:11,436 --> 02:20:15,018
It'll be the most unique and different sort, perhaps.

1486
02:20:16,339 --> 02:20:21,462
There's things we don't know now, but certainly it's not if, it's really a question of when.

1487
02:20:23,023 --> 02:20:23,363
I agree.

1488
02:20:23,543 --> 02:20:23,883
Thank you.

1489
02:20:24,604 --> 02:20:25,144
Member Russo.

1490
02:20:26,073 --> 02:20:26,854
Thank you very much.

1491
02:20:26,874 --> 02:20:36,241
And I know there's been some conversations around funding things for various ways of recognizing our senior class.

1492
02:20:37,241 --> 02:20:52,233
If we are not going to be using the money for renting the Tufts facility, I really think it's important to repurpose those funds rather than relying on the community to make donations, because we don't know how long this is going to go on.

1493
02:20:53,814 --> 02:20:59,255
The community to make donations implies that that's a never-ending thing we can rely on.

1494
02:20:59,455 --> 02:21:02,996
The community may be called upon to make donations to feed each other.

1495
02:21:03,756 --> 02:21:10,017
And the school system cannot repurpose our $18,000 for graduation to feed the community.

1496
02:21:10,478 --> 02:21:21,620
So I think we should really look at repurposing the money we've already budgeted for the purposes of taking care of our seniors to do that, rather than relying on the community because it

1497
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:28,248
We don't know when this ends, and I don't want the community getting worn out early in our ability to give.

1498
02:21:28,269 --> 02:21:29,891
Thank you.

1499
02:21:31,272 --> 02:21:31,593
Thank you.

1500
02:21:31,653 --> 02:21:33,115
Member Kress and Member McLaughlin.

1501
02:21:36,670 --> 02:21:37,551
Okay, great.

1502
02:21:37,611 --> 02:21:37,971
Thank you.

1503
02:21:38,532 --> 02:21:39,994
Thank you very much for the report.

1504
02:21:40,434 --> 02:21:45,900
And yes, I was thrilled, you know, to read the report that, you know, we're committed to having this graduation.

1505
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:52,247
You know, I couldn't, you know, even it's just so important to recognize all their achievements.

1506
02:21:52,327 --> 02:21:55,670
And it's just such a big, you know, event for the seniors.

1507
02:21:56,571 --> 02:22:04,978
I was just thinking of some things that maybe we could do in the city, you know, to just, you know, recognize the class of 2020.

1508
02:22:05,879 --> 02:22:11,844
Maybe we could put like a message on the billboard on mystic out, you know, congratulations to the class of 2020.

1509
02:22:13,845 --> 02:22:40,293
or even the large movable message boards that kind of pop up with information, either the square or the various squares like West Medford Haynes Square, Medford Square, and just simple things, because I think it's all students, elementary students moving on to middle school, middle school students moving on to high school, and high school students moving on to

1510
02:22:40,933 --> 02:22:41,974
college or career.

1511
02:22:41,994 --> 02:22:47,217
So, because we usually have the moving on ceremonies for each of the schools as well.

1512
02:22:47,638 --> 02:22:55,944
So I was even thinking, you know, I know that Mayor Longo Kern had, you know, a scavenger hunt where the students put

1513
02:22:56,664 --> 02:23:10,291
pictures on their door and maybe everybody in the community could just, you know, put a message, you know, draw something and put it on their door and to just recognize the student, you know, all students who are graduating the class of 2020.

1514
02:23:10,751 --> 02:23:12,832
And it would just be a simple, you know,

1515
02:23:13,833 --> 02:23:18,797
you know, thing that they could do and just to show our support to the whole community.

1516
02:23:18,817 --> 02:23:22,501
You know, I was just thinking about that just today.

1517
02:23:22,881 --> 02:23:32,430
What could we do, something simple that doesn't cost a lot of money that we could all do to recognize everybody and just start spreading the cheer and, you know, the appreciation.

1518
02:23:33,287 --> 02:23:33,947
Thank you, Kathy.

1519
02:23:33,987 --> 02:23:41,411
And I know Dr. Cushing has some ideas that he's been throwing my way the last several days.

1520
02:23:42,451 --> 02:23:46,373
It's just hard because we want some of the, you know, I know he wants some of them to be a surprise.

1521
02:23:46,433 --> 02:23:55,958
So I'm sure he'll maybe give a call to the school committee individually this week and kind of let you know some fun ideas that he and a number of the, I know Ms.

1522
02:23:56,398 --> 02:23:57,899
DeLaver is involved too.

1523
02:23:57,979 --> 02:24:01,941
So a number of ideas that are out there that we can definitely work on.

1524
02:24:01,981 --> 02:24:02,341
And I think,

1525
02:24:02,802 --> 02:24:10,350
With regards to prom, just a comment for myself is it will tell a lot what the governor decides at the end of the week.

1526
02:24:10,450 --> 02:24:14,214
So maybe we can add that to our meeting in two weeks.

1527
02:24:14,394 --> 02:24:22,322
And hopefully, no matter what happens, we can get those graduates their in-hand diploma, whether it's this summer or in June.

1528
02:24:22,382 --> 02:24:23,543
We will get it done.

1529
02:24:24,104 --> 02:24:25,285
So member Rousseau.

1530
02:24:26,065 --> 02:24:26,425
Thank you.

1531
02:24:26,445 --> 02:24:29,106
I have a question from a member of the community.

1532
02:24:30,347 --> 02:24:36,350
Susan Brosnahan, 9 Laird Road asks, so what is the final day for seniors?

1533
02:24:38,411 --> 02:24:46,915
So I can, the only thing I can say at this point in time is we can't make that determination until we know what the if is.

1534
02:24:49,245 --> 02:24:52,527
I don't want to say that the date is delayed.

1535
02:24:52,547 --> 02:24:55,108
I don't want to say that the date is on time.

1536
02:24:55,329 --> 02:25:02,293
I just want to know, if we're going back May 4th, then there's no issue with the date.

1537
02:25:02,393 --> 02:25:09,737
If we're not going back May 4th, we obviously have to restructure some things so that that date could possibly happen.

1538
02:25:10,077 --> 02:25:12,199
And I'm not saying that that's right or wrong.

1539
02:25:12,239 --> 02:25:14,320
I know some parents have some feelings about that date.

1540
02:25:15,225 --> 02:25:23,148
But, you know, at the same time, we're in uncharted territory and waters, you know, feeling is what is the story with instruction?

1541
02:25:23,508 --> 02:25:29,850
As you heard in many different various reports, you know, instructions up and down at this point in time.

1542
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:31,210
There's some people feel that's too much.

1543
02:25:31,250 --> 02:25:32,711
There's some people that feel it's not enough.

1544
02:25:34,431 --> 02:25:42,514
So until we know what the if is, I don't think we can give a direct answer to that question right now.

1545
02:25:44,878 --> 02:25:45,238
Thank you.

1546
02:25:45,538 --> 02:25:48,560
Member McLaughlin, and then Member Van de Kloot, and then Member Russo.

1547
02:25:50,301 --> 02:25:50,781
Thank you.

1548
02:25:50,801 --> 02:25:55,423
I just wanted to say thank you to Dr. Cushing for all your hard work on this.

1549
02:25:55,443 --> 02:26:05,508
I have to say, Peter, from day one, I remember back in March, you were saying from day one that you were going to make sure that the students were celebrated, and I really appreciate your effort in that.

1550
02:26:05,608 --> 02:26:11,331
I also want to show a nod to the parents who are organizing around this.

1551
02:26:11,371 --> 02:26:12,552
The senior parents have really

1552
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:19,623
gotten organized and gotten together on Facebook and are really trying to figure out next steps and what they can do.

1553
02:26:19,703 --> 02:26:24,365
And this is a big milestone for the parents as well as the students.

1554
02:26:24,445 --> 02:26:28,366
And I think a lot of people are feeling anxious about this and worried.

1555
02:26:28,406 --> 02:26:36,830
And I'm wondering, Peter, if folks have ideas or if folks are interested in donating money or if there's anything like that, can people reach out to you with ideas?

1556
02:26:37,778 --> 02:26:39,039
They can definitely reach out to me.

1557
02:26:39,879 --> 02:26:49,364
Also, I put out a call for parents and students to send me, it was in the letter, to send me information concerning themselves, a picture.

1558
02:26:49,865 --> 02:27:01,271
Right now, I'm putting together kind of a Facebook skin so that we can start posting to the district's new Facebook page, which had a soft launch last week with the McGlynn parade.

1559
02:27:01,551 --> 02:27:03,312
The Roberts parade will be up there, but

1560
02:27:03,815 --> 02:27:09,537
Send it, you can send that information to info at medford.k12 and the rest of it.

1561
02:27:09,677 --> 02:27:11,638
And then you can also send me any ideas.

1562
02:27:11,818 --> 02:27:13,618
Please CC the headmaster as well.

1563
02:27:15,119 --> 02:27:17,000
You know, we do have some things in the works.

1564
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:21,741
The problem, going back to what member Kretz was saying, the problem is low cost.

1565
02:27:21,861 --> 02:27:25,823
It's when we try to do stuff that's unique for each kid, there's a multiplier.

1566
02:27:26,083 --> 02:27:29,104
I think the number is 303 in the senior class.

1567
02:27:29,564 --> 02:27:31,865
So if you want to do something that's say 10 bucks per kid,

1568
02:27:32,936 --> 02:27:34,537
you're already at $3,000.

1569
02:27:35,137 --> 02:27:39,279
Um, and so that's just the, the considerations that we're working with.

1570
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:43,442
But, um, some people had mentioned the banners, uh, around the town.

1571
02:27:43,622 --> 02:27:53,127
I don't know what the banners cost, but I know when you do 303 of them, that's where, you know, your, your eyes might start to pop a little.

1572
02:27:53,787 --> 02:27:56,408
Well, I think that, you know, yes, I think you're right.

1573
02:27:56,548 --> 02:27:59,230
And I think someone quoted some of the price around a hundred or more.

1574
02:27:59,310 --> 02:28:01,331
It was crazy, especially cause they're individual.

1575
02:28:02,099 --> 02:28:08,765
But I did see, just for example, in Winchester, I was in a walk yesterday and they have, you know, started up with the lawn signs.

1576
02:28:08,825 --> 02:28:15,491
And I know there are several people here who have campaigned recently and know printers and, you know, know what all costs are for things and what have you.

1577
02:28:15,511 --> 02:28:22,376
But even, you know, lawn signs for our seniors, letting them know how much we appreciate them and their families, I think is an idea.

1578
02:28:22,436 --> 02:28:24,818
But again, looking for, you know, donations or whatever.

1579
02:28:24,899 --> 02:28:28,321
And I know that member Rousseau said, you know, clearly not just,

1580
02:28:29,632 --> 02:28:32,435
community members donating, but other funds being allocated.

1581
02:28:32,495 --> 02:28:38,140
But I think we should offer the opportunity to community members as well in the event that they do want to donate.

1582
02:28:41,102 --> 02:28:43,244
Member Van de Kloot and Member Russo?

1583
02:28:43,644 --> 02:28:52,032
Yes, this is slightly off topic, but I haven't heard any updates about the advanced placement exams.

1584
02:28:52,913 --> 02:28:55,395
Have those exams at this point been canceled?

1585
02:28:56,095 --> 02:29:00,088
No, no, actually, they're doing take home.

1586
02:29:01,109 --> 02:29:17,252
Exams and we have some students that opted to get a refund from their exams but the idea is that again the College board has done it so that teachers are reviewing what was currently taught.

1587
02:29:17,392 --> 02:29:29,855
That's what their exam is going to be based on And again, and they're providing with a login screen and their law in and doing it at home I see Maureen Lavin's jumped on so she might have some more details as well

1588
02:29:32,024 --> 02:29:33,165
been on, I know that.

1589
02:29:33,185 --> 02:29:34,425
She just hopped on our page.

1590
02:29:35,286 --> 02:29:36,126
Member van de Kloot?

1591
02:29:37,747 --> 02:29:38,727
That was my question.

1592
02:29:39,227 --> 02:29:40,028
Okay, you're finished.

1593
02:29:40,168 --> 02:29:40,968
And member Rousseau?

1594
02:29:41,408 --> 02:29:42,368
I don't have a question, thank you.

1595
02:29:42,408 --> 02:29:42,488
Okay.

1596
02:29:44,389 --> 02:29:45,310
Member McLaughlin?

1597
02:29:47,831 --> 02:29:58,575
Just one more comment that we heard from guidance counselors, and I was wondering if this was accurate or something that could be shared, Mr. de Leyva, was that a lot of colleges are bypassing or waiving

1598
02:29:59,473 --> 02:30:01,255
SAT scores, is that accurate?

1599
02:30:01,515 --> 02:30:02,376
Yes, that is true.

1600
02:30:02,416 --> 02:30:04,098
That actually came out just recently.

1601
02:30:04,238 --> 02:30:12,065
So, you know, I can't speak to every college, but I know, like they said, everybody's dealing with this in its own way.

1602
02:30:12,145 --> 02:30:21,594
So, you know, this fact that colleges are doing remote learning themselves at this point in time, and, you know, there are some colleges that are thinking they're not even going to be back

1603
02:30:22,397 --> 02:30:23,637
in the fall right away.

1604
02:30:23,718 --> 02:30:27,059
So yeah, so they're trying to do some adjustments as best they can.

1605
02:30:27,099 --> 02:30:31,120
But yeah, SAT was something that most colleges were reconsidering.

1606
02:30:34,201 --> 02:30:34,441
Ms.

1607
02:30:34,501 --> 02:30:36,022
D'Souza, do you have anything to add?

1608
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:45,325
I was just gonna say that like a lot of students, like seniors ourselves, we've kind of gathered around to like celebrate other seniors.

1609
02:30:46,305 --> 02:30:54,851
I know of a group of people who started up an Instagram account, like where people can like send their memories of like high school that are then posted.

1610
02:30:55,432 --> 02:31:05,139
And then me and a couple of the other officers also started another one where seniors can like DM their, like wherever they're going to college, so that we can all kind of like celebrate together.

1611
02:31:05,579 --> 02:31:11,524
But a lot of us just feel a little confused because we don't really know where everything's heading.

1612
02:31:11,724 --> 02:31:17,368
Like Mr. DeLeva said, or somebody else said, this is uncharted territory.

1613
02:31:17,728 --> 02:31:19,990
It's uncharted territory for us too.

1614
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:27,055
So I feel like if we had a bit more communication between the seniors and administration, that would be helpful.

1615
02:31:28,777 --> 02:31:29,037
Thank you.

1616
02:31:29,647 --> 02:31:40,931
And to comment on what Isabella said with her page, the class of 2020 asked me to gather up my 1994 pick that I was able to post out.

1617
02:31:40,951 --> 02:31:45,072
I had a lot of hair back then so I was kind of excited to see that.

1618
02:31:47,418 --> 02:31:50,580
The senior class are doing little things indirectly.

1619
02:31:52,021 --> 02:32:10,670
There's a page called Medford Class 2020, and they're posting out all their memories, actually, like they're listing out 10 things, like remembering their first football game that they went to that night, stuff like that, which has been great to see them share those memories.

1620
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:13,271
And I'm thankful that they let me go on the page.

1621
02:32:16,955 --> 02:32:17,195
Ms.

1622
02:32:17,235 --> 02:32:18,856
Dunlap, did anybody else want to speak?

1623
02:32:20,556 --> 02:32:20,816
Okay.

1624
02:32:21,616 --> 02:32:21,837
Oh, Ms.

1625
02:32:21,857 --> 02:32:22,157
Dunlap.

1626
02:32:23,617 --> 02:32:34,760
I just want to say that one of the things that we shared with seniors one day last week was the senior gifts are in and I actually have one right here.

1627
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:37,241
They're a reusable water bottle.

1628
02:32:37,441 --> 02:32:38,601
I'm not sure you can see them.

1629
02:32:38,721 --> 02:32:39,141
Yeah, we can.

1630
02:32:39,602 --> 02:32:40,402
They're fabulous.

1631
02:32:40,722 --> 02:32:44,343
And so just showing

1632
02:32:44,957 --> 02:32:49,961
students that these came in, they were thrilled, as you could imagine.

1633
02:32:49,981 --> 02:32:58,949
It made it real that there were things that we had planned for months to celebrate seniors then.

1634
02:32:59,129 --> 02:33:07,676
And it was very calming for them to hear that we were committed to doing many, if not most, or all of those same things.

1635
02:33:07,757 --> 02:33:10,599
And I think that just communicating with them like we did

1636
02:33:11,212 --> 02:33:17,833
last week, the feedback that we got in our meeting today was very positive, very positive.

1637
02:33:17,973 --> 02:33:28,395
So I think that will go a long way to sort of taking away the great sadness that they feel that, how can this be what I've dreamed about?

1638
02:33:28,875 --> 02:33:36,156
And when they see that we're following through on them, we're really seeing a really great response from them.

1639
02:33:37,117 --> 02:33:38,117
Great, thank you so much.

1640
02:33:38,677 --> 02:33:39,337
Mr. DeLeva.

1641
02:33:39,987 --> 02:33:44,071
So I do have another with the senior class gifts.

1642
02:33:45,252 --> 02:33:55,022
Once we get the go ahead, I think if you're going to do the next Chromebook distribution, one thing that I have in my office are all the caps and gowns.

1643
02:33:56,204 --> 02:34:02,110
And so we would also like to try to do a day after we're able to distribute Chromebooks,

1644
02:34:03,625 --> 02:34:11,406
to actually do a cap and gown distribution as well for seniors to come up and, you know, obviously social distance themselves, like we've been doing with the Chromebooks.

1645
02:34:12,047 --> 02:34:16,447
And Mr. Blauck and I have been talking about how we could get those distributed.

1646
02:34:16,587 --> 02:34:30,210
We're obviously, again, in the if wait till everything is, you know, calm, but we do want to get our seniors there, at least their caps and gowns, so that whatever we end up doing, they have those in their hands.

1647
02:34:32,779 --> 02:34:33,780
Great, thank you so much.

1648
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:37,903
And we can continue that for two weeks when we should know more from the governor.

1649
02:34:38,544 --> 02:34:44,649
Is there a motion on the floor to accept the report on senior class 2020 events?

1650
02:34:45,950 --> 02:34:48,933
Member Russo, seconded by member Van de Kloot.

1651
02:34:49,293 --> 02:34:50,114
All those in favor?

1652
02:34:50,134 --> 02:34:50,874
Aye.

1653
02:34:51,395 --> 02:34:52,136
All those opposed?

1654
02:34:52,556 --> 02:34:53,537
Paper passes.

1655
02:34:54,778 --> 02:34:56,379
Number eight, old business.

1656
02:34:56,579 --> 02:34:57,460
Is there any old business?

1657
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:58,221
Member Russo?

1658
02:34:59,019 --> 02:35:03,681
Actually, one of the documents we had in our packets was the calendar.

1659
02:35:04,681 --> 02:35:07,622
And I think, I'm assuming there's just a typo.

1660
02:35:07,682 --> 02:35:13,604
It says that the highlighted dates it says are the school days, when I think it's actually those are the no school days.

1661
02:35:14,064 --> 02:35:18,005
So I don't know if we published this somewhere, but we want to correct that.

1662
02:35:18,806 --> 02:35:25,448
So that calendar that ended up adding, going into the folder was from Christine Patterson.

1663
02:35:26,137 --> 02:35:35,939
it was showing the calculation, at least the last version of what I had looked at, it was showing the calculation of days that the bus drivers were not driving.

1664
02:35:35,959 --> 02:35:40,380
And so that was part of her transportation report.

1665
02:35:43,021 --> 02:35:53,823
And then, so I don't know how it ended up back in there, but she had just wanted to highlight the amount of days that transportation wasn't taking place.

1666
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:56,140
Thank you.

1667
02:35:56,441 --> 02:35:58,081
Is there any other old business?

1668
02:35:58,702 --> 02:35:59,882
Hearing and seeing none.

1669
02:36:00,923 --> 02:36:02,024
Any communications?

1670
02:36:03,585 --> 02:36:04,785
Hearing and seeing none.

1671
02:36:05,866 --> 02:36:10,408
New business, we have five condolences.

1672
02:36:11,289 --> 02:36:11,989
Member Van de Kloet?

1673
02:36:12,550 --> 02:36:15,531
It would be appropriate to add one to the new business.

1674
02:36:16,712 --> 02:36:16,872
Okay.

1675
02:36:17,377 --> 02:36:17,817
If I may.

1676
02:36:18,157 --> 02:36:18,337
Yes.

1677
02:36:19,178 --> 02:36:31,681
I'd like to just mention, of course, that this is the sad, um, you know, today the Boston marathon was supposed to be run and I wanted to certainly remember, uh, Crystal Campbell, uh, this evening.

1678
02:36:32,142 --> 02:36:32,342
Yes.

1679
02:36:32,442 --> 02:36:33,322
Thank you for that.

1680
02:36:33,342 --> 02:36:42,965
And if you just read these school committee resolution, be it resolved that the Medford school committee expressed its sincere condolences to the family

1681
02:36:43,519 --> 02:36:44,339
of Raymond Quill.

1682
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:49,101
Mr. Quill was the father of cosmetology teacher, Julian Morrow.

1683
02:36:50,242 --> 02:36:56,604
Be it resolved, the Medford School Committee express sincere condolences to the family of Anne Glencross.

1684
02:36:57,144 --> 02:37:04,787
Anne served as a senior account clerk for 47 years at the Medford Public Schools, working in the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

1685
02:37:06,548 --> 02:37:11,470
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express sincere condolences to the family of Brian Frida,

1686
02:37:11,964 --> 02:37:15,648
Mr. Frida was the brother of Medford High School teacher Lisa Dunphy.

1687
02:37:17,710 --> 02:37:30,684
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Margaret Peggy Small, a former Medford Public School lunch staff person and mother of former HVAC teacher Robert Bobby Small.

1688
02:37:32,130 --> 02:37:37,573
and be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Grace Lauria.

1689
02:37:38,193 --> 02:37:44,317
Mrs. Lauria was the grandmother of Medford High School special education teacher, Sabrina Huther.

1690
02:37:45,537 --> 02:37:48,079
And if we all just may take a moment of silence.

1691
02:37:56,583 --> 02:37:56,903
Thank you.

1692
02:37:58,522 --> 02:37:59,243
Member van de Kloot.

1693
02:37:59,884 --> 02:38:15,864
I just wanted to let you know that on Wednesday, I went up to sign the bills, and I'm standing outside the high school down on the main road was a whole lot of our vocational teachers and other staff from us.

1694
02:38:16,585 --> 02:38:20,468
holding signs to honor Annie Glenn Cross.

1695
02:38:20,909 --> 02:38:31,537
And it was so, so touching and moving to see our teachers making this effort, knowing that it was such an unusual time, that it was different for the family.

1696
02:38:31,878 --> 02:38:39,324
And yet they had gathered together appropriately, social distance, but showing their love for Annie.

1697
02:38:40,585 --> 02:38:41,125
It's so nice.

1698
02:38:41,666 --> 02:38:43,127
Thank you for sharing.

1699
02:38:44,290 --> 02:38:47,952
Negotiation and legal matters, I don't believe we have any tonight.

1700
02:38:48,692 --> 02:38:59,758
Our next scheduled meeting will be at four o'clock, budget hearings, four to 5.30 in two weeks, which is May 4th, yes.

1701
02:39:00,098 --> 02:39:04,181
And we will have our regular scheduled school committee meeting directly after that at 5.30.

1702
02:39:04,421 --> 02:39:05,761
So motion to adjourn?

1703
02:39:06,382 --> 02:39:07,062
Motion to adjourn.

1704
02:39:09,633 --> 02:39:11,916
by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

1705
02:39:12,417 --> 02:39:12,818
Thank you.

1706
02:39:12,838 --> 02:39:13,499
Have a good night.

1707
02:39:13,559 --> 02:39:14,220
All those in favor?

1708
02:39:14,360 --> 02:39:15,041
All those opposed?

1709
02:39:15,622 --> 02:39:16,443
Thanks, everyone.

1710
02:39:16,603 --> 02:39:17,024
Bye.

1711
02:39:17,524 --> 02:39:17,925
Hang in there.

1712
02:39:17,945 --> 02:39:18,406
Stay healthy.
