href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=637.28s">We're</a>  very grateful to the Teamsters 25 and one of their partners who donated liquid hand sanitizer for all of our custodians, 375 milliliter bottles. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=651.207s">The</a>  hand sanitizer was made from a local distiller called MS Walker, which is a family owned business based in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=660.172s">they</a>  stopped their production of alcohol and changed their business over to making a very strong alcohol-based hand sanitizer that can be used with a spray bottle. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=672.196s">So</a>  we want to just extend a very special thank you to M.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=675.857s">Walker</a>  and Teamsters 25 for going the extra mile and having a community partner support Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=687.359s">Additionally,</a>  according to our director of

technical support during school closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=704.973s">So</a>  I'm going to encourage all families to please use tech support. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=710.077s">That's</a>  T-E-C-H-S-U-P-P-O-R-T. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=715.138s">techsupport</a>  at medford.k12.ma.us. <a

href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=730.154s">Additionally,</a>  while we're during this closure time, the college board has informed our guidance department that due to COVID-19, SATs will not be administered during the remainder of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=745.207s">So</a>  that is just an important update for all families. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=749.09s">SATs</a>  will not be administered. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=753.681s">At</a>  this time, I also want to just acknowledge one of our Mustangs who's doing an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=759.366s">And</a>  we want to just say thank you to all of our health care professionals during this COVID-19 crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=767.172s">Last</a>  Sunday in the Boston Globe, one of our own Mustangs, Ricky Cormio, a 2002 graduate, was featured as a paramedic on the front lines for Cataldo Ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=779.923s">Ricky</a>  is the son of vocational electrical teacher, Mr. Richard Cormier, and his wife, Teresa. <a

in our grocery stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=799.82s">And</a>  even at my own home, my husband is a medical professional at Boston Medical Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=804.982s">So</a>  I know the dedication it requires and the long hours it demands. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=809.823s">We</a>  salute them all and pray for their good health. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=814.584s">Last</a>  week on Tuesday, we had the opportunity to enjoy an uplifting parade that the McGlynn teachers and staff hosted for their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=824.448s">This</a>  parade was led by the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and special guests, including Elsa from Frozen and Marshall from Paw Patrol. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=836.576s">Principal</a>  Diane Garino, Assistant Principal Doreen Andrews, had a long line of cars filled with teachers, administrators, and well-wishers <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=846.963s">who</a>  participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=847.905s">There</a>  were balloons, streamers, and posters beeping and waving to our students and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=857.057s">assistant</a>  superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing, associate superintendent, Diane Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=862.782s">We</a>  also were part of the parade and it was a wonderful time for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=868.246s">We</a>  did get to see the mayor and her family joining in and cheering the teachers on, on our route during the parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=876.633s">And</a>  I want to just extend a special thanks to our coach, Jack Dempsey, who filmed the parade, which was shown later on NBC 10 Boston News. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=886.302s">It</a>  was a bright spot in this time of social distancing and I know that the Brooks and Columbus schools hopefully are planning to host their parades in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=898.412s">So</a>  I just want to thank everyone for their participation and for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=902.817s">Additionally,</a>  I would like to say that I want to thank Mayor Lungo-Koehn for lifting our spirits with her Medford Strong video, which featured Medford residents indicating who they are staying home for, school children. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=918.333s">Parents,</a>  teachers, and residents are pictured with decorated signs and posters reminding all of us why it is so important to hashtag stay home. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=929.983s">We</a>  are Mustang strong, and we will get through this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=935.788s">On</a>  the academic side, there continues to be conversations with our commissioner of education and listening to what's being said by our governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=946.745s">We</a>  are awaiting an official decision from Governor Baker as to when schools will be able to resume. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=956.593s">As</a>  it stands right now, the date is May 4th, but I'm told that we should be hearing an updated report from the governor sometime this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=967.4s">In</a>  addition to this extended closure, I just want to formally say that in light of the extended closure, the Commissioner of Education, the MCAS assessment has been officially canceled for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=981.144s">It</a>  will not be given. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=983.224s">And</a>  that is something that we were waiting to find out if they were going to do it at a later point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=990.546s">But</a>  again, based on this extended closure, the decision has been made to <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=998.536s">cancel</a>  the MCAS completely for the entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1003.718s">Yesterday</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1005.059s">I</a>  am not aware uh, if some of you had the opportunity on fox 25 there was a um, A presentation in our own school nurse columbus school nurse Miss karen roberto was featured as one of the nurses talking about um how she is supporting our board of health additionally our mayor was on as well as showing what medford was doing to keep our community safe and <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1032.31s">And</a>  so we do thank our nurses again for being part of the team and contributing to keeping our entire community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1042.754s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools, our administrators, teachers, business staff, paras, librarians, nurses, along with the mayor and the entire school committee, are approaching this pandemic in a unified manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1057.96s">So</a>  for those of you

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1223.145s">Ray.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1223.405s">I'm</a>  not sure, I don't believe Marian O'Connor is on, but I did speak to her today, and it's a lot of the same that Tony mentioned, 519 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1233.811s">She</a>  wanted to give a special thank you to the six or seven nurses working on the contact tracing within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1241.755s">That's</a>  what is giving us the ability to really try to slow this spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1246.357s">We</a>  also have the meals being served by a number of residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1251.71s">and</a>  members of the committee, as well as nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1254.753s">And</a>  I thank them also for making calls on our UOK program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1259.297s">11,000</a>  seniors have been called. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1265.383s">Many</a>  of them are getting deliveries on a weekly or biweekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1269.227s">And</a>  the second round of those calls will be starting on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1272.21s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1275.588s">Yes,</a>  I just wanted to say thank you, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, for doing the R U OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1279.391s">program.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1279.771s">We</a>  have members in our district that are volunteering. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1283.653s">I</a>  don't know why we're getting the echo. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1285.795s">We</a>  have members in our district, in our ward, that are doing a lot of volunteer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1289.417s">And</a>  I've done some of those calls as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1290.958s">And</a>  the constituents are just so happy and touched that this has happened, that this R U OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1298.743s">program</a>  is happening, and that people are calling out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1301.916s">Some</a>  of them, it's kind of funny, the younger ones are like, you know, are you putting me in the elder category, which is kind of funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1307.562s">But</a>  there was somebody who wanted it to be made clear that they said, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1313.395s">We</a>  needed to tell you that there's a special place in heaven for Mayor Lungo-Koehn for doing this, which I thought was really sweet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1319.138s">Reminded</a>  me of my Nana. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1321.159s">But</a>  it's a really great program and all of the volunteers in our community that are calling each other and just the neighborliness that it's creating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1327.803s">People</a>  are bringing things to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1329.704s">I</a>  have several folks who are delivering groceries on a regular basis, like on a weekly basis to people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1336.308s">And</a>  it's just really brought the community together in a way that's quite remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1340.03s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1341.333s">No,</a>  thank you for taking part in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1344.135s">I</a>  know that there was about 150 people, volunteers from the school committee, the city council, making those calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1352.361s">Now</a>  for the second round, we did take a little bit of time off so that we can make sure people are quarried. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1356.944s">And</a>  while we're on live, I'd like to just point out, if you're willing to make calls, please, all you need is a quarry check that's being run through my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1365.371s">And</a>  if you'd like to make deliveries, which we are gonna need some, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1368.822s">serious</a>  support there, because our few volunteers are getting a little overwhelmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1372.143s">You</a>  can be MRC certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1374.484s">I</a>  took the certification course myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1376.665s">It</a>  took about an hour, and now I'm certified to make deliveries of medication and food. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1381.746s">So</a>  if anybody in the community is willing to help out with that, we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1385.488s">This</a>  is going to stretch for some time, and we are in need of some extra volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1390.349s">So</a>  thank you for everything you all have done, and we'll continue doing what we have to do to make sure everybody's fed and medicated properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1398.52s">And</a>  of course, our administration and school committee taking care of our kids as best we can.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1402.721s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1403.381s">Yes,</a>  Member Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1404.682s">Yes,</a>  I just also wanted to add and echo Melanie's thoughts because I too made calls and I will say that the response was just so positive and I'm very appreciative for you to doing that, starting that program and all the things that you and our administration have been doing during this very difficult period. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1424.687s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1426.053s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1426.473s">It's</a>  the volunteers doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1428.714s">I</a>  delivered to 13 homes on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1431.214s">That's</a>  because my husband wasn't feeling well, but he's been doing it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1434.355s">Everybody's</a>  just pulling their weight and it's going a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1436.936s">So</a>  thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1439.256s">And</a>  I know Toni Wray also said, yeah, our hardest hit population is the elderly and our nursing homes are, you know, we're working very hard to get them help through DPH and Secretary Sutter's office between staffing and PPE and, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1455.47s">infection</a>  control, we're working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1458.352s">Marianne</a>  is on the phone all the time, really trying to get those nursing homes as much help as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1463.674s">So</a>  that's what she wanted me to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1466.736s">If</a>  anybody has any other questions, if not, we can move on to number three, report on negotiated transportation contract payment for remainder of the school year 2020, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1477.461s">Christine</a>  Patterson.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1481.486s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1482.667s">So</a>  I provided documentation showing a calculation what the different phases of a potential cost breakdown would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1493.712s">I</a>  can share that I've been on numerous calls with the Department of Education, and they have given direction to the 365 cities and towns to work with their local <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1509.135s">yellow</a>  bus companies to maintain a payment structure to have our bus drivers intact when we do go back to regular school schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1522.118s">So</a>  the Eastern Bus Company has a number of communities that they are working with, and I've been on subsequent conference calls with the groups as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1533.921s">And</a>  the <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1536.221s">estimates</a>  that we have come up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1538.303s">Medford</a>  is on a low end of a per diem rate because we are in year five of a finalized five-year contract, which also leaves us a little bit open to some insecurity for a bid for this current year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1559.24s">The</a>  bid is currently been pushed out to May due to the closure <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1565.591s">And</a>  so we're hoping to mitigate this, but what the collective group has been negotiating with the bus contractor is between most of the cities are at the 70 to 75% reimbursement of the daily to and from school bus runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1587.09s">So</a>  the projection that I provided you is the base rate contractually <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1593.775s">at</a>  70% of that cost factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1596.737s">So</a>  I did negotiate that directly with the owner of Eastern Bus and for the Medford community, that's what he was looking at for our contract currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1611.89s">I</a>  also provided a sample letter that is a separate letter <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1618.832s">memo</a>  of agreement because we do have a current contract and in order to pay on a different schedule, we would need a new pseudo contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1630.581s">And</a>  that has been vetted out through the resources of Brookline and their legal department through the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1639.087s">So</a>  we have all been working in partnership as local schools in terms of trying to identify <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1647.862s">a</a>  collaborative rate in order to maintain our bus drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1652.564s">And</a>  what we have been insured and what is part of the separate side contractual agreement is that the bus drivers would be maintained payment or their regular salaries or hourly wages, they would be on a regular bus run. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1670.833s">So</a>  they are not filed for unemployment at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1674.949s">and</a>  the continued partial payment would ensure that they would be accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1683.231s">And</a>  that's the hope, that they will be accessible when the closure ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1689.372s">So</a>  as reported, I have provided the information back for your consideration and hope that we can maintain this prorated <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1704.311s">cost</a>  measure in the same effort to maintain an extension of our school day, which is the school bus drivers.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1716.561s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1716.921s">Member</a>  van de Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1718.122s">Yes,</a>  I wanted to thank you, Kirsteen, for working this out and for giving us the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1725.028s">I</a>  assume we need to take a vote to accept the MOA?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1729.556s">that</a>  would be correct, yes.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1731.638s">I</a>  make a motion that we accept the MOA as negotiated by our business superintendent, Christine Patterson.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1741.244s">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1745.828s">Thank</a>  you for doing this, Christine. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1747.869s">One</a>  second, I have to open my comments about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1759.15s">One,</a>  two, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1760.93s">And</a>  the fourth whereas, there is an asterisk in front of the word payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1764.551s">Does</a>  that mean something or is that just an asterisk that got left in there?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1770.332s">I'm</a>  sorry, which document are you referring to?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1773.473s">I'm</a>  in the COVID-19 agreement schoolbustransportation.pdf. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1777.334s">I</a>  know, there's so many documents.</p>

    <p>[-Ad9b17iUII_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1780.915s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1785.5s">says,</a>  where is the Department of Development, DESE, and the Mass Department Division of Labor Services encourage districts to make asterisk payments?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1794.903s">Oh,</a>  I believe that's in reference to an established payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1800.164s">So</a>  where we haven't formalized it yet, it was just a placeholder.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1805.125s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1806.606s">And</a>  then my other question was, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1812.21s">Under</a>  section three, considerations G, my question was, and I don't necessarily think it's a huge deal, but is there any way for us to know that, sorry, my notes keep moving, that they have received any grants or loans, and whether or not they've had to be repaid or not, are we just gonna trust them, which I'm not saying that's not okay,</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1840.383s">So</a>  any of the federal or state grants will be public information, so we would have access to a listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1847.771s">And</a>  if they were recipients of a stimulus grant or loan, we would have knowledge of that.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1856.441s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1856.741s">And</a>  then my last question is, when <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1861.262s">I</a>  hate the word when right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1862.383s">I</a>  feel like the answer to when right now is the most ridiculous question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1865.404s">But</a>  when do you think we might know if we were going to be getting any revenues back? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1872.547s">Considering</a>  we may be looking at some rough times ahead, every little bit of potential revenue coming in might become very important.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1882.547s">revenue</a>  coming back, I'm sorry, from where?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1886.528s">For</a>  credits related to anything that they've received that's forgiven, any grants or loans that are forgiven.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1894.53s">So</a>  just given the timeline that we're on, I don't believe that they would be receiving federal grants or state grants until likely May or June. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1908.342s">So</a>  the form of a credit would be the next fiscal year that it would be counted towards.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1916.725s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1917.185s">And</a>  do you know, would that likely come to the schools or to the city?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1922.827s">If</a>  I may, I know the second stimulus package that the federal government is discussing and hopefully passing this week does not have anything for the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1932.991s">They're</a>  hoping to maybe take that up in the third, if there is a third stimulus bill.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1942.268s">I</a>  think, oh, and then just at the very end, obviously, it accidentally says Brookline instead of us at the very end of that document.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1950.24s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1953.892s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1954.152s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1954.732s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1955.013s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1955.313s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1955.973s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1956.373s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1957.033s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1957.814s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1958.254s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1958.694s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1959.154s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1959.915s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1960.255s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1960.635s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1961.335s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1962.016s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1962.316s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1962.696s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1962.916s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1963.236s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1963.896s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1964.156s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1964.657s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1965.117s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1965.477s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1965.797s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1966.738s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1967.238s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1967.838s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1968.939s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1969.299s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1969.639s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1970.019s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1970.439s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1971.039s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1971.3s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1971.56s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1971.82s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1972.08s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1972.64s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1973.1s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1974.161s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1975.241s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1975.641s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1975.982s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1976.402s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1977.222s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1977.482s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1977.862s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1978.563s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1978.943s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1979.583s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1980.023s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1980.484s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1980.944s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1984.53s">So</a>  the smaller trips and or if they had been for the prior service period, those are getting paid now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1993.672s">We're</a>  on a delayed cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=1996.372s">So</a>  you were likely seeing some that were directly from the service period of March, which we were still in session the first half of that timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2007.494s">So</a>  that is phase two of the discussions is working with the <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2014.18s">special</a>  ed transportation providers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2018.301s">Yes,</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2020.361s">So</a>  right now we haven't had that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2023.042s">No,</a>  no, we haven't.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2025.503s">The</a>  main issue that has been directed to us from the Department of Ed is to work out the large contracts, the yellow buses at this point in time, because that's the majority of what would be needed in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2045.843s">to</a>  provide the most service for the most population. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2050.386s">So</a>  they've encouraged us to do our yellow bus schedules first. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2054.608s">We</a>  are working with the other smaller bus companies as a subset, but we wanted to get this initial yellow bus side agreements completed and or approved and negotiated before we attempt the other categories.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2073.879s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2076.914s">Any</a>  other questions?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2079.735s">If</a>  I may ask a question, this will carry us through, Christine, if you could just give us the timeframe of when this will carry us through. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2086.236s">And</a>  I only ask because the governor has stated that he is gonna decide on school by the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2092.918s">So</a>  just by chance, he says we're not going back to school, would our position be different? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2100.199s">And</a>  what timeframe does this carry us through?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2103.856s">No,</a>  so this particular agreement would be the end of this school year or when we would be allowed to return, whichever comes first. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2114.686s">So</a>  it's strictly for the remainder of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2119.11s">And</a>  if the closure is lifted prior to June 15th, when our last day is, then the subsequent agreement would end as well.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2135.203s">And</a>  is this, if I may just follow up on that, is there, this what other school districts are following or are some school districts going through a certain timeframe and then figuring it out once the governor makes the decision?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2149.894s">So</a>  the school districts that I have been collaborating with that are all part of Eastern Bus are using the same format. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2158.06s">It</a>  was a template developed <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2161.752s">through</a>  the school department of Brookline and vetted through their legal department.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2168.154s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2172.775s">So</a>  we have a motion for approval by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2177.417s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2178.517s">I</a>  think it should be a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2180.418s">That</a>  roll call vote has been requested.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2212.379s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2213.38s">How</a>  are you tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2215.502s">Thumbs</a>  up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2216.062s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2217.103s">So</a>  Medford Public Schools has developed an online kindergarten registration system <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2222.59s">that</a>  has been up and running since April 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2226.873s">This</a>  process will enable all our prospective parents to register their children remotely. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2232.258s">I</a>  have provided you with a document that has been posted online. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2238.102s">And</a>  as you can see, the application requirements are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2242.145s">Maria</a>  Ibrahim, our Parent Information Center coordinator, will communicate with families if parents are missing information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2251.607s">Stephanie</a>  McCann, a nurse at Medford High School, will coordinate and check the various documents required for health registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2260.673s">Kim</a>  Miles, our data manager, will check school brains regularly to ensure the information provided is correct and will send notification of missing information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2273.381s">Emails</a>  will be pushed out to families if the application or health information is incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2280.123s">So</a>  prior to March 13, we had 147 kindergarten students registered in our four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2289.188s">And</a>  then we had a gap of about three weeks, but since we posted the online registration process, we have enrolled 41, and I believe it's even higher than that now, students, which brings us to a total of 188 students registered for Medford's kindergarten classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2308.935s">Last</a>  year at this time, we had 237 kindergarten registrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2315.08s">This</a>  year we're at 188. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2317.202s">So</a>  it's about a difference of 49 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2320.545s">We</a>  are certain that our number of registrations will increase during the spring and summer and the gap between last year's numbers and this year's numbers will diminish. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2332.094s">Our</a>  plan is to roll out the grades one through 12 registrations <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2338.435s">by</a>  May 4th, and then after that we need to do our MEEP classrooms, of which we have about 10, to get the applications and the lottery process started on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2350.538s">So</a>  I just want to send out a huge thank you to Toni Wray and her staff, Stephanie McCann, Maria Ibrahim, Kim Miles, who have been working tirelessly and collaboratively to register all of our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2364.621s">And</a>  in addition to that, we just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2368.461s">remind</a>  parents that just because they register on School Brains doesn't mean they're complete and they're finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2375.066s">So</a>  they need to check in with Maria or Kim or Stephanie to make sure everything has been passed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2383.032s">I'm</a>  happy to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2393.82s">Mayor,</a>  Member Ruseau, then Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2398.341s">I</a>  think I'm looking at the wrong report. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2399.922s">I</a>  don't have a question on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2400.842s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2401.242s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2401.943s">Number</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2404.164s">Hi,</a>  thanks for the report, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2405.224s">Caldwell.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2406.785s">I</a>  was just wondering if registration continues, if we're going back, obviously, these are big ifs, all ifs, would there be an opportunity, especially in the parent room where folks are checking in all the time on the regular, would there be some, you know how we're seeing a lot of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2425.576s">plexiglass</a>  that we're seeing at the grocery stores and some ways that we can continue the social distancing if needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2434.618s">Again,</a>  these are big Fs, but is there an opportunity for something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2438.48s">I</a>  know that we'll have, I'm sure that we'll have hand sanitizer, what have you in the setting, but it's a small room and a lot of people will be coming in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2447.662s">And</a>  I just wanted to make sure that there's some thought to that.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2452.177s">So</a>  I haven't given that any thought at all because I'm worried about opening up our schools too soon, even though, you know, it's a small area, you're still in the foyer of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2463.466s">And,</a>  you know, I am concerned about the people that would be working. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2466.589s">Maria</a>  would be there, Kim, maybe some translators. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2470.432s">So</a>  I would obviously check with John McLaughlin, the superintendent would have to weigh in and Toni Wray, our director of nurses.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2480.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2482.85s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2487.992s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2491.074s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2491.694s">I</a>  did find my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2493.535s">In</a>  the documents required, there's an early childhood survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2497.977s">Is</a>  that a survey that's like a standard or we write it right around the survey?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2502.659s">It's</a>  a standard survey that we send out to preschools and to our Catholic schools just to see <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2510.697s">that</a>  it helps us transition the children into kindergarten, but it's a standard survey.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2516.149s">Can</a>  we edit that survey if we want?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2519.087s">I</a>  mean, if you want to- I think it's a PDF form. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2521.068s">You</a>  mean, do you want to change some of the parts of it or?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2523.989s">Well,</a>  I wanted to see if we could add a question to it around whether a parent or older sibling has a diagnosis of dyslexia since 50% of kids who have a parent or child with a diagnosis of dyslexia absolutely will end up with that diagnosis themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2540.215s">And</a>  I just thought, as we address dyslexia in the fall, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2546.12s">you</a>  know, capacity might be an issue, but if we have a set of kids that we, you know, should we be prioritizing some kids that have this known diagnosis in their family ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2558.328s">It</a>  seems like the right time to ask them that question, but maybe there's another appropriate place too. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2563.09s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2564.551s">But</a>  let me check on that for you, Mr. Oso and I'll get back to you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2568.194s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2568.554s">I</a>  mean, if there's another spot that it belongs or there's a kindergarten, you know, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2573.157s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2574.918s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2575.865s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2576.225s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2578.327s">Thanks,</a>  Diane. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2579.668s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2580.629s">I</a>  am excited that we are offering online registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2586.073s">And</a>  I hope that it's our plan to do that regardless of whether our buildings are open or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2590.697s">Because</a>  I think there's a tremendous community of parents who getting to the Parent Information Center on a particular day or time is just not logistically feasible when you can do it <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2604.787s">at</a>  home. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2605.848s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we can find ways to streamline this even further as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2612.013s">But</a>  I also wondered now that we have this online registration like have we done pushes out to all the area preschools to sort of make everybody aware that we want them to register as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2630.695s">given,</a>  especially given that they may not, you know, if they have a first kindergarten child, they may not be following the blog, or even if they have other children, they may not be following the blog to know that they still need to be doing this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2644.346s">And</a>  the sooner, the better.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2646.748s">So</a>  I didn't make any formal pushes, not a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2649.73s">We</a>  did prior to March 12th to us leaving, we made pushes to our private schools, but it might be a great idea just to remind parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2660.125s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2661.045s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2661.266s">So</a>  I can do that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2662.506s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2662.966s">And</a>  then, um, I guess one other question and a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2667.409s">Um,</a>  the comment is that before the school closure, we had a subcommittee meeting scheduled to talk about the kindergarten, um, onboarding and registration process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2676.793s">And</a>  I'll circle back with you all on finding another date and time where we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2682.336s">Um,</a>  and particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2684.33s">wanting</a>  to make sure we get that meeting in before the end of the year so that all the institutional knowledge that Diane has in her head over her years of service can sort of be part of the conversation as we prepare to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2698.759s">And</a>  that will obviously, that meeting will continue next year, but I want to make sure we get that in this year for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2704.182s">So</a>  I'll reach out on the dates for that soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2708.465s">And</a>  then I think the other question I had was around, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2714.249s">kindergarten</a>  visiting day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2715.55s">And</a>  I know, um, especially if you are a first time parent to be able to sort of touch and feel what school is like is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2726.636s">And</a>  we may simply not have that option right now, but I was wondering what plan B is if we don't go back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2734.48s">And</a>  we still want to provide our families some virtual way to touch and feel what school is like. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2743.581s">and</a>  whether you guys have talked about that at all.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2745.982s">So</a>  we really haven't had any formal conversations about that, Jenny, but we certainly can do a virtual. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2752.325s">I</a>  know we can talk to the principals and they'd probably be happy to set up some kind of a Zoom or some kind of a meeting with all of their new students, the prospective kindergartners coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2763.511s">And</a>  I know throughout the summer, there's all kinds of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2767.513s">And</a>  at some point, this is going to, I hope lighten up or let up a little bit, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2772.65s">that</a>  the activities that happens in the various schools will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2776.753s">So</a>  there'll be play dates in the summer and some, you know, I know the Brooks has some food thing that they do with the kids as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2785.0s">So</a>  we will be able to do some activities during the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2789.423s">And</a>  in addition to that, do some virtual. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2792.806s">And</a>  so I just wanna speak to a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2794.847s">If</a>  I could say it's like a silver lining that we have this online kindergarten registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2800.295s">I've</a>  wanted to do this for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2802.196s">So</a>  I think this is filling a need for those parents who also work 12 hours a day and can't make it to the parent information center. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2810.339s">So</a>  I'm kind of happy that this is up and running and we'll be able to do it for the other grade levels as well.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2816.422s">Yeah,</a>  I think, you know, none of this is good, but there's a lot of ingenuity that comes out of really, really bad situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2825.126s">So</a>  I'm really glad that we were able to move in this direction.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2829.595s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2831.277s">I</a>  agree, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2833.179s">Is</a>  there a motion for approval of report number four? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2835.762s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2838.785s">By</a>  member Ruseau, seconded by member van de Kloet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2841.248s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2841.949s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2843.891s">Paper</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2845.172s">Number</a>  five, report on student engagement during school closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2849.176s">Dr.</a>  Maurice-Edouard Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2852.219s">Yes,</a>  and we're going to share just the first screen of data with you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2858.093s">In</a>  summation, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2863.488s">trying</a>  to contact, gather and curate all of this data, we have some good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2872.531s">And</a>  we have, I would say the good news is out of all of our students, we have not been able to make contact approximately with 38 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2885.2s">So</a>  although that's very good in terms of what we haven't been able to make contact with about students that are not as engaged, that we are closely monitoring, that number is larger, about 10 times that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2901.756s">So</a>  there are about 350 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2904.88s">that</a>  are being closely monitored. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2907.884s">Total,</a>  that includes our general population, our special education population, and our EL population. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2914.793s">And</a>  so teachers have been working truly collaboratively with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2920.961s">um</a>  talking to their uh direct administrators and so um as a result of having this number we've also i've been in contact with our own chief jack buckley who is um committed to helping us make contact <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2939.601s">with</a>  every single student. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2941.982s">And</a>  so those 38 students, we're going to put that information together to pass it on to see if we can have in partnership with our <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2955.876s">police</a>  department, for them to go and do a wellness check, to check on our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2962.1s">And</a>  the 350 students that are not as engaged as we would like them to be engaged, we are looking at... <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2971.525s">additional</a>  ways to support them, not excluding students that may be experiencing extreme anxiety or other needs around this extended school closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=2986.192s">So</a>  we know that although the number is 350 students, the teachers, the administrators, assistant principals, all are really working diligently on trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3001.265s">re-engage</a>  the students that, for different reasons, are not as involved in the instruction that's being given to them at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3010.711s">So</a>  as you can see, this report shows all of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3017.115s">And</a>  the first table shows the data district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3024.72s">I</a>  want to be able to thank Dr. Cushing for, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3030.443s">sending</a>  out a survey to all of our administrators that they filled that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3036.766s">And</a>  also I'd like to acknowledge Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3039.268s">Kim</a>  Miles, our data manager, who took all of that data and produced these tables for us by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3049.633s">So</a>  that's the information that I have in a nutshell, and I'm open to any questions, if there are any. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3059.272s">Yes,</a>  member Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3061.534s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3062.875s">I'm</a>  very happy to see this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3065.397s">It's</a>  so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3067.619s">I</a>  guess my question was, what does engaged mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3072.062s">When</a>  I first read the report, I was completely confused how we could have more students not engaged than not contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3080.429s">I</a>  think engagement means something very different than contact.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3084.864s">Yes,</a>  so when we were trying to get the information, our first priority was to make contact with every single student. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3095.01s">Like,</a>  has a teacher, whether it's been by phone or by Zoom, by Google Classroom, have teachers been able to make contact with every single student? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3106.593s">so</a>  that we know that they are okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3109.296s">And</a>  so the first ask was, have you, since school closed, since the 13th of March, have you been able to make contact with students? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3118.664s">So</a>  out of the entire population, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3122.218s">38</a>  students, for one reason or another, we have not been able to make any contact with them by phone, by email, by Zoom, by Google Classroom, by some type of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3136.186s">And</a>  so those 38 students are going to be the first set of students that we are going to be working collaboratively <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3145.211s">with</a>  Chief Buckley to have him go and check on those families just to ensure, are they still living in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3154.755s">We</a>  could have some students that it's a transient population. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3158.676s">Based</a>  on the survey data that was collected, one of the schools said they believed a student relocated to another state. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3167.98s">And</a>  they were still diligently trying to see if they could confirm that the child has relocated to another state and is no longer a student in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3179.665s">But</a>  at this point in time, the child is still showing as a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3185.307s">The</a>  second number, where it's approximately 350 students, that number of students where they may have <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3196.621s">joined</a>  one or two Zoom classroom sessions, but their participation, remote participation, has been very inconsistent to the point where the classroom teachers are concerned that, wait a minute, I'm not seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3215.223s">Johnny,</a>  every time we have our Zoom meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3218.105s">I've</a>  only seen Johnny three times in three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3222.228s">And</a>  I've met with my other students, you know, multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3226.371s">And</a>  so those were what we were trying to figure out who haven't we had any contact with at all, which is the 38. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3233.456s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3236.308s">who</a>  has made contact, but it's so inconsistent that the teachers are truly concerned that it's not consistent interaction, consistent engagement in instruction and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3253.302s">So</a>  that's where we have the two numbers, and we are working to provide additional supports. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3261.408s">So</a>  we can't say for every family that it's connectivity, because there could be some families that it is connectivity, but we've been able to connect with them by telephone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3272.437s">There</a>  are other students where they have access to internet, but we haven't been able to completely unpack <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3280.513s">why</a>  they are not fully engaged in our distance learning that's currently being offered.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3287.575s">I</a>  hope that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3288.935s">That</a>  does help, except I feel like the numbers here are implying that there are no general ed students, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3297.598s">students</a>  that are not getting special ed services, students that are not Yale students, that every one of those other students is engaged.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3305.94s">No,</a>  so 228 <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3310.819s">of</a>  the students that are being closely monitored, we could classify that as general population on the first table. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3323.55s">Specifically</a>  under the special education umbrella, we have 58 students that fall under the special education umbrella that have not been actively engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3338.877s">And</a>  under our EL umbrella, we have 64 students that have not been actively engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3347.924s">And</a>  so we're closely monitoring and looking at what's going on with all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3353.949s">Those</a>  are kind of like the key categories that we're continuing to look at.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3359.774s">But</a>  I'm trying to understand, so is there 106 <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3364.463s">other</a>  students that are not engaged, or is there 228 additional students not engaged, not including the special ed and the EL students?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3373.272s">Well,</a>  228 minus the 58 and minus the 64 is 106 students.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3377.497s">So</a>  is 228 the total population of students that we're considering not engaged right now?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3390.681s">In</a>  my calculation, I'm doing it as 350.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3393.043s">What</a>  makes up that number, are you asking Mr. Member Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3401.306s">350.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3401.326s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3402.227s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3402.807s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3403.448s">228</a>  plus 58 plus 64 is 350. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3405.169s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3406.13s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3407.691s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3408.492s">Problem.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3409.472s">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3410.333s">And</a>  by school, by school, it shows you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3413.496s">So</a>  as you can see specifically, um, Dr. Cushing, if you're able to screen scroll up, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3420.821s">It's</a>  on your screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3422.783s">By</a>  school, you can see specifically that some schools have made, you know, 98% contact with, you know, I'm just looking at the Roberts, for example, very high engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3441.178s">The</a>  McGlynn Elementary, 99, 441 students of their 443 students <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3451.039s">they</a>  have been able to make contact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3455.847s">And</a>  there were approximately two students that they were trying to nail down at that particular school.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3465.521s">I</a>  have a question.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3467.161s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3468.362s">Yeah,</a>  I was just curious whether we've been able to go yet to the next level and find out, say, with the 38 students, is that 22 families? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3479.704s">Are</a>  there multiple siblings? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3482.345s">Have</a>  we been able to look at the students? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3487.706s">I</a>  would think that would be the next step and say if it hasn't been done yet.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3492.608s">That</a>  is the next level of work now that we were able to, you know, I originally thought prior to the survey being done, I actually thought it was going to be, you know, I didn't know if it was going to be six, 700 families that we weren't able to <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3509.837s">hear</a>  from. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3510.838s">So</a>  I was really, um, excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3513.579s">And</a>  even when I, you know, spoke with chief Buckley, he said, you know, what numbers are you thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3518.542s">I</a>  said, I'm, I'm really not sure because, um, some students they might like, uh, at the secondary level, for example, they may like a particular class better than another class. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3530.489s">So</a>  they have more active participation in one class and their MIA in another. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3536.432s">So</a>  trying, waiting for all of that data to kind of be sorted out and by each school to finally say, okay, this is the total number of students that we have not been able to make contact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3551.385s">And</a>  these are the ones we're closely monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3553.787s">So</a>  that is next layer of work that we are definitely doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3558.671s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3561.074s">just</a>  trying to nail that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3562.435s">But</a>  it's, again, where you're not able to just physically reach that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3570.701s">We</a>  tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3571.942s">And</a>  all the administrators, assistant principals, calling, texting, emailing, we finally got down to these numbers that you're looking at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3582.669s">And</a>  our next level of work is exactly what you were saying.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3587.912s">I</a>  think it's very valuable information for us to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3591.655s">As</a>  I know, it must have been very time consuming to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3594.698s">But</a>  it really gives us a good picture about where we're standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3598.701s">And</a>  it also reassures us as committee members of knowing that all of this outreach and touch has happened in a very clear way that we can see on these tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3609.431s">It</a>  really sums it up nicely for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3612.593s">So</a>  I appreciate it very much.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3615.336s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3618.094s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3620.916s">So</a>  I think I understand the numbers, but I just want to make sure I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3625.92s">So</a>  if you take the McGlynn Elementary School, if we think of the kids that are sort of on watch in some capacity, we have two kids that we haven't made contact with, zero that are closely monitored, zero special ed students not engaged and zero EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3643.072s">So</a>  for a total, for that whole school, there are two children <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3647.696s">in</a>  a concerned status.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3649.337s">Is</a>  that accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3650.878s">That</a>  is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3651.839s">And</a>  I was going to say, I believe, I don't know if Diane Guarino is still on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3655.922s">It's</a>  so, um, uh, there's so many people on, but, uh, if Diane Guarino is still on, I was gonna unmute her because when we had our meeting, she's unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3672.428s">Okay,</a>  Diane Garino.</p>

    <p>[-Ad9b17iUII_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3673.969s">I'm</a>  still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3675.149s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3675.789s">Can</a>  you speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3676.77s">I'm</a>  happy to say it's only one child that we haven't heard from. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3680.211s">Uh,</a>  one of them, the mom calls me over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3683.672s">We</a>  have her on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3685.153s">She</a>  spoke to the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3686.813s">She's</a>  been doing her work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3687.914s">So</a>  I am thrilled about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3689.314s">So</a>  it's only one shot at the McGlynn elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3691.435s">We</a>  have not heard from excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3693.456s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3693.756s">And</a>  just so everyone else on the committee is aware, we have many of the principals, um, and assistant principals on the call right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3700.407s">so</a>  that they can also provide more detailed information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3703.469s">The</a>  other thing too is, is I was speaking with the middle school principals today and they had mentioned that their numbers had changed over the weekend as they were able to make more contact and able to do outreach throughout the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3716.255s">So</a>  I really do applaud the efforts of the principals to really, from the high school all the way down through <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3723.318s">All</a>  of our principals have really done a great job reaching out, making sure the students have what they need, are doing mailings home as necessary for students who may have connectivity issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3734.64s">And</a>  teachers, principals, assistant principals are really going above and beyond in this crisis to make sure that kids have what they need.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3744.202s">Yeah,</a>  and I have to say, I wasn't exactly sure <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3748.43s">what</a>  the numbers would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3750.292s">So</a>  this is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3754.155s">I</a>  think one question I have as we continue to refine these, I'm assuming that you'll give us an updated report. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3762.641s">If</a>  that can also include like what is the definition of a student that requires close monitoring? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3768.106s">So</a>  I'm assuming we're all sort of using that same definition in terms of like, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3773.628s">what</a>  does it mean to be in the category of needing to be closely monitored? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3778.491s">I</a>  would just wanna make sure that all of our schools are using the same criteria to come up with that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3786.175s">So</a>  hopefully you can add that to the next time that you provide this report to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3791.178s">And</a>  then the other question that I had around technology access, access to the internet, and whether there's like a one-to-one device available at home, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3802.383s">is</a>  whether there is a place where we're capturing this data from a sustainability perspective in school brains or wherever we capture this kind of data. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3813.548s">So</a>  if we're hearing from a family that they lack internet access, that's something that I think we're going to need to know in a systemic way ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3824.773s">So</a>  is there a place that we're capturing that information or is that the next phase of this?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3831.064s">So</a>  some of the principals I know and teachers have been gathering specific information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3837.27s">We</a>  can specifically gather that information to get a closer number since we're down to a fairly manageable number of students that we haven't made contact with yet at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3853.424s">and</a>  or the number of students that we are monitoring based on the specific school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3859.952s">Where</a>  you were talking about what does the closely monitoring mean, that definition was generated through working with the administrators, because we've been meeting on a weekly basis for a couple of hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3874.248s">And</a>  that basically meant the students who were being closely monitored, there was a tiny asterisk due to sporadic work production in all or some classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3885.439s">So</a>  again, it was specific students that were flagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3891.245s">For</a>  not being consistently present during instruction and it could be for different reasons You know, we've been told some people are working right now and the fact that Instruction is happening at certain times. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3907.877s">So</a>  again, we don't know the specific financial situation of every family, but we will do a better job of Trying to gather more data regarding that</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3920.08s">Yeah,</a>  and I think having a place for it to live systemically is super important as we think about what the next several months and years looks like throughout the sort of ebb and flow of this virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3935.944s">I</a>  don't think there's going to be less need for us to be really clear about how many students lack internet access, how many students lack a device, those kinds of things as we go forward.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3946.707s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3947.723s">And</a>  I, yes, we can definitely do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3950.844s">We</a>  can definitely gather more specific data on that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3959.065s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3961.706s">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3962.286s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, I'm sorry, Member McLaughlin's had her hand up for like five, 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3967.567s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, Member Kreatz, then Member Ruseau is what I saw.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3971.708s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3974.396s">Thank</a>  you for this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3976.157s">And</a>  to all the staff members out there who took their time making these phone calls and reaching out to families, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3982.099s">I</a>  know that's a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3984.0s">I'm</a>  wondering about the closely monitored category as well for the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=3989.502s">So</a>  if I'm hearing you correctly, Superintendent, for the folks that have not had contact, you're going to work with Chief Buckley for the non-contact folks, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4000.468s">And</a>  so for the roughly 350 who are being closely monitored, I'm thinking about sort of the mass tiered systems of support and just that model and wondering how or what the closely monitored categories are gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4013.458s">How</a>  are you gonna work that out so that you're getting some progress in terms of what you're seeing or is there a plan in terms of the remote learning plan, what closely monitored means in terms of what happens next. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4027.508s">So</a>  I get what it means in terms of the definition, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4030.068s">But</a>  I'm wondering what it means in terms of what are the next steps.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4033.751s">Yeah,</a>  so we definitely, you know, data is knowledge, data is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4039.515s">And</a>  this data really let us realize that we are reaching the majority of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4046.54s">However,</a>  the 38 that we haven't <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4050.56s">I</a>  guess maybe 37 right now on, um, you know, principal Garino's updated number. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4056.965s">And</a>  then I haven't even been able to include the middle school administrators updated numbers, but the 350, that is our next <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4067.733s">layer</a>  of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4068.914s">And</a>  again, because it clearly stated that it was sporadic performance to try to unpack that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4075.497s">But</a>  a critical member of this would also be the work that's happening right now with Stacey Shulman, because we do know that this is a very stressful time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4086.202s">And</a>  I personally have received emails from students that have shared that this is just very stressful. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4093.146s">Some</a>  of our secondary students <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4095.848s">And</a>  so we are working on also meeting the social emotional needs of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4103.597s">So</a>  in that number of 350, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4108.472s">they</a>  may have different needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4111.134s">And</a>  so we are definitely willing to meet their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4115.518s">So</a>  if it is a social emotional challenge, next time when we, you know, if we're not back in school on May 4th, where I don't think we will be back in school on May 4th, but if in fact they extend it, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4131.41s">than</a>  to take this exact data, run the report again, see what the numbers look like, and even be able to say, of this number of 350 students, we are now providing social emotional type supports for 120 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4153.815s">And</a>  to be able to say that we are monitoring them, but this is what we're doing to address their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4160.497s">And</a>  for others, it could be 50 students, 60 students having inconsistent internet availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4167.061s">Um,</a>  it could be, unfortunately they could have some members at home that are currently sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4174.026s">And,</a>  um, also, you know, because they're working with their health right now, that school work is not a priority and that their health is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4183.792s">So</a>  we are fully aware that there could be some, um, very understandable <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4189.556s">concrete</a>  reasons that we would need to make the necessary accommodations for those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4196.059s">And</a>  we are definitely willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4198.621s">But</a>  based on what the original ask of this specific report, we wanted to at least be able to present this is what Medford Public Schools numbers look like in real time as of Friday of last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4214.645s">So</a>  we'll continue to do that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4217.047s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4217.427s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4217.948s">And</a>  just the data collection around that narrative piece, I'm assuming will happen in terms of the reaching out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4224.492s">So</a>  just, and not that you need to report necessarily that to me or the personal circumstances to school committee, but just that there's some narrative there so that there's some documentation that, you know, if for example, it's, you know, again, a student with, you know, depression, anxiety, you know, that these are being documented so that there's some, <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4244.744s">reference</a>  would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4246.287s">And</a>  thank you for all you're doing, we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zLR1K32xovo&t=4248.131s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
