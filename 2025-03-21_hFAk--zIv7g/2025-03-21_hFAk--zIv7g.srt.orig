00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,251

00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:40,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

40
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:48,603
[SPEAKER_04]: President De La Russo, just before the roll is called, I'd like to just announce that I'm going to abstain from the vote due to an appearance of a conflict of interest.

41
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,424
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

42
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,425
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks.

43
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:54,165
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

44
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:59,648
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to thank the city solicitor for offering this recommendation along with the mayor.

45
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:07,652
[SPEAKER_28]: This was originated at the budget meeting before the city council for an inquiry into this particular position.

46
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:09,333
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm glad to hear that

47
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:17,801
[SPEAKER_28]: uh, yourself and the mayor, uh, thought that, uh, the, uh, moving of that position was warranted and it's long overdue.

48
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,822
[SPEAKER_28]: And I appreciate the fact that you came forward with this paper.

49
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,083
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we certainly appreciate those sentiments also.

50
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:32,127
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's ironic because Mayor Burke had described discussed during the budget preparation, the possibility of doing this during the budgetary season, but this accelerated it.

51
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:33,528
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

52
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:34,188
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

53
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:38,610

55
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:44,249

[SPEAKER_26]: With the vote of six in the affirmative and one abstention.

59
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:06,275
[SPEAKER_26]: Please note that abstentions are only permitted in certain circumstances.

60
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:17,711
[SPEAKER_26]: And this circumstance is one where there may or may not be a conflict of interest, but to, uh, avoid any appearance as so, uh, the counselor has abstained.

61
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:33,895
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, president that, um, since this matter was going to have to take its three readings, it won't be in this budget until after it takes its third reading, which will be after the beginning of the budgetary, uh,

62
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:36,919
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. Solicitor.

63
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,360

[SPEAKER_24]: This is a reappointment.

76
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,500
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Flynn has served as the chairperson of the Licensing Commission for a number of years.

77
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:35,623
[SPEAKER_24]: Recently, we've seen a new member appointed that hasn't served on the Licensing Commission before that this council approved, one Dean Bruno.

78
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:41,736
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that Mr. Flynn's experience in his background and working in this position would be an absolute asset to the city.

79
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:42,976
[SPEAKER_24]: And I move for approval, Mr. President.

80

[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Flynn is here tonight.

83
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,059
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would ask that he come to the podium so the whole audience could see who he is.

84
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,540
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you could, I know you've served with distinction for a number of years,

85
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:10,626
[SPEAKER_28]: And, uh, if you could just update the council on any new happenings within the commission itself, standing your name and address for the record.

86
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:11,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

87
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:15,290

88
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:20,495

89
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:27,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and, um, we have, uh, had many, um, initiatives over the past few years.

90
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:45,953
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think overall we have attempted to discharge the city's business and be available to the business people for whatever their needs have been relative to the dispensing of alcohol.

91
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:55,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not aware of any new initiatives that are being undertaken at this point in time that I'd like to brief the council on, although that can change from time to time.

92
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:03,146
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I, without any hesitation, support the renomination of Mr. Flynn.

93
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:13,433
[SPEAKER_28]: He does a tremendous job on the board itself, and I know board members look to Mr. Flynn for his many years of service and his advice.

94
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:15,254
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to thank you for your service.

114
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:23,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Many people have had people in their family that have suffered from ovarian cancer and the chances of surviving it are very low.

00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:27,047
[SPEAKER_16]: And this group, I think, what, Carol, 10 years now?

139
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:11,077
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, the last three years that I've been on the council, this group has come by and they've asked for the opportunity to turn the town teal.

140
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:16,199
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of the requests that I've continually made was that I'd like a little ribbon for my- We will have the ribbons.

141
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,799
[SPEAKER_24]: For my lamp here and for my colleagues on the council as well.

142
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:19,779
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the ribbons here for September.

143
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Excellent, excellent.

144
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,780
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, move for approval.

145
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,421
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

146
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:25,781
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

147
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,041
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

148
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,289
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

149
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:29,730
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

150
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

151
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,192
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

152
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,153
[SPEAKER_26]: Congratulations.

153
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,839
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

154
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:47,484
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks has two condolences he wishes to lead us in, if you would, Councilor.

155
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:49,346
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

156
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:56,031
[SPEAKER_28]: First, I'd like to have this meeting dedicated to the Orlando

157
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:01,485
[SPEAKER_28]: victims, which took place the other day.

158
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:13,848
[SPEAKER_28]: As we all know, June is National Gay Pride Month, and the LGBT community in the city of Meffitt has been very active and involved for many, many years.

159
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:23,631
[SPEAKER_28]: Meffitt High School has a Gay-Straight Alliance, one of the few high schools that was represented in the Boston Pride Parade.

160
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:26,792
[SPEAKER_28]: And I want to dedicate tonight's meeting

161
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:34,252
[SPEAKER_26]: to all the victims of the Orlando massacre, Mr. President.

162
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:42,415
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, Mr. President, we lost two residents near and dear to me, David Semenza, Jr.

163
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,016
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to have a moment of silence.

164
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:53,419
[SPEAKER_28]: He is a longtime Medford resident, just recently passed away, and he's going to be sorely missed.

165
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,380
[SPEAKER_28]: A father, a great husband,

166
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:57,725
[SPEAKER_28]: and a great friend.

167
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,647
[SPEAKER_28]: The other one is Robert Sarabian.

168
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:04,928
[SPEAKER_28]: He's a longtime Medford resident who recently passed away.

169
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:09,650
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, grandfather, father, husband, and also a great friend.

170
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:13,692
[SPEAKER_28]: And if we can have a moment of silence for those two Medford residents, Mr. President.

171
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:20,075
[SPEAKER_26]: We could all stand for a moment of silence for these two Medford residents and keep in mind those who suffer in Orlando.

172
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:41,263
[SPEAKER_26]: on the motion of Vice President Longo-Kern to return to the regular order of business.

173
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,103
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

174
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:43,183
[SPEAKER_26]: All those opposed?

175
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,844
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion granted.

176
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:56,486
[SPEAKER_26]: 16-543, offered by Vice President Longo-Kern and Councilor Marks, be resolved that the proposed Locust Street development project be discussed for neighborhood and resident input.

177
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:57,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Madam Vice President.

178
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

179
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:04,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are a number of people in the audience that are here to

180
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: have an open public hearing with regards to the locus street development.

181
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:17,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was the council's intent to have this meeting prior to the board of appeals issuing, drafting their decision.

182
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:29,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if everybody knows, but the board of appeals did file their decision today with city hall.

183
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,573
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that makes it a little, changes the circumstances of tonight.

184
00:15:35,307 --> 00:16:01,167
[SPEAKER_04]: They have ruled in favor of the developer and have approved all 11 variances, leaving us with the issue now of whether it's the abutters and the city council or probably from, I guess, what my understanding is that maybe the city council has 20 days to appeal and any direct abutter has 20 days to appeal.

185
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:04,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do have our solicitor here who I hope and I know will

186
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:10,634
[SPEAKER_04]: give us, answer any questions the residents or the council may have.

187
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:30,399
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have on our agenda a resolution 16-545, and we do have an opinion from our city solicitor with regards to my resolution to request how the city council appeals, how long do we have, if we do need to appeal, how do we request funding.

188
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether we open it up to the public

189
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:34,448
[SPEAKER_04]: to the public first.

190
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:50,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it may, I don't know, open it up to the public, but we do want our city solicitor to answer some questions so that we, as a council, can make an appropriate recommendation and ask the appropriate questions to our administration so that we can get some relief in this matter.

191
00:16:51,215 --> 00:17:02,640
[SPEAKER_04]: We did vote last week, unanimously, seven to nothing, to have an open public hearing and to ask the Zoning Board of Appeals to withhold drafting that opinion until at least

192
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:12,557
[SPEAKER_04]: not only tonight for the public to speak, but also to have a public hearing held by the Zoning Board of Appeals before they made such a decision.

193
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:29,439
[SPEAKER_04]: From my understanding, I believe there is also a violation recorded with the city solicitor's office, a closed meeting violation, and I don't know if that is gonna be addressed tonight too, but that definitely concerns me, as I'm sure it does the entire council.

194
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a number of different issues that are time sensitive,

195
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:37,156
[SPEAKER_04]: that may need a vote tonight, and we definitely want to hear from the people.

196
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:45,503
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just pretty upsetting when you read the decision and how wonderful this project is when obviously there is so much wrong with what is going on.

197
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:46,243
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

198
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:53,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Before I recognize Councilor Marks, I want to point out that this is a meeting of the Medford City Council, and this is an agenda item.

199
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,491
[SPEAKER_26]: It is not a public hearing.

200
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:57,373
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Marks.

201
00:17:58,513 --> 00:17:59,755
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

202
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:10,241
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to preference my comments at the very outset to state that I, first of all, respect each and every member of the Board of Appeals.

203
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:21,308
[SPEAKER_28]: Over the years that I've been on the council, they've made a number of great decisions which have benefited many neighborhoods in this community over the years.

204
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,189
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to let that be known.

205
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:29,853
[SPEAKER_28]: I am equally as outraged as Councilor Longo with the fact that

206
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:35,075
[SPEAKER_28]: Last Tuesday, this council voted unanimously to ask the board of appeals.

207
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:53,921
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, they're a separate body and they don't answer to this council, but we respectfully ask them to hold off on their decision until we could have a public forum where people could come up from all over the city, including director butters and voice their concern with this particular project.

208
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,082
[SPEAKER_28]: And I am equally as dismayed with the June 14th

209
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:15,970
[SPEAKER_28]: 9 51 AM, uh, posting to the city clerk this morning, uh, 14 page decision from the board of appeals that outlines, uh, the reason why, uh, they supported unanimously the project on Locust street.

210
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:23,994
[SPEAKER_28]: And so I liked, I have a few comments and I'm dying to hear from the residents, but I have a few comments I'd like to make, uh, Mr. President.

211
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:24,695
[SPEAKER_28]: Um,

212
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:42,069
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, it was quoted in the paper a couple of weeks ago on an article regarding this particular project that spoke about the 490 units, the 750-yard parking spots, and the size of the project on Locust Street.

213
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:52,656
[SPEAKER_28]: And as part of that article, Mayor Burke was quoted as saying, Mayor Burke envisioned the neighborhood developing into something similar to station landing.

214
00:19:53,769 --> 00:20:02,154
[SPEAKER_28]: And I, as someone that lives in the Wellington area, can tell you firsthand that I don't consider Station Landing, first of all, a neighborhood.

215
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:07,436
[SPEAKER_28]: Residents in a neighborhood share social ties.

216
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:10,298
[SPEAKER_28]: They have a sense of identity as a neighborhood.

217
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:14,378
[SPEAKER_28]: When a problem occurs, residents mobilize.

218
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,101
[SPEAKER_28]: Look what's out in this audience.

219
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:23,411
[SPEAKER_28]: Neighborhoods have civic, religious, and educational organizations existing within the neighborhood.

220
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:27,276
[SPEAKER_28]: So I don't consider Station Landing a neighborhood.

221
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:39,734
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't consider station landing, when I go down there and grab a slice of pizza, as a place where I see a friendly face or people talking on the sidewalk or communicating.

222
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:40,954
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't see that.

223
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:47,179
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't see Mayor Burke's vision of turning Locust Street

224
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,842
[SPEAKER_28]: which has direct abutters and is a neighborhood.

225
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,404
[SPEAKER_28]: And I stated that last week to Mayor Burke.

226
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:54,946
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a neighborhood.

227
00:20:55,266 --> 00:21:03,012
[SPEAKER_28]: Whether you think it's commercially zoned or not, this is a residential neighborhood with many residential streets that abut this particular area.

228
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:09,318
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't want to see, I for one on the council, don't want to see this project turn into a station landing.

229
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:10,539
[SPEAKER_28]: That's my first point.

230
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,142
[SPEAKER_28]: The Board of Appeals, their decision

231
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:19,930
[SPEAKER_28]: from what I read in this, and I read it twice today, their 14-page decision.

232
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:27,374
[SPEAKER_28]: They said throughout this decision that they were relying on the petitioner's studies.

233
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:39,843
[SPEAKER_28]: So they relied on the petitioner who came to them for this 490 units, and they relied on their traffic study, they relied on their soil study, they relied on the engineering study.

234
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,085
[SPEAKER_28]: Everything was relied on by the petitioner.

235
00:21:43,763 --> 00:21:47,505
[SPEAKER_28]: They also said that we relied on the input from city departments.

236
00:21:48,026 --> 00:22:00,994
[SPEAKER_28]: And many city departments made recommendations, the Board of Health, the Building Department, the Fire Department, made recommendations to try to improve this particular project.

237
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:10,400
[SPEAKER_28]: But the one thing missing, Mr. President, Mr. President, I'm over here.

238
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,142
[SPEAKER_28]: The one thing missing, the one thing missing

239
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:17,023
[SPEAKER_28]: is resident and neighborhood input.

240
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:22,467
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the one thing missing out of this 14-page document.

241
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:32,294
[SPEAKER_28]: And the reason why I say that is the Boston Globe on Thursday, June 9th, if you look under talking points, they have a section that says development.

242
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:36,578
[SPEAKER_28]: Zoning board refuses to reconsider Alston apartment project.

243
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:49,235
[SPEAKER_28]: says developers of a contested Austin apartment building are going back to the drawing board after a key city zoning panel shot down their project for the second time in a month.

244
00:22:49,675 --> 00:23:06,529
[SPEAKER_28]: The Zoning Board of Appeals Tuesday refused to reconsider its vote to reject 130 unit building on 89 Bright Nav, which is made amid concerns from some neighbors about parking and traffic.

245
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:21,225
[SPEAKER_28]: The developer enormously disappointed by the decision and noted they've already spent two years modifying the plan to address community feedback.

246
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:24,127
[SPEAKER_28]: So here we have a project in Alston.

247
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:33,233
[SPEAKER_28]: The developer spent two years dealing with the neighborhood, altered plans, made every consideration possible to reach out to the neighborhood.

248
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:39,645
[SPEAKER_28]: And here we have a project in the city of Method, which had a public hearing about a week and a half ago.

249
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:45,307
[SPEAKER_28]: The residents weren't able to speak to about 10, 1030 at night, and then they were shut off quickly.

250
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:50,329
[SPEAKER_28]: We asked the zoning board of appeals not to make a decision so we can hear from residents.

251
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,690
[SPEAKER_28]: And they hastily made a decision without having any feedback from the community.

252
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,611
[SPEAKER_28]: Something is awfully wrong in this community, Mr. President.

253
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:03,493
[SPEAKER_28]: And in my opinion, this council definitely needs to move forward with an appeal.

254
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:06,132
[SPEAKER_28]: before land court or before superior court.

255
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:31,559
[SPEAKER_28]: The report goes on to talk about a traffic impact assessment, and that is one of the other studies that the Board of Appeals relied on.

256
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:47,609
[SPEAKER_28]: This was done in March 2016, prepared by Van Nuys and Associates and Corp, and it says the board finds that the proposed project will not have a significant impact on motorist delays or vehicular queuing.

257
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:56,847
[SPEAKER_28]: So, so this is not going to have any impact on Mystic Valley Parkway on Riverside Ave on Harvard, not at all.

258
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:04,773
[SPEAKER_28]: And that was, uh, the, uh, information they got from the petition is, uh, traffic impact assessment.

259
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:10,257
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, I might add, it was also done when the metal Glen mall was not in operation.

260
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:27,882
[SPEAKER_28]: And we heard a petitioner last week, one of the residents, that stated that they actually went and got a copy of the traffic impact report and they refused to add the numbers that they already had on file for what the Meadow Glen Mall brings in traffic-wise.

261
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:34,477
[SPEAKER_28]: And rather than stating the Meadowglen Mall, they stated this project is going to bring in some additional traffic.

262
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:50,589
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's not a wash, because we all know that the Meadowglen Mall is going to be rebuilt with Wegmans, which is going to bring thousands of new cars traversing our streets from people not only in the community, but people outside the community.

263
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,391
[SPEAKER_28]: In the Board of Appeals findings,

264
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:59,798
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'd be happy to share this report with anyone tonight if they want to take a look at it.

265
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:06,083
[SPEAKER_28]: But the Board of Appeals stated more or less the reasonings why they had to give so many variances.

266
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:23,777
[SPEAKER_28]: And these are the findings that I found to be somewhat tough to deal with when it comes to a residential and a neighborhood standpoint.

267
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,825
[SPEAKER_28]: The first finding was the soil.

268
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:44,775
[SPEAKER_28]: It says the site has a unique soil and environmental conditions, drastically increasing the cost of rehabilitating, requiring the appellant make full use of the project site, available development to effectively balance the cost of the environmental remediation.

269
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:55,316
[SPEAKER_28]: So the Board of Appeals is saying, because this land is going to be so expensive to remediate, we have to let them build it to its biggest and best use.

270
00:26:55,997 --> 00:27:03,240
[SPEAKER_28]: And that would be putting the most units we can on this particular site, so then they could balance the cost.

271
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,502
[SPEAKER_28]: The next finding was the lot shape.

272
00:27:08,402 --> 00:27:13,245
[SPEAKER_28]: It says, the site is also affected by a unique lot shape constraint.

273
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:19,710
[SPEAKER_28]: frontage only on one street, alternative means of vehicle access not available.

274
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:32,796
[SPEAKER_28]: As a result, a network of internal driveways and pedestrian walkways must be constructed and will occupy a substantial portion of the available lot area.

275
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:41,360
[SPEAKER_28]: So they're saying because of the lot shape, I mean, it hasn't changed in the last 30 years, so I'm not sure why this particular

276
00:27:42,222 --> 00:27:49,157
[SPEAKER_28]: petitioner would use that as a hardship, but that was one reason why the Board of

277
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:57,284
[SPEAKER_28]: appeals thought that they could provide the variance based on the soil, based on the lot shape, the topography.

278
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:06,025
[SPEAKER_28]: In addition to the soil and lot shape challenges, the project side is constrained by unique topographical conditions.

279
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:13,907
[SPEAKER_28]: Specifically, the depth of groundwater varies from one to six feet below ground surface.

280
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:19,248
[SPEAKER_28]: So they're saying based on the water table, they can't dig below

281
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:22,262
[SPEAKER_28]: So anything they have to do has to go on the surface.

282
00:28:23,463 --> 00:28:27,365
[SPEAKER_28]: And that is a hardship to this particular developer.

283
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:43,373
[SPEAKER_28]: The board also stated that, and this is a quote, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the zoning ordinances would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the appellant.

284
00:28:44,300 --> 00:29:01,870
[SPEAKER_28]: a little enforcement of the industrial zoning district height and use limitations would significantly reduce the project site capacity to accommodate multifamily use, resulting in a substantial loss of dwelling units, including much needed affordable units.

285
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:11,195
[SPEAKER_28]: So, uh, what the board is telling me is that, uh, based on the conditions of this lot, if, if I bought a house lot, mr. President,

286
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,272
[SPEAKER_28]: And I found out that the lot was contaminated.

287
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:17,054
[SPEAKER_28]: The lot had whatever it did in the lot.

288
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,356
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't go for relief.

289
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:24,401
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't go and say, you know what, I bought this lot, but I didn't realize that it had contaminants.

290
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,663
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't realize the dimensions weren't enough.

291
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:28,864
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't realize it didn't have a proper setback.

292
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:32,988
[SPEAKER_28]: I just would move forward, Mr. President, and I definitely wouldn't be looking

293
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:40,792
[SPEAKER_28]: to build something that's far greater than the use for that particular project, which is happening here before us.

294
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:57,862
[SPEAKER_28]: It also says that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially deteriorating from the intent, I'm sorry, degregating from the intent or purpose of the zoning ordinance.

295
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:06,701
[SPEAKER_28]: And I totally disagree with that, that their zoning relief is allowing for the degradation of the neighborhood.

296
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:11,426
[SPEAKER_28]: It is allowing for a project that is oversized in a particular neighborhood.

297
00:30:11,786 --> 00:30:22,636
[SPEAKER_28]: It is allowing a developer to come in without any deference to any residents, without any deference to anyone in the community, and build a project that we saw in Alston

298
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:29,800
[SPEAKER_28]: that their zoning board turned down saying it wasn't right for the neighborhood and the neighbors had a concern.

299
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:33,362
[SPEAKER_28]: And they went back to the developer and said, meet with the neighbors.

300
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:35,884
[SPEAKER_28]: Did not happen in this community.

301
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:44,868
[SPEAKER_28]: So, uh, based on that, Mr. President, I feel very comfortable in voting to ask for, uh, an appeal of this council.

302
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:51,592
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree with council Longo Kern that, uh, we also may need an appeal from a butters and residents

303
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:55,532
[SPEAKER_28]: uh, according to the city solicitor and he can speak for himself.

304
00:30:56,373 --> 00:31:13,492
[SPEAKER_28]: And, um, I would ask that, uh, also because we will probably need legal counsel, uh, to, uh, make a motion, uh, to appeal before land court or superior court that we also ask within our resolve tonight that the mayor appropriate

305
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:24,770
[SPEAKER_28]: ample funds to hire an attorney to give guidance and direction and represent this Memphis City Council in the process of appealing this project, Mr. President.

306
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:42,557
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to ask that the city solicitor come and give us some background on this matter.

307
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:53,779
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening, Mr. President.

308
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,380
[SPEAKER_27]: Mark Rumley, City Solicitor.

309
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:12,647
[SPEAKER_27]: It's really on the second resolution that I think I should begin, because the second resolution from Councilor Lungo was to ask the City Solicitor a series of questions that dealt with the ability of this Council, in general, to appeal a Zoning Board of Appeals decision.

310
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:21,130
[SPEAKER_27]: And so, rather than to have you wait the week, I submitted that decision, or that opinion, yesterday, because it wouldn't make any sense in this scenario

311
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:23,218
[SPEAKER_27]: to just wait that period of time.

312
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,122
[SPEAKER_27]: So, if you don't mind, I'll go over what that report says very quickly.

313
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:35,767
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not gonna read it all, because it's six pages, and then a couple of other words, and I think the citizens would rather be, or the residents would rather be heard than me.

314
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:49,898
[SPEAKER_27]: The truth is that under Chapter 40A, Section 17, a municipal board may appeal the decision of a Board of Appeals, so long as it has something to do with the subject matter of zoning.

315
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:58,107
[SPEAKER_27]: In this case, the city council is the place where it's kind of the launching pad for zoning amendments and changes.

316
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:04,991
[SPEAKER_27]: Then it goes to the planning board and comes back later on with recommendations to this council for final adoption.

317
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:16,779
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's very clear that the city council has a certain purview over the subject matter of zoning and therefore would have the ability under 40A section 17

318
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:23,357
[SPEAKER_27]: to file an appeal of a board of appeals decision.

319
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:35,881
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, what I also put in the decision is some language from a recent land court case that may be the basis for a challenge to that particular effort by a city council.

320
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:43,103
[SPEAKER_27]: But that's a land court case decision that I put in there just so that you understand that there are always two sides to every argument.

321
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:48,045
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that you wouldn't be surprised if indeed the city council appeals this matter,

322
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,998
[SPEAKER_27]: that there would be a challenge to the city council's jurisdiction.

323
00:33:52,359 --> 00:34:05,171
[SPEAKER_27]: However, under the statute, 4817, the city council does have standing independent of anyone else to make an appeal of a zoning board of appeals decision.

324
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:09,555
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, abutters and parties in interest.

325
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:13,999
[SPEAKER_27]: Everyone who enters a matter in court has to have standing.

326
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,820
[SPEAKER_27]: That's fundamental law.

327
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,842
[SPEAKER_27]: If you don't have standing to go before a court, you're out.

328
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:21,164
[SPEAKER_27]: You'll be dismissed, and that'll be the end of it.

329
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:30,611
[SPEAKER_27]: The people that have standing in an appeal of a Zoning Board of Appeals case primarily are the abutters.

330
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,353
[SPEAKER_27]: They are the parties in interest.

331
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:39,398
[SPEAKER_27]: They are the ones whose property interests are the most affected by a particular decision, and they would have standing.

332
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:42,841
[SPEAKER_27]: And that standing, by the way, is independent

333
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,398
[SPEAKER_27]: of the standing of this council under 4817.

334
00:34:47,698 --> 00:35:00,082
[SPEAKER_27]: So what I'm saying to you is that as a body, and you couldn't do this independently, you couldn't do this as Mr. Falco, as Mr. Marks, Mr. Caraviello, you would have to do this as a body.

335
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:03,523
[SPEAKER_27]: You are independent of abutters.

336
00:35:04,743 --> 00:35:13,546
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, if the abutters or any of the parties in interest decide to appeal this matter, their standing is based upon their property interests.

337
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:32,558
[SPEAKER_27]: If there was not an abutter appeal on a matter and yet there would be a city council appeal without any abutters, that would look fairly weak before a judge because they would want to hear from the people in the court case who are most affected by a decision.

338
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:40,701
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's a general outline of standing and how the standing of the council is different from the standing of

339
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:41,573
[SPEAKER_27]: and a butter.

340
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:43,014
[SPEAKER_27]: They're two different things.

341
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:52,297
[SPEAKER_27]: And really, the butters could have their own appeal without the city council, but the city council has its own independent one if you choose to do so.

342
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:53,837
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's number one.

343
00:35:54,698 --> 00:36:07,542
[SPEAKER_27]: The second question generally, which came up through Councilor Lungo's resolution, which oddly is next, is if the council did decide to appeal, when and how could it do so?

344
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:11,269
[SPEAKER_27]: The answer to that has already been talked about, and it is this.

345
00:36:11,729 --> 00:36:23,560
[SPEAKER_27]: It's 20 days from the day that the appeal is filed in the office of the city clerk, which, according to the date stamp, and I don't think this is in controversy at all, was this morning at approximately 10 o'clock.

346
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:32,709
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's 20 days from today that an appeal would have to be filed, whether it's by the council or whether it would be by an abutter or party in interest.

347
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:33,109
[SPEAKER_27]: It's 20 days.

348
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:38,573
[SPEAKER_27]: You just can't write down on a piece of paper, and this is a big deal.

349
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:40,835
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't just write down, I appeal.

350
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:42,215
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't like the decision.

351
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:58,785
[SPEAKER_27]: You have to bring an appeal forward to the superior court or land court, having reviewed the decision, having reviewed the process and said, at least through an attorney, and it should be an attorney or somebody well-versed in land law,

352
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:03,054
[SPEAKER_27]: what the objection is to the decision.

353
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:04,895
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it procedural?

354
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,558
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it substantive by saying that the reasons are inappropriate?

355
00:37:08,938 --> 00:37:13,762
[SPEAKER_27]: But you have to have competent legal counsel to do that, and if you don't,

356
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:18,003
[SPEAKER_27]: Any type of an appeal under 40A is perilous.

357
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:21,143
[SPEAKER_27]: It's even perilous for some fine legal practitioners.

358
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:22,704
[SPEAKER_27]: It can be dangerous.

359
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:24,864
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you do that, you have to know what you're doing.

360
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:33,166
[SPEAKER_27]: So anyone who says, I don't like this project, I'm gonna appeal it, you have to have more flesh on the bones than that in order to go forward.

361
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:35,147
[SPEAKER_27]: These aren't childish games.

362
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,147
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the law and this is court.

363
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:41,428
[SPEAKER_27]: So 20 days from today is when the appeal has to be filed.

364
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:48,431
[SPEAKER_27]: The third question, and I'm kind of going by way of subject matter rather than to read all this stuff to you, because I don't want to read to you.

365
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:57,452
[SPEAKER_27]: The third question is, if the council decided to appeal, and this is back to the council now, who represents the council?

366
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,053
[SPEAKER_27]: And here's the answer to that question.

367
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:03,254
[SPEAKER_27]: First, we'll start with the reverse, who it won't be.

368
00:38:03,474 --> 00:38:08,194
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is not because of any reason dealing with government, but this deals with legal ethics.

369
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:11,635
[SPEAKER_27]: It can't be the city solicitor's office because,

370
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:22,025
[SPEAKER_27]: Both myself and Assistant City Solicitor Scanlon already represent the Board of Appeals in other matters which don't really get the attention of this one.

371
00:38:22,486 --> 00:38:31,129
[SPEAKER_27]: So we couldn't do that out of legal conflict of interest, which would be a violation of the ethical considerations that deal with being an attorney at law.

372
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:39,872
[SPEAKER_27]: Therefore, this council would have to, if it was going to appeal, have its own council, that is, its own legal council, and on that,

373
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:55,455
[SPEAKER_27]: My only suggestion to you is that you would have to file or, excuse me, pass a resolution asking the mayor, who's the chief budgetary officer of the city because of her position, to make an appropriation of sufficient funds for you to do so.

374
00:38:56,076 --> 00:39:05,998
[SPEAKER_27]: So it isn't that the city solicitor's office or the assistant city solicitor isn't capable of representing you, but legal requirements and rules of ethics would prohibit us.

375
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,639
[SPEAKER_27]: So those are the answers to those three questions.

376
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:10,439
[SPEAKER_27]: One other thing.

377
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:16,968
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to correct one thing with, uh, vice president, uh, Lungo, but she wouldn't have known this cause she wasn't there.

378
00:39:17,628 --> 00:39:30,736
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a, a complaint raised by a resident, uh, miss Rodriguez of, uh, alleging an open meeting law violation of the board of appeals on this matter.

379
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:34,578
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was amended once she filed a revised complaint.

380
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:38,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Also that matter was heard this morning before the board of appeals.

381
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:39,441
[SPEAKER_27]: I was there.

382
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:53,578
[SPEAKER_27]: At the end of it, the Board of Appeals said in response to that, this is just so that you understand what occurred, they said that they did not prohibit anyone from coming in the room and they felt that there was not an open meeting law violation.

383
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,680
[SPEAKER_27]: I addressed the Board of Appeals this morning, as did Ms.

384
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,884
[SPEAKER_27]: Rodriguez, but that matter is not pending any longer.

385
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:07,989
[SPEAKER_27]: That matter was heard this morning by the Board of Appeals just before they filed their decision.

386
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,688
[SPEAKER_27]: So, procedurally, that's where we are.

387
00:40:12,068 --> 00:40:16,730
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I know that people want to say some things, but I want to answer your questions, too, so I'll stay.

388
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,951
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not going anywhere.

389
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:19,551
[SPEAKER_27]: But if you have any questions for me now.

390
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:21,452
[SPEAKER_26]: Madam Vice President.

391
00:40:21,692 --> 00:40:23,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

392
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:31,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So, with regards to the city solicitor's office not being able to represent the council, we then would have to find our own council.

393
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,057
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't even help us find

394
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:36,103
[SPEAKER_04]: sufficient outside counsel?

395
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:47,827
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that you'd have to, I don't think, I know, you have to pass a resolution, first of all, saying that you want to appeal, by the way, that's a majority vote, not three quarters, or two thirds, rather.

396
00:40:48,168 --> 00:41:00,532
[SPEAKER_27]: Majority vote, then, unless you have some other funding source, which I don't believe you would, you would have to ask the mayor for an appropriation of sufficient money to retain outside counsel.

397
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:02,253
[SPEAKER_27]: In that endeavor,

398
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:11,071
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, we'd be able to assist you in that, as would the Treasurer's Office, excuse me, the Finance Office, to find the appropriate counsel.

399
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:16,034
[SPEAKER_27]: But then that counsel would be independent of us, which is the way it should be.

400
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:25,018
[SPEAKER_27]: And also, if you think that I would take exception to that or somehow have my nose out of joint because you had your own independent counsel, I don't.

401
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,139
[SPEAKER_27]: It's required.

402
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:27,900
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're going to follow the law.

403
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And with regards to separate

404
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:45,458
[SPEAKER_04]: The council has separate standing than the abutters, so with regards to the abutter portion of this, there could be multiple abutters in one filing the appeal together.

405
00:41:45,478 --> 00:41:46,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

406
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:51,761
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, but the abutters, this question came up, I had conversations with most of you this afternoon just briefly.

407
00:41:52,162 --> 00:42:00,686
[SPEAKER_27]: Councilor Mox asked me that question this afternoon, and I told him that there can't be an appeal filed by the city council and then have the abutters

408
00:42:01,263 --> 00:42:05,145
[SPEAKER_27]: let me use just a colloquialism, they can't piggyback onto that appeal.

409
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:09,166
[SPEAKER_27]: They would have to have their own independent appeal with their own independent counsel.

410
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:16,309
[SPEAKER_04]: But multiple abutters could join forces and.

411
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,270
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, they could.

412
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,552
[SPEAKER_27]: And that happens very often in land court or in superior court on an appeal of this nature.

413
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:25,473
[SPEAKER_26]: All set, Madam Vice President?

414
00:42:25,513 --> 00:42:25,893
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

415
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:27,714
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

416
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:29,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Chair recognizes Counsel Scott Pellett.

417
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,240
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't thank you, Mr. Romley.

418
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, one of the questions come about by a few residences.

419
00:42:34,781 --> 00:42:37,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you define what a, a butter is for everyone?

420
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:40,583
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, in a butterwood, there's a legal definition of it.

421
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:58,768
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll probably be vague on this cause I didn't look it up in preparation of this, but those who are immediately a butters, uh, being that contiguous with this parcel, they certainly are a butters, but then they also also notice went, if it went according to the law or I didn't look at the notice, it should have gone within 300 feet of the parcel notice to others.

422
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:05,902
[SPEAKER_27]: So there'd be a presumption that they'd be parties in interest, but that's a presumption only which could be attacked during the course of an appeal.

423
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:17,610
[SPEAKER_27]: And people who are going to engage in this, the council and the residents should know this, not trying to be ominous, but you go to court and it's a land court or superior court.

424
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:22,374
[SPEAKER_27]: It isn't a matter of saying, oh, we filed an appeal and now we're going to go to court next month.

425
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:26,477
[SPEAKER_27]: Anybody who's been in court once knows that when you go to court,

426
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,561
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an experience.

427
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:29,742
[SPEAKER_27]: It isn't a day.

428
00:43:30,243 --> 00:43:33,045
[SPEAKER_27]: And it stretches out and goes from time to time to time.

429
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:34,567
[SPEAKER_27]: There are different time frames involved.

430
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:41,974
[SPEAKER_27]: An appeal in the land court or the superior court, if it's quick, might take a year or two.

431
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:47,920
[SPEAKER_27]: So there's any number of different things that happen once this comes into play.

432
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,982
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that everybody has to do this.

433
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,661
[SPEAKER_27]: with eyes wide open.

434
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:58,084
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if you don't do something in life with eyes wide open, then you're deluding yourself.

435
00:43:58,504 --> 00:44:05,389
[SPEAKER_27]: And the only way to make progress in life is to base your actions on firm bricks of truth and clarity.

436
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:09,912
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and I appreciate that.

437
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:13,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Believe me, I appreciate your knowledge.

438
00:44:13,535 --> 00:44:18,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of the things that we've learned going through this process in the last couple weeks,

439
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:47,110
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the concerns, as I did my homework, is filing this appeal as abutters, making sure that it's more than one, and actually recommending that to anybody who I talk to for the fact that the manipulation with developers and meeting with one abutter and working with them to set up certain side deals so things could be handled out of court.

440
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,671
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's welcomed.

441
00:44:50,145 --> 00:45:02,034
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, what I heard over and over again was that having the abutters being the group that really pushes this.

442
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,235
[SPEAKER_27]: The laboring oar?

443
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:04,096
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry?

444
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:05,677
[SPEAKER_17]: The laboring oar.

445
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:06,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

446
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:12,603
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's that we see over and over again that I've gotten the response from.

447
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:19,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, another question that maybe you can or can't answer, the cost to the taxpayers.

448
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,867
[SPEAKER_17]: if we had to then ask the mayor?

449
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:24,328
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something I think we need to know.

450
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:30,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Roughly, in this type of case, is it, could you answer that?

451
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:35,754
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the kind of money I never made in my life because I represent the city.

452
00:45:38,096 --> 00:45:38,476
[SPEAKER_27]: That much.

453
00:45:38,496 --> 00:45:47,041
[SPEAKER_27]: But it certainly would exceed, it would exceed conservatively, and I'm being cheap,

454
00:45:47,597 --> 00:45:50,920
[SPEAKER_27]: conservatively exceed $15,000 to get going.

455
00:45:53,362 --> 00:45:53,882
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

456
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:54,383
[SPEAKER_27]: 20, he says.

457
00:45:55,764 --> 00:45:56,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

458
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:57,005
[SPEAKER_27]: 20 it is.

459
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:58,926
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, it is expensive.

460
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:01,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

461
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:02,689
Thank you.

462
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:05,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Caffiel.

463
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:05,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Mr. President.

464
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:16,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Solisio, if I'm understanding you right, and you're saying we should be going, going into this with our eyes wide open, um, would it, do you think it would be prudent for us to maybe, um,

465
00:46:17,268 --> 00:46:32,413
[SPEAKER_16]: before we go in and hire an attorney or be decided on this appeal, maybe seek maybe a consultation with an outside attorney, whether it's something that an outside attorney feels that would be favorable for us.

466
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:34,433
[SPEAKER_27]: That's always a prudent choice.

467
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:38,815
[SPEAKER_16]: However, it's a prudent choice, but you'd have to do it within the week.

468
00:46:38,975 --> 00:46:39,295
[SPEAKER_16]: PDQ.

469
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,996
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I say.

470
00:46:42,016 --> 00:46:45,017
[SPEAKER_16]: If we had a consultation and you get some cost estimates,

471
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:47,458
[SPEAKER_16]: trying to figure out where we are with this.

472
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,882
[SPEAKER_27]: Respectfully, counselor, the cost estimates will astound you anyway.

473
00:46:53,002 --> 00:47:05,332
[SPEAKER_27]: But I think the thing that the consultation would benefit you on is to having an objective set of eyes look at the decision and the process and tell you whether or not you have a viable appeal.

474
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:09,128
[SPEAKER_27]: Because, see, that's the hair that has to be split.

475
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:14,872
[SPEAKER_27]: It's one thing, and I say this respectfully, it's one thing to say, I don't like this project.

476
00:47:15,313 --> 00:47:22,038
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's another thing to say, I don't like this project for these reasons which give me a tenable appeal.

477
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:25,460
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's that second part that's crucial.

478
00:47:26,181 --> 00:47:29,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this something you feel that we can get done in the next 14 days?

479
00:47:32,745 --> 00:47:33,306
[SPEAKER_27]: It'll be tough.

480
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:36,025
[SPEAKER_16]: where would we get the guidance on what attorney to hire?

481
00:47:36,346 --> 00:47:46,408
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we'd certainly set you up with speaking to, see, I don't, I'm not a shill for any lawyer, but we'd certainly make some type of calls to the Mass Power Association and that sort of thing.

482
00:47:46,728 --> 00:47:55,050
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe City Solicitor and Town Council Association for referrals, but we never really pick, if anyone calls the law office and says, could you recommend a lawyer?

483
00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:00,891
[SPEAKER_27]: We never do because we're not going to set somebody, we're not farming stuff out to anybody.

484
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:06,060
[SPEAKER_27]: Mass Bar Association, City Solicitor and Town Council Association, we'd start to get some referrals.

485
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,482
[SPEAKER_16]: So would it be prudent to at least have a consultation before we venture into this?

486
00:48:10,502 --> 00:48:11,983
[SPEAKER_27]: We could start assembling some names.

487
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:12,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

488
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:16,645
[SPEAKER_26]: All set, Counselor?

489
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:17,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

490
00:48:17,325 --> 00:48:18,005
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Counselor.

491
00:48:18,025 --> 00:48:18,205
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

492
00:48:18,446 --> 00:48:20,326
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair recognizes Vice President Ludlow-Curran.

493
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:21,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

494
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:28,550
[SPEAKER_04]: If the council or the abutters filed an appeal, would that stall the process and create a time period where

495
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:30,562
[SPEAKER_04]: things couldn't move forward on the site?

496
00:48:30,582 --> 00:48:32,523
[SPEAKER_27]: The project would not move forward during the appeal.

497
00:48:33,364 --> 00:48:36,586
[SPEAKER_27]: There'd be too much money at stake for the developer to take that type of risk.

498
00:48:36,866 --> 00:48:37,426
[SPEAKER_27]: They wouldn't do it.

499
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:50,494
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my second question, with regards to the open meeting law violation, whether or not that goes to the Attorney General's office next, would that be inclusive of something that the city council could appeal on?

500
00:48:50,514 --> 00:48:51,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Could that be a basis?

501
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:56,198
[SPEAKER_27]: The open meeting law violation was raised by a resident, Cheryl Rodriguez,

502
00:48:56,631 --> 00:49:08,859
[SPEAKER_27]: And because of the timeframes involved in making that type of allegation, and the fact that it was filed by her last week during the budget period, the Board of Appeals held that meeting this morning.

503
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:11,460
[SPEAKER_27]: It is hers to appeal to the Attorney General.

504
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:18,305
[SPEAKER_27]: Anybody else who would allege an open meeting law violation at this juncture, I think the timeframes have gone by, or they're getting close.

505
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,346
[SPEAKER_27]: However, Ms.

506
00:49:20,386 --> 00:49:23,168
[SPEAKER_27]: Rodriguez does have the ability to appeal this.

507
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:30,815
[SPEAKER_27]: the action of the Board of Appeals today to the Attorney General's Office in their open meeting law division.

508
00:49:31,295 --> 00:49:33,416
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's all set forth by rule.

509
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:37,059
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know that she is becoming more and more familiar with those rules.

510
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:38,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

511
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:43,703
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair recognizes Councilor Mox.

512
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:46,025
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Solicitor, just one quick question.

513
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:56,535
[SPEAKER_28]: Under the FY16 budget for your department, there's claims under $1,000 and then claims over $1,000.

514
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:57,876
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, sir.

515
00:49:58,476 --> 00:50:04,538
[SPEAKER_28]: And the claims under $1,000 started off with $30,000, and claims over $1,000 started off with $60,000.

516
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:07,520
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, a very, very modest sum.

517
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,781
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you know how much is left in that account?

518
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:11,421
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't, honestly.

519
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,362
[SPEAKER_27]: Not off the top of my head.

520
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:14,543
[SPEAKER_27]: My secretary would.

521
00:50:14,843 --> 00:50:15,743
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a great deal.

522
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:16,424
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a great deal.

523
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,665
[SPEAKER_28]: But in the past, there has been money allocated

524
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:21,560
[SPEAKER_28]: for outside counsel.

525
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

526
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,362
[SPEAKER_27]: And generally speaking, though, that has not come out of the claims account.

527
00:50:25,382 --> 00:50:26,483
[SPEAKER_27]: There's been other sources.

528
00:50:26,883 --> 00:50:30,065
[SPEAKER_27]: It's been a while before this has been done since this has been.

529
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:43,834
[SPEAKER_27]: But for example, the example I gave to the council last week, when I talked about, for example, civil rights violation and perhaps a public safety officer being sued, we have insurance for that, but a very high deductible, like 50,000.

530
00:50:45,073 --> 00:50:57,176
[SPEAKER_27]: So when we hire outside counsel for that, generally speaking, the mayor, both the present mayor and the former mayor, they would find another source of funding to pay that contractual obligation.

531
00:50:57,516 --> 00:50:59,776
[SPEAKER_27]: Generally speaking, it didn't come out of the claims account.

532
00:51:00,617 --> 00:51:02,437
[SPEAKER_27]: However, they did find other sources.

533
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:06,158
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have done it in the past and we've done it in different cases.

534
00:51:06,638 --> 00:51:08,398
[SPEAKER_27]: This would be a first in my career.

535
00:51:09,479 --> 00:51:14,820
[SPEAKER_28]: So you don't have any idea whether or not at the end of this fiscal year, which is coming up within the next couple of weeks,

536
00:51:15,402 --> 00:51:17,263
[SPEAKER_28]: There may be a surplus in those two line items.

537
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:25,866
[SPEAKER_27]: If there is a, if there's a surplus in our claims account, I'm sure it's going to be extremely modest, but it might be something that could be contributed.

538
00:51:26,046 --> 00:51:26,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

539
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:26,706
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

540
00:51:28,226 --> 00:51:28,586
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

541
00:51:28,987 --> 00:51:29,887
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

542
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:31,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, Mr. Warren, one more question today.

543
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:34,969
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it was a question that was someone brought to my attention.

544
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:42,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Silly question maybe, but the McGlynn school, the parents of the McGlynn school, would that be considered a butters?

545
00:51:42,571 --> 00:51:42,771
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

546
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:43,551
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

547
00:51:43,712 --> 00:51:45,032
[SPEAKER_17]: No, because they're no.

548
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:45,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

549
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:46,389
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all.

550
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:51,491
[SPEAKER_27]: No, they're not residents of the school.

551
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:55,413
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

552
00:51:56,194 --> 00:52:02,397
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to now open this portion of the meeting to the residents who wish to visit us.

553
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:04,318
[SPEAKER_26]: Please note a couple things.

554
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:10,961
[SPEAKER_26]: First, we ask that when you approach the podium that you state clearly your name and address for the record.

555
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:14,383
[SPEAKER_26]: We also ask that you write your name and address

556
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:18,686
[SPEAKER_26]: for the record, allegedly on that pad of paper that's left there.

557
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:32,850
[SPEAKER_26]: Up here on the podium, because of the primitive nature of the sound system in this room, it's very difficult for us to always understand what the speaker at the podium is saying.

558
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,532
[SPEAKER_26]: So it will be very helpful for the clerk to have an accurate record of those speaking.

559
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:40,952
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody has a time limit.

560
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:42,513
[SPEAKER_26]: And also,

561
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:51,778
[SPEAKER_26]: We ask that you not insert yourself in the line again until everybody has had a chance to speak one time.

562
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:55,079
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you.

563
00:52:55,659 --> 00:52:58,720
[SPEAKER_26]: And so we'll start with you, Ms.

564
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Martin.

565
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,921
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you would, 10 minutes.

566
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:03,701
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you would, Ms.

567
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:05,882
[SPEAKER_26]: Martin, please state your name and address for the record.

568
00:53:07,323 --> 00:53:09,666
[SPEAKER_32]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford.

569
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:14,732
[SPEAKER_32]: First of all, thank you for letting me speak tonight without Ms.

570
00:53:14,772 --> 00:53:16,034
[SPEAKER_32]: Cohen and Mr. Marks.

571
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:17,616
[SPEAKER_32]: We wouldn't be here.

572
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:21,869
[SPEAKER_32]: able to speak at an open meeting like this, so I thank you for that.

573
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:27,152
[SPEAKER_32]: Normally, I speak for myself, so the weight of what I say doesn't carry a lot.

574
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:33,676
[SPEAKER_32]: But today, I have been asked by many of the abutters to speak for them, because they are just regular people.

575
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:37,418
[SPEAKER_32]: And they don't get up here, and they're not public speakers.

576
00:53:38,198 --> 00:53:40,120
[SPEAKER_32]: And so they've asked me to speak for them.

577
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:47,824
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm very nervous, because it's an awesome responsibility that I have to speak for these folks.

578
00:53:48,231 --> 00:53:51,053
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope that after I speak, they'll feel more comfortable coming forward.

579
00:53:54,254 --> 00:54:08,863
[SPEAKER_32]: With that, let me introduce you to the people of Cumming Street, the small scale residential neighborhood that the developers called these people.

580
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:15,935
[SPEAKER_32]: This is them, and they're all along Riverside Avenue, but most of them are for Cumming Street, but they're all along Riverside Avenue.

581
00:54:16,476 --> 00:54:17,156
[SPEAKER_32]: Meet my neighbors.

582
00:54:17,736 --> 00:54:19,277
[SPEAKER_32]: They're all over here, okay?

583
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:22,779
[SPEAKER_32]: So these are people, and this is wonderful that they've come out.

584
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,061
[SPEAKER_32]: Just their presence here, they don't come out here every day.

585
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:31,504
[SPEAKER_32]: They got jobs and lives, not like me, but you know, they have jobs and lives.

586
00:54:32,004 --> 00:54:34,506
[SPEAKER_32]: They can't be here every day advocating for themselves.

587
00:54:34,546 --> 00:54:36,087
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't know what's going on all the time.

588
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:40,148
[SPEAKER_32]: And so it's important that they're here tonight.

589
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:43,073
[SPEAKER_32]: And so their presence should speak volumes.

590
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:49,304
[SPEAKER_32]: We also have literally direct abutters to the Shaw's project tonight.

591
00:54:50,164 --> 00:54:55,250
[SPEAKER_32]: literally, without question, literally direct abutters here tonight.

592
00:54:55,851 --> 00:54:56,131
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay?

593
00:54:56,512 --> 00:54:58,034
[SPEAKER_32]: So I want that to be known.

594
00:54:58,534 --> 00:55:01,678
[SPEAKER_32]: And I thank Mr. Marks and Ms.

595
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:05,002
[SPEAKER_32]: Cohen for bringing this to everybody's awareness.

596
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:09,428
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that it's very interesting that today they approved

597
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,141
[SPEAKER_32]: this appeals thing, whatever it is.

598
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:16,442
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a complex situation.

599
00:55:16,502 --> 00:55:18,182
[SPEAKER_32]: And most of these people, this is over their heads.

600
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:22,884
[SPEAKER_32]: You have to be a lawyer to figure this out, and land lawyers, and this and that, and the other thing.

601
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:25,765
[SPEAKER_32]: All they know is that this project's too big for their neighborhood.

602
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:26,845
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what they know.

603
00:55:27,665 --> 00:55:28,425
[SPEAKER_32]: They know it's too big.

604
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:29,446
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't care.

605
00:55:29,486 --> 00:55:30,906
[SPEAKER_32]: No offense, city solicitor.

606
00:55:31,346 --> 00:55:32,727
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't know that stuff.

607
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:34,007
[SPEAKER_32]: This is intimidating.

608
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:36,368
[SPEAKER_32]: This process is intimidating for regular people.

609
00:55:37,108 --> 00:55:38,408
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

610
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:44,047
[SPEAKER_32]: I think they passed it so that the suits didn't have to sit here and look at the people tonight.

611
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:45,327
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what I think.

612
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:50,810
[SPEAKER_32]: I think they passed it today so that the suits didn't have to show up from New York, Park Street, or whatever that is.

613
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:58,374
[SPEAKER_32]: And if they didn't do this in the dark of night, we wouldn't be here, and it wouldn't cost the city a dime.

614
00:55:58,794 --> 00:55:59,394
[SPEAKER_32]: You're talking about $15,000.

615
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:03,316
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, if this was done right in the first place,

616
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:11,150
[SPEAKER_32]: We wouldn't have to pay a dime to a lawyer if they had asked for the city's, for the neighborhood's input ahead of time.

617
00:56:11,631 --> 00:56:15,312
[SPEAKER_32]: This is what happens when you try to slip something under in the dark of night.

618
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:16,073
[SPEAKER_32]: This is what happens.

619
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,733
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's get this passed.

620
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:21,895
[SPEAKER_32]: 11 different violations of code violations or whatever.

621
00:56:22,275 --> 00:56:28,838
[SPEAKER_32]: If they had asked for this, and yes, maybe if they had asked, maybe three people would have shown up, you know, but you don't know that.

622
00:56:29,623 --> 00:56:30,344
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't know that.

623
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:33,486
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe there would have been 20 people that showed up, maybe 25.

624
00:56:35,007 --> 00:56:35,788
[SPEAKER_32]: But now look at us.

625
00:56:35,968 --> 00:56:37,970
[SPEAKER_32]: Where we are, we shouldn't have to be here tonight.

626
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,251
[SPEAKER_32]: We should not have to be doing this tonight.

627
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,833
[SPEAKER_32]: This is because it wasn't done right in the first place.

628
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:51,920
[SPEAKER_32]: And we have 20 days.

629
00:56:53,526 --> 00:56:57,168
[SPEAKER_32]: The other big thing is that we have only 20 days to do something about this.

630
00:56:57,509 --> 00:57:02,172
[SPEAKER_32]: So when you talk about getting counsel, I don't care what you have to do, but we have to do it tomorrow.

631
00:57:02,572 --> 00:57:04,093
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to do it 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

632
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:06,275
[SPEAKER_32]: I want you to work with these folks here.

633
00:57:06,655 --> 00:57:14,340
[SPEAKER_32]: I want you to get the director butters, get their names, get them on paper because they don't, they've asked me to speak for them and I don't know how to speak for them, to be honest with you.

634
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,322
[SPEAKER_32]: I want them to speak for themselves.

635
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:18,961
[SPEAKER_32]: They're intimidated.

636
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:21,682
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a very, very arduous process.

637
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:22,863
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys do this every day.

638
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:24,183
[SPEAKER_32]: This is what you do for a living.

639
00:57:24,304 --> 00:57:25,544
[SPEAKER_32]: This is what you get paid to do.

640
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:27,125
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't do this every day.

641
00:57:27,585 --> 00:57:28,166
[SPEAKER_32]: They're not up here.

642
00:57:28,206 --> 00:57:28,786
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't know you.

643
00:57:28,806 --> 00:57:30,087
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't know the routine every day.

644
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:33,348
[SPEAKER_32]: So this is important that you get this done.

645
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:39,932
[SPEAKER_32]: And just because something's hard does not mean it shouldn't be done.

646
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:43,874
[SPEAKER_32]: So when you say, we have to have this done and we have to have that done,

647
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:47,817
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't, no offense, Mr. Solicitor.

648
00:57:48,237 --> 00:57:48,718
[SPEAKER_32]: He knows me.

649
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:53,658
[SPEAKER_32]: But just because it's hard doesn't mean we shouldn't go forward with it.

650
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:59,079
[SPEAKER_32]: So don't say that just because, you know, well, we might have to this, that, and the other.

651
00:57:59,299 --> 00:58:01,500
[SPEAKER_32]: But I do like what he said about coming up with the reasons.

652
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,200
[SPEAKER_32]: The solicitor said we do need to have reasons.

653
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,081
[SPEAKER_32]: We shouldn't have had to come, we shouldn't be here where we are today.

654
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:12,101
[SPEAKER_32]: But we do need to come up with those reasons now because the horse is out of the barn.

655
00:58:13,882 --> 00:58:14,922
[SPEAKER_32]: The horse is out of the barn now.

656
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:16,986
[SPEAKER_32]: It shouldn't have been that way.

657
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,647
[SPEAKER_32]: It should have been that the horse should have stayed in the barn, and we would have been fine.

658
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:22,508
[SPEAKER_32]: You wouldn't see these people here tonight.

659
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,469
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't want to be here.

660
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:24,670
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to be here.

661
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,510
[SPEAKER_32]: I love coming here.

662
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,190
[SPEAKER_32]: This is my thing.

663
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:28,612
[SPEAKER_32]: But these people, they don't want to be here.

664
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:31,113
[SPEAKER_32]: This is not their normal Tuesday night.

665
00:58:31,773 --> 00:58:33,074
[SPEAKER_32]: They have people to take care of.

666
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:33,875
[SPEAKER_32]: They have things to do.

667
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,036
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I just want you to recognize that.

668
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:42,154
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope that they can speak for themselves now.

669
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,935
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope that I've given them that much encouragement.

670
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:45,996
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

671
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:54,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

672
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,100
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

673
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:58,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

674
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:00,502
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Jean M. Nuzzo.

675
00:59:01,202 --> 00:59:02,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 35 Parris Street.

676
00:59:04,343 --> 00:59:08,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to just take a few moments and reiterate a few thoughts that I made

677
00:59:08,695 --> 00:59:11,216
[SPEAKER_03]: with a much smaller audience last week.

678
00:59:11,837 --> 00:59:15,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Just my research, I have some information to reference.

679
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:21,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as a point of information, a lot of what I have to say tonight I've researched, and they're facts.

680
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:22,523
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not

681
00:59:22,919 --> 00:59:27,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Opinions I'll tell you if I think I'm making an opinion.

682
00:59:27,945 --> 00:59:42,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, so I've done a lot of research and I have some information to share First let me say that I'm a lifelong Medford resident and I think that that still means something I live in this city because I love it and

683
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:51,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm passionate about Medford and our opportunities to develop the city, and I'm passionate about construction and development.

684
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the industry that I work in.

685
00:59:53,972 --> 01:00:03,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I do construction planning and tenant improvement development work for several different industries, including biotech, government, academic.

686
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see what other cities are doing locally and all the way down to Rhode Island.

687
01:00:11,505 --> 01:00:16,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am fully in support of responsible development within the city of Medford.

688
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:36,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I still believe, as I did last week, that there is a subset of Medford officials that feel like Medford is the ugly sister who can't get a date, and so we should just be happy that someone wants to dig in the ground and build something here.

689
01:00:37,872 --> 01:00:39,894
[SPEAKER_03]: reiterate that that is not the case.

690
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:47,701
[SPEAKER_03]: We sit smack dab in the middle of something that has been dubbed the urban edge or the urban ring.

691
01:00:48,422 --> 01:00:54,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I have documentation from NIOP, which is the building industry

692
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,830
[SPEAKER_03]: standards that they talk about this book.

693
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,712
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're welcome to look at it, I can refer you to it.

694
01:01:02,232 --> 01:01:19,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all the projects that are going on in Somerville, Charlestown, Medford, West Cambridge, Watertown, Alston, North Station, and speculated projects around to support the outward migration from the city of Cambridge and Boston proper.

695
01:01:21,584 --> 01:01:21,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

696
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:26,906
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to look at it, I've notated a couple pages of interest, but I think that's available online.

697
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:29,366
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested, I'll let you borrow it or have a copy.

698
01:01:30,727 --> 01:01:45,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I bring this up because in both instances, the developer has said the reason that they need to build 490 units is because there's nothing else they can do with that parcel in an industrial code.

699
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:55,883
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's zoned for industrial, and because Wegmans is coming across the street, they can't put another retail unit there, and there's nothing else they can do.

700
01:01:56,003 --> 01:02:07,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at that book, there's at least 150 projects going on, some residential, mostly mixed use, some office, some lab space.

701
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:15,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I have additional information that talks about what the market will bear, and values for rental,

702
01:02:16,127 --> 01:02:31,679
[SPEAKER_03]: for the city of Medford or Cambridge, the surrounding areas in New England, and what the rents are, and the fact that, as I stated last week, there is now 115,000 square feet of lab space available in Cambridge.

703
01:02:36,604 --> 01:02:41,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a demand for over a million four square feet.

704
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:42,787
[SPEAKER_03]: They have 114,000.

705
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:54,932
[SPEAKER_03]: As you look through that book, you'll notice that Watertown, Belmont, the surrounding areas are all doing things to bring business into their cities.

706
01:02:55,592 --> 01:02:58,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm not opposed to a residential development.

707
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Their position was it has to be residential, and that is

708
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:07,414
[SPEAKER_03]: my findings and my information that I know of at the moment that's out there.

709
01:03:07,655 --> 01:03:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome to read it.

710
01:03:09,195 --> 01:03:11,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I can refer you to links, whatever you'd like.

711
01:03:12,377 --> 01:03:16,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I'm fully in support of responsible development for the city of Medford.

712
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have a great opportunity here.

713
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:25,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused as to why this application for variance was considered.

714
01:03:26,364 --> 01:03:30,506
[SPEAKER_03]: As was stated, there are three arguments really don't

715
01:03:31,836 --> 01:03:32,617
[SPEAKER_03]: hold merit.

716
01:03:33,197 --> 01:03:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So the arguments that they make about the city needing to give them a variance because the land is brownfield and they can't dig.

717
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:51,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, World Trade Center 1 that came out of the ground has what they call a bathtub.

718
01:03:51,753 --> 01:03:53,194
[SPEAKER_03]: It's submerged in water.

719
01:03:53,214 --> 01:03:55,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are things that can be done.

720
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:56,697
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to go so high.

721
01:03:56,757 --> 01:03:59,920
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I think it's just another example of

722
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:05,224
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective that they bring to the argument.

723
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:07,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that there are things that can be done.

724
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:10,227
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to build that way, as I mentioned last week.

725
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:15,690
[SPEAKER_03]: They can do what they call a Texas wrap, which doesn't involve going into the earth at all.

726
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:28,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't see anything in the documentation about presumptive load testing to assure that this property can even hold a 75-foot multi-story building on it.

727
01:04:28,537 --> 01:04:30,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't held that in the past.

728
01:04:31,343 --> 01:04:34,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And in all the documentation that I looked at, I didn't see anything.

729
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:35,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have overlooked it.

730
01:04:35,645 --> 01:04:38,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be misplaced and just not in the copies that I was looking at.

731
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:43,488
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's something extremely important to consider for a building that they want to go 75 feet tall.

732
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:48,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm concerned the Butters weren't impacted.

733
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:58,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that in other cities that follow the Massachusetts general law, a Butters and their feedback are prominent.

734
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:06,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I know of instances in both residential and commercial that when direct to Butters have said no, the matter is closed.

735
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:07,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.

736
01:05:07,986 --> 01:05:09,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel

737
01:05:10,187 --> 01:05:20,410
[SPEAKER_03]: badly that our abutters haven't had the opportunity and maybe they'd be more interested and open to this building had they had the opportunity to provide feedback.

738
01:05:22,531 --> 01:05:38,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that moving forward with the project this large and not making it clear that this is not something that Medford residents want sets the stage and it sets the precedence that

739
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,455
[SPEAKER_03]: people can come in and develop.

740
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:54,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mentioned last week, and I'll mention again for the benefit of the people who weren't here, that I know that there is a desire or human nature to say, well, that's a little bit further away from me.

741
01:05:54,961 --> 01:05:56,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not affect me so much.

742
01:05:56,981 --> 01:06:01,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may be true of this 490-unit development.

743
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:08,586
[SPEAKER_03]: But just off the top of my head, I can think of four parcels, one on Riverside Ave, one on Salem Street,

744
01:06:09,238 --> 01:06:24,895
[SPEAKER_03]: One on High Street and actually a good number on Mystic Ave that a greedy developer or a savvy developer can come in and you will see multiples of this type of building.

745
01:06:25,477 --> 01:06:39,764
[SPEAKER_03]: go up, where they maximize what they're putting, they know the board, they know community development, and I know they work hard, and I believe that they have the best interests of the city at heart.

746
01:06:40,184 --> 01:06:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a thankless job that they do.

747
01:06:42,606 --> 01:06:43,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I take my hat off.

748
01:06:43,946 --> 01:06:45,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that I would

749
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:59,464
[SPEAKER_03]: ever want to do that job, but if it's known that this will be accepted and approved very swiftly in the city of Medford, you will see them come.

750
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:03,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd ask people to think about that.

751
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:05,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what your vision is for the city?

752
01:07:06,586 --> 01:07:11,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it is, you know, well then certainly stand up and be heard on that position.

753
01:07:11,392 --> 01:07:20,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's not, you know, we need to kind of step forward and make it known that this one we may or may not be able to do something about.

754
01:07:20,563 --> 01:07:22,165
[SPEAKER_03]: It may or may not go our way.

755
01:07:22,899 --> 01:07:37,647
[SPEAKER_03]: But the next one, we're gonna mobilize, we're gonna be ready, we're gonna be united, and we're gonna try to influence and make sure that our voices are heard before that schematic design is completed.

756
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:50,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also urge your consideration, and I don't know how the best way to go about this would be, but I feel like we need some subject matter expertise in Medford on this.

757
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:53,455
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some savvy developers out there.

758
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:57,839
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some really good developers out there that would be interested in Medford.

759
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:07,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just by way of accepting this one, I think that we could use a little bit more strength in that expertise.

760
01:08:07,746 --> 01:08:08,407
[SPEAKER_10]: You have one minute.

761
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:09,127
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

762
01:08:09,227 --> 01:08:09,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I can finish.

763
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:14,011
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, if anyone's interested in the market information, I'm happy to share.

764
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:16,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need some subject matter experts.

765
01:08:17,073 --> 01:08:19,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in closing, I'll leave you with this thought.

766
01:08:20,635 --> 01:08:24,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It may cost us $15,000 to file an appeal.

767
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:25,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It may cost us $30,000.

768
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:30,141
[SPEAKER_03]: But how much will it cost the taxpayers for that 490-unit development going in?

769
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:41,447
[SPEAKER_03]: that we will drive by every day, deal with the traffic, pay for the children that need to go to school, and any other taxing that they put on our infrastructure.

770
01:08:41,527 --> 01:08:50,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think in the grand scheme, $15,000, $30,000 is not a lot to invest to at least influence the outcome.

771
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:51,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

772
01:09:01,382 --> 01:09:01,882
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

773
01:09:01,962 --> 01:09:03,904
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

774
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:07,466
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jay Campbell and I live at 707 Fulton Street.

775
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:10,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for having this open hearing.

776
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:11,588
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice to receive a robo call.

777
01:09:11,868 --> 01:09:15,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Recommend that the residents come here to talk about this before any decisions made.

778
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,031
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having this still.

779
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:25,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just talk about a few different things that was brought up last week and this week as well.

780
01:09:26,197 --> 01:09:30,179
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the development goes, development necessarily isn't bad.

781
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:36,799
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the biggest concerns I have with this 490-unit development is that, once again, we get rid of the retail.

782
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:42,865
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pushing businesses out, be it commercial, be it retail.

783
01:09:44,326 --> 01:09:50,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally believe that, I believe it's something like 65,000 square feet of space is currently there, and we're going down to 10,000.

784
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:55,636
[SPEAKER_01]: There used to be a car dealership right by the skating rink, by Flynn Skating Rink.

785
01:09:56,288 --> 01:09:58,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, over by the fields.

786
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:02,731
[SPEAKER_01]: That's now Luminaire, which is a huge apartment building.

787
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:03,932
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gone.

788
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:09,655
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two apartments, complexes on Locust Street that used to be, I believe, auto body shops.

789
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:11,616
[SPEAKER_01]: That's now gone, now apartments.

790
01:10:11,956 --> 01:10:12,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing filled in.

791
01:10:12,977 --> 01:10:15,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep on hearing people talk about stations landing.

792
01:10:16,358 --> 01:10:22,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Councilor Mox doesn't feel it's a neighborhood, but my mother lives there and loves it, but that's okay.

793
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:25,323
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things, she lives in the condos.

794
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:30,461
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have their meetings, and they have their things, and they love the retail.

795
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:33,922
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other concerns I have is that we're not putting in condos.

796
01:10:34,682 --> 01:10:39,343
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting in these big, you know, you talk about affordable housing, but affordable housing to rent.

797
01:10:40,223 --> 01:10:41,084
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ownership.

798
01:10:41,524 --> 01:10:44,204
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no owner of having it.

799
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:48,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the concerns with this project is that, once again, it's an apartment.

800
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:53,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if you could have it where you start to put in more condos, like at St.

801
01:10:53,927 --> 01:10:54,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Francis,

802
01:10:55,156 --> 01:10:56,797
[SPEAKER_01]: The old school is now condos.

803
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:57,738
[SPEAKER_01]: At least there's a buy-in.

804
01:10:58,038 --> 01:11:01,300
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that have ownership and feel a piece of it.

805
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:17,251
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I'd recommend to this, if you're going to look at the zoning, not only for the local street, for the 490 units, but we also address across the street from me, there's a neighbor that has a 2,000 square foot lot that isn't being used because it's not big enough.

806
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:23,275
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you could take a look at the zoning and take a look to see, you know what, maybe you could put an 800 square foot house on there.

807
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:28,864
[SPEAKER_01]: two-bedroom, one-bathroom home that now would sell for a lot less than any home in Medford is selling for today.

808
01:11:28,904 --> 01:11:31,587
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be brand-new construction that would make it more affordable.

809
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:40,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that when you're talking about this subject matter, you need to start looking at other ways that we can bring residents in, businesses in, and really have a discussion.

810
01:11:40,975 --> 01:11:45,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at this point, it sounds like it's already a done deal, that there are some things you can do.

811
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:47,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can appeal it for the $15,000.

812
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:51,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it a negotiation time.

813
01:11:51,986 --> 01:11:52,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Negotiate.

814
01:11:53,127 --> 01:11:54,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's some things you don't want.

815
01:11:54,307 --> 01:11:55,487
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want as high.

816
01:11:55,507 --> 01:11:56,528
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want as many units.

817
01:11:56,568 --> 01:11:58,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want first floor in.

818
01:11:58,968 --> 01:12:01,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Or as I like to say, maybe you want an electric car station in.

819
01:12:01,709 --> 01:12:04,509
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whatever you might want is the opportunity to do it.

820
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:11,731
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that this board, this city council takes the opportunity to reevaluate, even though it's been through, even if that means appealing it.

821
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:13,912
[SPEAKER_01]: But appeal it with a goal in mind.

822
01:12:14,432 --> 01:12:15,332
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your end game?

823
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,333
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say no to development.

824
01:12:17,373 --> 01:12:19,053
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say we shouldn't develop anything.

825
01:12:19,488 --> 01:12:22,049
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you could say is, we want the retail.

826
01:12:22,929 --> 01:12:24,029
[SPEAKER_01]: We want certain things.

827
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:25,450
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a better quality of life.

828
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:34,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I'll just leave you with is, one of my questions to you is, can someone who lives in an apartment be considered an abutter?

829
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:37,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have the Luminaire right next to it.

830
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:39,934
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the Metro Public Housing.

831
01:12:39,994 --> 01:12:44,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's a certain piece of the land that's within 300 feet, but that's very close to it.

832
01:12:44,976 --> 01:12:47,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a tenant, or if you're on,

833
01:12:49,349 --> 01:12:57,011
[SPEAKER_01]: public housing, does that give you special, because there's some in the Mystic Apartments, does that give you the opportunity, the criteria to be in a butter?

834
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Or does it have to be physically your name on the deed of the property?

835
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:01,391
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be something you might want to ask as well.

836
01:13:01,672 --> 01:13:02,972
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you all for taking the time.

837
01:13:11,614 --> 01:13:12,114
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

838
01:13:12,274 --> 01:13:14,234
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

839
01:13:14,694 --> 01:13:16,195
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio.

840
01:13:16,215 --> 01:13:18,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 12 Yale Street.

841
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:20,938
[SPEAKER_06]: City of Medford.

842
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple of points that I'd like to make.

843
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:36,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to ramble, but with regards to an appeal from an abutter, an attorney, there are always large firms that have it in their

844
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:42,230
[SPEAKER_06]: realm to offer their services pro bono for different areas.

845
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:46,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe the people that may want to consider an appeal may want to look into that.

846
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:50,517
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a GoFundMe fund out there that could be utilized.

847
01:13:51,057 --> 01:14:00,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And that if the development is not going to benefit all the residents of the city of Medford, maybe they'll throw in $2, $5 or whatever.

848
01:14:01,005 --> 01:14:07,890
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing that bothers me about this development, several years back on Yale Street,

849
01:14:08,355 --> 01:14:13,459
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a couple of developers that came in and said, we can't build unless you let us build 200 units over there.

850
01:14:14,059 --> 01:14:14,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine?

851
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:20,603
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having trouble with 50 units over there now, about 50 units with parking and different things.

852
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:28,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine if they built two high rises they wanted to build at 200 apartments over there or 490 units?

853
01:14:29,169 --> 01:14:34,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's quite a bit, but I, I don't consider that to be a smart development.

854
01:14:34,673 --> 01:14:37,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see anything that's, um,

855
01:14:38,331 --> 01:14:43,173
[SPEAKER_06]: altruistic for the city of Medford are coming from the developer to the city.

856
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:44,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see that.

857
01:14:44,394 --> 01:14:46,615
[SPEAKER_06]: All I see is dollar signs with this developer.

858
01:14:47,415 --> 01:14:53,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm involved in a project right now for veterans that we're trying to get and build communities for them.

859
01:14:53,998 --> 01:15:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one that we're looking at 32 units in an adjacent city and another one for 42 units down in Westboro.

860
01:15:00,961 --> 01:15:03,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been working on these things for close to a year now.

861
01:15:03,782 --> 01:15:05,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't just happen like that.

862
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:08,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm confused at the Board of Appeals.

863
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I questioned, do they live in the city of Medford and know what's going on in the city?

864
01:15:13,603 --> 01:15:16,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, right now we're jammed up with an awful lot of traffic.

865
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,947
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got Mystic Avenue that's going through another development.

866
01:15:19,288 --> 01:15:21,409
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be putting retail stores.

867
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:24,952
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be putting apartments, what I understand, in businesses.

868
01:15:26,794 --> 01:15:33,500
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you go to West Medford and they knocked down 30 units on Canal Street, but they want to put 490 on Commercial Street.

869
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:36,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the right kind of a development for that area.

870
01:15:37,064 --> 01:15:40,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Development and building is good, puts people to work.

871
01:15:41,365 --> 01:15:47,127
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have people going to work, but we have to have something that's not going to have a problem when it's all done.

872
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:50,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, where are the people going to come when they have all these problems?

873
01:15:50,349 --> 01:15:51,029
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to come here.

874
01:15:51,049 --> 01:15:52,369
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to come to the city council.

875
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:53,410
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to go to the traffic.

876
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,610
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to go everywhere.

877
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:55,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

878
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And what kind of a life is that?

879
01:15:57,571 --> 01:16:00,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, it was a commercial on TV years ago.

880
01:16:01,009 --> 01:16:02,170
[SPEAKER_06]: The three boys eating breakfast.

881
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,070
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't want to eat the breakfast.

882
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:04,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, give it to Mikey.

883
01:16:04,992 --> 01:16:05,432
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll eat it.

884
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:08,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, throw it all down here in this section over here.

885
01:16:09,054 --> 01:16:10,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what the heck?

886
01:16:10,255 --> 01:16:11,136
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got enough.

887
01:16:12,056 --> 01:16:13,037
[SPEAKER_06]: The streets are jammed.

888
01:16:13,477 --> 01:16:14,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Golden Avenue.

889
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:16,239
[SPEAKER_06]: People can't get through Mystic Ave.

890
01:16:16,259 --> 01:16:17,420
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming up Golden Avenue.

891
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, this morning, there was a line from Willis Avenue all the way up to Main Street.

892
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just too congested.

893
01:16:24,805 --> 01:16:27,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they go ahead and build it, that's fine.

894
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:29,248
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not much you can do it unless you want to really fight it.

895
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:31,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not smart development.

896
01:16:32,712 --> 01:16:36,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody in the city was not nobody in the city.

897
01:16:37,795 --> 01:16:41,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I don't think was aware of it off of the community development.

898
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they throw back or the mayor throw back something and say, wait a minute, that's not the right fit for this particular thing.

899
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:48,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we, what about this?

900
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what about that?

901
01:16:49,921 --> 01:16:51,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like, is it a wham bam?

902
01:16:51,142 --> 01:16:51,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Sam.

903
01:16:51,762 --> 01:16:59,806
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it was done, but, uh, and then schools, if you have 490 units and you just take two and a half people, two and a half,

904
01:17:00,156 --> 01:17:01,037
[SPEAKER_06]: people per unit.

905
01:17:01,457 --> 01:17:02,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about 1300 people.

906
01:17:02,658 --> 01:17:14,147
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take one and a half times those people, divide it, you're going to have anywhere from 450 to maybe 600 additional students because they're building one, two and three bedroom units over there.

907
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:17,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be a crunch in the school system.

908
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:19,791
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a lot of things that should have been thought of.

909
01:17:20,312 --> 01:17:27,477
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the cows are already out of the barn and um, hopefully, I don't know, hopefully we'll survive this.

910
01:17:27,757 --> 01:17:28,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we will.

911
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:34,169
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's just not the right fit for this city because this is like Cabrini Green in Chicago.

912
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:36,290
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just too much down there.

913
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,650
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

914
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:46,993
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

915
01:17:47,093 --> 01:17:49,254
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

916
01:17:49,494 --> 01:17:50,575
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Robert Penter.

917
01:17:50,615 --> 01:17:53,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I live at zero summit road, former member of this August party.

918
01:17:54,176 --> 01:17:57,217
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we're not a city that's rising from the ashes.

919
01:17:58,395 --> 01:18:05,940
[SPEAKER_14]: There hasn't been a catastrophe in this city, and we shouldn't be looked upon as a community that the Trojan horses come in, which is development.

920
01:18:06,601 --> 01:18:10,683
[SPEAKER_14]: And development, just for the sake of development, doesn't mean it's always good for this community.

921
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:17,528
[SPEAKER_14]: When that decision was rendered this morning, I took all afternoon to review it, page by page, word by word.

922
01:18:18,248 --> 01:18:21,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Fourteen pages of a hastily written decision because

923
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:26,924
[SPEAKER_14]: The board, I believe, did not want to hear what this Medford City Council wanted to do.

924
01:18:27,264 --> 01:18:32,685
[SPEAKER_14]: And the city solicitor is absolutely right, because I've checked the cases and other cases that reflect upon the fact.

925
01:18:32,946 --> 01:18:39,227
[SPEAKER_14]: You folks, you are the master of the zoning of this city of Medford, not the board of appeals, because that's what they are.

926
01:18:39,607 --> 01:18:40,968
[SPEAKER_14]: People go to them on an appeal.

927
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,608
[SPEAKER_14]: But you folks, you write the zoning.

928
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:47,829
[SPEAKER_14]: The zoning begins and ends here, goes through whatever the process might be.

929
01:18:48,549 --> 01:18:51,130
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have every right to not only appeal this decision,

930
01:18:51,632 --> 01:18:54,153
[SPEAKER_14]: but to appeal it as loudly and as strongly as you can.

931
01:18:55,273 --> 01:19:04,295
[SPEAKER_14]: On page five of the decision, the commentary says it completes the zoning, the industrial zoning, except for heightened use.

932
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:11,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this is an industrial piece of property, which is allowed to have certain exemptions that you don't have.

933
01:19:12,017 --> 01:19:17,599
[SPEAKER_14]: But the heightened use relegates itself to the multiple dwelling portion.

934
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,141
[SPEAKER_14]: We can go back to 1988.

935
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:21,602
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a company called Asano and White.

936
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:31,750
[SPEAKER_14]: They did a, I think it was a $70,000, $80,000 report here in the city of Meffitt as it reflects upon housing, development, traffic impact, and water and sewer.

937
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:36,453
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Wellington Glenwood area was one of the particular areas that they did it on.

938
01:19:37,674 --> 01:19:41,057
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilman Marks alluded to the fact on page eight, the topography of the land.

939
01:19:41,937 --> 01:19:48,182
[SPEAKER_14]: The board says that a substantial part of the property, if it's not developed with multiple dwelling,

940
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:55,476
[SPEAKER_14]: In the ordinance, the industrial zone, in essence, will become inoperative because it'll just stay industrial and you can't do anything with it.

941
01:19:56,497 --> 01:20:00,761
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's one point that hasn't been said thus far, unless somebody else wants to say it later on.

942
01:20:01,242 --> 01:20:05,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget, when these folks came on March 31st and before that, they didn't say no to the development.

943
01:20:06,226 --> 01:20:07,307
[SPEAKER_14]: They were conciliatory.

944
01:20:07,828 --> 01:20:13,193
[SPEAKER_14]: They said, reduce the size of the project, make it smaller if you can, and I think the people could live with it.

945
01:20:14,117 --> 01:20:15,177
[SPEAKER_14]: But that didn't take place.

946
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:27,319
[SPEAKER_14]: If you read the decision regarding 7 Canal Street, the very last paragraph, as written by the board, basically says, and I read it, Mr. President.

947
01:20:27,879 --> 01:20:29,200
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of interesting, that decision.

948
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:37,621
[SPEAKER_14]: It says the following, in conclusion, the board is hopeful that the developer will reconsider the size and scope of the proposed apartment building.

949
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:43,062
[SPEAKER_14]: There is much to commend the overall project in such close proximity to public transportation

950
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:44,570
[SPEAKER_14]: including the commuter rail.

951
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:48,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, in that decision, they talked about the abutters that showed up.

952
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:55,214
[SPEAKER_14]: In this 14-page decision, there's nothing about an abutter that showed up, nothing about the concerns that they had.

953
01:20:55,714 --> 01:21:00,056
[SPEAKER_14]: All they talked about was the fact that this is going to be great for that particular area.

954
01:21:00,296 --> 01:21:06,919
[SPEAKER_14]: April 27th of this year, Mayor Burke of this community said this is a great project to develop a new neighborhood in this part of town.

955
01:21:06,939 --> 01:21:07,820
[SPEAKER_14]: We're excited about it.

956
01:21:08,725 --> 01:21:13,427
[SPEAKER_14]: But where is the transparency, the open public meeting on zoning of this nature?

957
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:17,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you folks have never had a development this large smack you in the face.

958
01:21:17,828 --> 01:21:23,310
[SPEAKER_14]: And since you've all been here, you've never had an audience like this who are so upset over the fact that they weren't a part of it.

959
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:24,810
[SPEAKER_14]: They're coming in after the fact.

960
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:28,111
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have been here before the fact, before this honorable body.

961
01:21:28,391 --> 01:21:33,093
[SPEAKER_14]: You folks wrote the law, and you should be well aware of what's going on upstairs in that Board of Appeals.

962
01:21:41,968 --> 01:21:47,454
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, in the decision, it's relegated to the terms.

963
01:21:48,155 --> 01:21:49,176
[SPEAKER_14]: They state the following.

964
01:21:50,358 --> 01:22:01,571
[SPEAKER_14]: We respect the fact that this zoning and site plan review fits the standards of this particular project.

965
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:05,092
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the wording of the zoning and the site plan review.

966
01:22:05,112 --> 01:22:12,498
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose of our zoning is to promote the health, safety, morals, convenience, and to lessen the danger from congestion and confusion.

967
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:14,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Site plan review states the following.

968
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:23,566
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose of this article is to promote development, which is harmonious with surrounding areas and adequate consideration of abutting land owners.

969
01:22:24,247 --> 01:22:26,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have abutting land owners here tonight.

970
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:29,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Where were their concerns is written in this document.

971
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:30,712
[SPEAKER_14]: It's nowhere to be found.

972
01:22:31,418 --> 01:22:35,420
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it's nowhere to be found here, it's quite obvious that they didn't take it into consideration.

973
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:42,283
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilman Marks, again, alluded to the fact that we relied on department head reports, and we relied on their reports.

974
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:50,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of interesting, the folks that, Vanessa Hagan, who was the consultant they had for the traffic study, is the same one that they had for Canal Street.

975
01:22:51,748 --> 01:22:54,831
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was only four stories high and for 30 units.

976
01:22:55,612 --> 01:23:01,338
[SPEAKER_14]: This is 490 units high, 490 units and five stories high.

977
01:23:01,838 --> 01:23:02,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Big difference.

978
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:03,920
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's get to the bottom line.

979
01:23:03,941 --> 01:23:05,362
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you going to have here for the bottom line?

980
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:07,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's the impact that's going to affect the neighborhood.

981
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:09,126
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what you're going to have.

982
01:23:09,146 --> 01:23:09,947
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have coal.

983
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:13,270
[SPEAKER_14]: If everybody's online and all the developments are coming on board.

984
01:23:13,617 --> 01:23:17,318
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll have Coles, you'll have Marshalls, you'll have Wegmans, you'll have Lumineer.

985
01:23:17,338 --> 01:23:23,401
[SPEAKER_14]: They just sold their building after one year for $66.6 million.

986
01:23:23,841 --> 01:23:25,821
[SPEAKER_14]: What makes you think these people may not do the same thing?

987
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:26,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Come in.

988
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:27,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Hawaii.

989
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:27,522
[SPEAKER_14]: See you later.

990
01:23:27,782 --> 01:23:28,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Make a fast buck.

991
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:29,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Who pays for it?

992
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:29,983
[SPEAKER_14]: The neighborhood.

993
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:32,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you're going to have the skating rink over there.

994
01:23:32,284 --> 01:23:33,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you're going to have the 490 units.

995
01:23:33,946 --> 01:23:37,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you're going to have eight commercial businesses, three apartment buildings.

996
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:41,795
[SPEAKER_14]: And now let's take a ride down Locust Street and bang a left and go to Wellington Circle.

997
01:23:42,096 --> 01:23:45,299
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have 200 more units of apartment housing going over there.

998
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,622
[SPEAKER_14]: And don't forget the casino when that opens up.

999
01:23:47,882 --> 01:23:49,184
[SPEAKER_14]: You put this all together.

1000
01:23:49,544 --> 01:23:53,807
[SPEAKER_14]: And you take Little Locust Street, which is a two-way street, it's going to make no sense at all.

1001
01:23:54,227 --> 01:24:00,091
[SPEAKER_14]: If this administration had any brains, they would have called you into that office over there, sat down with you and said, what do you think, guys?

1002
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:01,833
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what I think I'd like to see.

1003
01:24:02,173 --> 01:24:04,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we add or subtract to it and come up with a unified front?

1004
01:24:05,555 --> 01:24:10,560
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you have an administration that just goes on their own way and now you're here to pick up the slack.

1005
01:24:10,861 --> 01:24:11,641
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's the slack?

1006
01:24:11,882 --> 01:24:15,385
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have to take money and appeal it on behalf of the taxpayers.

1007
01:24:15,606 --> 01:24:27,358
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would expect you folks, do appeal it and do spend that money and send the message back to that office over there that you guys and gals are not patsies for someone else's administration when you're not even brought in and consulted.

1008
01:24:27,718 --> 01:24:30,739
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no transparency to what's going on in this city right now.

1009
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:34,381
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the perfect example when you look at a development such as this.

1010
01:24:34,681 --> 01:24:38,483
[SPEAKER_14]: This should never be happened without your consideration and consultation.

1011
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:55,792
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we get elected for one reason, or I got elected for one reason when I was on that side of the rail, to do the people's business.

1012
01:24:56,783 --> 01:24:59,266
[SPEAKER_14]: not to sit here and wonder what I'm supposed to do.

1013
01:24:59,506 --> 01:25:02,369
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're brand new, it's a learning process, then you better learn real quick.

1014
01:25:02,669 --> 01:25:03,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know what you're dealing with?

1015
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,011
[SPEAKER_14]: You're dealing with the taxpayers' money.

1016
01:25:05,231 --> 01:25:16,382
[SPEAKER_14]: You're dealing with their direction in how this city is supposed to go forward, whether it's on the school department side when you take that final vote, or whether it's on the city side when you're putting all your money together to find out in what direction are we going to be able to go.

1017
01:25:17,223 --> 01:25:18,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, you have a budget coming up right now.

1018
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:27,544
[SPEAKER_14]: And in this particular budget, as the councilor, Mr. Rumley alluded to, you should make the request tonight to put a minimum of $50,000 in there.

1019
01:25:27,604 --> 01:25:29,285
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to tell you the reason why.

1020
01:25:29,865 --> 01:25:38,889
[SPEAKER_14]: A few years ago, when I was on this city council, we had a decision to be made regarding Tufts University on a piece of land that they wanted to take and they wanted to use it.

1021
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:43,071
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was Foley, Holg, Elliott and Boston.

1022
01:25:43,492 --> 01:25:47,414
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was a hundred thousand dollars would cost the city, but the city won its case.

1023
01:25:47,994 --> 01:25:48,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1024
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:57,876
[SPEAKER_14]: because the council was determined when they took that vote that we weren't going to get pushed around and we weren't going to have the Dover Amendment used against us because it was inappropriate at that particular time.

1025
01:25:57,916 --> 01:26:00,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was 1991 or whatever it might be.

1026
01:26:01,202 --> 01:26:02,802
[SPEAKER_14]: But you've got to be realistic about this.

1027
01:26:02,822 --> 01:26:03,922
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to move ASAP.

1028
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:06,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus another thing, Mr. Rumley, you can correct me if I'm wrong.

1029
01:26:06,903 --> 01:26:10,864
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys and girls are going to come on board and appeal this case, you can ask for an extension of time.

1030
01:26:11,464 --> 01:26:12,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Same thing that the visiting nurses did.

1031
01:26:13,224 --> 01:26:22,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe they got a six-month extension of time when the taxpayers decided or the abutters decided to appeal this particular case.

1032
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:22,646
1985.

1033
01:26:25,406 --> 01:26:28,807
[SPEAKER_14]: In 1985, I made an offer of a resolution before this Method City Council.

1034
01:26:29,427 --> 01:26:30,147
[SPEAKER_14]: None of you were on it.

1035
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:33,338
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I'm still here, because I remember these things.

1036
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:34,461
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a bag full of tricks.

1037
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,881
[SPEAKER_14]: that tells me what to remember every single time, okay?

1038
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:47,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I made a resolution to put a moratorium on building and construction in the city of Medford because at that point in time, you had high-rise condominiums going up with no rhyme and no reason.

1039
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:55,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you didn't take a look and see where you wanted your city to go and the traffic impact it would have, the social impact, the educational impact.

1040
01:26:55,067 --> 01:26:56,888
[SPEAKER_26]: You have one minute, Mr. Pinto.

1041
01:26:57,348 --> 01:26:59,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And the educational impact, you would have no idea where you're going.

1042
01:27:00,609 --> 01:27:02,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And then again in 2005, I filed the same resolution.

1043
01:27:04,368 --> 01:27:09,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Miffitt City Council in both times approved it, and both times the city administration did not want to embark upon it.

1044
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:21,155
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it sounds nice to say, if this development takes place, I think we're going to get, here it goes, we're going to get approximately $1.5 million in building permits.

1045
01:27:21,175 --> 01:27:23,595
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get approximately $2 million in linkage.

1046
01:27:23,615 --> 01:27:25,416
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get approximately $1.375,000 in tax money.

1047
01:27:30,606 --> 01:27:34,210
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, money just for the sake of money should not make this city drive itself.

1048
01:27:35,243 --> 01:27:36,603
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what should drive this community?

1049
01:27:37,103 --> 01:27:39,044
[SPEAKER_14]: The heart of every single person in here.

1050
01:27:39,344 --> 01:27:46,166
[SPEAKER_14]: How you can get along, how you can live together, how your streets can be compatible, how your schools, your churches, and your neighbors can be compatible.

1051
01:27:46,846 --> 01:27:54,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to have a group of people come in here tonight, frustrated over the fact this is after the fact, and now you're picking up the ball and going forward.

1052
01:27:55,488 --> 01:27:56,468
[SPEAKER_14]: This should not be.

1053
01:27:56,868 --> 01:28:03,030
[SPEAKER_14]: They should be coming here tonight congratulating you because you stopped it early on and it came before you at an appropriate time.

1054
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:03,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1055
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:11,411
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope this is a warning, Mr. President, and all members of the council, that you go forward, hire the attorney, and I'm quite sure that you will win.

1056
01:28:11,771 --> 01:28:12,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

1057
01:28:12,592 --> 01:28:12,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1058
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:29,895
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1059
01:28:30,075 --> 01:28:31,915
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1060
01:28:32,577 --> 01:28:35,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark Davis, 232 Riverside Ave in Medford.

1061
01:28:35,818 --> 01:28:36,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to bark.

1062
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:39,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't bite like Mr. Pendleton, but I'm going to go easy.

1063
01:28:39,919 --> 01:28:46,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Not too long ago, every one of you were on the streets asking for our vote, shaking our hands, saying, we're going to be here for you.

1064
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,440
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want to see?

1065
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:48,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're coming to you.

1066
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,761
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we want.

1067
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:53,361
[SPEAKER_10]: You've all supported going forward and fighting this.

1068
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to know that you have our support.

1069
01:28:57,022 --> 01:29:01,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on Riverside Ave, and lately, with Luminaire and all the construction, all development,

1070
01:29:02,148 --> 01:29:04,309
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a game of chicken getting out of my own driveway.

1071
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:09,633
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to back into our driveway just to get out in the morning because of the traffic, you know, impact.

1072
01:29:11,434 --> 01:29:17,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And the heavy trucking, which is a resolution since 1978 that's been on the books and trucks keep flying down and down.

1073
01:29:19,559 --> 01:29:21,480
[SPEAKER_10]: We pull out and it's a game of chicken.

1074
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:30,506
[SPEAKER_10]: The only way to get from Luminaire to 93 North is either Riverside Ave or to deal with the traffic on Route 16.

1075
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:37,203
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't bring that into consideration to go down, you know, the amount of traffic that's going down to Riverside Ave to get to 93 North.

1076
01:29:38,464 --> 01:29:41,186
[SPEAKER_10]: We are heavily affected by just Luminaire alone.

1077
01:29:41,246 --> 01:29:48,951
[SPEAKER_10]: To see 490 units go in with an average of 1.5 cars per household, that's 735 more cars that's going to be in our neighborhood.

1078
01:29:49,491 --> 01:29:50,752
[SPEAKER_10]: That's definitely too much.

1079
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:52,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Then what's a shortcut?

1080
01:29:53,253 --> 01:29:54,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's cut through the school zone.

1081
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:56,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you ask, Mr. Marks, what's it going to cost?

1082
01:29:57,556 --> 01:29:59,317
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no money that's going to, you know,

1083
01:29:59,804 --> 01:30:05,709
[SPEAKER_10]: replace a child when the child gets hit because one person is late for work, and they bomb through the school zone, and they kill one of our kids.

1084
01:30:06,490 --> 01:30:11,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So I urge you all, make this proposal, let this go through, and let's save our city.

1085
01:30:11,914 --> 01:30:12,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1086
01:30:12,535 --> 01:30:14,356
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. Henson.

1087
01:30:14,376 --> 01:30:15,577
[SPEAKER_26]: Please, if you would, sign your name.

1088
01:30:22,883 --> 01:30:23,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1089
01:30:25,425 --> 01:30:25,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1090
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:28,291
[SPEAKER_25]: hope that we don't disturb the speakers.

1091
01:30:28,331 --> 01:30:32,912
[SPEAKER_25]: It takes most of us a lot to come up here to explain themselves.

1092
01:30:33,032 --> 01:30:36,393
[SPEAKER_25]: So if we could not interrupt the speakers.

1093
01:30:36,873 --> 01:30:37,253
[SPEAKER_25]: Welcome.

1094
01:30:37,573 --> 01:30:39,113
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1095
01:30:39,454 --> 01:30:39,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening.

1096
01:30:40,094 --> 01:30:43,775
[SPEAKER_23]: Christie Avino from 24 Carberry Street in Medford.

1097
01:30:45,313 --> 01:30:49,336
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for inviting us here this evening to give public comment on this project.

1098
01:30:49,796 --> 01:31:03,145
[SPEAKER_23]: Before I moved to Fulton Height two years ago, I lived and owned a home near the corner of Riverside Ave and Spring Street, so just about one block from Locust Street, where this proposed development is sited.

1099
01:31:03,786 --> 01:31:04,786
[SPEAKER_23]: I love that neighborhood.

1100
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:16,718
[SPEAKER_23]: I love being part of that neighborhood, and I wanted to share with you some of my experiences living there and my perspective of how this project will impact that wonderful neighborhood, that wonderful community.

1101
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:24,025
[SPEAKER_23]: Because the key part of the Zoning Board of Appeals decision is determining that this project is not a substantial detriment

1102
01:31:24,365 --> 01:31:25,105
[SPEAKER_23]: to the public good.

1103
01:31:25,345 --> 01:31:31,907
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think it's very important that we hear comment and share our opinion on how this project will impact our community.

1104
01:31:31,947 --> 01:31:39,509
[SPEAKER_23]: And I share this both as a homeowner, a city resident, a commuter to Boston, and a Medford public school parent as well.

1105
01:31:40,469 --> 01:31:47,851
[SPEAKER_23]: First of all, my primary concern is the impact that this project will have on the traffic in the area.

1106
01:31:48,131 --> 01:31:49,531
[SPEAKER_23]: It is an enormous project.

1107
01:31:49,591 --> 01:31:53,032
[SPEAKER_23]: It is one of the largest residential, private residential projects

1108
01:31:53,312 --> 01:31:56,875
[SPEAKER_23]: that I could find in our recent history, 490 units.

1109
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:04,580
[SPEAKER_23]: The other buildings up and down Mystic Valley Parkway are 172 units, 240 units.

1110
01:32:04,741 --> 01:32:13,647
[SPEAKER_23]: This project is nearly twice the size, over 700 parking spaces, which well exceeds what was currently at the Shaw's site.

1111
01:32:14,067 --> 01:32:18,191
[SPEAKER_23]: The traffic impact of this project cannot be underestimated.

1112
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:20,092
[SPEAKER_23]: Locust Street is a two-way street.

1113
01:32:20,412 --> 01:32:28,178
[SPEAKER_23]: So what I think is going to happen, because having lived there and commuted in the area, we're going to have traffic extending out to Route 16.

1114
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:31,901
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to have traffic extending onto Riverside Ave to get to Route 93.

1115
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:38,866
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to have traffic going over to Riverside, up Spring Street, down Salem Street to get onto 93 there.

1116
01:32:39,206 --> 01:32:41,087
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to be a massive traffic impact.

1117
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:47,212
[SPEAKER_23]: Because unlike Shaw's, where traffic comes and goes all day long, at that apartment complex, people are going to be leaving in the morning.

1118
01:32:47,632 --> 01:32:50,833
[SPEAKER_23]: and in the evening to go to school, to go to work, and to go to their activities.

1119
01:32:51,313 --> 01:32:55,075
[SPEAKER_23]: The traffic crush is going to be tremendous.

1120
01:32:55,255 --> 01:33:02,858
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think the traffic study that was proposed did not take into consideration the coming casino traffic and the coming Wegmans traffic.

1121
01:33:03,158 --> 01:33:05,419
[SPEAKER_23]: It is going to be an unbelievable increase.

1122
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:06,599
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's unknown.

1123
01:33:06,979 --> 01:33:07,639
[SPEAKER_23]: It's unknown.

1124
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:13,382
[SPEAKER_23]: So what we're buying here is something that's going to be an unknown impact combined with all of this other development.

1125
01:33:13,942 --> 01:33:16,903
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm absolutely in favor of smart development on that site.

1126
01:33:17,323 --> 01:33:19,465
[SPEAKER_23]: Nobody wants to see that site go unused.

1127
01:33:19,525 --> 01:33:29,394
[SPEAKER_23]: We all want something that's going to contribute to the community, a combination, a true combination of housing, of public services, of retail space, but it has to be smart development.

1128
01:33:29,694 --> 01:33:33,137
[SPEAKER_23]: This project was proposed, I believe, on April 18th.

1129
01:33:33,477 --> 01:33:36,520
[SPEAKER_23]: It was heard before the Zoning Board of Appeals on May 31st.

1130
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,121
[SPEAKER_23]: It was not publicized.

1131
01:33:38,381 --> 01:33:40,783
[SPEAKER_23]: The plans were not available to my knowledge on the website.

1132
01:33:41,044 --> 01:33:42,425
[SPEAKER_23]: This community has come together.

1133
01:33:42,885 --> 01:33:52,308
[SPEAKER_23]: both posting pictures of the plans on Facebook, interacting through various websites and emails, just to circulate information.

1134
01:33:52,428 --> 01:34:01,731
[SPEAKER_23]: Not enough information was provided to this community so that we could understand what this project is, and I know this council voiced that very opinion last week.

1135
01:34:02,371 --> 01:34:08,133
[SPEAKER_23]: In addition to the traffic that I talked about, there's going to be an unbelievable impact on public transportation.

1136
01:34:08,473 --> 01:34:11,414
[SPEAKER_23]: I know this site has been sold, this project has been sold,

1137
01:34:11,754 --> 01:34:13,736
[SPEAKER_23]: as a transit-oriented site, okay?

1138
01:34:13,756 --> 01:34:20,721
[SPEAKER_23]: But somebody who lived near that corner, I can tell you that commuting to and from Wellington is not easy.

1139
01:34:21,362 --> 01:34:23,283
[SPEAKER_23]: Very, very few people are going to walk.

1140
01:34:23,364 --> 01:34:25,765
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not possible to easily walk down Route 16.

1141
01:34:26,642 --> 01:34:34,403
[SPEAKER_23]: through station landing, up basically what's been an unpaved path for many, many years now, through a garage over to Wellington.

1142
01:34:34,704 --> 01:34:38,464
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not an easy walk, not to mention the dangers in crossing Wellington Circle.

1143
01:34:38,824 --> 01:34:40,785
[SPEAKER_23]: So you might think people are going to hop on the bus.

1144
01:34:41,125 --> 01:34:47,846
[SPEAKER_23]: But that bus, the 134 bus that goes from Medford Square to Wellington, it's standing room only in the morning.

1145
01:34:48,286 --> 01:34:49,306
[SPEAKER_23]: It's standing room only.

1146
01:34:49,326 --> 01:34:52,827
[SPEAKER_23]: And we all know that the MBTA is not increasing services.

1147
01:34:53,207 --> 01:34:54,508
[SPEAKER_23]: they're decreasing services.

1148
01:34:54,548 --> 01:35:02,374
[SPEAKER_23]: The impact and the availability of services is only, hopefully it will stay the same, but always faces the possibility of going down.

1149
01:35:02,514 --> 01:35:09,079
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think we can count on the MBTA to shuttle people from that development to Wellington Station every morning.

1150
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,721
[SPEAKER_23]: In addition, we have the impact on the schools.

1151
01:35:15,262 --> 01:35:26,429
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope the council is aware, and if you're not, this fall, I think most of the Medford public elementary schools are anticipating having excess capacity in the kindergarten classroom.

1152
01:35:26,509 --> 01:35:34,635
[SPEAKER_23]: Just last month at the Roberts School, the principal has already predicted that they're going to reach capacity, and then we'll need to address where the extra classroom.

1153
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:39,678
[SPEAKER_23]: Are we going to have to put modular classrooms at our elementary schools to accommodate the increase?

1154
01:35:39,978 --> 01:35:44,464
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, please don't be fooled when the developer says that this is a millennial-oriented project.

1155
01:35:44,684 --> 01:35:45,825
[SPEAKER_23]: Millennials have children.

1156
01:35:45,925 --> 01:35:47,227
[SPEAKER_23]: People want to live in Medford.

1157
01:35:47,267 --> 01:35:55,517
[SPEAKER_23]: We have great schools, but we need to ensure that our schools are going to be able to accommodate the increase in school children, and I've heard nothing about that.

1158
01:35:57,681 --> 01:36:04,463
[SPEAKER_23]: What's happening here is that we're going to allow development of a commercial parcel for residential use at half the tax rate.

1159
01:36:04,783 --> 01:36:14,525
[SPEAKER_23]: And what we're buying is going to be an increased commitment of services that the city is going to have to provide that far outweighs the benefit of the project as it's currently proposed.

1160
01:36:14,745 --> 01:36:23,947
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think we need another look at what the project is actually going to add in terms of value to the city and not overburdening our current services.

1161
01:36:25,068 --> 01:36:25,788
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1162
01:36:37,609 --> 01:36:38,270
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Chris.

1163
01:36:45,415 --> 01:36:45,855
[SPEAKER_26]: Welcome.

1164
01:36:45,935 --> 01:36:47,817
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1165
01:36:47,837 --> 01:36:51,139
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1166
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,881
[SPEAKER_33]: I live at 281 Park Street.

1167
01:36:55,022 --> 01:36:57,885
[SPEAKER_33]: I was the subject of the meeting this morning for the complaint.

1168
01:36:58,978 --> 01:37:03,819
[SPEAKER_33]: If anyone doesn't know yet, I think everyone knows, but I attended that meeting.

1169
01:37:03,879 --> 01:37:05,800
[SPEAKER_33]: There were more than a dozen residents.

1170
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,540
[SPEAKER_33]: Every seat in that room was full.

1171
01:37:08,461 --> 01:37:10,121
[SPEAKER_33]: And the abutters were there.

1172
01:37:10,161 --> 01:37:11,161
[SPEAKER_33]: They're here tonight again.

1173
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:12,042
[SPEAKER_33]: I recognize them.

1174
01:37:12,322 --> 01:37:17,363
[SPEAKER_33]: All stood up and said what address they lived on on Cumming Street and that they were opposed to this project.

1175
01:37:18,303 --> 01:37:25,205
[SPEAKER_33]: At approximately 10.30, Chairman Arena said, we have over 1,000 pages of documentation to review.

1176
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,922
[SPEAKER_33]: and we will be taking this matter under advisement.

1177
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:36,908
[SPEAKER_33]: At that point, all the citizens and the attorneys, the entire Equity One Army, they brought almost as many people as we had, about 15 people.

1178
01:37:38,597 --> 01:37:40,759
[SPEAKER_33]: Rose exited the room.

1179
01:37:41,319 --> 01:37:45,642
[SPEAKER_33]: No words were spoken by anyone on this board until the room was cleared.

1180
01:37:46,202 --> 01:37:53,847
[SPEAKER_33]: We were in the hallway, and Dennis McDool, I guess their secretary, came, closed the door, and said, we have much to discuss.

1181
01:37:54,248 --> 01:37:55,729
[SPEAKER_33]: We were not invited into the room.

1182
01:37:55,809 --> 01:37:57,570
[SPEAKER_33]: We did not know what was happening.

1183
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:01,913
[SPEAKER_33]: I am not an attorney, as Chairman Arena told me this morning.

1184
01:38:02,613 --> 01:38:03,934
[SPEAKER_33]: I knew, but he reminded me.

1185
01:38:04,555 --> 01:38:06,656
[SPEAKER_33]: So I don't know all the rules of open meeting laws.

1186
01:38:06,676 --> 01:38:14,302
[SPEAKER_33]: When someone closes a door and says we have much to discuss, a reasonable person would assume that you're not invited into this room.

1187
01:38:15,362 --> 01:38:29,312
[SPEAKER_33]: At that point, and every member of the board gave a different amount of time, either 20, 45, or 90 minutes later, 90 minutes would make it June 1st, because the meeting adjourned after 1030, they made the decision to unanimously

1188
01:38:30,393 --> 01:38:35,055
[SPEAKER_33]: passed all the variances, 11 variances, unprecedented amount of variances.

1189
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:43,418
[SPEAKER_33]: And in their haste to beat you all today, they sent out their certificate with an incorrect address on it.

1190
01:38:44,899 --> 01:38:48,480
[SPEAKER_33]: So they've actually granted a variance to build 490 units at 361 Locust Street.

1191
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:49,300
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know where that is.

1192
01:38:59,563 --> 01:39:06,027
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that may be in the middle of the Mystic, which I'm cool with if they want to build it there.

1193
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:08,749
[SPEAKER_33]: But, you know, the race was on.

1194
01:39:08,789 --> 01:39:15,033
[SPEAKER_33]: They were very gleeful this morning that, you know, we're done with this complaint and we'll be filing it right away.

1195
01:39:15,413 --> 01:39:22,218
[SPEAKER_33]: And when I said, well, there is a hearing, a meeting going on at City Council tonight, they'll be discussing this, and Chairman Noreen giggled.

1196
01:39:23,238 --> 01:39:28,902
[SPEAKER_33]: Several times during the meeting, he said, you know, it was a very informal discussion to vote to approve these variances.

1197
01:39:29,443 --> 01:39:32,505
[SPEAKER_33]: And he very proudly said, I believe I said, let's rock and roll.

1198
01:39:32,705 --> 01:39:35,567
[SPEAKER_33]: People, did I say let's rock and roll before we voted on this?

1199
01:39:36,128 --> 01:39:39,610
[SPEAKER_33]: So he clearly does not take this seriously.

1200
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:43,333
[SPEAKER_33]: He doesn't, he didn't take the consideration of any of the citizenry.

1201
01:39:43,953 --> 01:39:51,419
[SPEAKER_33]: And if you read this report, this decision, it reads 100% as if he works for the developer.

1202
01:39:53,132 --> 01:39:55,074
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, let's start on page six.

1203
01:39:56,656 --> 01:39:59,419
[SPEAKER_33]: The land is contaminated since the 90s.

1204
01:40:00,219 --> 01:40:04,544
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not allowed to be used for residential housing with gardens or playgrounds.

1205
01:40:05,545 --> 01:40:12,312
[SPEAKER_33]: It continues on to page seven, but hey, it'd be really expensive if he had to clean the site, so we're just going to pave it.

1206
01:40:13,293 --> 01:40:15,354
[SPEAKER_33]: Didn't we just fix the land on the DPW?

1207
01:40:15,655 --> 01:40:24,300
[SPEAKER_33]: I believe I sat in meetings where the estimates that the consultants exceeded $500,000 for the cleaning, but they're not going to clean it.

1208
01:40:24,781 --> 01:40:28,563
[SPEAKER_33]: Now my kid can't play here, but somebody else's kid is going to live here.

1209
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:33,767
[SPEAKER_33]: So in 10 years, will we be back that these children are developing cancer?

1210
01:40:35,397 --> 01:40:36,138
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm concerned.

1211
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:37,480
[SPEAKER_33]: They're not concerned.

1212
01:40:38,441 --> 01:40:45,888
[SPEAKER_33]: If you turn over to page 8, the zoning ordinance says if we make them follow the law, it will be a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the appellate.

1213
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:49,973
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm sorry, this is a board that works for the City of Medford.

1214
01:40:50,957 --> 01:40:52,718
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't care how much money the developer makes.

1215
01:40:53,238 --> 01:40:55,379
[SPEAKER_33]: How much is this going to cost me in extra police?

1216
01:40:55,979 --> 01:40:57,179
[SPEAKER_33]: Are we going to have the extra police?

1217
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:57,920
[SPEAKER_33]: Are we going to be short?

1218
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,140
[SPEAKER_33]: Are we going to have enough firemen?

1219
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:03,422
[SPEAKER_33]: If something's going on over there and then something happens on the other side of the city, are we going to be short?

1220
01:41:04,022 --> 01:41:05,462
[SPEAKER_33]: Are the schools going to be overrun?

1221
01:41:05,803 --> 01:41:07,363
[SPEAKER_33]: These are the things that I'm concerned about.

1222
01:41:07,423 --> 01:41:15,506
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not concerned about the man living on Park Avenue in New York City and if he loses a zero off of his project.

1223
01:41:16,246 --> 01:41:19,788
[SPEAKER_33]: The literal enforcement of this would reduce the project's capacity.

1224
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,371
[SPEAKER_33]: So there would be a substantial loss of dwelling units.

1225
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:28,213
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, I really, I'm not concerned.

1226
01:41:28,753 --> 01:41:36,756
[SPEAKER_33]: Why is it that this project is approved and practically applauded when in West Medford 30 units was too much?

1227
01:41:38,397 --> 01:41:39,077
[SPEAKER_33]: Way too much.

1228
01:41:39,617 --> 01:41:40,918
[SPEAKER_33]: Come back with something smaller.

1229
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:46,140
[SPEAKER_33]: This is 490 units and on page nine it says it's a vibrant mixed use

1230
01:41:48,166 --> 01:41:52,490
[SPEAKER_33]: project, 7,000 square feet total retail.

1231
01:41:53,391 --> 01:41:56,694
[SPEAKER_33]: 3,000 will be the existing Eastern Bank, which they'll move to the other side of the building.

1232
01:41:57,055 --> 01:42:01,179
[SPEAKER_33]: So we're talking 4,000 square feet of retail, convenience retail.

1233
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:05,623
[SPEAKER_33]: When someone asked at that meeting, would this be a coffee shop possibly?

1234
01:42:05,803 --> 01:42:06,123
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, no.

1235
01:42:06,764 --> 01:42:08,065
[SPEAKER_33]: We're not going to have a coffee shop.

1236
01:42:08,385 --> 01:42:10,668
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think we're looking at a convenience store and a dry cleaner.

1237
01:42:11,108 --> 01:42:13,571
[SPEAKER_33]: That's a fabulous addition to the neighborhood.

1238
01:42:13,911 --> 01:42:22,260
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the stations landing type development that Burke promised us in the article in the transcript before the May 18th meeting of the Community Coalition.

1239
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:26,024
[SPEAKER_33]: A dry cleaner in a convenience store?

1240
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:31,710
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know why anyone would want this or say this is anything like stations landing.

1241
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:33,212
[SPEAKER_33]: These are rental units.

1242
01:42:34,724 --> 01:42:36,969
[SPEAKER_33]: Millennials, I can tell you they own cars.

1243
01:42:37,149 --> 01:42:38,031
[SPEAKER_33]: They're going to park here.

1244
01:42:38,832 --> 01:42:42,780
[SPEAKER_33]: They want us to pay to build paths to Hormel so they can park their extra cars there.

1245
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:49,404
[SPEAKER_33]: They want us to pay to build a path to Cumming Street so these residents can have them walking through as they go to park in the neighborhoods.

1246
01:42:49,744 --> 01:42:54,705
[SPEAKER_33]: They're charging for the extra parking space for anyone that wants an extra parking space and units.

1247
01:42:55,085 --> 01:43:00,747
[SPEAKER_33]: So they'll be paying approximately $3,000 a month for a two-bedroom and an untold amount for a parking space.

1248
01:43:01,207 --> 01:43:06,808
[SPEAKER_33]: Do you think that they'll stay on their property or do you think that they'll explore the neighborhood and start parking there?

1249
01:43:11,168 --> 01:43:13,489
[SPEAKER_33]: This board did not consider the needs of the neighborhood.

1250
01:43:13,529 --> 01:43:17,171
[SPEAKER_33]: They did not consider the needs of the city, and the developers will come.

1251
01:43:17,511 --> 01:43:18,871
[SPEAKER_33]: They'll say, this is great.

1252
01:43:19,872 --> 01:43:24,354
[SPEAKER_33]: May 18th, they had a meeting, and the community development people said, oh, you're going to expand the water line?

1253
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:26,095
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll give you a $950,000 credit.

1254
01:43:26,115 --> 01:43:27,735
[SPEAKER_33]: Done deal.

1255
01:43:28,016 --> 01:43:29,016
[SPEAKER_33]: Can we vote on it now?

1256
01:43:29,276 --> 01:43:30,096
[SPEAKER_33]: I was at that meeting.

1257
01:43:30,156 --> 01:43:31,397
[SPEAKER_33]: That is literally what was said.

1258
01:43:33,178 --> 01:43:37,500
[SPEAKER_33]: May 31st, all the residents said no, and apparently,

1259
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:40,711
[SPEAKER_33]: This board does not work for the city of Medford.

1260
01:43:40,831 --> 01:43:45,354
[SPEAKER_33]: They work for the developer, because if you read this report, it reads like their attorney wrote it.

1261
01:43:45,714 --> 01:43:47,255
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, it's going to cost us money.

1262
01:43:47,275 --> 01:43:48,396
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, we're going to make less money.

1263
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:51,278
[SPEAKER_33]: That's not the concern of a Medford board.

1264
01:43:51,738 --> 01:43:54,880
[SPEAKER_33]: These boards need to work for Medford, or maybe it's time to step aside.

1265
01:43:55,961 --> 01:43:58,322
[SPEAKER_33]: Chairman Arena has been on this board for more than two decades.

1266
01:43:58,422 --> 01:43:59,323
[SPEAKER_33]: Maybe it's time to go.

1267
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:18,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Welcome.

1268
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:21,071
[SPEAKER_25]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1269
01:44:21,211 --> 01:44:22,771
[SPEAKER_31]: Loretta James Sherman Place.

1270
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:26,532
[SPEAKER_31]: I was at the Board of Appeals meeting.

1271
01:44:27,412 --> 01:44:31,413
[SPEAKER_31]: None of you were there, so I'd like to recap some things and some facts that I said.

1272
01:44:32,234 --> 01:44:36,375
[SPEAKER_31]: And also, there are a lot of people here that were at that meeting.

1273
01:44:37,695 --> 01:44:40,176
[SPEAKER_31]: And it was very hot that night.

1274
01:44:40,216 --> 01:44:42,276
[SPEAKER_31]: I think there were about 25 residents there.

1275
01:44:43,337 --> 01:44:44,497
[SPEAKER_31]: And we were opposed.

1276
01:44:45,508 --> 01:44:53,291
[SPEAKER_31]: Not because we didn't want development, but the type of development it was, and that it was not any benefit to the residents that lived there.

1277
01:44:54,051 --> 01:44:55,132
[SPEAKER_31]: There were several points.

1278
01:44:56,152 --> 01:44:58,073
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll try to go through them pretty quickly.

1279
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:06,577
[SPEAKER_31]: As a 490-unit apartment building with over 1,000 residents, I think 10% is set aside

1280
01:45:08,934 --> 01:45:11,475
[SPEAKER_31]: some maybe subsidized housing or low income.

1281
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:16,097
[SPEAKER_31]: I mentioned, well, you know, what is the benefit to the residents who live there?

1282
01:45:16,137 --> 01:45:21,478
[SPEAKER_31]: And I did pass this out and I'm not sure if you have this or not, but this is what they were.

1283
01:45:21,638 --> 01:45:37,564
[SPEAKER_31]: One of the things about chapter 94 city of Medford code of ordinances for the variance purpose to promote the health, safety, morals, convenience, and general welfare of its inhabitants to lessen the danger from fire congestion and confusion

1284
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:44,406
[SPEAKER_31]: and to improve and beautify the city under and pursuant to the provisions of MGLA, 40A, and all amendments.

1285
01:45:45,146 --> 01:45:54,494
[SPEAKER_31]: So I pass this out, and this is one of the ordinances that the Board of Appeals should have done, in my opinion.

1286
01:45:55,615 --> 01:46:00,960
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'd like to, if you don't have this, I'd like you, I couldn't make extra copies tonight,

1287
01:46:05,456 --> 01:46:09,579
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, when we're talking about residence, yes, we need housing.

1288
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:24,528
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe we could have a smaller development, I proposed, with 10 units set aside for veterans, 10 units that are handicap accessible, 40 units for below-market rents, and a mixed-use condominium and apartment development.

1289
01:46:25,068 --> 01:46:28,470
[SPEAKER_31]: And the reason is, we don't have enough housing in Massachusetts.

1290
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:35,114
[SPEAKER_31]: Why not have 35 condos at below-market rate for first-time homebuyers and be a HUD-certified property?

1291
01:46:35,575 --> 01:46:39,517
[SPEAKER_31]: But I was told later after the meeting that condominiums don't sell.

1292
01:46:40,538 --> 01:46:46,182
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, they're not from Massachusetts in the Boston metro area.

1293
01:46:46,482 --> 01:46:47,402
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's one of the things.

1294
01:46:47,462 --> 01:46:50,284
[SPEAKER_31]: I also contested their traffic analysis.

1295
01:46:51,285 --> 01:46:57,929
[SPEAKER_31]: And the traffic analysis said that the existing, if I take a few numbers, I'm sure people could help me.

1296
01:46:58,723 --> 01:47:05,507
[SPEAKER_31]: would be 15 to 26% more traffic on Riverside Ave based on the existing traffic now.

1297
01:47:06,088 --> 01:47:10,090
[SPEAKER_31]: My issue is, and others, is Wegmans is coming.

1298
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:12,852
[SPEAKER_31]: Wegmans will have 1,000 cars or more a day.

1299
01:47:13,312 --> 01:47:17,835
[SPEAKER_31]: The developer also said that they expected 3,600 in and outs of their property.

1300
01:47:18,415 --> 01:47:22,297
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're looking at 3,600, maybe 2,000 for Wegmans.

1301
01:47:22,657 --> 01:47:24,598
[SPEAKER_31]: And you can't turn on Locust Street now.

1302
01:47:24,678 --> 01:47:26,879
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not easily a turnable street.

1303
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:28,619
[SPEAKER_31]: The buses have a hard time turning.

1304
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:37,643
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think the number will be more like 80% on Riverside Ave, because they're not looking at the future traffic.

1305
01:47:38,143 --> 01:47:40,284
[SPEAKER_31]: A lot of these developers come into the city.

1306
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,565
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyone can come in and present a proposal.

1307
01:47:43,986 --> 01:47:45,906
[SPEAKER_31]: And they go through the different departments.

1308
01:47:48,394 --> 01:48:02,903
[SPEAKER_31]: One of the things that seems to be happening is we don't have a community meeting about these projects going on or a way of knowing about them if we don't read them into transcript or

1309
01:48:03,923 --> 01:48:12,747
[SPEAKER_31]: Even if we go online, I don't think we only see it in case there's a Board of Appeals meeting or a special public meeting online or maybe in the newspaper.

1310
01:48:13,167 --> 01:48:26,453
[SPEAKER_31]: So hearing today, and this is a little off from what I was going to say about all the different bad things about this project, is if this body, the City Council, is in charge of zoning and ordinances,

1311
01:48:26,913 --> 01:48:42,604
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to suggest that you consider a motion as of today to have any and all projects and developments become a public meeting or a way that the community can be involved.

1312
01:48:43,064 --> 01:48:44,225
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're aware of that.

1313
01:48:45,166 --> 01:48:56,033
[SPEAKER_31]: If that's what it takes that you make these decisions on zoning and ordinances and projects going through, why can't we have an ordinance or a rule that these projects have to be posted?

1314
01:48:56,507 --> 01:48:57,467
[SPEAKER_31]: somewhere online.

1315
01:48:58,488 --> 01:49:02,129
[SPEAKER_31]: There are many projects in the works now that are developments, and we don't know about them.

1316
01:49:03,509 --> 01:49:08,331
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think we might have had 1,000 people here today, or maybe 2,000.

1317
01:49:08,891 --> 01:49:18,274
[SPEAKER_31]: And the developer did say many times, this small residential area, meaning us, Riverside Ave and Spring Street, no, this affects all of Medford.

1318
01:49:18,714 --> 01:49:21,655
[SPEAKER_31]: And the problem is that most of the traffic

1319
01:49:23,648 --> 01:49:31,753
[SPEAKER_31]: and in the city, most of the people who work here, I think, on these development boards, whatever the department is, they don't live in our area, the Wellington area.

1320
01:49:32,213 --> 01:49:44,160
[SPEAKER_31]: So what happens is, I've actually spoken to a few people, oh, they'll use Route 16, they'll use Route 28, they'll get off at 93, they'll get off at Meadow Glen Assembly Row.

1321
01:49:45,288 --> 01:49:47,288
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I worked in Boston for years.

1322
01:49:47,628 --> 01:49:51,469
[SPEAKER_31]: If that's backed up, I'm getting off in Medford Square and I'm coming down Riverside Ave.

1323
01:49:51,709 --> 01:49:56,530
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm getting off in Medford Square and taking the rotary and going through Main Street to Spring Street to get down here.

1324
01:49:56,910 --> 01:49:58,450
[SPEAKER_31]: We can't handle that traffic.

1325
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:09,292
[SPEAKER_31]: So I did mention to the developer that since they don't have enough parking, and a lot of people don't know, 490 apartments, 790 spaces, one and a half spots per unit,

1326
01:50:15,088 --> 01:50:24,655
[SPEAKER_31]: that's five, six, 750 parking spots, four retail shops, and at least 50 to 80 more spots, where are the guests?

1327
01:50:25,516 --> 01:50:32,461
[SPEAKER_31]: If 100 people have 100 guests, what you notice, we need another 200 to 300 parking spots.

1328
01:50:32,802 --> 01:50:37,646
[SPEAKER_31]: These are all of the things that were brought up at the Board of Appeals meeting.

1329
01:50:38,486 --> 01:50:44,671
[SPEAKER_31]: And I also said, well, if that's the case, and this goes through, then they should really consider paying for all the permitted parking

1330
01:50:44,987 --> 01:50:54,069
[SPEAKER_31]: for all the streets up Spring Street for this development, because we will have to go to permitted parking, because they're all going to come up there for parking.

1331
01:50:54,469 --> 01:50:56,849
[SPEAKER_31]: Wegmans won't have enough parking for all their guests.

1332
01:50:57,269 --> 01:51:03,091
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, imagine if 250 apartments at the holidays have four guests or three guests.

1333
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:05,431
[SPEAKER_31]: That's four or 500, where are they going to go?

1334
01:51:05,911 --> 01:51:06,951
[SPEAKER_31]: There's no place to go.

1335
01:51:07,271 --> 01:51:08,492
[SPEAKER_31]: So I didn't see any benefit.

1336
01:51:10,092 --> 01:51:10,673
[SPEAKER_31]: in most of us.

1337
01:51:11,453 --> 01:51:12,434
[SPEAKER_31]: How does it benefit us?

1338
01:51:12,795 --> 01:51:21,843
[SPEAKER_31]: They're not putting in a swimming pool or tennis courts or a clubhouse that we could buy a pass for occasionally to use, you know, when they're residents aren't used.

1339
01:51:22,203 --> 01:51:23,164
[SPEAKER_31]: There is no benefit.

1340
01:51:24,445 --> 01:51:32,633
[SPEAKER_31]: If it's half the size, like I said before, I'm just repeating myself, excuse me, and it's condominiums and it's first-time homebuyers and it adds

1341
01:51:33,661 --> 01:51:39,243
[SPEAKER_31]: to the city and 50% of the employees will come from the city of Medford if they're qualified.

1342
01:51:40,323 --> 01:51:41,624
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, there's so many things.

1343
01:51:41,944 --> 01:51:54,048
[SPEAKER_31]: So I think I would love to see the city council propose something that all projects in the city become public on the city website or whoever does this so we can be involved.

1344
01:51:54,548 --> 01:51:57,969
[SPEAKER_31]: And here's the other thing someone had mentioned to me today.

1345
01:51:59,263 --> 01:52:13,077
[SPEAKER_31]: about this variance, excuse me, and Jean had mentioned for me to look up the Commonwealth of Mass zoning, chapter 48, section 10 on variances.

1346
01:52:13,967 --> 01:52:19,230
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'd like to submit this, and I wasn't here last week because I didn't know about the meetings.

1347
01:52:20,131 --> 01:52:20,871
[SPEAKER_31]: That's another thing.

1348
01:52:21,251 --> 01:52:25,054
[SPEAKER_25]: And it tells about... If you want to pass that to the messenger, and he will submit it for the record.

1349
01:52:25,074 --> 01:52:28,055
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, and it says, desirable... The messenger will take it from you.

1350
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:28,476
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right.

1351
01:52:28,836 --> 01:52:29,716
[SPEAKER_25]: Where is the messenger?

1352
01:52:29,996 --> 01:52:37,701
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think... I think that was all.

1353
01:52:39,443 --> 01:52:41,903
[SPEAKER_31]: I hope you have a good picture of what happened.

1354
01:52:42,364 --> 01:52:47,284
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't think, I think they closed the doors at the end of the Board of Appeals meeting to discuss other things.

1355
01:52:48,465 --> 01:53:04,987
[SPEAKER_31]: We weren't privy to that, you know, so I'm just appalled that the answer was done so quickly and that they didn't mention the residents when I was also here for the Canal Street Board of Appeals meeting and that they did recognize what the residents.

1356
01:53:05,027 --> 01:53:08,068
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm not sure what is going on with that, but it just seems wrong.

1357
01:53:08,948 --> 01:53:09,788
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you for listening.

1358
01:53:16,810 --> 01:53:17,930
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much, Loretta.

1359
01:53:30,693 --> 01:53:31,093
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1360
01:53:31,153 --> 01:53:32,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1361
01:53:33,174 --> 01:53:34,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1362
01:53:34,614 --> 01:53:37,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street in Medford.

1363
01:53:38,008 --> 01:53:40,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank all the people that came out and spoke tonight.

1364
01:53:41,609 --> 01:54:07,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope that, you know, with this audience and focus on this issue, I would hope that more residents in the auditorium tonight and watching at home would pay a lot more attention to what goes on in the city of Medford on their website, because this is one in a sea of issues that escapes a lot of people in their everyday lives, that if more people came out and spoke like this so eloquently,

1365
01:54:07,871 --> 01:54:09,791
[SPEAKER_11]: as have tonight that came before me.

1366
01:54:11,232 --> 01:54:17,553
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot more good government and a lot more good stewardship of the people's money would take place in the city of Medford.

1367
01:54:17,993 --> 01:54:19,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to address three quick points.

1368
01:54:20,394 --> 01:54:24,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Communication, affordable housing, and money.

1369
01:54:25,015 --> 01:54:30,436
[SPEAKER_11]: On communication, obviously, this Zoning Board of Appeals seriously dropped the ball.

1370
01:54:30,756 --> 01:54:33,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if they took into account the full city of Medford,

1371
01:54:34,142 --> 01:54:39,786
[SPEAKER_11]: in the streets and roads, the police department falling apart, the school facade, this building right here.

1372
01:54:40,126 --> 01:54:45,749
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot more serious issues to address first before we bring in a 490 unit.

1373
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:50,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my street alone, I just found out tonight that, you know,

1374
01:54:51,928 --> 01:55:00,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I came up before this council a few weeks ago that Evans Street is one of the top five streets, and Evans Street is a stone's throw from this project.

1375
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:09,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, with this traffic that's gonna develop, you're gonna see more people trying to avoid the long lines and going down some of these other side streets like mine.

1376
01:55:10,132 --> 01:55:20,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the Honorable Adam Knight sent me a message that bidding on my street ended, and they were gonna choose, but I come to find out, the meeting on Saturday morning, that nothing's moving forward on that.

1377
01:55:20,714 --> 01:55:24,221
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no plans to do any construction or fixing of that street.

1378
01:55:24,582 --> 01:55:29,533
[SPEAKER_11]: The water pipes in Medford, the gas pipes, there's a lot more serious issues to look at first.

1379
01:55:30,046 --> 01:55:31,907
[SPEAKER_11]: before the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1380
01:55:32,628 --> 01:55:34,229
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think Sheryl Rodriguez was right.

1381
01:55:34,729 --> 01:55:37,131
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't written by Medford for Medford.

1382
01:55:37,151 --> 01:55:40,813
[SPEAKER_11]: It was written by this body that wants to come in and make some change.

1383
01:55:41,374 --> 01:55:41,994
[SPEAKER_11]: That's first.

1384
01:55:43,335 --> 01:55:44,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Communication is awful.

1385
01:55:45,236 --> 01:55:46,297
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that simple.

1386
01:55:46,677 --> 01:55:48,198
[SPEAKER_11]: The second point is affordable housing.

1387
01:55:49,099 --> 01:55:53,962
[SPEAKER_11]: There's other ways of making things affordable for the citizens of Medford.

1388
01:55:54,923 --> 01:55:59,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Meals tax, sales tax, income tax, property tax, that goes up every year.

1389
01:55:59,366 --> 01:56:04,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Next month starts the Community Preservation Act, which is an end-run to around the property two and a half tax.

1390
01:56:05,269 --> 01:56:09,871
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a surcharge on the property taxes that have gone up for every year for nearly 30 years.

1391
01:56:10,331 --> 01:56:19,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Reduce some of these taxes, make it more affordable for the citizens of Medford, people to want to move here, businesses to want to move here through tax incentive.

1392
01:56:20,535 --> 01:56:24,497
[SPEAKER_11]: With more people moving in, you'll find that the city will actually have reduced tax rates,

1393
01:56:24,757 --> 01:56:26,477
[SPEAKER_11]: would probably take in more revenues.

1394
01:56:26,917 --> 01:56:27,898
[SPEAKER_11]: That's number two.

1395
01:56:28,618 --> 01:56:29,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three is money.

1396
01:56:30,158 --> 01:56:38,040
[SPEAKER_11]: You're talking about hiring a lawyer if this resolution is passed and the cost that's going to be on the city.

1397
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:38,980
[SPEAKER_11]: What cost?

1398
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,980
[SPEAKER_11]: You're having a free cash account, what?

1399
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,721
[SPEAKER_11]: A surplus of almost $10 million?

1400
01:56:43,561 --> 01:56:46,481
[SPEAKER_11]: How many millions in surplus is this city sitting on?

1401
01:56:47,142 --> 01:56:47,922
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our money.

1402
01:56:48,122 --> 01:56:49,622
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already paid for the lawyer.

1403
01:56:50,802 --> 01:56:53,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Their money has already been given to this city.

1404
01:56:53,323 --> 01:56:54,363
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you talking about?

1405
01:56:56,463 --> 01:56:59,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, one last question through the chair for the city solicitor.

1406
01:56:59,904 --> 01:57:12,046
[SPEAKER_11]: If this board does vote to pass a resolution to appeal, then the mayor has to approve it or is she automatically bound by the resolution?

1407
01:57:12,406 --> 01:57:15,287
[SPEAKER_11]: The president is shaking his head no.

1408
01:57:15,607 --> 01:57:22,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you're saying is this city council could pass a resolution and the mayor could possibly shoot it down and the appeal is gone.

1409
01:57:23,092 --> 01:57:24,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you're telling me, Mr. President?

1410
01:57:26,553 --> 01:57:28,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't use those words, but yes.

1411
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:32,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1412
01:57:32,595 --> 01:57:38,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure you would use much more congenial words, and I appreciate your candor and good judgment.

1413
01:57:38,697 --> 01:57:52,222
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that if that does become the situation, and it does get dismissed, not approved, kindly disregarded by Her Honor the Mayor, then when you come to a city budget,

1414
01:57:53,213 --> 01:58:02,911
[SPEAKER_11]: You should actually use the power of the city council to have some bite, to speak up for these people that are in this audience tonight that want action for their money and their votes.

1415
01:58:02,991 --> 01:58:03,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1416
01:58:12,357 --> 01:58:12,917
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1417
01:58:12,977 --> 01:58:13,337
[SPEAKER_26]: Welcome.

1418
01:58:13,357 --> 01:58:15,378
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1419
01:58:15,398 --> 01:58:15,758
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1420
01:58:15,798 --> 01:58:16,798
[SPEAKER_35]: My name is Linda Brown.

1421
01:58:16,838 --> 01:58:19,139
[SPEAKER_35]: I live at 28 Cumming Street in Medford.

1422
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:21,339
[SPEAKER_35]: I've lived in Medford most of my life.

1423
01:58:21,859 --> 01:58:25,360
[SPEAKER_35]: I was a river rat from the projects back in the 50s.

1424
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:29,101
[SPEAKER_35]: My parents lived there as veterans project, one of the first families to move in.

1425
01:58:29,721 --> 01:58:33,342
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm quite familiar with the area and the people that live there.

1426
01:58:34,422 --> 01:58:40,307
[SPEAKER_35]: I did attend, I'd seen the transcript with this huge article of this massive build and development they wanted to put in.

1427
01:58:41,168 --> 01:58:42,949
[SPEAKER_35]: I said, whoa, what is this thing?

1428
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:47,633
[SPEAKER_35]: I went to the first meeting when I saw it, the community development meeting.

1429
01:58:48,715 --> 01:58:53,781
[SPEAKER_35]: And I sat there for two hours in room 201 on hard chairs with a bad back.

1430
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:55,402
[SPEAKER_35]: But I sat there anyways.

1431
01:58:56,103 --> 01:59:01,649
[SPEAKER_35]: And I listened to the dog and pony show that was conducted by the developers that went on and on and on and on and on.

1432
01:59:02,030 --> 01:59:05,333
[SPEAKER_35]: Of course, most of the audience in that room that night were the developers.

1433
01:59:06,214 --> 01:59:08,257
[SPEAKER_35]: Very few residents, because nobody knew about the meeting.

1434
01:59:09,964 --> 01:59:13,209
[SPEAKER_35]: So I was going to attend the next meeting, which was the zoning meeting.

1435
01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:25,906
[SPEAKER_35]: And that meeting there, once I found out that it wasn't in here, that it was going to be held in room 201 on an 80 some odd degrees night, OK, and another dog and pony show was to be conducted.

1436
01:59:26,727 --> 01:59:29,009
[SPEAKER_35]: From what I hear now, it was three hours I didn't go.

1437
01:59:29,529 --> 01:59:32,291
[SPEAKER_35]: I could not sit there in a hot room for that many hours.

1438
01:59:32,792 --> 01:59:36,094
[SPEAKER_35]: That is totally ridiculous and the people did not know about this meeting.

1439
01:59:36,815 --> 01:59:47,103
[SPEAKER_35]: I went around to my neighborhood last week when I found out what was going on with this other stuff and the zoning boards and the variances that they wanted to overcome.

1440
01:59:47,887 --> 01:59:51,228
[SPEAKER_35]: to get this project going without us knowing anything, okay?

1441
01:59:51,868 --> 01:59:54,830
[SPEAKER_35]: My neighbors, some of them didn't even know about the project.

1442
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:58,291
[SPEAKER_35]: I went up to one of my neighbors and he said, what are you talking about?

1443
01:59:58,971 --> 02:00:06,814
[SPEAKER_35]: I said, they want to put 490 units down here, the end of our street, a street that has no sidewalks, okay?

1444
02:00:06,834 --> 02:00:13,336
[SPEAKER_35]: The people that walk down the street, they have to walk in the middle of the street, because Cumming Street's a private way, no sidewalks.

1445
02:00:13,597 --> 02:00:17,338
[SPEAKER_35]: We have a small little open at the end that we used to go to Shores to do our shopping with.

1446
02:00:17,598 --> 02:00:18,638
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll cut through to go to the mall.

1447
02:00:19,058 --> 02:00:19,479
[SPEAKER_35]: That's it.

1448
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:21,179
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a small street.

1449
02:00:21,859 --> 02:00:24,380
[SPEAKER_35]: We don't need a 490-unit development here.

1450
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:25,680
[SPEAKER_35]: It's too big.

1451
02:00:26,601 --> 02:00:27,581
[SPEAKER_35]: We need something else.

1452
02:00:27,681 --> 02:00:29,161
[SPEAKER_35]: I know something else has to go in there.

1453
02:00:29,701 --> 02:00:33,463
[SPEAKER_35]: But the way this is being held and handled, it's totally ridiculous.

1454
02:00:34,123 --> 02:00:35,183
[SPEAKER_35]: I never come to meetings.

1455
02:00:35,543 --> 02:00:36,443
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not an attorney.

1456
02:00:36,803 --> 02:00:39,484
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm just a person that lives in this city, and I love this city.

1457
02:00:39,964 --> 02:00:45,626
[SPEAKER_35]: But I'll be damned if they're going to let this thing go through without us having to say, thank you.

1458
02:01:03,609 --> 02:01:04,230
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, welcome.

1459
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:05,991
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1460
02:01:06,291 --> 02:01:11,875
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Roseanne Ronchetti, and I live at 54 Cummings Street in Method.

1461
02:01:13,376 --> 02:01:15,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be very brief.

1462
02:01:15,457 --> 02:01:18,299
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the speakers tonight have done a wonderful job.

1463
02:01:18,519 --> 02:01:24,003
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there's really anything more I can say that's going to add to what's already been said.

1464
02:01:24,503 --> 02:01:29,807
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I am a direct abutter to the property.

1465
02:01:32,168 --> 02:01:35,509
[SPEAKER_13]: It's practically in my side yard.

1466
02:01:37,649 --> 02:01:41,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not want 492 new neighbors.

1467
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:45,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm quite happy with the wonderful neighbors I have in our neighborhood.

1468
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:59,128
[SPEAKER_13]: One, which would be right beside my house.

1469
02:01:59,148 --> 02:02:01,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I could probably reach out and touch it.

1470
02:02:02,289 --> 02:02:02,989
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how close.

1471
02:02:03,609 --> 02:02:04,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm right on the line.

1472
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:08,051
[SPEAKER_13]: My property abuts that development.

1473
02:02:10,811 --> 02:02:11,512
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what to say.

1474
02:02:11,532 --> 02:02:20,194
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to ask each and every one of you, if you had one of these developments going up next to your house, how many of you would be for it?

1475
02:02:21,035 --> 02:02:21,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a question.

1476
02:02:22,115 --> 02:02:22,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you like that?

1477
02:02:23,916 --> 02:02:24,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you want that?

1478
02:02:26,983 --> 02:02:28,224
[SPEAKER_13]: I love living in Medford.

1479
02:02:28,244 --> 02:02:30,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I love living on Cummings Street.

1480
02:02:30,325 --> 02:02:31,465
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a quiet street.

1481
02:02:31,865 --> 02:02:32,946
[SPEAKER_13]: We all get along.

1482
02:02:33,706 --> 02:02:34,607
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to leave.

1483
02:02:34,887 --> 02:02:36,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been there for 30 years.

1484
02:02:36,107 --> 02:02:37,468
[SPEAKER_13]: I think maybe I already said that.

1485
02:02:38,108 --> 02:02:38,909
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do not.

1486
02:02:39,869 --> 02:02:46,432
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not in favor of a 492-unit development.

1487
02:02:47,633 --> 02:02:48,673
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not right.

1488
02:02:49,474 --> 02:02:56,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just causing me extreme anxiety over even thinking about living in practically

1489
02:02:56,896 --> 02:03:01,919
[SPEAKER_13]: a construction site for the length of time that it would take to build that development.

1490
02:03:02,739 --> 02:03:03,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1491
02:03:23,289 --> 02:03:25,330
[SPEAKER_26]: There's a gentleman who hasn't had a chance to speak yet.

1492
02:03:25,390 --> 02:03:26,631
[SPEAKER_26]: Why don't we allow him to come up?

1493
02:03:27,127 --> 02:03:29,467
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, please state your name and address for the record.

1494
02:03:29,487 --> 02:03:30,148
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is J.M.B.

1495
02:03:30,168 --> 02:03:31,868
[SPEAKER_36]: 35 Greenhall Street, Medford.

1496
02:03:33,828 --> 02:03:49,892
[SPEAKER_36]: I wish the Board of Appeals would be as lenient and forgiving when mom and dad want to add a porch or a ramp to their house, and they don't have two feet to do it.

1497
02:03:49,952 --> 02:03:56,853
[SPEAKER_36]: So therefore, people want to put an in-law apartment in because, hey, we're getting older.

1498
02:03:57,808 --> 02:03:59,169
[SPEAKER_36]: We want to take care of our parents.

1499
02:04:00,529 --> 02:04:05,231
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, no, you can't do that because, you know, we care about the people.

1500
02:04:06,251 --> 02:04:08,132
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, that's a lot of whatever.

1501
02:04:09,372 --> 02:04:11,233
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. D'Antonio brought up a good point.

1502
02:04:12,454 --> 02:04:14,434
[SPEAKER_36]: New development going up on Mystic Ave.

1503
02:04:14,454 --> 02:04:16,135
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know if you people know about that.

1504
02:04:16,175 --> 02:04:19,116
[SPEAKER_36]: They're talking hotels, apartments, businesses.

1505
02:04:19,136 --> 02:04:24,218
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know if anybody's been around Riverside and Locust Street lately.

1506
02:04:25,018 --> 02:04:26,719
[SPEAKER_36]: Export towing is no longer there.

1507
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:28,819
[SPEAKER_36]: Where are they going?

1508
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:31,000
[SPEAKER_36]: What is going to happen to the property?

1509
02:04:31,961 --> 02:04:32,601
[SPEAKER_36]: Any guesses?

1510
02:04:34,682 --> 02:04:35,562
[SPEAKER_36]: More apartments.

1511
02:04:38,464 --> 02:04:45,106
[SPEAKER_36]: You've already had three variances given for three buildings by one owner on Locust Street already for apartments.

1512
02:04:45,647 --> 02:04:50,449
[SPEAKER_36]: Nice small size apartment, didn't upset the traffic flow all that much.

1513
02:04:51,369 --> 02:04:55,811
[SPEAKER_36]: For an industrial zone section there, you're going to have another 490 units.

1514
02:04:55,831 --> 02:04:57,452
[SPEAKER_36]: That's not going to impact the schools at all.

1515
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:02,939
[SPEAKER_36]: McGlynn, I believe, is at capacity.

1516
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,680
[SPEAKER_36]: Columbus, I believe, is at capacity.

1517
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:11,522
[SPEAKER_36]: So when we have a new development, residential development on Mystic Gap, where are those kids going to go to school?

1518
02:05:13,603 --> 02:05:16,184
[SPEAKER_36]: Where are the kids from Locust Street going to go to school?

1519
02:05:16,964 --> 02:05:20,565
[SPEAKER_36]: And where are the kids from the new Riverside and Locust Street development?

1520
02:05:20,665 --> 02:05:26,307
[SPEAKER_36]: It's going to happen within maybe two years, maybe three, depending on how some of the property sales go.

1521
02:05:27,428 --> 02:05:29,409
[SPEAKER_36]: So you're going to have another whole new development there.

1522
02:05:29,629 --> 02:05:32,430
[SPEAKER_36]: Can you guess the magnitude that they're going to want to put up there?

1523
02:05:35,091 --> 02:05:38,633
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, you're still talking local street, still two lanes.

1524
02:05:39,333 --> 02:05:39,854
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm sorry.

1525
02:05:39,874 --> 02:05:47,757
[SPEAKER_36]: Uh, in my previous life, the one area I wouldn't work in Medford was the Wellington area because of the traffic congestion.

1526
02:05:47,977 --> 02:05:49,358
[SPEAKER_36]: You couldn't save lives on time.

1527
02:05:52,930 --> 02:05:54,051
[SPEAKER_36]: That was then.

1528
02:05:54,631 --> 02:05:55,732
[SPEAKER_36]: That was 20 years ago.

1529
02:05:56,032 --> 02:05:58,294
[SPEAKER_36]: Do you know initially there was another sector?

1530
02:05:58,414 --> 02:06:01,576
[SPEAKER_36]: I know Councilor Falco mentioned four sectors in Method.

1531
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:03,058
[SPEAKER_36]: Method used to have six sectors.

1532
02:06:05,619 --> 02:06:09,402
[SPEAKER_36]: When I got on the job, there were over 100 patrolmen, I believe.

1533
02:06:10,683 --> 02:06:11,664
[SPEAKER_36]: We've got, what, 60, 70 now?

1534
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:21,822
[SPEAKER_36]: People coming in, you think all those units, just like station landing, station landing, everybody thought was going to be a big boom.

1535
02:06:22,382 --> 02:06:26,104
[SPEAKER_36]: They're going to rent it out and sell it out and all that stuff there.

1536
02:06:27,244 --> 02:06:36,688
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, unfortunately, that didn't come to pass because there were a lot of vacant apartments and condos over there that had to be leased, some of them back to the state.

1537
02:06:38,068 --> 02:06:39,609
[SPEAKER_36]: The same thing's probably going to happen over there.

1538
02:06:40,129 --> 02:06:45,131
[SPEAKER_36]: Nothing wrong with that, but everybody has these big plans for millennials coming in.

1539
02:06:46,876 --> 02:06:47,396
[SPEAKER_36]: That's nice.

1540
02:06:47,416 --> 02:06:49,017
[SPEAKER_36]: You're going to say millennials only.

1541
02:06:50,998 --> 02:06:52,018
[SPEAKER_36]: You don't know what you're going to get.

1542
02:06:52,038 --> 02:06:53,479
[SPEAKER_36]: You're going to have kids down there.

1543
02:06:53,499 --> 02:06:57,961
[SPEAKER_36]: You're going to have a new development that's going to be before this council.

1544
02:06:59,582 --> 02:07:03,724
[SPEAKER_36]: And like I said, another couple of years for God knows how many more units right up at the corner of that street.

1545
02:07:05,184 --> 02:07:06,525
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's face reality people.

1546
02:07:06,545 --> 02:07:11,287
[SPEAKER_36]: You're going to have a casino, which everybody's complaining about.

1547
02:07:12,623 --> 02:07:15,125
[SPEAKER_36]: All this development, all this, you've heard it all before.

1548
02:07:15,746 --> 02:07:21,290
[SPEAKER_36]: But there's gonna be another development up there on Riverside and Salem, Riverside and Locust.

1549
02:07:21,971 --> 02:07:29,137
[SPEAKER_36]: There's gonna be another one over there at Mystic Gav, across from the, from Barnard Ave and all that stuff.

1550
02:07:29,677 --> 02:07:31,299
[SPEAKER_36]: So you people decide what you're gonna do.

1551
02:07:31,659 --> 02:07:33,180
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't need any more schools, do we?

1552
02:07:36,483 --> 02:07:38,485
[SPEAKER_36]: That's where our money's gonna go.

1553
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:42,711
[SPEAKER_36]: If I pay for more schools, you don't have the property.

1554
02:07:44,051 --> 02:07:49,072
[SPEAKER_36]: Because the city, when they purged the last schools, didn't keep any of them.

1555
02:07:49,573 --> 02:07:50,193
[SPEAKER_36]: No forethought.

1556
02:07:51,173 --> 02:07:53,114
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, have a wonderful evening.

1557
02:07:59,035 --> 02:08:01,876
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, please state your name and address for the record.

1558
02:08:01,896 --> 02:08:04,517
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Sam Collins, live at 172 Jerome Street.

1559
02:08:05,957 --> 02:08:08,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Medford resident for about 30 years.

1560
02:08:09,435 --> 02:08:37,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in construction for about 18 years, and the report, I haven't read it in as much detail as the council, but from everything I'm hearing, it's really, it's a lot of hot air, and I'm not gonna digress, and I'm not gonna get into details, unless I misunderstand, it seems like most of the people in this room, if not all of the council, are not necessarily opposed to the project, but opposed to parameters of this project, so I don't wanna preach to the choir, okay?

1561
02:08:37,211 --> 02:08:38,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're all on the same page

1562
02:08:38,905 --> 02:08:48,311
[SPEAKER_07]: something should be done to slow this down so we can skip the traffic talk and the resident, the schools, all valid points, all very grave concerns, but I think that we can skip that.

1563
02:08:49,932 --> 02:08:53,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just very disturbed by the zoning board's actions.

1564
02:08:53,874 --> 02:08:58,697
[SPEAKER_07]: As the previous gentleman said very well, they're not so lenient for anyone else.

1565
02:08:59,278 --> 02:09:04,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I just finished two years ago, I built an addition under my parents' house to live in, and it was a nightmare.

1566
02:09:04,601 --> 02:09:07,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in construction 18 years, it was a nightmare, I'll never do it again.

1567
02:09:08,362 --> 02:09:18,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to bring my little job back to the drawing board after I had already moved into my parents' house with my family to undergo construction because I was intruding two feet into my driveway.

1568
02:09:18,404 --> 02:09:25,045
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said it's either three to six months to possibly get a variance, which is still not guaranteed, or you can redraw to comply.

1569
02:09:25,506 --> 02:09:28,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I redrew to comply because who's got three to six months to wait?

1570
02:09:28,786 --> 02:09:30,567
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys have what?

1571
02:09:30,887 --> 02:09:37,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct me if I'm wrong, anybody, but April they have a meeting, May they have the hearing, and then a week and a half later,

1572
02:09:38,275 --> 02:09:40,937
[SPEAKER_07]: They have approval, and then this morning, they slip it in under the door.

1573
02:09:42,778 --> 02:09:44,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone's getting a kickback, or they're fools.

1574
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:45,660
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think they're fools.

1575
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:46,381
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting a kickback.

1576
02:09:46,901 --> 02:09:49,203
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been in construction almost 20 years.

1577
02:09:49,263 --> 02:09:50,784
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a kickback deal.

1578
02:09:50,804 --> 02:09:54,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Smile on his face, giving taxes, not getting amenities.

1579
02:09:54,507 --> 02:09:55,367
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no courtyard.

1580
02:09:55,407 --> 02:09:56,068
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no parks.

1581
02:09:56,448 --> 02:09:59,290
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not getting upgraded utilities for the streets.

1582
02:09:59,310 --> 02:10:00,191
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not fixing the streets.

1583
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:01,351
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a joke.

1584
02:10:01,452 --> 02:10:04,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not directed towards you, obviously, and a lot of respect for the council.

1585
02:10:04,914 --> 02:10:06,315
[SPEAKER_07]: But the zoning board, something is up there.

1586
02:10:06,675 --> 02:10:14,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a follow-up to that, and I'm not trying to light a fire necessarily, but let me tell you, these guys are all laughing at us right now.

1587
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:15,161
[SPEAKER_07]: They're laughing at us in this room.

1588
02:10:15,181 --> 02:10:16,661
[SPEAKER_07]: They're laughing at you on this side of the rail.

1589
02:10:17,082 --> 02:10:17,762
[SPEAKER_07]: They're laughing at us.

1590
02:10:18,242 --> 02:10:20,644
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going through, haha, they're going to make millions.

1591
02:10:21,084 --> 02:10:22,385
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys are going to get millions.

1592
02:10:22,405 --> 02:10:23,226
[SPEAKER_07]: These aren't condos.

1593
02:10:23,586 --> 02:10:28,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody else said eloquently, more eloquently than I can, that nobody's getting ownership.

1594
02:10:28,589 --> 02:10:29,910
[SPEAKER_07]: If at least it's condos, at least

1595
02:10:30,297 --> 02:10:35,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's investing, and they're going to get that equity, and they're making something of themselves in Medford.

1596
02:10:35,763 --> 02:10:37,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to build out of my parents' house to get that.

1597
02:10:37,365 --> 02:10:37,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1598
02:10:37,605 --> 02:10:39,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can't afford to buy in Medford.

1599
02:10:39,227 --> 02:10:39,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a good job.

1600
02:10:40,008 --> 02:10:41,029
[SPEAKER_07]: My wife works full time.

1601
02:10:41,349 --> 02:10:42,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't afford to buy in Medford.

1602
02:10:42,671 --> 02:10:47,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell me nobody will develop that lot when we have some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

1603
02:10:47,536 --> 02:10:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's going to move here and build here?

1604
02:10:49,098 --> 02:10:50,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, I don't think so.

1605
02:10:52,196 --> 02:10:57,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess next I would say, sort of side note, somebody mentioned a redevelopment authority, which is what that's called.

1606
02:10:57,541 --> 02:11:03,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Other municipalities and cities and towns do this, Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, Boston Redevelopment Authority.

1607
02:11:03,566 --> 02:11:14,316
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't necessarily have to make every project public, but I would implore the council to form a Medford Redevelopment Authority that does any large scale project over a dollar value or square footage does come before.

1608
02:11:14,416 --> 02:11:18,540
[SPEAKER_07]: And they coordinate this stuff with the community and nothing will be issued until it goes through the Medford

1609
02:11:18,857 --> 02:11:19,758
[SPEAKER_07]: redevelopment authority.

1610
02:11:19,778 --> 02:11:20,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a great idea.

1611
02:11:21,398 --> 02:11:26,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't know if letters, did a butters receive this letter that they're supposed to receive?

1612
02:11:26,021 --> 02:11:31,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm noticing the notification of the development that everybody received that letter.

1613
02:11:31,784 --> 02:11:42,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that, as far as I know, again, to intrude two feet into my driveway, my own driveway, I had to send a written letter to everybody within 300 feet of my property as the other gentlemen, I think Mr. Penta pointed out.

1614
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:42,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

1615
02:11:44,145 --> 02:11:48,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know where the requirements and how do people get to skip these requirements.

1616
02:11:49,308 --> 02:12:05,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, if there is any avenue that this council has to cease and desist the development or file an injunction until these matters are resolved, all these improprieties in the procedure that other citizens are held accountable to, but they're not held accountable to, and they're not residents of Medford.

1617
02:12:06,197 --> 02:12:07,377
[SPEAKER_07]: So I won't go on and on.

1618
02:12:09,066 --> 02:12:13,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I would take great offense if I were you to the zoning board's actions slipping in this morning.

1619
02:12:14,049 --> 02:12:15,590
[SPEAKER_07]: They were all laughing at you with the developers.

1620
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:18,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's his name, Arietta, who's the head of the zoning board?

1621
02:12:18,311 --> 02:12:20,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's having a drink with the developer tonight.

1622
02:12:20,793 --> 02:12:21,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Guaranteed.

1623
02:12:21,553 --> 02:12:36,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So good luck, and you have my support in shutting this down.

1624
02:12:36,262 --> 02:12:36,362
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi.

1625
02:12:36,402 --> 02:12:37,923
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1626
02:12:38,478 --> 02:12:39,378
[SPEAKER_01]: My name's Jay Campbell.

1627
02:12:39,838 --> 02:12:41,299
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 707 Fulton Street.

1628
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:42,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And mine is actually more just a quick thing.

1629
02:12:43,479 --> 02:12:46,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Evidently, there's people watching from home because I've received questions.

1630
02:12:47,160 --> 02:13:00,603
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I brought up was, if you live in Mystic Place Apartments, Luminaire Apartments, or if you're in the Section 8 type housing, does that qualify you as an abutter?

1631
02:13:01,023 --> 02:13:04,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if the city council or the city solicitor or someone could answer that.

1632
02:13:04,404 --> 02:13:07,645
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you could at some point, because some of the people would like to know.

1633
02:13:08,996 --> 02:13:21,680
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I just want to bring up, if this does go through, whether it does or it doesn't, that maybe someone could take a look at replacing the lights with the traffic rotary, because I know sometimes it does speed things along faster.

1634
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:28,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other point, too, I meant to bring up earlier, because my son goes to McGlynn, and thanks to Council Caviello,

1635
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:31,523
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very excited today because I gave him books.

1636
02:13:31,743 --> 02:13:33,967
[SPEAKER_01]: He went around to all the schools and gave out books, so thank you for that.

1637
02:13:34,007 --> 02:13:38,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we're all standing here complaining, but I just want people to know that good things are happening too.

1638
02:13:38,414 --> 02:13:38,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

1639
02:13:47,103 --> 02:14:03,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just speaking with someone and they asked me to come up and point out that in all of the development, if we could start to consider a little bit more religiously our seniors and senior development.

1640
02:14:03,962 --> 02:14:06,764
[SPEAKER_03]: they seem to be being left out of the discussions.

1641
02:14:07,485 --> 02:14:23,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that when they met with the council, I'm sorry, the board, there was a question on low income, there was a question on veteran, but we seem to be forgetting about our aging population and they account for, I believe, according to the latest census, roughly 38 to 40%.

1642
02:14:25,179 --> 02:14:28,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, I don't know if this will be a popular suggestion, but

1643
02:14:29,883 --> 02:14:39,390
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could be made aware, if the funds aren't made available, perhaps we could set up a Medford Advocacy GoFundMe page to support the efforts if we had to.

1644
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:43,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that would be a donation well spent.

1645
02:14:43,233 --> 02:14:44,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So just something to consider.

1646
02:14:49,958 --> 02:14:50,418
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1647
02:14:50,438 --> 02:14:52,299
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1648
02:14:52,319 --> 02:14:53,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1649
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:54,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Betty Lowe, 34 Gibson Street.

1650
02:14:56,959 --> 02:14:58,261
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a long-term resident of Medford.

1651
02:14:58,281 --> 02:14:59,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been here since 1992.

1652
02:14:59,603 --> 02:15:05,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been around here long enough to remember the Barker Steel factory that was right next to, that was abutting my property.

1653
02:15:07,958 --> 02:15:12,781
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also a millennial, one of those oft-discussed millennials.

1654
02:15:17,123 --> 02:15:20,325
[SPEAKER_12]: So I live in Medford here, and I work and play in Somerville in Cambridge.

1655
02:15:20,525 --> 02:15:28,250
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just seems a little bit ridiculous to me, given from my perspective, that this seems to be a giveaway of Medford land.

1656
02:15:29,085 --> 02:15:41,272
[SPEAKER_12]: to this developer who's in all likelihood probably going to flip this condo complex, just as what has happened with Lumiere and with so many of these condos that are coming up in the greater Boston area.

1657
02:15:42,212 --> 02:15:43,813
[SPEAKER_12]: My first home was in Chinatown.

1658
02:15:44,373 --> 02:15:49,357
[SPEAKER_12]: in Boston, and I have watched it get basically eaten alive by all these developers.

1659
02:15:50,377 --> 02:15:51,978
[SPEAKER_12]: All these small businesses are being forced out.

1660
02:15:52,058 --> 02:15:55,181
[SPEAKER_12]: All these low-income residents are being forced out.

1661
02:15:55,521 --> 02:16:04,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Boston is now one of the most unequal cities in terms of income in the United States, and it breaks my heart to see all that happen in my hometown.

1662
02:16:04,947 --> 02:16:13,753
[SPEAKER_12]: because of bad policy, because of, I don't know, possibly kickbacks, which it seems to me may be happening in this city as well.

1663
02:16:14,093 --> 02:16:23,239
[SPEAKER_12]: It's ridiculous that the zoning board is this unaccountable to the people, it operates in this much secrecy, in this much darkness, and it's...

1664
02:16:25,110 --> 02:16:45,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And our own mayor, the mayor that we elected, thinking that she was going to bring some fresh breath of air to the city or whatever, that she was going to bring mixed retail developments to the city, when in fact we're getting not even 7,000 square feet, because about half of it is going to go to Eastern Bank in this development.

1665
02:16:45,582 --> 02:16:50,969
[SPEAKER_12]: We're gonna get like 3,000 to 4,000 square feet of retail development and the rest of it is gonna be just luxury condos.

1666
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:55,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, I'm sorry, 90% of it will be luxury condos, 10% will be, you know, accessible.

1667
02:16:56,495 --> 02:16:56,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Apartments.

1668
02:16:57,617 --> 02:16:58,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Apartments, sorry.

1669
02:16:58,438 --> 02:17:00,861
[SPEAKER_12]: In any case, it's...

1670
02:17:02,412 --> 02:17:12,515
[SPEAKER_12]: All that I've heard today, all the research that I've done, all the homework that I've done catching up about this case in the two and a half hours this afternoon, it's just been very disheartening to see.

1671
02:17:13,996 --> 02:17:31,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, the lack of accountability from the zoning board, the fact that I feel like the city council has not done enough to protect the residents and the city from encroaching developers who want to just take our land, build these huge developments on it that are easy to flip, and then flip it, and then leave, and then never again be accountable to us.

1672
02:17:31,983 --> 02:17:32,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that they ever really were.

1673
02:17:36,465 --> 02:17:39,487
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, actually, I wanted to bring up something.

1674
02:17:40,187 --> 02:17:47,051
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed that on one of the zoning board members is Yvette Velez, and that name really rang a bell to me.

1675
02:17:47,651 --> 02:17:58,417
[SPEAKER_12]: I graduated from Suffolk University, and she is actually the director of Off-Campus Housing, the OCHO office, the Off-Campus Housing Office, that's what it's called.

1676
02:17:59,677 --> 02:18:11,362
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it really makes me wonder, you know, what stake does she have, you know, as the director of this... It's appropriate not to impugn anyone at this rail.

1677
02:18:11,762 --> 02:18:12,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, okay.

1678
02:18:13,763 --> 02:18:16,984
[SPEAKER_12]: I just thought that was very interesting that it just came up in my research.

1679
02:18:18,244 --> 02:18:25,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I... Yeah, and again, I was just...

1680
02:18:30,303 --> 02:18:43,509
[SPEAKER_12]: And going back to the development, I read about these real estate tax breaks that were going to be given to the developer, all this reduction in the linkage fees, the reduction in the access paths around the property.

1681
02:18:44,450 --> 02:18:49,892
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just, again, wondering, why does this feel like such a huge giveaway to these developers?

1682
02:18:51,273 --> 02:18:55,235
[SPEAKER_12]: My parents bought our property in Medford for about $140,000 in 1992.

1683
02:18:55,555 --> 02:19:02,578
[SPEAKER_12]: It is now 2016, and it is worth, yeah, wow, wow, and it is now worth half a million.

1684
02:19:02,698 --> 02:19:04,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I looked up on Zillow.com because I got curious.

1685
02:19:04,599 --> 02:19:07,840
[SPEAKER_12]: It is worth half a million dollars now, up from $140,000 in 1992, and, you know, we can't

1686
02:19:12,242 --> 02:19:19,529
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't get developers that are better for the city, better for the long-term residents here, that better serve all of us?

1687
02:19:19,789 --> 02:19:21,571
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't get those kind of developments in here?

1688
02:19:21,971 --> 02:19:22,912
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds ridiculous.

1689
02:19:23,252 --> 02:19:31,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I have friends who are jealous of where I live, because, again, I work and play in Cambridge and Somerville, and I live in Medford, and they're like, oh my god, you get to live in Medford?

1690
02:19:32,861 --> 02:19:36,585
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a really, really desirable area, and I feel like this is just a huge giveaway to the developers.

1691
02:19:37,145 --> 02:19:42,427
[SPEAKER_12]: And I cannot believe that our zoning board, the zoning board that's supposed to work for us, is facilitating this.

1692
02:19:42,968 --> 02:19:47,349
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's all I have to say.

1693
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:48,210
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1694
02:20:02,356 --> 02:20:04,398
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1695
02:20:04,658 --> 02:20:05,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1696
02:20:05,119 --> 02:20:06,680
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Pasquale Nuzzo.

1697
02:20:06,961 --> 02:20:12,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I live at 35 Paris Street, and I'm also a general contractor.

1698
02:20:12,146 --> 02:20:22,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I've built small to mid-sized scale projects, and this is the first time personally that I've ever heard

1699
02:20:23,479 --> 02:20:34,173
[SPEAKER_05]: of a business that wants to build something using the fact that they can't make enough money as a reason for an exception to build on anywhere.

1700
02:20:34,934 --> 02:20:40,521
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like going to your boss and saying that you're not paying me enough so you have to double my salary.

1701
02:20:40,541 --> 02:20:41,963
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to look at you and laugh.

1702
02:20:43,062 --> 02:20:49,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the city's job to make sure that every Tom, Dick, and Harry makes a profit on their buildings.

1703
02:20:50,568 --> 02:20:52,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a buyer beware market.

1704
02:20:53,570 --> 02:20:57,653
[SPEAKER_05]: You do your due diligence, you look at the property, and you assess.

1705
02:20:57,913 --> 02:21:01,076
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't just walk in and say, well, we could build the 200 units.

1706
02:21:03,646 --> 02:21:13,091
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll make maybe a couple of million, or we can declare a hardship and say, oh, we have to put up 490 units so that we make even more money.

1707
02:21:13,731 --> 02:21:18,153
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not our job to make people make money, especially on this scale.

1708
02:21:18,654 --> 02:21:24,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And with all the breaks and everything, I just want to talk one more thing about the legal fees for this.

1709
02:21:25,457 --> 02:21:32,681
[SPEAKER_05]: What we need to look at as a city and as taxpayers is not just the cost of a lawsuit to stop this project.

1710
02:21:33,081 --> 02:21:48,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to look at every day, the half an hour, hour, or whatever it adds on to a commute to get into our job, those times that we could be spending with our families, the times that we can be spending asleep or getting a good breakfast, all those times.

1711
02:21:49,900 --> 02:22:17,924
[SPEAKER_05]: That amount of time we're going to be missing out on because somebody's over stuffing our city their traffic survey only Discussed two lights the traffic light at the beginning of Locust Street and at the end of Locust Street And they were saying oh if we read time those two lights our problem over here is no there's no problem anymore But then you go down the street to Wellington Circle or even closer and you've just messed up that traffic down that line They don't care about anything beyond

1712
02:22:18,865 --> 02:22:23,188
[SPEAKER_05]: the property lines that they're building to the last square inch on.

1713
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:36,721
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to destroy so many aspects of our city, infrastructurally, just a lifestyle is going to be completely different in this city just from one structure.

1714
02:22:37,201 --> 02:22:42,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't believe that that is in any way, shape, or form good for the people that live here.

1715
02:22:42,786 --> 02:22:43,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for your time.

1716
02:22:57,482 --> 02:22:57,842
[SPEAKER_26]: Go ahead, Andrew.

1717
02:23:00,163 --> 02:23:02,703
[SPEAKER_26]: The chair recognizes the gentleman from East Medford.

1718
02:23:04,404 --> 02:23:07,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Honorable President.

1719
02:23:10,005 --> 02:23:13,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1720
02:23:13,646 --> 02:23:20,167
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I didn't write this down, but a friend of mine closer to City Hall here

1721
02:23:21,886 --> 02:23:27,649
[SPEAKER_09]: He received a reverse 911 call, I guess, about, it's a robocall, is that what happened tonight?

1722
02:23:29,029 --> 02:23:38,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I live like three blocks further east, even closer to this proposed development, and I have not received any robocall.

1723
02:23:38,434 --> 02:23:44,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually, my friend Sergeant Barry Clemente calls for a lot of things, but I didn't get it.

1724
02:23:44,457 --> 02:23:50,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, if it wasn't for Mr. Captain Barry Clemente and the IRS, nobody would call me, for God's sakes.

1725
02:23:51,597 --> 02:23:53,278
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, it's neither here nor there.

1726
02:23:57,879 --> 02:24:00,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but East Medford matters too.

1727
02:24:02,721 --> 02:24:13,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not against progressive development, but 490-unit apartment building is huge, way too huge for my side of town.

1728
02:24:14,605 --> 02:24:20,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Traffic is heavy now before Wetman's Assembly Road is fully

1729
02:24:21,933 --> 02:24:31,698
[SPEAKER_09]: developed, and the casino opens with 18,000 vehicles daily alone, just the casino alone, 18,000.

1730
02:24:31,738 --> 02:24:38,202
[SPEAKER_09]: The Board of Appeals approved this?

1731
02:24:41,363 --> 02:24:41,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

1732
02:24:43,224 --> 02:24:44,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe that can happen.

1733
02:24:46,246 --> 02:24:47,186
[SPEAKER_09]: What were they thinking?

1734
02:24:47,727 --> 02:24:48,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Inhaling?

1735
02:24:53,396 --> 02:24:59,057
[SPEAKER_09]: This size project is overkill in a New York minute.

1736
02:25:02,858 --> 02:25:22,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's take a Medford moment and get the scale down to 150,000 square feet, which must include a smart commercial mixed use of 50,000 with a coffee shop too, please.

1737
02:25:24,668 --> 02:25:31,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stunned and I'm at a loss for any nice words for this matter.

1738
02:25:31,153 --> 02:25:32,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for listening.

1739
02:25:38,843 --> 02:25:41,225
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again from 281 Park Street.

1740
02:25:41,685 --> 02:25:49,750
[SPEAKER_33]: I just had one further point that I wanted to make regarding the meeting for the complaint that I had filed that was held this morning.

1741
02:25:50,911 --> 02:25:52,512
[SPEAKER_33]: I was not invited to this meeting.

1742
02:25:52,732 --> 02:25:57,234
[SPEAKER_33]: An attorney from Equity One was present, so clearly they were invited to this meeting.

1743
02:25:57,254 --> 02:25:59,196
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is just further evidence.

1744
02:25:59,856 --> 02:26:04,040
[SPEAKER_33]: that this board feels that they work for the developer and not the citizens of Medford.

1745
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:07,744
[SPEAKER_33]: My address was clearly printed on the top of my complaint.

1746
02:26:08,284 --> 02:26:10,186
[SPEAKER_33]: My phone number was on the bottom.

1747
02:26:12,128 --> 02:26:15,491
[SPEAKER_33]: They actually saw me bring the complaint, Dennis, the secretary.

1748
02:26:16,072 --> 02:26:17,513
[SPEAKER_33]: I was not invited to the meeting.

1749
02:26:17,913 --> 02:26:21,117
[SPEAKER_33]: I had to find out about the meeting from someone else.

1750
02:26:22,057 --> 02:26:22,238
[SPEAKER_33]: So,

1751
02:26:24,194 --> 02:26:25,295
[SPEAKER_33]: They're not considering us.

1752
02:26:25,515 --> 02:26:26,995
[SPEAKER_33]: They're only considering the developer.

1753
02:26:27,055 --> 02:26:30,357
[SPEAKER_33]: If there's a way to unseat this board, it should be explored.

1754
02:26:30,417 --> 02:26:35,340
[SPEAKER_33]: More than 20 years, he should feel like Medford is his home and he needs to protect it.

1755
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:40,822
[SPEAKER_33]: But to come down with a decision on the side for the developer this strong, we really need to look at that.

1756
02:26:40,842 --> 02:26:47,986
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi.

1757
02:26:48,046 --> 02:26:49,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1758
02:26:49,847 --> 02:26:50,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

1759
02:26:50,725 --> 02:26:51,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, good evening.

1760
02:26:51,486 --> 02:26:52,828
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Balram Chamaria.

1761
02:26:52,988 --> 02:26:54,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 258 Main Street.

1762
02:26:54,450 --> 02:27:02,459
[SPEAKER_00]: I have come to know about this meeting only through messaging service that we have through 9-1-1 call.

1763
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:04,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, what's going on?

1764
02:27:04,702 --> 02:27:07,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had heard about this thing because I'm in the trade.

1765
02:27:08,186 --> 02:27:08,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I design buildings.

1766
02:27:11,067 --> 02:27:21,233
[SPEAKER_00]: On curiosity, I had asked Equity One to share their plans with us, because on the website, Medford City website says, plans are available for viewing in the city.

1767
02:27:21,774 --> 02:27:22,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kind of are?

1768
02:27:22,754 --> 02:27:26,817
[SPEAKER_00]: We're entering 21st century, so we could have all that online, but we didn't have that.

1769
02:27:27,697 --> 02:27:31,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gentlemen saw my email, but didn't respond to it.

1770
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:34,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, OK, maybe that's where it stops.

1771
02:27:35,522 --> 02:27:37,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, out of sight, out of mind.

1772
02:27:39,545 --> 02:27:41,266
[SPEAKER_00]: but now I'm hearing all these things.

1773
02:27:41,366 --> 02:28:08,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not gone through the decisions or the plans or anything, but one thing I can see clearly is if this thing goes through, and with the words that I'm hearing from the decision-making, we are setting a very dangerous precedence here, because the amount of, the kind of variances being awarded, and the size of this project, and you know,

1774
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:24,433
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things add together, it's a very dangerous precedence towards for future development, because now they can say, look back, saying, look at that reasoning, look at that what else you gave, and if you can give it to them, why not now?

1775
02:28:24,733 --> 02:28:35,222
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can, now we are in a bind where we are not following a procedure, and now, I don't know, maybe there are a lot of lawsuits for us in future.

1776
02:28:35,422 --> 02:28:37,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only this particular project,

1777
02:28:37,853 --> 02:28:48,076
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I think, we should look in the future, because there's a lot of empty land in Medford, which can be, you know, and we are very close to Boston, do not, to be lucrative for a lot of more development.

1778
02:28:48,536 --> 02:28:57,458
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I want to kind of shed some light, if I can, that we could be setting ourselves up for more exploitation in the future.

1779
02:28:57,839 --> 02:28:58,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

1780
02:28:58,739 --> 02:28:59,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1781
02:29:04,741 --> 02:29:06,161
[SPEAKER_26]: She had declared a 10-minute recess.

1782
02:30:17,474 --> 02:30:18,915
[SPEAKER_26]: The council meeting will reconvene.

1783
02:30:28,821 --> 02:30:31,943
[SPEAKER_26]: Madam Clerk, please note the time that the council meeting reconvened.

1784
02:30:34,565 --> 02:30:35,746
[SPEAKER_26]: With all members present.

1785
02:30:58,970 --> 02:31:01,152
[SPEAKER_26]: Do any of the councilors wish to be recognized?

1786
02:31:01,812 --> 02:31:03,533
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1787
02:31:05,015 --> 02:31:06,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1788
02:31:06,596 --> 02:31:09,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to start out by thanking everyone for coming down here tonight.

1789
02:31:10,218 --> 02:31:18,505
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very important issue that really affects Locust Street, but in general, it really affects and impacts the whole city.

1790
02:31:19,666 --> 02:31:21,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really thank you for coming down.

1791
02:31:21,327 --> 02:31:23,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a long night, and I thank you for your time.

1792
02:31:24,229 --> 02:31:28,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's valuable to hear your opinions, because many of you live in the neighborhood,

1793
02:31:28,791 --> 02:31:32,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to experience this on a firsthand basis.

1794
02:31:32,072 --> 02:31:35,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for your time tonight and for coming down.

1795
02:31:36,034 --> 02:31:38,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it last week, and I'll say it again.

1796
02:31:38,135 --> 02:31:42,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I am completely against this project in this current state.

1797
02:31:43,917 --> 02:31:44,498
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too big.

1798
02:31:45,298 --> 02:31:46,579
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too big.

1799
02:31:46,599 --> 02:31:50,520
[SPEAKER_08]: 492 units, 781 parking spaces.

1800
02:31:51,141 --> 02:31:56,703
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Wegmans across the street, Lumiere down the road, the casino coming in in Everett.

1801
02:31:57,985 --> 02:31:58,605
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just too big.

1802
02:31:58,665 --> 02:32:00,726
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just too much traffic in that area.

1803
02:32:01,266 --> 02:32:02,746
[SPEAKER_08]: There's too much traffic in this city.

1804
02:32:02,966 --> 02:32:06,387
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter where you go, this city is congested with traffic.

1805
02:32:07,207 --> 02:32:11,628
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to find a solution to that, in addition to these issues that we talked about tonight.

1806
02:32:13,328 --> 02:32:16,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a motion earlier in the year that we have to hire a traffic engineer.

1807
02:32:17,309 --> 02:32:18,770
[SPEAKER_08]: It is needed in the worst way.

1808
02:32:18,790 --> 02:32:20,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked to the police chief about it.

1809
02:32:21,050 --> 02:32:22,250
[SPEAKER_08]: He agrees with it as well.

1810
02:32:22,570 --> 02:32:23,591
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to happen.

1811
02:32:23,671 --> 02:32:24,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Traffic is out of control.

1812
02:32:25,376 --> 02:32:28,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you put in a development like this, it's going to be complete chaos.

1813
02:32:29,199 --> 02:32:30,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Locust Street is a two-lane road.

1814
02:32:31,461 --> 02:32:34,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you get out to the parkway that's bad already, this is going to be even worse.

1815
02:32:34,764 --> 02:32:38,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So this development, to me, in its current state, makes absolutely no sense.

1816
02:32:41,389 --> 02:32:44,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that I'm completely against development, but it should be smart development.

1817
02:32:45,212 --> 02:32:46,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to be in common sense.

1818
02:32:46,893 --> 02:32:50,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to take into account the quality of life and the people that live in the neighborhood.

1819
02:32:51,775 --> 02:32:56,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when you think about it, at the end of the day, this actually is going to alter the fabric of the neighborhood.

1820
02:32:56,578 --> 02:32:58,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1821
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:02,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said, this is too big, and it needs to be looked at.

1822
02:33:02,763 --> 02:33:05,685
[SPEAKER_08]: The scope of this project is absolutely massive.

1823
02:33:06,125 --> 02:33:06,846
[SPEAKER_08]: It is massive.

1824
02:33:06,926 --> 02:33:10,888
[SPEAKER_08]: They are trying to actually build on every square inch of this land.

1825
02:33:11,329 --> 02:33:12,590
[SPEAKER_08]: It's completely out of hand.

1826
02:33:13,410 --> 02:33:29,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I don't like about this is the developer comes in and they're trying to build the biggest thing they can, make the most money they can, and then what happens is they end up leaving and then you and me and everyone in this city is left to deal with the problems.

1827
02:33:29,782 --> 02:33:36,147
[SPEAKER_08]: The traffic, the parking, the overflow parking, the potential for school overcrowding.

1828
02:33:36,427 --> 02:33:41,511
[SPEAKER_08]: So this could actually potentially create a lot of problems if it was to go through in its current state.

1829
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:50,786
[SPEAKER_08]: But most of all, what I really don't like, and I am concerned about, is that a project of this scope sets precedent.

1830
02:33:51,386 --> 02:33:52,307
[SPEAKER_08]: It sets precedent.

1831
02:33:52,687 --> 02:34:06,577
[SPEAKER_08]: If someone comes in and builds a 500-unit condominium complex, what prevents the people down on Mystic Ave, where there's an open lot, what prevents them from saying, hey, you did 500 units down on Locust Street, why can't we do 500 on Mystic Ave?

1832
02:34:07,078 --> 02:34:08,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't we do 500 on Riverside Ave?

1833
02:34:09,179 --> 02:34:10,440
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes absolutely no sense.

1834
02:34:11,581 --> 02:34:12,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to look at zoning.

1835
02:34:13,845 --> 02:34:16,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a resolution earlier in the year with regard to zoning.

1836
02:34:17,066 --> 02:34:20,626
[SPEAKER_08]: The zoning laws in our city, in my opinion, are terribly outdated.

1837
02:34:21,147 --> 02:34:24,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Zoning needs to be looked at, and it needs to be looked at soon.

1838
02:34:25,127 --> 02:34:31,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And, as far as I'm concerned, the city administration has to come up with a plan, a master plan for development.

1839
02:34:33,109 --> 02:34:37,490
[SPEAKER_08]: People have realized, and especially developers have realized,

1840
02:34:38,503 --> 02:34:45,689
[SPEAKER_08]: everything that we know, that Medford is a great place to live, a great place to work, a great place to play, and a great place to raise a family.

1841
02:34:46,349 --> 02:34:54,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's happening now is developers are coming in, and they're trying to take every opportunity they can to build on every square inch of land.

1842
02:34:54,716 --> 02:34:55,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And we must stand up.

1843
02:34:57,258 --> 02:35:05,905
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, 11 variances, it violates the spirit of the zoning ordinance.

1844
02:35:06,285 --> 02:35:06,966
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too many.

1845
02:35:07,726 --> 02:35:08,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely too many.

1846
02:35:09,707 --> 02:35:14,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I understand most complexes, there probably are some variances.

1847
02:35:15,809 --> 02:35:18,930
[SPEAKER_08]: 11 is completely, to me, above and beyond.

1848
02:35:18,950 --> 02:35:21,111
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any sense.

1849
02:35:21,711 --> 02:35:27,173
[SPEAKER_08]: You look at 7 Canal Street, that went down, and that was only 30 units.

1850
02:35:28,554 --> 02:35:30,374
[SPEAKER_08]: This here, or close to 500 units.

1851
02:35:30,394 --> 02:35:32,375
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 units, 11 variances, completely

1852
02:35:36,293 --> 02:35:37,314
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any sense to me.

1853
02:35:37,394 --> 02:35:38,634
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not smart growth.

1854
02:35:38,674 --> 02:35:40,255
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not good planning.

1855
02:35:40,895 --> 02:35:46,999
[SPEAKER_08]: This is someone trying to come in, build a development, and make as much money as they can, and leave.

1856
02:35:48,419 --> 02:35:52,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And the residents, they're going to be the ones in the city.

1857
02:35:53,062 --> 02:35:56,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be the ones to actually have to take care of the problems when it's all over.

1858
02:35:58,545 --> 02:35:59,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to go on the record.

1859
02:35:59,925 --> 02:36:03,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely am against this development in its current state.

1860
02:36:05,429 --> 02:36:06,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank everyone for coming down tonight.

1861
02:36:06,910 --> 02:36:07,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1862
02:36:13,114 --> 02:36:14,754
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Peller.

1863
02:36:15,295 --> 02:36:16,536
[SPEAKER_17]: If I can, thank you, Mr. President.

1864
02:36:18,176 --> 02:36:25,561
[SPEAKER_17]: If I can follow up with my fellow colleague, I, too, appreciate everyone coming out tonight because these are the issues that shape Medford and where we will go.

1865
02:36:28,743 --> 02:36:32,525
[SPEAKER_17]: This is something, as it's been evolving, we've been doing a lot of homework.

1866
02:36:33,496 --> 02:36:42,983
[SPEAKER_17]: A good read if anybody wants to see it is A Better City, a report of summer 2016 by the State of the Built Environment, Greater Boston Infrastructure.

1867
02:36:43,003 --> 02:36:48,207
[SPEAKER_17]: It tells you the growth of where we're going in the next 10 to 20 years.

1868
02:36:48,227 --> 02:36:52,751
[SPEAKER_17]: 10 to 20 years might sound like an eternity, but it isn't.

1869
02:36:54,332 --> 02:36:59,516
[SPEAKER_17]: It's something that we encourage our current administration to look at where we're going.

1870
02:36:59,836 --> 02:37:01,958
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is, I think, the first thing we need to look at.

1871
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:03,280
[SPEAKER_17]: is the plan.

1872
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:07,402
[SPEAKER_17]: I, too, am not for this project at 490 units.

1873
02:37:07,862 --> 02:37:08,983
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just way too big.

1874
02:37:10,323 --> 02:37:12,804
[SPEAKER_17]: I have my kids go to the McGlynn and the Andrews.

1875
02:37:13,325 --> 02:37:16,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I travel that route every day, probably twice a day.

1876
02:37:17,206 --> 02:37:18,527
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the impact it'll make.

1877
02:37:19,147 --> 02:37:23,929
[SPEAKER_17]: But more importantly, I think it's where we're going to go as a city and how we're going to grow.

1878
02:37:23,949 --> 02:37:29,932
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Councilor Falco made a huge push for

1879
02:37:30,946 --> 02:37:33,088
[SPEAKER_17]: revisiting our zoning laws.

1880
02:37:33,949 --> 02:37:35,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And they are outdated.

1881
02:37:35,450 --> 02:37:42,095
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the biggest concerns is the amount of money that it would cost to revisit that.

1882
02:37:43,036 --> 02:37:53,245
[SPEAKER_17]: One thing that, traveling and digging to some homework, we're fortunate to be part of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which there's taxpayer money.

1883
02:37:54,320 --> 02:38:15,729
[SPEAKER_17]: that if we ask, our administration asks, and I'll make that recommendation, that our city, our administration asks the Metropolitan Area Planning Council that they look into coming in using state tax dollars to visit our zoning laws and get their guidance for change.

1884
02:38:17,469 --> 02:38:18,270
[SPEAKER_17]: What is a variance?

1885
02:38:18,690 --> 02:38:20,471
[SPEAKER_17]: A variance should be very difficult to get.

1886
02:38:22,251 --> 02:38:23,692
[SPEAKER_17]: To apply for variance,

1887
02:38:24,335 --> 02:38:28,297
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a few reasons to really look at a variance.

1888
02:38:28,877 --> 02:38:34,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Either there's a problem with the development or there's a problem with the zoning law.

1889
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:37,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Here, I think it's a problem of both.

1890
02:38:39,041 --> 02:38:47,785
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we need to, as a council, stick together and work together to make sure that these projects stop.

1891
02:38:49,265 --> 02:38:52,727
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll also make a motion tonight that, followed with the

1892
02:38:53,886 --> 02:38:57,708
[SPEAKER_17]: the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and asking our administration to look into that.

1893
02:38:59,288 --> 02:39:01,029
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe the city solicitor could help me.

1894
02:39:01,689 --> 02:39:14,975
[SPEAKER_17]: But I believe if we ask for that, we can now ask for a six-month moratorium in variances of the Zoning Appeal Board for projects over 150 units.

1895
02:39:16,655 --> 02:39:18,216
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't want to stop development.

1896
02:39:18,336 --> 02:39:19,757
[SPEAKER_17]: I think development's very important.

1897
02:39:19,857 --> 02:39:20,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need it.

1898
02:39:22,138 --> 02:39:22,758
[SPEAKER_17]: As you can see,

1899
02:39:23,649 --> 02:39:30,072
[SPEAKER_17]: even the Metropolitan Area Planning Council presses for development, but smart growth and development.

1900
02:39:31,173 --> 02:39:34,975
[SPEAKER_17]: So I feel very strongly about these issues.

1901
02:39:35,195 --> 02:39:36,736
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate everybody coming out.

1902
02:39:37,976 --> 02:39:49,282
[SPEAKER_17]: The questions I do have, and I think, I hope that we can call the city solicitor out going forward with our vote later on tonight and asking him,

1903
02:39:54,487 --> 02:40:04,972
[SPEAKER_17]: With our issues with the abutters, I think that was what I saw, what I heard when I talked to different communities, is really getting the butters on board.

1904
02:40:07,313 --> 02:40:09,554
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't piggyback off each other, that was already said.

1905
02:40:10,094 --> 02:40:15,376
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need to find a way that we can assist the abutters to make sure that they fight for this.

1906
02:40:18,878 --> 02:40:23,500
[SPEAKER_17]: The other piece of this is the impact that will pose for our city.

1907
02:40:24,277 --> 02:40:33,379
[SPEAKER_17]: and looking into what will happen if we approve that money going forward for an appeal.

1908
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:40,461
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think these are very important questions, important questions that were said loud and clear tonight.

1909
02:40:41,301 --> 02:40:43,302
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate everybody's time tonight.

1910
02:40:43,382 --> 02:40:50,223
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's, it's, it's a very intriguing and very interesting piece of our future hearing method.

1911
02:40:50,644 --> 02:40:52,104
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that, um,

1912
02:40:52,551 --> 02:40:58,654
[SPEAKER_17]: the decisions we make, not just as city council, but as an administration, will tell us where we're going to go here in Medford.

1913
02:40:59,715 --> 02:41:04,437
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have total faith that Medford's going to come out on top.

1914
02:41:04,917 --> 02:41:06,018
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you very much.

1915
02:41:12,981 --> 02:41:15,002
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor, you said you were going to make some motions.

1916
02:41:15,062 --> 02:41:15,763
[SPEAKER_17]: If I can, yes.

1917
02:41:15,823 --> 02:41:17,504
[SPEAKER_26]: Are there any motions that you're making?

1918
02:41:17,564 --> 02:41:18,684
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I apologize.

1919
02:41:19,144 --> 02:41:20,365
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to make a motion that

1920
02:41:20,769 --> 02:41:38,593
[SPEAKER_17]: We asked the city administration to ask the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to assist us with the district local technical assistance using state tax dollars to do an overview of our city's zoning rules and regulations.

1921
02:41:39,013 --> 02:41:47,575
[SPEAKER_26]: So you want to request our administration to request help from the MAPC to review our zoning laws.

1922
02:41:47,595 --> 02:41:47,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1923
02:41:48,295 --> 02:41:49,035
[SPEAKER_17]: And then with that,

1924
02:41:50,368 --> 02:42:09,883
[SPEAKER_17]: I make a motion that we put a six-month moratorium on any future zoning variances to the Zoning Appeals Board for units over 150 at this type of size and this type of impact to our community.

1925
02:42:15,408 --> 02:42:33,772
[SPEAKER_26]: Further amended of the same resolution amended that the Zoning Board of Appeals have a moratorium placed upon it to not entertain any variances on projects that supersede 150 units.

1926
02:42:33,792 --> 02:42:35,872
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1927
02:42:38,853 --> 02:42:44,774
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion by Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by Councillor Scarpelli,

1928
02:42:45,394 --> 02:42:46,235
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Caviello.

1929
02:42:46,435 --> 02:42:47,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1930
02:42:47,816 --> 02:42:51,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Early this evening, one of the ladies had a book here, the NAIOP book.

1931
02:42:51,259 --> 02:42:52,340
[SPEAKER_16]: I think she had it.

1932
02:42:52,820 --> 02:42:58,605
[SPEAKER_16]: And it says in there, City of Medford has a dynamic, expanding commercial real estate market.

1933
02:42:59,486 --> 02:43:05,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know, as I drive around the city, I see very little commercial development other than apartments.

1934
02:43:05,951 --> 02:43:11,135
[SPEAKER_16]: You go up on the Fells Way, up by the Mulder River, there's an apartment building up there.

1935
02:43:13,057 --> 02:43:14,538
[SPEAKER_16]: You get 500 units coming down.

1936
02:43:14,827 --> 02:43:18,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Everywhere you look, we're seeing housing, housing, housing, more apartments.

1937
02:43:19,452 --> 02:43:25,158
[SPEAKER_16]: The apartment market has to crash at some point, and I don't want to be around when it does.

1938
02:43:28,422 --> 02:43:37,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Being one of the most desirable communities in the Boston area, we should be setting the tone of what comes into our city and the rules.

1939
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:42,581
[SPEAKER_16]: And it seems like they're being dictated to us along with the parameters.

1940
02:43:42,621 --> 02:43:45,462
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that those are things that we should be demanding because of this.

1941
02:43:47,123 --> 02:43:54,565
[SPEAKER_16]: And I agree with Councilor Scarpelli that every project that comes into the city should at least be presented to us so we can have some opinion.

1942
02:43:54,945 --> 02:43:59,486
[SPEAKER_16]: So when people in this community ask us a question, we know what's happening.

1943
02:43:59,846 --> 02:44:06,188
[SPEAKER_16]: I asked a solicitor earlier, and I'm gonna rely on his guidance again this evening for this, where we only have 20 days left

1944
02:44:07,353 --> 02:44:27,551
[SPEAKER_16]: to consider an appeal, and Mr. Solicitor, if you could help me with this, that the solicitor help us find an attorney on a quick basis that the council can sit with in the next few days and find out what our options are and if we do have a case.

1945
02:44:28,492 --> 02:44:30,734
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to make that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

1946
02:44:36,921 --> 02:44:49,586
[SPEAKER_16]: That the city go out, with the help of the city solicitor, go out and get an outside council to give us some guidance on what avenues we have, and if we do have a winnable case.

1947
02:44:49,746 --> 02:44:50,466
[SPEAKER_16]: If we have a case.

1948
02:44:50,626 --> 02:44:54,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Solicitor, maybe you could give us some guidance tonight on this.

1949
02:44:54,348 --> 02:45:02,251
[SPEAKER_26]: So on the motion of Councilor Scott Pelli, as amended by Councilor Scott Pelli and Councilor Caravaglio, the chair recognizes the city solicitor.

1950
02:45:03,007 --> 02:45:04,508
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

1951
02:45:04,908 --> 02:45:14,314
[SPEAKER_27]: In answer to the council's request, I think it's a wise idea, but I think it has to be specific.

1952
02:45:14,394 --> 02:45:25,360
[SPEAKER_27]: For example, I listened to Councilor Falco, I listened to Councilor Scott Pelly talk about concerns about this project, concerns about development generally, and even what you've just said, Councilor Caviello.

1953
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:30,723
[SPEAKER_27]: And while I'm not going to tell you what my personal opinions are, because they're irrelevant,

1954
02:45:31,140 --> 02:45:33,821
[SPEAKER_27]: When you have general concerns about development, that's good.

1955
02:45:33,861 --> 02:45:34,721
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what you should have.

1956
02:45:34,761 --> 02:45:35,762
[SPEAKER_27]: You're elected officials.

1957
02:45:36,422 --> 02:45:41,024
[SPEAKER_27]: But when you're appealing a case, what you need to know is, what are the grounds of your appeal?

1958
02:45:41,044 --> 02:45:41,984
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you have a good appeal?

1959
02:45:42,444 --> 02:45:43,845
[SPEAKER_27]: And how are you going to base that appeal?

1960
02:45:44,465 --> 02:45:47,086
[SPEAKER_27]: And that should be looked at by outside counsel.

1961
02:45:47,446 --> 02:45:58,310
[SPEAKER_27]: So I have, in anticipation of this, I talked to the Assistant City Solicitor earlier tonight and told her that tomorrow morning, since I won't be available, that she can start

1962
02:45:58,818 --> 02:46:01,879
[SPEAKER_27]: gathering the names of prospective outside counsel.

1963
02:46:02,239 --> 02:46:03,859
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, the prudence of that is this.

1964
02:46:03,879 --> 02:46:06,300
[SPEAKER_27]: You're going to get a group of names.

1965
02:46:07,940 --> 02:46:12,681
[SPEAKER_27]: When there is some type of vetting done of them, you'll have some idea of what the dollars are.

1966
02:46:13,281 --> 02:46:27,765
[SPEAKER_27]: And then if they say to you that somebody wants to want to take this review, you can do that without saying right now, we're appealing, without having any grounds for appeal really looked at or examined.

1967
02:46:28,397 --> 02:46:36,282
[SPEAKER_27]: You see, the idea of saying that right now I want to appeal is putting the cart before the horse in the sense that you don't know what the grounds are.

1968
02:46:37,123 --> 02:46:40,445
[SPEAKER_27]: This has to be done carefully, or it won't be done well.

1969
02:46:41,265 --> 02:46:42,706
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's the reason I asked this.

1970
02:46:42,786 --> 02:46:44,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's the avenue to go.

1971
02:46:44,787 --> 02:46:47,769
[SPEAKER_16]: And if your office could give us questions to ask and some guidance.

1972
02:46:48,029 --> 02:46:49,610
[SPEAKER_27]: But everything has to be done quickly.

1973
02:46:49,891 --> 02:46:50,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1974
02:46:50,071 --> 02:46:55,354
[SPEAKER_27]: So when we have that, then they have to be disseminated through the clerk's office to the council president.

1975
02:46:55,664 --> 02:46:57,145
[SPEAKER_27]: And that really should be done this week.

1976
02:46:57,285 --> 02:47:07,731
[SPEAKER_27]: And then some type of a protocol where this council can meet with some or a couple, because we're outside of procurement when we choose lawyers.

1977
02:47:07,951 --> 02:47:09,232
[SPEAKER_27]: We're exempt from procurement.

1978
02:47:09,773 --> 02:47:17,217
[SPEAKER_27]: So you could choose the ones that you want to talk to, and then get an idea of the price, which would give you the ability to ask for the appropriation.

1979
02:47:17,777 --> 02:47:19,118
[SPEAKER_27]: All of it is one ball.

1980
02:47:20,179 --> 02:47:22,620
[SPEAKER_27]: And what you don't want to do is to say, we're appealing.

1981
02:47:23,021 --> 02:47:25,362
[SPEAKER_27]: And then my question to you is, oh, good, on what grounds?

1982
02:47:25,751 --> 02:47:26,491
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't know yet.

1983
02:47:27,232 --> 02:47:39,838
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's the basis of my, of my motion that let's, let's see where we're going with this before we get before, like you said, before we, and the watch word is, as was said earlier by all of you, there's no real time to do this.

1984
02:47:39,878 --> 02:47:42,939
[SPEAKER_27]: This has to be done with, with, uh, lightning speed.

1985
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:47,682
[SPEAKER_27]: So we will begin garnering names for you tomorrow.

1986
02:47:48,322 --> 02:47:50,943
[SPEAKER_27]: And hopefully we can have some names to you by Thursday morning.

1987
02:47:51,363 --> 02:47:54,745
[SPEAKER_16]: And Mr. So let's say if you could, uh, draft us some kind of, uh,

1988
02:47:55,740 --> 02:48:00,061
[SPEAKER_16]: questions or points that we should be asking, these attorneys will be helpful also.

1989
02:48:00,261 --> 02:48:00,782
[SPEAKER_26]: I can do that.

1990
02:48:00,982 --> 02:48:01,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1991
02:48:02,122 --> 02:48:04,263
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Counselor Scott Pally.

1992
02:48:06,723 --> 02:48:08,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Romley.

1993
02:48:10,565 --> 02:48:19,667
[SPEAKER_17]: The question I have, if we go this route and the information gets back to us within the next 20 days, we can appeal.

1994
02:48:20,868 --> 02:48:21,468
[SPEAKER_17]: The question is,

1995
02:48:24,457 --> 02:48:25,898
[SPEAKER_17]: will we have enough time to do that?

1996
02:48:26,138 --> 02:48:34,480
[SPEAKER_27]: And will we have enough time to... If you voted right now, this minute, this absolute minute to vote to appeal, I don't think it would be any quicker.

1997
02:48:36,001 --> 02:48:40,502
[SPEAKER_27]: Because you're beginning the process of appeal the way any other human being would do it.

1998
02:48:41,002 --> 02:48:47,244
[SPEAKER_27]: They'd go to contact the lawyer and they'd say, this is the decision, these are the facts, do I have a case?

1999
02:48:48,164 --> 02:48:48,985
[SPEAKER_27]: And then you proceed.

2000
02:48:50,085 --> 02:48:53,586
[SPEAKER_27]: As opposed to saying, I'm going to court, want to be my lawyer?

2001
02:48:54,409 --> 02:48:56,229
[SPEAKER_27]: See, that's the cot before the horse.

2002
02:48:57,310 --> 02:48:59,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And I say, that's why I propose this.

2003
02:48:59,930 --> 02:49:02,591
[SPEAKER_16]: And I say, let's make sure we do this correctly.

2004
02:49:03,051 --> 02:49:03,271
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

2005
02:49:03,891 --> 02:49:04,971
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the rest is true.

2006
02:49:05,351 --> 02:49:08,092
[SPEAKER_27]: It has to be done like that.

2007
02:49:09,412 --> 02:49:11,352
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, within a week, you have to make a choice.

2008
02:49:11,493 --> 02:49:11,933
[SPEAKER_27]: You're going.

2009
02:49:12,533 --> 02:49:13,773
[SPEAKER_27]: So we could ask for an extension.

2010
02:49:14,553 --> 02:49:14,833
[SPEAKER_27]: Pardon me?

2011
02:49:15,493 --> 02:49:19,714
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm saying if we have counsel, that counsel can ask for extension for that deadline.

2012
02:49:19,774 --> 02:49:21,174
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I heard you say that earlier.

2013
02:49:21,194 --> 02:49:21,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's what the question was.

2014
02:49:21,895 --> 02:49:23,435
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I wouldn't put a lot of money on that one.

2015
02:49:23,962 --> 02:49:24,482
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, thank you.

2016
02:49:24,522 --> 02:49:25,363
[SPEAKER_27]: You have 20 days.

2017
02:49:25,383 --> 02:49:25,804
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

2018
02:49:27,225 --> 02:49:29,166
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information on that.

2019
02:49:29,186 --> 02:49:31,328
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Vice President Lugo-Curran.

2020
02:49:31,528 --> 02:49:39,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Which conveniently, because it was filed today, leaves us till July 5th, which, I mean, most, it's a July 4th weekend.

2021
02:49:39,195 --> 02:49:40,756
[SPEAKER_27]: Right, July 5th is a legal work day.

2022
02:49:41,496 --> 02:49:42,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but it's

2023
02:49:42,595 --> 02:49:46,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that is July 4th, which is the Monday, which is the holiday.

2024
02:49:46,377 --> 02:49:49,478
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people go away starting the 1st, which is the Friday.

2025
02:49:49,498 --> 02:49:53,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might be tough to even find an attorney that can do it within two weeks.

2026
02:49:53,100 --> 02:49:53,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Extremely tough.

2027
02:49:54,361 --> 02:49:58,302
[SPEAKER_27]: But we have to operate on the basis of what is, not what we want.

2028
02:50:00,343 --> 02:50:01,024
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. Slavitt.

2029
02:50:01,224 --> 02:50:01,524
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2030
02:50:02,284 --> 02:50:09,948
[SPEAKER_26]: And the neighbors have to organize themselves if they're going to file an appeal as well.

2031
02:50:11,457 --> 02:50:14,579
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair recognizes, are you all done, Madam Vice President?

2032
02:50:16,401 --> 02:50:19,363
[SPEAKER_26]: Were you seeking the floor at some point?

2033
02:50:19,904 --> 02:50:20,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lost track.

2034
02:50:20,704 --> 02:50:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll yield to the podium.

2035
02:50:22,466 --> 02:50:23,686
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't yield to the podium.

2036
02:50:25,408 --> 02:50:27,409
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

2037
02:50:27,429 --> 02:50:29,571
[SPEAKER_36]: Dave Champey, 35 Greenhall Street, Medford.

2038
02:50:30,732 --> 02:50:31,272
[SPEAKER_36]: Question.

2039
02:50:33,094 --> 02:50:37,237
[SPEAKER_36]: The city is going to, we're going to repeal this thing.

2040
02:50:37,860 --> 02:50:40,121
[SPEAKER_36]: basically, because you're going to look like fools if you don't.

2041
02:50:40,702 --> 02:50:45,005
[SPEAKER_36]: But how come the city solicitor can't represent the council on this?

2042
02:50:45,565 --> 02:50:46,746
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it earlier.

2043
02:50:50,608 --> 02:50:56,712
[SPEAKER_27]: The city solicitor can't represent the council on this because he's a lawyer and he has to operate on the basis of the rules of ethics.

2044
02:50:57,112 --> 02:51:01,595
[SPEAKER_27]: And the city solicitor and his office already represent the board of appeals and other appeals.

2045
02:51:01,955 --> 02:51:04,717
[SPEAKER_27]: Therefore, there would be a conflict of interest, which would be prohibitive.

2046
02:51:07,522 --> 02:51:19,672
[SPEAKER_36]: So the city solicitor office can't represent the city of Medford against another city agency, even though the agency being appealed?

2047
02:51:20,092 --> 02:51:21,393
[SPEAKER_27]: I've just explained this to you.

2048
02:51:22,054 --> 02:51:22,914
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't do it.

2049
02:51:23,035 --> 02:51:23,335
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't.

2050
02:51:23,375 --> 02:51:24,216
[SPEAKER_27]: No, listen.

2051
02:51:25,416 --> 02:51:33,323
[SPEAKER_27]: The city solicitor, as a lawyer, who is me, and my assistant who is a lawyer also, have to operate under the rules of ethics.

2052
02:51:33,843 --> 02:51:35,525
[SPEAKER_27]: The rules of ethics prohibit.

2053
02:51:36,362 --> 02:51:42,726
[SPEAKER_27]: a lawyer from representing one party and then the interest against that same party in another matter.

2054
02:51:43,147 --> 02:51:44,087
[SPEAKER_27]: That's elementary.

2055
02:51:44,608 --> 02:51:49,971
[SPEAKER_27]: Therefore, in this instance, this council would have to get independent counsel, period.

2056
02:51:50,492 --> 02:51:51,613
[SPEAKER_27]: There is nothing else to say.

2057
02:51:52,933 --> 02:51:53,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe on your part.

2058
02:51:54,494 --> 02:51:56,096
[SPEAKER_27]: But, yes, Mr. Chairman.

2059
02:51:56,336 --> 02:51:59,638
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not going to engage in a back and forth debate out here.

2060
02:51:59,658 --> 02:52:02,660
[SPEAKER_36]: We were just discussing it amongst ourselves, Mr. President.

2061
02:52:02,860 --> 02:52:03,180
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2062
02:52:06,943 --> 02:52:19,288
[SPEAKER_36]: The way that sounds to me is that if the city solicitor is representing one part of the city, you can't represent another part of the city, especially if it's going to be a party to the conflict at hand, correct?

2063
02:52:20,109 --> 02:52:25,011
[SPEAKER_36]: So there should be an automatic mechanism.

2064
02:52:25,031 --> 02:52:28,232
[SPEAKER_36]: I believe there is because I think the council executed it in 1984, 85.

2065
02:52:28,412 --> 02:52:28,593
[SPEAKER_36]: But, uh,

2066
02:52:35,205 --> 02:52:36,665
[SPEAKER_36]: I will leave that to Mr. Romney there.

2067
02:52:36,685 --> 02:52:44,948
[SPEAKER_36]: If he says we got to beg for another lawyer to pay on our own dime and gives us negative feedback in that regard, it's to be appealed.

2068
02:52:46,188 --> 02:52:51,930
[SPEAKER_36]: It doesn't seem like he has the citizens of Medford's interest at hand, and that's the bottom line.

2069
02:52:52,330 --> 02:52:53,511
[SPEAKER_27]: Excuse me, Paul.

2070
02:52:54,071 --> 02:52:57,452
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not going to listen to that from any resident ever.

2071
02:52:58,449 --> 02:53:06,352
[SPEAKER_27]: that the city solicitor being me doesn't have the best interest of this city and every single resident in his heart and in his actions.

2072
02:53:06,952 --> 02:53:08,773
[SPEAKER_27]: That is simple blather.

2073
02:53:10,133 --> 02:53:10,893
[SPEAKER_25]: We're aware of that.

2074
02:53:14,795 --> 02:53:16,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Gina Muzo, 35 Paris Street.

2075
02:53:17,515 --> 02:53:20,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just have one quick comment and then a question.

2076
02:53:21,097 --> 02:53:24,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I understand what our city solicitor is saying.

2077
02:53:25,705 --> 02:53:53,751
[SPEAKER_03]: The example I would give would be if you went to seek counsel for a car accident and it became known in your initial consultation that the lawyer you were seeking counsel from represented that particular client in another accident, they couldn't represent you in your accident because they're already engaged as representation, and so it creates an appearance of a conflict of interest.

2078
02:53:54,308 --> 02:53:58,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that probably illustrates what you're trying to say.

2079
02:53:58,931 --> 02:53:59,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

2080
02:54:00,412 --> 02:54:08,376
[SPEAKER_03]: My question, if you could just provide clarity for me, is it 20 calendar days or 20 business days?

2081
02:54:09,417 --> 02:54:16,221
[SPEAKER_27]: It is 20 calendar days, which brings us to the 4th of July, which brings us to the 5th of July.

2082
02:54:17,481 --> 02:54:21,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the only other thought I had, which I'm not certain is, is there any

2083
02:54:22,587 --> 02:54:39,559
[SPEAKER_03]: avenue for us before we go to land court or superior court to appeal the Board of Appeals directly as an internal body, you know, rather than have the family fight in public forum, maybe have that discussion internally?

2084
02:54:39,599 --> 02:54:42,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know the answer to that, but I'd raise that question.

2085
02:54:44,082 --> 02:54:50,146
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, can the city council appeal the Board of Appeals decision, or do they have to go to land court?

2086
02:54:50,725 --> 02:54:53,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an appeal process within the Board of Appeals?

2087
02:54:53,686 --> 02:54:55,686
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, you're talking about the same thing.

2088
02:54:55,766 --> 02:54:56,766
[SPEAKER_27]: The distinction is this.

2089
02:54:57,286 --> 02:54:59,727
[SPEAKER_27]: They don't have to appeal, but they can appeal.

2090
02:54:59,967 --> 02:55:02,087
[SPEAKER_27]: And when they appeal, the appeal goes to court.

2091
02:55:02,827 --> 02:55:03,907
[SPEAKER_27]: That's where the appeal goes.

2092
02:55:03,967 --> 02:55:04,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2093
02:55:04,287 --> 02:55:07,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So they never appeal directly to the Board of Appeals?

2094
02:55:07,528 --> 02:55:07,948
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2095
02:55:07,988 --> 02:55:09,488
[SPEAKER_27]: That sounds incongruous, doesn't it?

2096
02:55:09,528 --> 02:55:12,349
[SPEAKER_27]: Because you're the Board of Appeals, but you don't appeal to the Board of Appeals.

2097
02:55:12,369 --> 02:55:13,149
[SPEAKER_03]: You appeal to court.

2098
02:55:13,289 --> 02:55:13,469
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

2099
02:55:13,649 --> 02:55:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure we couldn't just keep it in the family.

2100
02:55:18,490 --> 02:55:20,330
[SPEAKER_26]: Madam Vice President, if you wish to continue,

2101
02:55:23,152 --> 02:55:23,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll yield.

2102
02:55:25,153 --> 02:55:26,594
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

2103
02:55:27,435 --> 02:55:30,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to speak, actually, but we always have yield to the speakers.

2104
02:55:30,637 --> 02:55:31,778
[SPEAKER_04]: We've always been allowed to do that.

2105
02:55:32,959 --> 02:55:33,359
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2106
02:55:34,220 --> 02:55:35,140
[SPEAKER_26]: Where's the floor, Mr. President?

2107
02:55:35,821 --> 02:55:36,981
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight has the floor.

2108
02:55:38,502 --> 02:55:40,964
[SPEAKER_22]: I certainly think that Councilor Caviello is.

2109
02:55:41,825 --> 02:55:43,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight has the floor, sir.

2110
02:55:46,908 --> 02:55:48,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight has the floor.

2111
02:55:48,189 --> 02:55:49,430
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight has the floor.

2112
02:55:52,818 --> 02:55:56,881
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight has the floor.

2113
02:56:01,224 --> 02:56:04,087
[SPEAKER_26]: There is no yielding mechanism in our rules.

2114
02:56:08,730 --> 02:56:11,252
[SPEAKER_24]: Freddie, give her the floor either one way or the other when we get to the end of it.

2115
02:56:14,395 --> 02:56:14,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.

2116
02:56:16,676 --> 02:56:17,697
[SPEAKER_04]: My comments will be brief.

2117
02:56:17,737 --> 02:56:22,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's been a long night and I think the comments made by the residents have been

2118
02:56:23,585 --> 02:56:28,149
[SPEAKER_04]: very detailed, and I think they've covered a number of things, traffic, parking, schools.

2119
02:56:29,670 --> 02:56:30,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to set a precedent.

2120
02:56:31,671 --> 02:56:34,693
[SPEAKER_04]: The way things were done were obviously too quick, lack of notice.

2121
02:56:35,774 --> 02:56:41,539
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also, I'm not sure if it was mentioned, but an air quality issue, that many residents, also the soil problem.

2122
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:51,106
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many issues, and I'm also in shock that 11 variances were given, and I too believe that we're being laughed at.

2123
02:56:51,645 --> 02:57:01,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that we need to figure out what our options are for appeal and go forward with that if we do have an appealable issue, 100% for the residents.

2124
02:57:02,068 --> 02:57:20,653
[SPEAKER_04]: To have the opinion state blatantly, even on page nine, that the proposed project is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance, which is to promote the health, safety, morals, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city of Medford, I'm not sure

2125
02:57:23,157 --> 02:57:33,446
[SPEAKER_04]: where this opinion, how it was written, or who actually wrote it would be my questions, because it does seem like the developers, attorneys, did have a helping hand in that.

2126
02:57:34,186 --> 02:57:43,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm shocked at the way that things have transpired in the last two weeks, absolutely shocked.

2127
02:57:44,575 --> 02:57:51,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is definitely something that is going to impact this entire city, not just the many streets that are in that area.

2128
02:57:52,142 --> 02:57:53,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in Wellington Circle.

2129
02:57:53,982 --> 02:57:57,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I commute every day to work in Wellington Circle.

2130
02:57:57,103 --> 02:58:04,384
[SPEAKER_04]: The traffic on the Fellsway and Riverside Ave is backed up for a good 20 minutes at rush hour.

2131
02:58:05,365 --> 02:58:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: This is extremely serious, especially when you're talking 400 to 600 kids, new children in our school system.

2132
02:58:13,006 --> 02:58:14,466
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already the class size.

2133
02:58:14,747 --> 02:58:19,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll speak for myself at the Roberts next year in kindergarten is going to be 23, 24 children.

2134
02:58:19,868 --> 02:58:21,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And they won't allow full-time aides.

2135
02:58:22,958 --> 02:58:27,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So we definitely have a problem here, and I thank my colleagues for speaking positively.

2136
02:58:28,039 --> 02:58:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're all on the same page, and I think we need to move forward tonight with a vote to hopefully we get a list of attorneys that we can reach out to by Thursday.

2137
02:58:38,202 --> 02:58:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we need to also take a vote that the money is approved by the administration so that we can appeal.

2138
02:58:46,224 --> 02:58:51,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to take that vote so that that money is ready when we do need to hire an attorney.

2139
02:58:51,721 --> 02:59:02,831
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 20 days, and if we can't ask for an extension, that means we have two weeks to find an attorney that we all agree on, figure out our payable rights, and get an appeal into court.

2140
02:59:03,151 --> 02:59:16,142
[SPEAKER_04]: That is going to be a tough task, but I think we can do it, and I think we do need to take a couple votes tonight, being funding and, obviously, to ask for that list and for, you know, further opinions from the solicitor.

2141
02:59:19,638 --> 02:59:38,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you for allowing me to speak, and I thank all the people and all the residents who care about our city, because what you're doing, obviously, is 100 people here tonight, but you're helping thousands and thousands of people that are going to have to deal with the traffic and parking.

2142
02:59:39,388 --> 02:59:43,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go on and on, but traffic is something that's going to impact this entire community.

2143
02:59:49,457 --> 02:59:51,759
[SPEAKER_26]: Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

2144
02:59:51,779 --> 02:59:52,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2145
02:59:53,240 --> 03:00:01,567
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um, I certainly feel as though, uh, Councillor Caviello's recommendation and his motion, uh, to consult with an attorney to see whether or not we have a case is prudent course.

2146
03:00:02,107 --> 03:00:05,030
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um, I'll certainly be supporting that motion this evening, Mr. President.

2147
03:00:05,670 --> 03:00:09,694
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, personally, I have a very different vision for the local street area.

2148
03:00:10,274 --> 03:00:14,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I'm certainly not crazy about this large scale residential development and I'm really not

2149
03:00:15,860 --> 03:00:18,321
[SPEAKER_24]: overly crazy about Wegmans coming in there either, Mr. President.

2150
03:00:18,381 --> 03:00:37,507
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we have an opportunity to really take a look at putting in some mixed-use development at that location that's real, that has office space, that has commercial space, that has residential opportunities that are more in scale with the neighborhood, but that also will allow us an opportunity to really make a commitment to bringing affordable housing to our city, Mr. President.

2151
03:00:38,472 --> 03:00:41,033
[SPEAKER_24]: So, with that being said, I don't think that this is a good project.

2152
03:00:41,093 --> 03:00:42,673
[SPEAKER_24]: I stated my reasons why last week.

2153
03:00:42,693 --> 03:00:49,595
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, traffic impact, impact on our public schools, impact on our infrastructure, and pretty much everything that everybody said here this evening.

2154
03:00:49,635 --> 03:00:50,895
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I think we're all on the same page.

2155
03:00:50,915 --> 03:00:52,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Longo-Curran's right about that.

2156
03:00:52,715 --> 03:00:53,756
[SPEAKER_24]: We are all on the same page.

2157
03:00:53,796 --> 03:00:56,056
[SPEAKER_24]: We feel as though this development is too large-scale.

2158
03:00:56,656 --> 03:01:03,638
[SPEAKER_24]: We feel as though this development's not going to have a great impact on the quality of life and the residents in the neighbourhood that are there and that are existing.

2159
03:01:05,279 --> 03:01:12,303
[SPEAKER_24]: moving forward and taking a look at whether or not we have a case, Mr. President, to determine whether or not we should appeal this is certainly the prudent course of action.

2160
03:01:12,844 --> 03:01:15,765
[SPEAKER_24]: So with that being said, I will be supporting Councillor Caviello's motion.

2161
03:01:16,746 --> 03:01:20,508
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I think that we can really make a commitment to putting mixed-use development down there.

2162
03:01:20,948 --> 03:01:31,075
[SPEAKER_24]: I've filed resolutions in the past to take a look at an overlay district or a mixed-use district down there with a commitment to affordable housing, and I'll continue to take a look at that stuff, Mr. President.

2163
03:01:31,095 --> 03:01:34,997
[SPEAKER_24]: But it can't get done without the help and the work and the cooperation from the developers that are involved.

2164
03:01:35,495 --> 03:01:47,880
[SPEAKER_24]: And quite frankly, I feel as though these developers are coming into our city and they're trying to really maximize their potential to earn and not taking into consideration the factors that affect us and our quality of life and our everyday livelihood, Mr. President.

2165
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:55,243
[SPEAKER_24]: So, with that being said, I certainly oppose the project in its current state and I certainly support Councilor Caviello's motion to consult with an attorney.

2166
03:01:55,703 --> 03:01:57,584
[SPEAKER_24]: And I move for approval on that motion, Mr. President.

2167
03:01:58,364 --> 03:02:01,765
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Councilor Falco.

2168
03:02:02,265 --> 03:02:03,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2169
03:02:04,355 --> 03:02:09,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Question for Mr. City Solicitor, please.

2170
03:02:11,096 --> 03:02:11,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. City Solicitor.

2171
03:02:13,617 --> 03:02:17,938
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Solicitor, the Councillor has a question for you.

2172
03:02:19,558 --> 03:02:21,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a quick question regarding the process.

2173
03:02:22,378 --> 03:02:27,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if we meet with the different attorneys, we decide we're going to appeal.

2174
03:02:29,360 --> 03:02:31,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Can the Mayor veto our decision to appeal?

2175
03:02:32,449 --> 03:02:34,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Can she veto the decision to appeal?

2176
03:02:34,729 --> 03:02:42,071
[SPEAKER_27]: I would think that that — I would think not, for this reason.

2177
03:02:42,151 --> 03:02:46,031
[SPEAKER_27]: She could, of course, decide to fund you $1, but I don't think she'd do that.

2178
03:02:46,051 --> 03:02:51,112
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, if you're talking about some type of nefarious intent, I don't think you'll find that.

2179
03:02:51,572 --> 03:02:53,853
[SPEAKER_27]: But would she, say, veto the appeal?

2180
03:02:54,133 --> 03:02:56,333
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, that would just make you override it, if she could.

2181
03:02:56,673 --> 03:02:58,913
[SPEAKER_27]: So I don't think that that's something that would be in the cards.

2182
03:02:59,514 --> 03:03:01,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know we have limited time, so I'm just trying to question —

2183
03:03:02,304 --> 03:03:05,586
[SPEAKER_08]: different outcomes and whatnot, you know, what our options are.

2184
03:03:05,706 --> 03:03:06,166
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's... Right.

2185
03:03:06,186 --> 03:03:06,866
[SPEAKER_27]: I understand that.

2186
03:03:06,906 --> 03:03:13,130
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that the mayor will listen to any resolution, as she always does, and then she'll make a decision.

2187
03:03:13,430 --> 03:03:20,533
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, the reason I said that she should have some type of idea of who the attorney is and what the cost is, because that would drive what your appropriation is.

2188
03:03:21,194 --> 03:03:21,534
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all.

2189
03:03:21,774 --> 03:03:22,875
[SPEAKER_27]: It's just a practical matter.

2190
03:03:23,215 --> 03:03:23,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2191
03:03:24,315 --> 03:03:26,917
[SPEAKER_27]: So, but I don't think that a veto would be in the cards.

2192
03:03:27,197 --> 03:03:29,518
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't speak for any other human being, but...

2193
03:03:29,988 --> 03:03:31,950
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that would be unlikely.

2194
03:03:32,470 --> 03:03:32,770
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2195
03:03:35,653 --> 03:03:36,333
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Falco.

2196
03:03:38,295 --> 03:03:38,976
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my question.

2197
03:03:39,016 --> 03:03:39,216
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2198
03:03:40,116 --> 03:03:40,737
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, sir.

2199
03:03:40,797 --> 03:03:42,378
[SPEAKER_26]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2200
03:03:42,879 --> 03:03:45,121
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

2201
03:03:45,561 --> 03:03:55,029
[SPEAKER_14]: On that question to Councilor Falco you just asked, I believe it would be discriminatory on the man's part because right now, as the city solicitor just alluded to, he's representing the Board of Appeals.

2202
03:03:55,489 --> 03:03:57,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Under normal circumstances, correct me if I'm wrong,

2203
03:03:57,941 --> 03:03:59,882
[SPEAKER_14]: you would be the legal counsel for the city council.

2204
03:04:00,502 --> 03:04:04,123
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, that leaves you without any legal representation.

2205
03:04:04,483 --> 03:04:07,504
[SPEAKER_14]: And you, by right and by law, are entitled to have legal representation.

2206
03:04:08,204 --> 03:04:13,866
[SPEAKER_14]: My suggestion would be that you would ask for $20,000, put it into the budget, and you could take it from there.

2207
03:04:13,886 --> 03:04:16,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't think you're going to get out of this thing any cheaper than that.

2208
03:04:16,427 --> 03:04:19,248
[SPEAKER_14]: You need a starting figure to start off with, and I would keep it at $20,000.

2209
03:04:19,968 --> 03:04:26,770
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly, I just want to say, I want to thank you for continuously being so rude, Mr. Delarusso, because I really

2210
03:04:33,433 --> 03:04:34,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2211
03:04:34,513 --> 03:04:36,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

2212
03:04:36,554 --> 03:04:37,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to be very quick.

2213
03:04:38,995 --> 03:04:55,181
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to me like there's some confusion as to whether or not, I mean, you're talking about the process and I appreciate that, but I mean, everything that was discussed tonight, you've got the 11 variances, the zoning particular to this case impact on the city.

2214
03:04:55,481 --> 03:05:01,323
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to me you've got, like right now, you could make a motion to appeal,

2215
03:05:02,482 --> 03:05:19,125
[SPEAKER_11]: enlist specific things, specific to this zoning law, as the city solicitor informed us that it has to be specific to this zoning, to take a vote on appeal and request the funds from the mayor for the legal representation for it.

2216
03:05:19,705 --> 03:05:26,146
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see why that's not crystal clear to everybody in this room at this moment.

2217
03:05:26,626 --> 03:05:31,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would just like to ask, when you do take the vote to appeal and it gets approved,

2218
03:05:31,833 --> 03:05:40,076
[SPEAKER_11]: that whatever meetings that you do have with legal representation, that it's open to the public, specifically to the abutters.

2219
03:05:40,376 --> 03:06:00,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Because like Gene Martin said earlier, these are people that, you know, this is everyday, ordinary people that may not be lawyers, that may not be pretty about how to go about appealing this as a direct abutter to this, so that they could come, not to piggyback on your litigation process, but so that they can absorb information as well

2220
03:06:01,152 --> 03:06:03,233
[SPEAKER_11]: so that they know what to do going forward.

2221
03:06:03,473 --> 03:06:04,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2222
03:06:10,017 --> 03:06:10,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2223
03:06:11,638 --> 03:06:20,363
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, where time is of the essence, I think it's only appropriate, and I agree with what was mentioned by the city solicitor and members of this council.

2224
03:06:20,684 --> 03:06:26,227
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we should move forward with soliciting a good land attorney first.

2225
03:06:26,828 --> 03:06:32,050
[SPEAKER_28]: and getting feedback and advice from that attorney, and then moving forward on appeal.

2226
03:06:32,090 --> 03:06:33,010
[SPEAKER_28]: So I agree with that.

2227
03:06:33,331 --> 03:06:43,775
[SPEAKER_28]: The only thing I would say is that in order to get together and discuss what attorney may be right for us, I think we have to either set up a special meeting or an emergency meeting.

2228
03:06:44,115 --> 03:06:48,897
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think we should wait till Tuesday, because I think that's putting us behind the eight ball.

2229
03:06:52,651 --> 03:07:05,276
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'd recommend as a part of whatever vote we take tonight that we have a special meeting requires 48 hour notice, an emergency meeting we can call without the 48 hour notice.

2230
03:07:05,337 --> 03:07:12,940
[SPEAKER_28]: But according to the city solicitor, he may need until Thursday to get some names and so forth and a list of names.

2231
03:07:13,480 --> 03:07:17,902
[SPEAKER_28]: So if we call for a special meeting, Mr. President, I think this is such an important issue.

2232
03:07:18,453 --> 03:07:20,575
[SPEAKER_28]: that I think we're all available to meet.

2233
03:07:20,615 --> 03:07:25,859
[SPEAKER_28]: It won't take long, maybe an hour on Friday evening, because it's got to be 48 hours out.

2234
03:07:26,379 --> 03:07:28,041
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll be in contact with the solicitor.

2235
03:07:28,081 --> 03:07:34,406
[SPEAKER_26]: And once we have a feeling of when things are going to go, I'll call for the special meeting or convene an emergency meeting.

2236
03:07:37,048 --> 03:07:37,748
[SPEAKER_28]: Before the weekend?

2237
03:07:38,409 --> 03:07:38,809
[SPEAKER_26]: Hopefully.

2238
03:07:39,430 --> 03:07:40,170
[SPEAKER_26]: Not hopefully.

2239
03:07:40,190 --> 03:07:43,193
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we need to get the ball rolling.

2240
03:07:43,433 --> 03:07:43,953
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, we do.

2241
03:07:44,454 --> 03:07:45,374
[SPEAKER_28]: Because we have budget.

2242
03:07:45,414 --> 03:07:47,016
[SPEAKER_28]: We have the superintendent coming before us.

2243
03:07:48,018 --> 03:07:48,398
[SPEAKER_28]: going on.

2244
03:07:48,899 --> 03:07:51,740
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I think we need to get this rolling.

2245
03:07:51,800 --> 03:07:54,022
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I would ask that in the formal motion.

2246
03:07:54,822 --> 03:07:59,645
[SPEAKER_26]: That there be a special meeting of the City Council called for when, Councilor?

2247
03:07:59,785 --> 03:08:00,626
[SPEAKER_28]: 48 hours from today.

2248
03:08:00,726 --> 03:08:01,607
[SPEAKER_28]: That's due Friday.

2249
03:08:02,607 --> 03:08:06,069
[SPEAKER_28]: Friday evening or maybe Saturday morning.

2250
03:08:06,129 --> 03:08:09,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to stay on the phone at 8 a.m.

2251
03:08:09,852 --> 03:08:11,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday morning to start.

2252
03:08:12,794 --> 03:08:13,554
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information.

2253
03:08:15,247 --> 03:08:21,750
[SPEAKER_24]: Our actions are going to be contingent upon whether or not we can actually get in touch with somebody and get a list of people that are willing to actually review the case and take a look at the case.

2254
03:08:21,790 --> 03:08:22,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Isn't that correct?

2255
03:08:23,431 --> 03:08:23,851
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.

2256
03:08:23,991 --> 03:08:36,537
[SPEAKER_21]: And if we can't get anybody in the next three days, or we get a list on Thursday, that only leaves us Thursday to Friday to get it together for a special meeting either Friday night or Saturday morning from someone that we may not even have the opportunity to come to the meeting and explain to us who we are.

2257
03:08:36,657 --> 03:08:38,357
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't anticipate meeting with a lawyer.

2258
03:08:38,718 --> 03:08:41,999
[SPEAKER_28]: I anticipated getting together and selecting a lawyer.

2259
03:08:42,625 --> 03:08:43,865
[SPEAKER_28]: and then reaching out to the lawyer.

2260
03:08:44,006 --> 03:08:45,626
[SPEAKER_28]: So I didn't anticipate sitting with someone.

2261
03:08:45,926 --> 03:08:46,326
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree.

2262
03:08:46,346 --> 03:08:47,587
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think we're going to get someone that quick.

2263
03:08:47,607 --> 03:08:47,687
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

2264
03:08:47,787 --> 03:08:48,147
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

2265
03:08:48,167 --> 03:08:51,088
[SPEAKER_24]: I was a little confused by the direction that we were going.

2266
03:08:51,108 --> 03:08:52,289
[SPEAKER_28]: This will be a selection.

2267
03:08:52,589 --> 03:08:57,831
[SPEAKER_28]: And then once we maybe make a selection one, two, and three, we're going to have to pick up the phone and make the phone calls.

2268
03:08:57,931 --> 03:09:08,915
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. President, I'd even be willing to entertain an ad hoc committee being established to go through that process and present it to the council at some point in time with the decision-making processes.

2269
03:09:09,254 --> 03:09:11,075
[SPEAKER_24]: But that's at a later date, you know what I mean?

2270
03:09:11,115 --> 03:09:12,276
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, we're going to get a list of lawyers.

2271
03:09:12,296 --> 03:09:13,036
[SPEAKER_24]: We've got to pick a lawyer.

2272
03:09:13,116 --> 03:09:15,477
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm available Friday or Saturday, whatever the counsel.

2273
03:09:15,497 --> 03:09:16,978
[SPEAKER_28]: So do you want to do Thursday night?

2274
03:09:17,499 --> 03:09:18,339
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that 48 hours?

2275
03:09:18,739 --> 03:09:19,019
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it?

2276
03:09:20,420 --> 03:09:21,161
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

2277
03:09:21,201 --> 03:09:23,302
[SPEAKER_27]: You want to meet with lawyers on Thursday night?

2278
03:09:23,362 --> 03:09:24,782
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no, no, no.

2279
03:09:25,243 --> 03:09:26,724
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't understand what you're asking.

2280
03:09:26,784 --> 03:09:29,305
[SPEAKER_27]: He's asking for a meeting to discuss a list of lawyers.

2281
03:09:30,366 --> 03:09:31,126
[SPEAKER_27]: To have the list?

2282
03:09:31,226 --> 03:09:32,787
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yes, we can certainly get you a list.

2283
03:09:35,088 --> 03:09:36,789
[SPEAKER_26]: But remember, when you meet Thursday night.

2284
03:09:37,349 --> 03:09:38,030
[SPEAKER_28]: You can't, 48 hours.

2285
03:09:39,157 --> 03:09:41,519
[SPEAKER_26]: City Hall is closed out of business on Friday.

2286
03:09:41,539 --> 03:09:46,703
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of information, Vice President Lugo-Curran.

2287
03:09:46,723 --> 03:09:58,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Just maybe a better route is we get a list on Thursday, each of us call somebody on Friday, then we meet Friday night or Saturday morning to say this is what, you know, this is what I found out, this is what you found out, and then we pick one.

2288
03:09:59,732 --> 03:10:07,398
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's not available, this one's available, this rate is $200 an hour, this one can do it before Fourth of July, this one can't.

2289
03:10:08,521 --> 03:10:14,605
[SPEAKER_27]: My office would be happy to make the inquiry about availability and what the hourly rates are.

2290
03:10:14,685 --> 03:10:14,965
[SPEAKER_27]: Great.

2291
03:10:15,285 --> 03:10:15,486
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

2292
03:10:15,646 --> 03:10:17,287
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, we can begin on that tomorrow.

2293
03:10:17,307 --> 03:10:22,710
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I don't want serial calls made by the council which would be outside of the open meeting law.

2294
03:10:24,571 --> 03:10:27,553
