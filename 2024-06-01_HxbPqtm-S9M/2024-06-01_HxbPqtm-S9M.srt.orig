[SPEAKER_06]: the meeting is called to order.

14
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:31,531
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a meeting of the

15
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:41,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Planning and Permitting Committee.

16
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:54,005
[SPEAKER_02]: The action and discussion item for this meeting is paper 24042, a resolution to discuss the implementation of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance.

17
00:00:54,065 --> 00:01:03,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've invited some members of the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office that are the staff that are tasked with implementing and enforcing

18
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:07,895
[SPEAKER_02]: this ordinance to be with us here tonight.

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:17,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make it clear, because this is a resolution to discuss the implementation of an ordinance that was passed around this time last year.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: The Housing Stability Notification Ordinance is an ordinance that was passed in February 2023 that created a new requirement for

21
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:42,289
[SPEAKER_02]: property owners of properties where there are tenants, that at the beginning and end of any lease, that they should send a document that is created by the City of Medford detailing tenants' resources and tenants' rights to those tenants at those given

22
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,166
[SPEAKER_02]: start and end times to any lease.

23
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the ordinance in a nutshell.

24
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fairly simple.

25
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:55,649
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a fairly lengthy process crafting the ordinance between 2022 and 2023.

26
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's been about a year since we passed it, so the purpose of this meeting is to check in

27
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:25,022
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office that have been working hard, thinking about how it makes sense to roll out this ordinance, going through the necessary steps to put together that document, to draft it, to run it by legal counsel, and to be thoughtful about how to make sure that everybody in the community that ought to know about this new requirement does before we officially begin implementing and following up with people to ensure that it's being complied with.

28
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:34,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'm going to open it up to preliminary comment from my fellow councillors that I'd love to hear just an overall update from our city staff.

29
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Any comments from my fellow councillors?

30
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:50,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing none, I'd be happy to turn it over to Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, and our housing planner, Aditi, to give us an update on the

31
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know that there's been a lot of good work being done in the planning office to develop this document and to think through how we're gonna roll it out.

32
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:06,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love any sort of update that you can share on that process.

33
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, I'm Alicia Hunt, the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

34
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And with me tonight is

35
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, I'm Aditi Mugur.

36
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:30,884
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the housing planner at the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

37
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:39,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to start by, Councillor Collins had asked for an update of what had happened.

38
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:48,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like, so you're aware, Aditi started with us in January, and obviously we've been working on this since long before that.

39
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:55,630
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a housing planner over the summer who unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, had to relocate back to Pennsylvania.

40
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,292
[SPEAKER_01]: So Barbara started this process.

41
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:09,576
[SPEAKER_01]: She, along with interns and other staff in the office, created the Housing Stability Notification document, the document that the Tenants' Rights and Resources Guide.

42
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:14,559
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent a good amount of time working with plain language.

43
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:36,957
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance with the community liaisons to talk about how can we use language that is understandable by everybody and things that will translate well into other other things as well as getting information from what are other communities sending in their tenants rights and resources documents that are out there.

44
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:38,919
[SPEAKER_01]: So that occurred over the summer.

45
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:39,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked

46
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,264
[SPEAKER_01]: very hard on formatting it in a way that made it very accessible.

47
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:48,107
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to log into the Zoom and share it on the screen if you'd like to see it.

48
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:55,273
[SPEAKER_01]: We did send it to legal counsel and they have given us two kinds of feedback.

49
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:57,815
[SPEAKER_01]: One is easy to accept feedback.

50
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:16,024
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've just made the changes and the other is where they've asked for or they are recommending language that our concern is it's making it not understandable and so we're still sort of working through those very specific suggestions to make it understandable by the public.

51
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But the document is essentially done

52
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:31,444
[SPEAKER_01]: including, I wanted to just mention the section, right, so there is a section on the first page that says translations in Spanish, Brazilian, Portuguese,

53
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:39,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Haitian Creole, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic are available on the city website with the URL.

54
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:43,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sentence is translated into each of those languages.

55
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:53,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you read that language and you pick it up, you look at it, there is a box on there that has that sentence in the language that you speak.

56
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:59,468
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you can go to the URL and get the translated version of it.

57
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:11,255
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Councillor Collins had said, the intention was to take this, so a landlord is supposed to give this to the tenant upon the start of their tenancy.

58
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:16,981
[SPEAKER_01]: But this document could be updated over time to reflect changes in rights.

59
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:27,831
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've been talking about is that we don't necessarily want to send this document to the landlord because they might just hold on to it.

60
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,231
[SPEAKER_01]: and photocopy it.

61
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:34,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'd like them to do is send them a letter that says, this is the ordinance.

62
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:39,395
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinance says you have to give this document to your tenant.

63
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:47,378
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a copy of this document on the city's website at this URL.

64
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:56,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your tenant speaks one of these languages, we have it in that language on this website for you to download and give to them.

65
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:03,445
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also been thinking that we'd like to send it to all the real estate agents in Medford as well, so they're aware.

66
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:07,167
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the next question is, how do we get it out to landlords?

67
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:10,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something we've been discussing among staff in the office.

68
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:17,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I can stop there because that's the history, that's what has happened, and now the next step is getting it out.

69
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:19,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

70
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:21,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just chime in, Madam President, if I can?

71
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:22,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

72
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:26,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, and I understand why we're doing this, but I think that some of the confusion's coming in.

73
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:39,629
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could shed some light, I know that that Section 31, Chapter 186 of Mass General Law, that all landlords must deliver an accompanying form when issuing a notice of quit for nonpayment

74
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:41,491
[SPEAKER_08]: of rent and residential tenants.

75
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:53,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, so the confusion is that I believe, are we saying in context that we're not seeing that happen and we want to make sure that we're doing our part as a city?

76
00:07:54,545 --> 00:08:01,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Or because there's already, what I've been told is that the state law is already in place.

77
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:10,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a required notice to quit an accompanying form that the landlords must provide a form of notice to quit as of April 1, 2023.

78
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:12,537
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when it was implemented.

79
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:19,519
[SPEAKER_08]: The landlords that issue notice to quit for non-payment of rent to a residential tenant must also give a tenant

80
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:31,489
[SPEAKER_08]: a completed accompaniment form that details information on rental assistance programs, applicable trial court rules, standing orders, emergencies, so on and so forth.

81
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:38,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I could just keep on going, but as the questions that I received were that if this is already in place in the state,

82
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:46,240
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what I don't see is it is these forms in multi language languages that we're offering.

83
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:56,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's important to hear that is, are we doing this in conjunction with the state law to make sure that we're going above and beyond as a council?

84
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the question that landlords are asking.

85
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,729
[SPEAKER_08]: We're already doing this by state law.

86
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we doing something we're not supposed to?

87
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is this something now we can do the metric ordinance instead of the state ordinance?

88
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:12,173
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think just getting that clarification would be good.

89
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:16,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll quickly chime in, and then I'll turn it back over to our subject matter experts.

90
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:23,598
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding, and I appreciate that question, Councilor Scarparilli, because I think that's an important point to clarify.

91
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:24,959
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding is this

92
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:32,291
[SPEAKER_02]: ordinance adds something to that process.

93
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:39,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So the state law creates a requirement for that document and that required notice and resources to be sent when there is a notice to quit.

94
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:49,599
[SPEAKER_02]: This ordinance says not necessarily just when there's an ordinance, sorry, when there's a notice to quit, but when a lease is beginning or when a lease is ending for other reasons.

95
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:50,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make sure

96
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

97
00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:07,109
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a foreclosure happening, let's make sure that the person occupying that home or about to occupy that home knows their rights and has these resources in those other scenarios as well, building on top of the state law that is specifically about notices to quit.

98
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I get that right, Director?

99
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:10,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

100
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:12,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was actually just so

101
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:25,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Our ordinance is 49-34, or in section 49-34, the notice is both at the start of the tenancy and at the end, and it's for any reason.

102
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:30,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to switch over to the document we have.

103
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:35,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So the document we have, our document, is not just a document.

104
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:41,157
[SPEAKER_01]: about their so this also provides some resources for them as well.

105
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:43,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, I want to make sure I'm heard on the thing.

106
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:58,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So the it includes information about rental assistance funds, metro housing, Boston, on the housing authority, like what are some resources that if they are in fact leaving, they can have available to them as well.

107
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:05,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one of the things that we like about this is that we can put any Medford specific programs on to here as well.

108
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:18,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So the state form, this would accompany the state form for a notice to quit, but it would also be given to them when they start and if the building is sold or something else is happening.

109
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:21,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemming?

110
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:24,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick point of information from Councilor Scarpa.

111
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you repeat the section of the Mass General Law that you mentioned earlier?

112
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:48,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I apologize for that.

113
00:11:49,471 --> 00:12:05,459
[SPEAKER_08]: When a state law is in place, and we have, I understand the fact that we're putting in an ordinance to beef that up, but when it goes to a judge, would they look, they wouldn't look at what we're implementing.

114
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it hold muster if it goes to a court?

115
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,079
[SPEAKER_08]: like with the state ruling or what the state's asking and then what we're asking.

116
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I understand if somebody challenges our law and it goes to court or if the tenant is being evicted and goes to court.

117
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:36,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if it goes to court, is it a binding law that it would be using it as either defense or, you know, you're battling it goes to a court for eviction?

118
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,014
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what a judge, right?

119
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that as a binding bind?

120
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it binding in the eyes of the court?

121
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:55,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, am I correct in understanding you to be saying if somebody is being evicted and they weren't given this document, could their lawyer say to the judge, but I wasn't served proper notice because I wasn't given this document?

122
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:56,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

123
00:12:57,122 --> 00:13:00,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that is not the intent of this document.

124
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:00,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

125
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:00,985
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

126
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:01,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

127
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:01,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

128
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I, I appreciate, um, I,

129
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:09,090
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the goals of this meeting is just a general update of where we are at in rolling out the implementation.

130
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:21,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other, especially now that it's been a year since we were talking about this in public meeting, is to have these clarifying conversations about what is the intent of this and what does it do and what are the consequences and what aren't the consequences.

131
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:26,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as the sponsor of the original ordinance now passed,

132
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:36,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there is nothing about the notification document that would affect eviction proceedings at all.

133
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:46,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that there's anything about the notification document that would... The intent of the document is to be something that can go to a tenant and say,

134
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:49,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some info.

135
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:53,215
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an issue, here's who you can call.

136
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:54,916
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a question, here's who you can call.

137
00:13:55,276 --> 00:14:01,400
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question and this is the language you speak and it's not English, here's who you can call just to be informative.

138
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:08,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And the intent of that is to really make sure that people are empowered with information before they have any sort of issue or problem, which is intended to be.

139
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:13,445
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial for a tenant or property owner, everybody in that relationship.

140
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:20,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the enforcement side, I don't think this would ever impact, you know, should a notice to quit be issued.

141
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:24,708
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's another condition that prompts an eviction, this would not affect that timeline.

142
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we put it very clearly in the ordinance.

143
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:34,971
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is something that is intended to be an informative and educational ordinance, not something that we're going to be

144
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:50,899
[SPEAKER_02]: looking and looking for evidence of non-compliance to issue tickets, but rather to be something that we can follow up and saying, let's make sure that everybody gets the information before they need it, and that our city staff can be working proactively to make sure that this is getting out to the community in an accessible way.

145
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,482
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate the opportunity to clarify that.

146
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:56,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

147
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:59,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So Madam Chair, I may share with you

148
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,453
[SPEAKER_01]: what that on this document, it's not just about evictions.

149
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:13,921
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that it seems to us that a good tenant is an educated tenant, they know what their responsibilities are and the landlord's responsibilities.

150
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:20,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some frequently asked questions on here, including things like what can I be charged to move into my home?

151
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Can my landlord increase my rent?

152
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a limit?

153
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:28,115
[SPEAKER_01]: How should my security deposit and last month's rent be handled?

154
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,498
[SPEAKER_01]: When can my landlord enter my home?

155
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,362
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get my landlord to make repairs?

156
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:36,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I be charged for utilities?

157
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I sublet or share my unit with another renter?

158
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So like these are all things that

159
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:43,733
[SPEAKER_01]: tenants should know.

160
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:48,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And some sometimes you feel like, well, of course, people know the answers to this.

161
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:52,037
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, things are different from state to state and country to country.

162
00:15:52,798 --> 00:16:00,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody who's always grown up in a single family owner occupied home, they actually have no idea about the answers to some of these questions.

163
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:09,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea of the document is, in fact, that it is designed to help somebody even as they're moving in, and not just as they're leaving.

164
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I might, to that end, we started to really, in our office, think about how do we get this out to the landlords so they would know that they need to give this out.

165
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:29,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more we talked about it and consulted people who understand real estate law, and we work with the assessor's office to understand what data people have,

166
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:38,172
[SPEAKER_01]: we kind of came to the realization that we think we should send it to everybody who owns residential property in the city of Medford.

167
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:42,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is because you might own a single family home.

168
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:49,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And two months from now, you might relocate unexpectedly to Virginia and decide to rent your house.

169
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you are a landlord and you weren't before, right?

170
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody could suddenly become a landlord.

171
00:16:55,866 --> 00:17:07,918
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that you live next door to somebody who didn't notice this or forgot about this notice and didn't share it to their tenants and their tenants are your friends now.

172
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:12,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can actually say, well, actually, you know, I know about this notice.

173
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,683
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the city's website.

174
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can share that information that it exists.

175
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:24,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of getting it out there into the community as a known document that exists feels like it would benefit everybody.

176
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:30,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we try to say, how could we tell who was an

177
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:38,521
[SPEAKER_01]: It is extremely difficult because we do not have a rental registry to know for sure which properties are being rented.

178
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:42,963
[SPEAKER_01]: When is the landlord actually still getting mail at that property address?

179
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:43,564
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens.

180
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:49,047
[SPEAKER_01]: If you own a two-family and your owner occupied, you are in fact getting mail at that address.

181
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:54,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So we realized that filtering that out was becoming difficult.

182
00:17:55,413 --> 00:18:06,999
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thought, though, is that it's not clear to us that we actually want to send this notice to everybody because it should be updated as our programs change and as the law change.

183
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,903
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're thinking about sending is a letter that says,

184
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:17,386
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this new ordinance that was passed in the city of Medford.

185
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:23,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are a landlord, you should download this document and you should give it to your new tenant.

186
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:27,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were thinking that that would get out to everybody.

187
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:42,452
[SPEAKER_01]: People would be all go to the website and look at the document and that that would be more beneficial than just sending this flyer to some limited group that we were having trouble figuring out who are the landlords in Medford.

188
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Alicia.

189
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that approach.

190
00:18:47,738 --> 00:19:04,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, like we said, the goal of this is to be informative, if we all recognize that a healthy tenant-landlord relationship is one where everybody knows what their responsibilities are and their resources are, tenants included, and know what to expect and what to expect of themselves.

191
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:09,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the best recipe for a healthy and unproblematic relationship.

192
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:13,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw President Beers, Councilor Lemming, and then back to you, Councilor Scarpelli.

193
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:14,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

194
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:15,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.

195
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:22,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the rental registry conundrum has been a real issue in terms of the short term rental piece of things as well.

196
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:24,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking to Commissioner

197
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:38,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that that's an issue on that question as well, because it's so hard to know who's doing Airbnb.

198
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,546
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we figure it out?

199
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And Airbnb won't tell us.

200
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So interested in some solutions around that as well.

201
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:51,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Just had a question on the content of the notification.

202
00:19:53,905 --> 00:20:06,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it note that these are like the state law minimums or maximums, but then also note that like check your lease because your lease may have, you may have signed something that has different requirements.

203
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:17,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for example, like if you don't have separate meters at the house that the landlord has to pay for the electric, but if you do have separate meters, then you can sign a lease that says I have to pay for the electric, right?

204
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:18,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's certain kind of nuances.

205
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's always important to remind

206
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:25,752
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that this is what the law says, but check your lease as well.

207
00:20:25,832 --> 00:20:26,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that in there?

208
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:35,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't specify to check the lease, but there's a question on can I be charged for utilities?

209
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:45,349
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's response saying that your landlord must pay for water, gas, electricity, hot water and heat unless you agree to pay for those in your lease or rental agreement.

210
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:46,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

211
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,996
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think we could include a question which specifically talks about the lease.

212
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,321
[SPEAKER_00]: and to check that during the rental agreement.

213
00:20:55,641 --> 00:21:00,923
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's built into the answers, you know, I think that's, you know, as long as it's in, I can go either way on it.

214
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:02,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just a good reminder.

215
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:11,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it doesn't apply to everything, but you know, if all the questions where it applies, it says, and be sure to check your lease, because this is, you could have signed something that says something different.

216
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:12,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's sufficient.

217
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:13,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good suggestion.

218
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:14,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

219
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:17,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Councillor Lennon.

220
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:20,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

221
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:25,966
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that a rental registry would be be an excellent idea.

222
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:44,012
[SPEAKER_04]: The two things that I just like to get some information on which I believe Council President bears touched on a little bit here is first of all, how much would it what would be estimated cost and effort be to send out the notification every

223
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:49,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Property owner in the city and what would be the capacity of your office?

224
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:53,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you estimate to design and upkeep a rental registry?

225
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:55,094
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time.

226
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So rental registry would not be managed by our office.

227
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:07,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It would certainly have to go through the building department, which is where the Airbnb goes through and they do building permits.

228
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:11,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be get built into the citizen serve system that exists.

229
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not speak to what the workload would be on that.

230
00:22:16,082 --> 00:22:21,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely something that has been recommended by some of our previous sanitarians.

231
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:25,009
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something worthy of discussing with our new building commissioner as well.

232
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:29,036
[SPEAKER_01]: The other question was the cost of the mailing.

233
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:39,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be our intention, right now, we are talking to the treasurer about not doing a separate mailing, but actually, can we include it in the tax bill?

234
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,863
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that we could send it in the water bill.

235
00:22:44,684 --> 00:22:50,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that putting a one-pager in the water bill, color one-sided is usually,

236
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:58,264
[SPEAKER_01]: about $3,000 because that's what I do with the rain barrel program every year.

237
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:17,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also aware, because of that, that the water bill does not go to all property owners, that you can opt out and you can get it electronic only, and there is no way, last I checked, which would have been this time last year, to attach a notice to the electronic water bill.

238
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:20,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would actually only go to those people who have not yet opted out.

239
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:28,515
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why we're pursuing, we've reached out to the treasurer about doing it in the tax bill.

240
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:47,125
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to us that it is possible with the approval of the mayor, which would be straightforward, but we're just clarifying, because there was a little confusion whether she was saying, sure, you can do it in the water bill, or whether she was saying, sure, but we usually do it in the water bill.

241
00:23:47,145 --> 00:23:48,906
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to make sure there are no cross signals there.

242
00:23:50,567 --> 00:24:04,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd expect that if we're sending just the letter, that it's going to be on that order and our office can cover that amount this semester, this spring.

243
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why my brain is in school land.

244
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:08,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Kids.

245
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:10,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

246
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:13,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I just paid the bill, didn't I, Alicia?

247
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:14,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I just paid John's job.

248
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a cover your questions?

249
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:19,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

250
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:20,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I get them all?

251
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

252
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:24,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

253
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Similar similar questions my colleagues brought up.

254
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:34,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it's funny when we see some of the biggest issues we have is the policing and the notification and who's doing it.

255
00:24:35,614 --> 00:24:40,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it falls back in an office that's undermanned and overworked.

256
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:47,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that that's that's I think that's the, the, the concern is making sure the word gets out so.

257
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:54,894
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking, you know, I know that landlords don't always oversee their properties.

258
00:24:54,954 --> 00:25:15,063
[SPEAKER_08]: So you look at real estate agents, and we have, we have a lot of great real estate agents that are responsible, and maybe finding a way to marry them to also share that information to share to their tenants if that's their will, or is it just something that goes right to the homeowner, and it leaves it up to them?

259
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think right now the,

260
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:29,099
[SPEAKER_08]: the biggest issue is that I see it's the intent is awesome, getting it out there, making sure that people are informed in this, you know, so one of the questions what is, is a redundant?

261
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:37,147
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it isn't redundant, because the state law looks at one thing, but we're looking at multiple factors that pay into a landlord.

262
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,130
[SPEAKER_08]: tenant agreement.

263
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:45,131
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I, I was fortunate that I had, we had the best landlord in my life.

264
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:45,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was my dad.

265
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:58,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And he had, we had landlord, we were, we had renters that lived with us for 15 years, and bought their home, another 15 years, bought a home.

266
00:25:58,677 --> 00:26:01,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And now my dad's been gone seven years, the tenants that are still there.

267
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:04,180
[SPEAKER_08]: they've been there for about 12 years now.

268
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot to say about a good landlord tenant relationship.

269
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:15,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And, but I think that the biggest thing is really going to be that I want to focus on as we move forward.

270
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:20,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is really now bringing in the building department saying, how are we going to do this?

271
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:24,697
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's, it's, like you said, Alicia had it all right here, you know, the tax bill, you know, I,

272
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:50,960
[SPEAKER_08]: the water bill is right because I don't pay the water anymore I go right online and do it so I wouldn't get that information so I think that these are the these are the big issues as we're vetting that's what we have in these meetings that people have to understand because I know that the the intent that people thought this meeting was for is we're going to do rent control again and uh I said so this is once again not that meeting I appreciate Vice President Collins clarifying that and and everybody understanding that

273
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:55,345
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a journey that we still have to vet out some very important pieces.

274
00:26:55,405 --> 00:27:04,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I think we look at the situation we had last year, it gives us an avenue to support our renters and our landlords.

275
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:05,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're prepared.

276
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:06,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

277
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:17,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, if I might, it has come to my attention, one of the things I've wanted to do for many years is to engage with the real estate agents who do business in Medford.

278
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:27,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never been aware of a way to get that, the list, how do we, but it has actually come to my attention that we can get the list of real estate agents licensed doing business in the city of Medford.

279
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:31,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are gonna connect and get that list.

280
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:41,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we could also, I, as of yet, don't know if that would be attached to email addresses, it would be my preference to email stuff out to everybody.

281
00:27:42,423 --> 00:27:44,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we can't just do that with property owners.

282
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:48,386
[SPEAKER_01]: But if not, then we would paper mail it to them as well.

283
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:58,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so we would really like to work with as soon as we said that actually Brenda who does energy and the energy efficiency in our office and can I get that list too, I want to work with real estate agents.

284
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,871
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so hopefully we'll start a new relationship there.

285
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:03,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

286
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:03,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Director.

287
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:16,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's exciting to hear about different ways of collaborating with, you know, not just property owners, but also real estate agents in the city to make sure that all these initiatives and all the good work that I think everybody wants to be doing, that we can be staying on the same page and synthesizing about that.

288
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to the housing planner and then Councilor Behrs.

289
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:21,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Madam Chair, Councilor Behrs.

290
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to clarify on the question of checking lease before signing the agreement.

291
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:29,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably that's not there in the notification.

292
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:40,110
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because the notification is handed only after the lease agreement is signed, but there will be details on utility charges and what happens if they are provided a notification to quit.

293
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:41,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

294
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:42,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

295
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:42,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

296
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:46,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And just my other question.

297
00:28:47,754 --> 00:28:51,640
[SPEAKER_03]: folks who pay their taxes through their mortgage, which is a lot of people in the city today.

298
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,766
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so there's still some people aren't open to it.

299
00:28:56,086 --> 00:28:57,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what I hear.

300
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:59,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I was debating that myself.

301
00:28:59,371 --> 00:28:59,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

302
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was thinking, you know, my mortgage is paid my escrow account, but I

303
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:05,339
[SPEAKER_01]: open it eventually.

304
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:11,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our thought was that if there was extra pages in there, you might notice that something's weird about it and be more likely to open it.

305
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:14,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it's an interesting question.

306
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:21,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Would people be more likely to open a letter from the city addressed to them at their address?

307
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,245
[SPEAKER_01]: than something that is clearly their real estate tax bill, right?

308
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:29,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are they more likely to open?

309
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:38,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually a really tough call, which is why if it's just a separate letter, it incurs significant additional costs to mail it out.

310
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:42,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's significantly cheaper to do it through the real estate bills.

311
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:55,755
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it would be good to do additional outreach to like put out a press release that says this document is now available and to start some buzz about it, that it's available.

312
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:56,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how you get it.

313
00:29:56,655 --> 00:30:01,899
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's on it and stuff through the social media, the other avenues that we use.

314
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm guessing these are probably questions for

315
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:16,448
[SPEAKER_03]: the Treasury Department, or even for Commissioner Vandewaal, who was surprised that he runs the mail metering system, when he was like, I've been trying to fix the mail machine.

316
00:30:16,468 --> 00:30:18,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that was my job.

317
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:24,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing we just print this on the bulk envelopes that go out, and there's no way that we could put like a stamp on.

318
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:28,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing we don't buy envelopes for the tax bills every year.

319
00:30:28,214 --> 00:30:33,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And could we put something on it that's like, please open, there's also city information inside, like on the envelope itself.

320
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,862
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting question.

321
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:38,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the way our tax bills go out is through a mailing house.

322
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:44,464
[SPEAKER_01]: So we send PDFs to a mailing house company, and they do the whole thing.

323
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:47,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Those never actually come through City Hall.

324
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:47,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

325
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:52,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be interesting if they could special print on the envelope, maybe.

326
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't charge us for it.

327
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:57,266
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll ask for a price.

328
00:30:57,306 --> 00:31:00,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Envelopes, when you open them up, they... Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

329
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Read this, yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Prize inside.

331
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:07,262
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't like it, but it's still a prize.

332
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:16,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure they have to print the return address on it anyway, so I don't know.

333
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:21,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, there's probably one sitting on my dining room table unopened.

334
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Unopened, exactly.

335
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:24,512
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

336
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:47,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Behrens, and I appreciate, you know, when we were developing this ordinance over the course of several months leading up to, I think we passed it in February 2023, most of our conversations were centered around how do we make this something that is accessible, that people can understand, that people who don't read English can language, can access in the language they understand.

337
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:52,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, how do we make this tool that is meant to be informational, how do we make it easy to access?

338
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate, you know, now that we're talking about

339
00:31:55,583 --> 00:32:06,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that City staff is taking the time to make sure that this is done right in that same spirit of we want to make sure that everybody who needs to know that this is a new requirement hears about it.

340
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:12,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that we're thinking through the communication channels that the city already uses, that the conversation is starting with.

341
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:15,859
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we use to physically get this into people's hands?

342
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know it's probably a fraction of all Medford residents and property owners that are on the city's

343
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:27,473
[SPEAKER_02]: social media channels and accessing what local news we have left.

344
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:33,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I appreciate that those are, you know, perhaps going to be supplementary tools to getting this information out, but that primarily we're thinking through.

345
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:38,756
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what's the best mailing to use so that this is cost-effective that we make sure that people hear about it.

346
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:52,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was especially happy to hear that staff is thinking in the direction of, you know, the mailing that will go out to property owners will include sort of a signal, like, there is a new requirement to send out a document.

347
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:53,482
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not that document.

348
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:55,203
[SPEAKER_02]: That document lives online.

349
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:56,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, here's how to access it.

350
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:57,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how to print it out.

351
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:02,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how to send it to the library and get it printed out, rather than sending a static document that then

352
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:10,461
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll get photocopied until it's illegible or we'll get updated and people won't benefit from that updated information and so on.

353
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:15,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

354
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:31,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we're moving in the right direction, but I think that we keep this in the committee and actually call for a meeting with the building department and try to see once we gather more information with what our office of

355
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:47,153
[SPEAKER_08]: planning is doing, and we can, like we said, these meetings are great, and what they're intended for is to vet these processes out where, you know, you get phone calls as a counselor saying, we're doing something today.

356
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:56,676
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, no, understand there's a process, and these small processes hopefully get us to a resolution where everybody looks at the final product and say, this is how it benefits everybody.

357
00:33:57,256 --> 00:34:20,622
[SPEAKER_08]: no one's out to get anyone this isn't a conspiracy theory this is something that's hopefully going to work so i think that the biggest question right now is how we how we get the information out and then um in the building department how we're going to oversee that uh this that's that piece of it so so i would recommend we move with that as a as a motion thank you councillor scarpelli

358
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:28,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second on the motion to keep the paper in committee and reconvene for another update, perhaps on timeline as we get later into the spring?

359
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:28,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

360
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Second from Councilor Lemming.

361
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:50,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to reiterate, you know, the content of this meeting so far on the ongoing implementation rollout of the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance, we've had a, I think, a really helpful update from city staff where we're at with the timeline.

362
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:56,694
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the questions still on the table for finalizing the document and then alerting everybody who ought to be alerted about it?

363
00:34:57,755 --> 00:35:05,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there's some energy to try to get the document finalized and begin to roll that out, you know, this spring, by June, I think.

364
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,723
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a committee that meets often.

365
00:35:07,743 --> 00:35:08,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It meets every two weeks.

366
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:13,809
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fairly straightforward conversation because we've talked about this ordinance so many times before.

367
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:27,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I just say that to note that even though there's a lot of competition for meeting dates in this committee in particular, because we're doing zoning in this committee, I'm sure that this is something where we can have a quick update on an evening that's shared with other topics.

368
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:33,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, oh, peanut gallery over here.

369
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:43,432
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to keep the paper in committee seconded by

370
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:45,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemming, all in favor.

371
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:46,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, roll call.

372
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:52,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to keep the paper committee call for a future meeting and then with the ability for them to reconvene later.

373
00:35:53,372 --> 00:35:53,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

374
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:54,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

375
00:35:54,573 --> 00:35:55,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Got that.

376
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:57,154
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ready.

377
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:01,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I forgot how to call a roll call vote.

378
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:05,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

379

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]: Five in favor, none opposed.

389
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes.

390
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:25,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any further comment from councilors or members of the public that would wish to speak?

391
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:30,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Or last words from city staff for now.

392
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:32,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn.

393
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:34,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by President Behrs.

394
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

395
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:51,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And while the clerk is getting ready, I'd just like to say thank you again to Alicia and Aditi for working with us on developing this ordinance in the previous term and for doing such a thoughtful job of implementation in this one.

396
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:51,856
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

397
00:37:05,841 --> 00:37:09,402
