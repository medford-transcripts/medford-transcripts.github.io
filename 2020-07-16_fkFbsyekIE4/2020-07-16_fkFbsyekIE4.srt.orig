1
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:00,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

2
00:00:00,814 --> 00:00:01,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think we're in good shape.

3
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:06,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, people can keep on joining in as they wish.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll keep on letting them in.

5
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:11,284
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll kind of just get started with some updates with the campaign.

6
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:15,728
[SPEAKER_07]: The goal of today is that we'll be doing some updates until 830.

7
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:17,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Just everything going on in the campaign.

8
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:24,399
[SPEAKER_07]: just all of it because there's so much all the time and I want to make sure that everyone who's interested knows about it.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:33,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at 8 30 ish once we've finished updates will be an option if anyone wants to pop off and be done for the night they can but that will that's also when we'll open it up to other questions.

10
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:40,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So either for the kitchen cabinet, or I assume most questions will be for Anna, but that will be kind of towards the end of the whole thing.

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd say for the most part, she likes to answer anything under the sun.

12
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:48,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So it can be policy related, it can be campaign strategy related, it can be funny story related, all that.

13
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:53,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So feel free to start cooking up those in your mind as we get going.

14
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,163
[SPEAKER_07]: But so again, welcome, welcome.

15
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:59,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I am very excited about everything that we have

16
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Going on right now, we have a lot of momentum building.

17
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:07,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone knows what today is, but today is the exact marker of seven weeks until primary day.

18
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:09,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

19
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:11,358
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got seven Saturdays.

20
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,760
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got seven Monday, Wednesday, and Sundays of phone banks.

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,800
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got seven meet and greets.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,041
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got seven of everything.

23
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:18,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the plan.

24
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:19,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven to win.

25
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:21,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are totally, we've got all this momentum.

26
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:26,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten some great endorsements coming in recently, particularly from Sunrise Tufts, which is so exciting.

27
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:29,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Spencer is here, one of our Sunrise representatives.

28
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:31,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so, so excited about that.

29
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:35,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, a couple weeks ago, had a forum.

30
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:39,829
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a forum that Anna attended and Christine Barber was at as well.

31
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotten some great video from that, some great, it was very well received, where Anna was able to make her case, which was exciting.

32
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:50,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And overall, so campaigning under COVID has been,

33
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:52,709
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult to say nonetheless.

34
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:57,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have, I think everyone in this room has really risen to the occasion.

35
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:04,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just part of tonight, I just also want to say thank you, thank you, thank you for the fundraising, for the volunteering, doing it all virtually and remotely.

36
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:07,238
[SPEAKER_07]: We've really made Black our home in a lot of ways.

37
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:18,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to make a quick plug before we get to some brief introductions that in Slack, there are basically four channels where if you're not a part of, I definitely recommend you consider joining besides just the general channel.

38
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,842
[SPEAKER_07]: There is our communication, our comms channel, so hashtag comms.

39
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:27,503
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, any time we have new lit or designs or copy for things to go up, we tend to post it there.

40
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:30,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And Anna is nothing but about transparency.

41
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:32,085
[SPEAKER_07]: and always wants opinions.

42
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:37,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time she and I have a disagreement, her answer always is, great, so let's ask other people.

43
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:37,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's open it up.

44
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,511
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things I love about her.

45
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So comms is one of the places that we aim to do that.

46
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:48,678
[SPEAKER_07]: We also are doing more coordination in our social media channels, so hashtag social media for posts, things that we want to get out there.

47
00:02:49,518 --> 00:03:01,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also have our we have a random channel for just fun random things and jokes and we have a brand new spanking canvassing channel where obviously there's some great photos and things going on since we just launched canvassing last week.

48
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:03,109
[SPEAKER_07]: So just want to make a quick plug for those.

49
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I do also just want to go around and I we have a very large expansive kitchen cabinet, which is very exciting.

50
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:12,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to go down the line and have those introduced

51
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:29,273
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves, and so just giving, I'd say almost everyone here is involved in a little bit of everything, has many, many hats, but they will just mention the most common hat or hats that they wear, because I'd say it's very fair that everyone does a whole lot.

52
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:36,818
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, so I'll just mention, I'm Caitlin, her pronouns are she, her, and I'm the campaign manager.

53
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:42,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Erin, she, her pronouns, and I'm the field director, and I write policy and emails.

54
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:49,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my name is Ann Sheeher, and I'm a social media coordinator as well as research coordinator.

[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Nick.

[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

80
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it okay?

81
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not so many people on.

82
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:15,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Can those folks?

83
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:19,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was literally just about to get into that.

84
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally with you.

85
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:22,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, it looks like we spent enough time together.

86
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:29,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I will just mention we have a few other people who are not able to join tonight who are also constantly doing things with Kitchen Cabinet.

87
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,787
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Sam who is also involved with our website.

00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:43,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And Louise, who does fundraising and house parties.

91
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So really, really great crew.

92
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:53,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also love to just, for introduction, kick it over to Josh and then Steve and Lena and Steve.

93
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:56,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Josh.

94
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:59,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been volunteering phone making for many weeks now.

95
00:05:59,154 --> 00:05:59,554
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been great.

96
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:03,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

97
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:05,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And Steve or dad, I should say.

98
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:08,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Steve.

99
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:10,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Him, her?

100
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:11,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Him, he?

101
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:12,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

102
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:13,674
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

103
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:19,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just supporting my daughters and supporting this great campaign and just very proud of them.

104
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:20,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Great to be here.

105
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:21,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

106
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lena and Zach.

107
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:26,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, we're here.

108
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:37,149
[SPEAKER_09]: We handed out literature for Anna once on primary night for the presidential election, and we've phoned banks a couple times, and Aaron just called us the other day, so I wanted to join.

109
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it, welcome.

110
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,430
[SPEAKER_15]: And Steve.

111
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi all, Steve, he, him, and I'm helping out with a strategy around racial justice.

112
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:48,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, and Spencer.

113
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'm Spencer, and I'm from Sunrise Tufts and just here to help.

114
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:57,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

115
00:06:58,363 --> 00:06:59,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

116
00:06:59,364 --> 00:06:59,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

117
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:08,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And with all that being said, I will now kick it over the last, but absolutely certainly not least, because the reason we all are all here, Miss Anna Callahan.

118
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:09,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are you again?

119
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Anna Callahan, she, her.

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I am running for office.

121
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.

122
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:24,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, I'm so happy to be back at the doors, right?

123
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:27,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Knocking on doors and talking to voters is super fun.

124
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love it.

125
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:34,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just tell you a little bit about what I say to people because it's kind of fun and how people react.

126
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, hey, you know, I'm

127
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:40,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Anna Callahan, I'm running for state rep, software engineer and mom.

128
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:44,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I ask, do you know much about the state house?

129
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:45,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, not really.

130
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:50,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, well, I'll tell you two fun facts that you can share with your friends.

131
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:54,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one is that there's no way for any of us to know how our state reps are voting.

132
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:55,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two,

133
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:02,090
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the last three speakers of the house have all been convicted of felonies related to corruption and bribery.

134
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:14,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just had someone today who after I did that, and then of course I go on to explain why that matters and what the policies are that we cannot pass because of this broken system, blah, blah, blah.

135
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:23,935
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody just today was like, I really like your pitch because when you said there were two things that are fun facts, I thought, oh, well, there's only two.

136
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I have time for those.

137
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:28,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you're done, it was really interesting.

138
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yes, that is what I was going for.

139
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:48,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, almost everyone I talk to is convinced and they're going to vote for us, or they just want to do some due diligence.

140
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,356
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to kind of look and read up a bit.

141
00:08:53,702 --> 00:09:12,577
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've even, I tell you, I've had a number of people who, the longest conversations I have are with people who, the rare person that I talk to who has worked with Christine on something or who, you know, is a kind of regular caller and those people are,

142
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,073
[SPEAKER_02]: all very, very rare, but just talked to one the other day.

143
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:22,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, she had time, I had time.

144
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:27,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked, the concentration of power in the hands of the speaker

145
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:34,067
[SPEAKER_02]: She was interested in that, but she wasn't convinced by it.

146
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:52,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until I started talking about the work I've done over the last four years and co-governance and how the people who have been marginalized, who are not engaged in the political process have got to be at the decision-making table.

147
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:56,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was what convinced her.

148
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:12,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of my, you know, I keep it in my back pocket for the people that aren't convinced by the first argument, which is almost everyone is convinced by the transparency and the power of the speaker argument, but that's always there.

149
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:17,534
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the movement building aspect, which in my heart is kind of the true

150
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:30,012
[SPEAKER_02]: reason why I am running and the thing that will be different about me from most other people who are elected representatives is that once I've always got that.

151
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I probably spoke too long.

152
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:36,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to say something about the difference between me and Christine.

153
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:42,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure anybody here doesn't already know, but you know, we've got

154
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,577
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got a real problem at the state house, right?

155
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:50,057
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot pass no brainer legislation.

156
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Caitlin, you're gonna love this.

157
00:10:51,118 --> 00:11:00,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at a door today and I was like, and we can, you know, because of this concentration of power in the hands of the speaker, we cannot pass election day registration.

158
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't pass, you know, 100% renewables by 2050, 2050.

159
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was like, those are no brainers.

160
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:13,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I always say at the door, is no-brainer policies.

161
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:15,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So she took the words right out of my mouth.

162
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:16,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are no-brainers.

163
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yes, they are.

164
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:19,067
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

165
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:20,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough from me.

166
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:27,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to go ahead and pass this on to a voter in the district, Mr. Greg Nadeau.

167
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:29,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.

168
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:30,955
[SPEAKER_01]: My name's Greg.

169
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:36,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And 30 years ago, I was legislative aide, campaign manager, then legislative aide for a state rep.

170
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:40,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Worked in the statehouse and observed firsthand

171
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:47,889
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentration of power in both branches really prevented progressive legislation from moving forward.

172
00:11:49,350 --> 00:12:02,540
[SPEAKER_01]: In recent years, I've been pleasantly seeing that the State Senate, ever since Stan Rosenberg has been president, has improved substantially, but the House really hasn't.

173
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been saying for a number of years that you cannot be a progressive and vote for the Speaker.

174
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter how many times

175
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:16,005
[SPEAKER_01]: progressive legislators say that they co-sponsor wonderful things, vote the right way.

176
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:21,968
[SPEAKER_01]: The only vote that matters is the vote that prevents all progressive legislation from continuing and that is the vote for the speaker.

177
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:38,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a phone call from one of you, I'm not forget whom, someone can identify themselves who called me and I was driving along doing some errands and said voting for Alec in a Callahan or support in a calendar and I said,

178
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,578
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm with Christine.

179
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Christine is a great rep.

180
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:42,480
[SPEAKER_01]: She's my favorite in the delegation.

181
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like her very much.

182
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's smart.

183
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's got integrity, blah, blah, blah.

184
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just sort of had this pause.

185
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:50,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, wait a second.

186
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:56,006
[SPEAKER_01]: From the message that the person said about reforming statehouse, I said, well, OK, I'll come to a house party.

187
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to attended a house party, asked some questions.

188
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:02,429
[SPEAKER_01]: My son, Max, was also there.

189
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And really- I think you actually grilled me.

190
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:09,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was late.

191
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've completely passed.

192
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:15,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I said I would, and I did talk to Christine a couple of days after that.

193
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:26,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And Christine did not respond with a firm commitment to oppose the speaker and to dilute the concentration of power in the House that prevents all progressive legislation from falling.

194
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:30,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said that I would now be shifting my support.

195
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,522
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am, happy to be involved.

196
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:35,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty involved in Somerville in a lot of ways.

197
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:36,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here for 20 years.

198
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:49,418
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely know every city councilor and school committee member and mayor and everyone else very, very well and tend to talk to all of them and say, look, either you're with the speaker or you're with progressive causes.

199
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:50,339
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no in between.

200
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like racism.

201
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:52,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot be neutral on racism.

202
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Either you're actively opposing racism or you are part of the status quo that is perpetuating.

203
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:07,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everyone who is supporting Christine is fundamentally supporting a status quo that is preventing climate change, racial justice, and everything else that we care about from progressing.

204
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:26,470
[SPEAKER_12]: And because that house party was so successful with Greg being able to have all of these answers or these questions answered by Anna, we are now gonna have more opportunities for people to come to meet and greets to directly speak with Anna and fall in love with her.

205
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,792
[SPEAKER_12]: They're gonna be at seven o'clock every Thursday until the election.

206
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:31,972
[SPEAKER_12]: We are so excited.

207
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:34,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda and I are working on that.

208
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, city.

209
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:40,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're really excited.

210
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:41,765
[SPEAKER_12]: to do this every week.

211
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:42,606
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be great.

212
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:44,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Caitlin?

213
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:48,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me unmute myself.

214
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:48,629
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

215
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

216
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

217
00:14:51,090 --> 00:15:03,136
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that all being said, I also just wanted to give a couple just overall kind of updates on where we are on the fundraising front, on our kind of plan to win and all of that, because I know I mentioned that before.

218
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:06,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So for those of you who, if you didn't see the email we had sent out before,

219
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:09,180
[SPEAKER_07]: which if you didn't read all the emails, I totally understand.

220
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Anna and I both cannot keep up with our inboxes at times.

221
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:23,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But we, as of the end of June, we had actually raised not only more money than, oh wait, one second, we have a guest joining us.

222
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:28,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me, great, so we have a guest who just joined us.

223
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:30,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Bob, how are you?

224
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, where?

225
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm well, Caitlin.

226
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:34,802
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

227
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:36,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very, very good.

228
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:37,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad you could join us.

229
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:48,585
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you who do not know, Bob Massey ran for governor here in Massachusetts in 2018 in the Democratic primary, lives here in Centerville and is beloved.

230
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:56,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, Bob, do you want to share some thoughts that you have with us about the campaign or how you're thinking of voting?

231
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I'm so glad to see all of you.

232
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:03,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of you from other work.

233
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:07,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Anna, I see you over here in the corner.

234
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And Frank, how are you?

235
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:09,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.

236
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:15,200
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you, I didn't know anything about Anna a couple of months ago.

237
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,602
[SPEAKER_00]: I was over in Italy,

238
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:30,065
[SPEAKER_00]: because my wife Anne was running their Rhode Island School of Design's program, and then it became pretty clear by February that Italy wasn't the place we should stay, so we came back to the U.S.

239
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:36,867
[SPEAKER_00]: and lived in Providence for a little while because we had rented our house in Somerville.

240
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:43,829
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came back, and I began hearing a little bit about Anna here and there, and I thought, well, this is interesting.

241
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,450
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm someone who had

242
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:58,836
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, thought Christine was doing an okay job, but when Anna really made it her business to get in touch with me, which I appreciated, we had the chance to, I had the chance to learn about her and then we had a chance to talk.

243
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And I must say, I was just super impressed.

244
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:13,303
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's clear from everything that Anna has done that she has not only the kind of values that I think we all care about, but she has the passion and the willingness to really work hard and take on

245
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:17,667
[SPEAKER_00]: those people in the structures who don't really want change.

246
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And they talk about change, but they don't really want to do it.

247
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:29,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conversations with Anna and looking at her skills, strategic skills, organizing skills, and then

248
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:53,553
[SPEAKER_00]: uh seeing her energy and her boldness and uh and frankly I said this and I wasn't sure that she would like it but I said you know you seem very energetic bold and noisy and I wasn't sure that noisy would be received as a compliment but it was and uh and I think being noisy is a very very important qualification now

249
00:17:54,373 --> 00:18:17,883
[SPEAKER_00]: in this crazy time when, on the one hand, everything is falling apart and we are at risk of being, and I say this not as hyperbole, but I think the country itself, the idea of what the United States should become, that is under threat from this lunatic criminal president and many of the people who are enabling him.

250
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:26,070
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, this turmoil creates opportunity for change.

251
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:36,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things you hear from many people is, you know, today in July, we're talking about things that would have seemed impossible and insane in February.

252
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,844
[SPEAKER_00]: the standard of what we're allowed to talk about, what we're allowed to imagine, what we're allowed to do has changed in just a couple of months.

253
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:53,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And as somebody who's been hoping for that kind of change and working for it for many, many more decades than I want to tell you, this is an exciting moment.

254
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:58,470
[SPEAKER_00]: But it depends on the courage of people to run.

255
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:03,733
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they run to say the things and do the work to win, and then

256
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:09,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really one of the most important things when they win to do what they said they were going to do.

257
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:21,064
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a problem that I have seen many times that there's some, you know, when you walk through the doors of the State House, they hit you with some kind of electric voltage.

258
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:24,867
[SPEAKER_00]: So you forget what it is you wanted to do and you become

259
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:31,817
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated by the idea like how do I not piss off the speaker or how do I, you know, all these internal things.

260
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:43,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I've had many conversations with progressives who got elected and then they tell me things like, well, I can't really do it because I would annoy the speaker and I have to bring home some goodies.

261
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:52,529
[SPEAKER_00]: for my district, well, I think reps should serve their district, but more than anything, they should serve our state and serve our country and our ideals.

262
00:19:53,009 --> 00:20:00,731
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would much rather that somebody did that than they came home and they told me they got $85,000 for a streetlight somewhere.

263
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:03,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We need streetlights, but we need our values a lot more.

264
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:10,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I've gotten to know Anna and see not only what she's trying to do and how she's doing it, I'm very enthusiastic.

265
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:15,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great pleasure to turn on and see 21 participants.

266
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:20,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we can turn that into 121 and more.

267
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,561
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that much time.

268
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:27,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good thing that we all have a little, I'll speak for myself, a little extra time.

269
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:35,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am trying to engage with a couple of different campaigns and I'm very happy that Anna's is one of them.

270
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for inviting me to show up.

271
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And this won't be the only time you see me, I promise.

272
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:43,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to see you, Bob.

273
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks so much for being here.

274
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:52,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I really wanted particularly to share Greg's story and Bob's thoughts as a chance.

275
00:20:52,411 --> 00:21:02,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I know so many people here are doing a lot of direct voter contact, talking on canvassing and on the phones, and these are the types of things you can absolutely talk about, of things that you're hearing.

276
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:09,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I think us really feeling really good about how we're talking to voters on every, you know, wording and stuff is a little different for everyone, and so

277
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:17,129
[SPEAKER_07]: the idea is that it's very helpful to understand other people's perspectives as well because obviously everyone here very much supports and I know we don't we're not trying to convince anyone at the moment.

278
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:32,520
[SPEAKER_07]: But so thank you so much so we're going back to our regular scheduled programming and just with a couple updates like I said on the fundraising front we at the end of June had actually raised more money than any of any other challenger in the area so the similar races in the area

279
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,722
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to raise more money in our campaign than others.

280
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:37,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong, stuff is difficult under COVID.

281
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:40,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Campaigning under COVID is more expensive and it's harder to raise.

282
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't mean we're done.

283
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,608
[SPEAKER_07]: We still absolutely need to keep going.

284
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:50,734
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is my chance to say thank you to all of our recurrent, anyone who signed up for recurring donation, as I know a lot of people have here.

285
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Those donations, every second that Anna and I, that we're not spending on fundraising, it means we're spending it on direct voter contact.

286
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it is, I just really, really appreciate all the support, because I know everyone here has like,

287
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:09,216
[SPEAKER_07]: gone above and beyond and it's just amazing and it's really paid off and it's shown in very hard concrete numbers the amount of amazing incredible support that we have.

288
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:25,024
[SPEAKER_07]: That also being said, what we are doing, and I'm gonna kick it over to Erin in just a minute to talk a little bit about some of our field plan, but basically overall right now, our whole focus is being super COVID safe and figuring out how to campaign differently in the COVID era.

289
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:29,626
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are doing way more phone calls than what would be normal for a campaign like this.

290
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:33,188
[SPEAKER_07]: We are doing extra, extra safe canvassing, which is super exciting.

291
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:38,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And so part of our effort and aim of what we need to do is actually focusing so much on communicating

292
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,190
[SPEAKER_07]: all of those things.

293
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:47,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I also wanted to make sure that there are some proper updates from our amazing organizing squad, which keeps growing every single week and I absolutely love.

294
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,774
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that being said, I'm going to kick it over to Erin.

295
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:52,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

296
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:56,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I want to talk for a little bit just about what we have accomplished thus far.

297
00:22:56,696 --> 00:23:00,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like Katen said, canvassing under COVID is not easy.

298
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Organizing under COVID is not easy.

299
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Campaigning is just

300
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:05,426
[SPEAKER_06]: way, way more challenging.

301
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:14,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, we've been really creative in coming up with different ways to engage the community and talk to voters, and we have just started our canvassing program.

302
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:18,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means we are kind of fitting a whole program into just seven weeks.

303
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like knocking doors on speed.

304
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Extremely excited about it.

305
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:30,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I just spent the last couple of days cutting the entire district, and we are already well on our way through making a first pass.

306
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:37,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And the goal is to not only complete our first pass, but then to go back and do it all over again and make sure that we're talking to every single voter that we can.

307
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:42,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So our Doors universe, basically, people that don't have phone numbers.

308
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:43,177
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of them.

309
00:23:43,877 --> 00:23:48,140
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also done enough phone banking that we found a lot of people just don't pick up the phone.

310
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So those people go on our Knock Doors list.

311
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:52,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.

312
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:53,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Ring-a-ding-ding.

313
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,223
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not picking up the phone?

314
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Knock, knock.

315
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:55,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's me.

316
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:56,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Anna.

317
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:58,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to me.

318
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:00,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've had a lot of good luck with those folks, too.

319
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:05,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So our campaign is on track right now to knock over 8,000 doors and make over 70,000 calls.

320
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:14,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Anna alone is knocking around 100 doors a day right now, which is insane.

321
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:19,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And even more insane is that her persuasion rate is over 50%.

322
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:32,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So the best thing that we can do to win this campaign is just get Anna in front of more people, and more volunteers in front of more people, because when you hear about the platform, people are really, really receptive.

323
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:37,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am gonna kick it over to Anne.

324
00:24:39,824 --> 00:24:41,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, good evening everyone.

325
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:47,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just gonna talk about what is canvassing safely under COVID-19.

326
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a beautiful link that I've sent you.

327
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:52,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll take you to Anna's beautiful website.

328
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:57,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially it is an infographic about how we do our canvassing.

329
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,670
[SPEAKER_04]: First and foremost,

330
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Your safety as canvassers are key because we need you.

331
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:08,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Anna spoke beautifully on Saturday that this work goes beyond this election.

332
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes beyond this moment.

333
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:15,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It is for a lifetime, and we need everyone safe and healthy, and that is first and foremost.

334
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:22,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that being said, what it basically looks like is you show up with your mask, some sunscreen, as I learned, because I got a nice burn.

335
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,886
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the voters called me out on it too, so that was great.

336
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:31,532
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring your sunscreen, water bottle, we will provide the rest.

337
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:38,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We will give you gloves, we will give you all the hand sanitizer, contact-free lid, which Caitlin is going to demonstrate.

338
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a little baggy there you get a goodie bag.

339
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:42,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everyone loves a goodie bag.

340
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:43,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

341
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,730
[SPEAKER_04]: We remember that just from like our childhood.

342
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:47,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So there we go.

343
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,113
[SPEAKER_04]: You show up.

344
00:25:48,473 --> 00:25:56,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Canvas captain, I will be there to motivate you to tell you all of the details, everything you need to know you will be prepared.

345
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I can assure you, if you have any questions.

346
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:04,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna call you the day before, so that way we don't even have to get within six feet of each other.

347
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:10,093
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna have everything set up on your phone, and then I'm gonna have a whiteboard, and I'm gonna write it out.

348
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:12,193
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a question, we're gonna figure it out.

349
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:17,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a professional performer, so I will do charades.

350
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:18,356
[SPEAKER_04]: We will communicate it.

351
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:19,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Safety is first.

352
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:22,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That is all I have to say in that regard.

353
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:24,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm gonna kick it to Susan.

354
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:33,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Susan, are you still there?

355
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:39,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're on mute.

356
00:26:40,338 --> 00:26:40,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

357
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:44,806
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so did you want me to talk about the

358
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:49,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Canvassing or a phone bit any phone bank updates.

359
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:51,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh for the phone baking.

360
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:56,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, so Matt was handling that but I believe we're doing it.

361
00:26:56,569 --> 00:27:08,538
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna be doing it on Monday nights and Sundays at 12 o'clock and then Monday, I think it's from 530 530s till like 730 on Mondays Yep

362
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:15,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

363
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:16,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

364
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still have Wednesdays as well.

365
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:20,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Mondays, Wednesdays and Wednesdays.

366
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:20,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

367
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:21,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

368
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:23,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

369
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:24,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

370
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:29,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to kick it over to Travis for any other updates we have for ways to get ahold of voters.

371
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,513
[SPEAKER_10]: It is yes, actually, that you asked.

372
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,616
[SPEAKER_10]: We have something called relational organizing.

373
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:42,264
[SPEAKER_10]: For those who are uninitiated, it is a little bit different than traditional, you know, like phone banking door-to-door.

374
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:46,449
[SPEAKER_10]: You are pretty much reaching out to people you already have records with.

375
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,812
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like friends, families.

376
00:27:50,914 --> 00:27:53,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Facebook friends, you know, whoever is a familiar face.

377
00:27:54,458 --> 00:28:09,875
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the reasons behind it and like empirical proofs of it is that the people you already have reports with are always more likely than someone you're cold calling or knocking on a door to actually vote for the candidate.

378
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,938
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's actually data proving that.

379
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:20,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also one of the quickest ways to organize because it's usually like a one and done deal.

380
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:26,394
[SPEAKER_10]: You organize a list of people you already know, reach out to them, and it's all taken care of.

381
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,236
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to wait for it to make a phone call.

382
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:29,657
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to go from door to door.

383
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,160
[SPEAKER_10]: It's quick, easy, and fun.

384
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:40,468
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of your old connections actually like hearing from you again, which is always interesting in its own right.

385
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:46,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're using, for relational organizing, we're using an app called Reach.

386
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:52,499
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an app developed by AOC's team, actually, when she ran.

387
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:56,426
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just ended up kind of becoming like an industry standard.

388
00:28:56,446 --> 00:28:59,187
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like very simple to use and pretty fun.

389
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:00,648
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like fun chat features.

390
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:08,751
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm going to post a link in the chat that invites you to join.

391
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:12,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really easy, simple.

392
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:18,080
[SPEAKER_10]: We will follow up with you, help you out, give you training.

393
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really easy, fun.

394
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said fun like three times already, but I just want to emphasize it.

395
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:28,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that is it.

396
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:31,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I will kick it off to Aaron again.

397
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

398
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:37,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I want to talk a little bit about volunteering and recruitment.

399
00:29:37,914 --> 00:29:43,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a growing and robust recruitment squad and recruitment program.

400
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:47,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got, you know, about half a dozen organizers who are making recruitment calls throughout the course of the week.

401
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:53,526
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a really great dedicated volunteer base, but it's really, you know, it's an election.

402
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:54,447
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a numbers game.

403
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:59,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Anna can talk to a ton of people, but she's just one Anna.

404
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, by the numbers, we have knocked over 1,500 doors thus far, which is amazing.

405
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:16,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And just 500, or rather, like 500 of those were just this past Saturday, which is our first full volunteer canvas.

406
00:30:16,988 --> 00:30:19,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've only been door knocking for barely over a week.

407
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to sync that in, 1,500 doors, barely more than a week.

408
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:31,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we are just really, really crushing the doors.

409
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:36,443
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, having more folks, of course, means we can talk to, you know,

410
00:30:37,024 --> 00:30:39,865
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times as many voters.

411
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:44,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So not only everyone here is phone banking, please start canvassing with us.

412
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot of fun.

413
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:46,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really, really successful.

414
00:30:46,907 --> 00:30:49,608
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, bring your friends, right?

415
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:52,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring a buddy policy.

416
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,911
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're going to be attending one of our phone banks, see if you can find someone new to bring to the campaign.

417
00:30:57,151 --> 00:31:00,032
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be so, so helpful and really easy.

418
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:06,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We all have friends who are progressive and care about politics, but are maybe a little bit lazy, maybe haven't really gotten involved yet.

419
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,121
[SPEAKER_06]: This is their shot.

420
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,102
[SPEAKER_06]: This is their chance.

421
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:15,367
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I also wanted to plug something that makes that even easier.

422
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:20,790
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the barnstorm that we have coming up actually a week from today.

423
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:28,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is a really great event where we're not going to be asking anyone for direct voter contact during that event.

424
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:30,636
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of lowers the barrier to entry.

425
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:36,399
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about what canvassing is like, what phone making is like, what the reach is like, and then get people engaged that way.

426
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:44,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can forward that link to any friends you know who are interested in Anna or might be interested in Anna, please do that because we need to continue to grow.

427
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:46,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we will, but we need your help to do it.

428
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And my last little make and go drop is our beautiful volunteer page on the website.

429
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Jacqueline for making it beautiful.

430
00:31:55,255 --> 00:32:02,981
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where we have all of our direct contact events and meet and greet events for you to share around in RSVP.

431
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:06,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's all I have.

432
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm gonna kick it back to Caitlin.

433
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:09,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

434
00:32:10,374 --> 00:32:12,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That about concludes all of our main updates of the campaign.

435
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:15,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully your brains aren't exploding.

436
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I know mine is, but that's nothing new.

437
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:19,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just all the times there's so many things happening.

438
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will be sharing more and more.

439
00:32:23,062 --> 00:32:32,808
[SPEAKER_07]: The other just kind of thing to start looking out for as we have more and more voters in the district who are willing to really talk about why they support Anna and love her so much, we're going to be posting it.

440
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,850
[SPEAKER_07]: quotes on the website, on social media, getting it out there via email.

441
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:39,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can be on the lookout for that for sharing.

442
00:32:39,672 --> 00:32:47,517
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hopefully be seeing more things from both Greg and Bob, for example, and Amanda and others as well in the district.

443
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:59,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And so please do help us share those, get the word out as much as possible, because obviously Anna is incredibly inspiring, but also hearing the reasons why other people who are voting for her.

444
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:02,525
[SPEAKER_07]: are inspired is also inspiring in its own sense.

445
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you so, so much.

446
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:06,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to stick to my promise.

447
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:10,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry we're a few minutes over there, but if anyone does need to head off for the night, please feel free.

448
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:18,268
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, you can type stack into the Zoom chat if you are interested in asking a question.

449
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:24,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume of Anna, but if you'd like to ask a question of anyone else here in the kitchen cabinet, you're welcome to.

450
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,131
[SPEAKER_07]: But any questions at all, please type chat into the chat.

451
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:32,734
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're gonna start, it looks like, with Bob Massey.

452
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:36,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob, are you muted?

453
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?

454
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:40,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

455
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:41,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

456
00:33:42,448 --> 00:33:46,930
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be careful because I know a lot of you have good experience and you know what you're doing.

457
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:50,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So please excuse if I'm saying something you already know.

458
00:33:52,033 --> 00:34:03,098
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about door-to-door canvassing, first of all, it can be very fun, but there's some things that make it more fun, which is do it in pairs.

459
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring a kit.

460
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:10,382
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, people open their doors to kids very easily.

461
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:18,287
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can usually, if it's not too hot, I mean I have three kids and they've all been invited to do this.

462
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:19,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they refuse.

463
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:24,991
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, they have their own things that they can sometimes talk about and they're very persuasive.

464
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:28,733
[SPEAKER_00]: A small dog is also a very nice thing.

465
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:31,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Big dog, not always, but a small dog.

466
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:33,216
[SPEAKER_00]: wear your stuff.

467
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:37,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it is when people look out the door, who the hell is this?

468
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:41,322
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to like you in that split second and they have to know what you're doing.

469
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:50,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a T-shirt, have a hat, this isn't somebody coming to make them pay a bill or serve them with cord papers or anything like that.

470
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,449
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you can do.

471
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:57,273
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is smile and smile when you're on the phone too because it affects your voice.

472
00:34:57,293 --> 00:34:58,193
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably all know that.

473
00:34:58,594 --> 00:34:59,974
[SPEAKER_00]: And then find a way to share

474
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:01,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny stories.

475
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:12,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not funny stories that mock people, but just like, wow, she offered me an ice cream sundae, or they had the most beautiful rose garden I've ever seen.

476
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:21,248
[SPEAKER_00]: People in Somerville, I don't know Medford as well, but people in Somerville tend to be very proud of whatever they're growing outside, so talk to them about that.

477
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:23,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, COVID.

478
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,049
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?

479
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:24,810
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?

480
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,051
[SPEAKER_00]: How are your family members?

481
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:34,516
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that creates a real bond, and you can't ask that without, you know, genuinely connecting with folks.

482
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:35,477
[SPEAKER_00]: And then,

483
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,372
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, be proud of what you're doing.

484
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Share with other people, invite other people.

485
00:35:42,595 --> 00:35:47,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I find calling still sometimes hard because I have to get in the mood.

486
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:55,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Invite your friends to meet you somewhere 10 feet apart and give them a sandwich and then sit in a park and make calls together.

487
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:59,468
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, I think it was great that Travis mentioned fun three times.

488
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:00,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it should be fun.

489
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,451
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was you, right, Travis?

490
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:04,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Four times?

491
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be fun.

492
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:08,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing is important.

493
00:36:08,515 --> 00:36:14,680
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it sounds like you're well on the way to establishing that culture.

494
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:23,567
[SPEAKER_00]: But any other tricks that you can do that make it more fun or make you into a band of brothers and sisters, that can really work.

495
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:24,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll stop there.

496
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:26,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo-hoo!

497
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:27,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

498
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:34,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I'm remembering, on the Bernie 2016 campaign when I was in California, our best canvasser was a nine-year-old.

499
00:36:34,654 --> 00:36:36,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I completely forgot about that.

500
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:37,796
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just the best.

501
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:40,619
[SPEAKER_07]: He just, like you said, everyone opened the door for him.

502
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was so passionate.

503
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:48,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I campaigned with my oldest son up in New Hampshire for, I don't remember, Al Gore or somebody.

504
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:52,528
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got so tired that I forgot who I was.

505
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:53,989
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his name is Sam.

506
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:54,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So the door opened.

507
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:56,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the end of a long day.

508
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:59,810
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hi, I'm Sam, and this is Bob.

509
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my son said, no, I'm Sam, and you're Bob.

510
00:37:03,272 --> 00:37:08,395
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a miracle we got any response from this woman, because clearly I was crazy.

511
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:10,236
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sam rescued it.

512
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:12,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you know, the kids can bail you out.

513
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:15,378
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.

514
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:19,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I also just will say with how much I loving all this.

515
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,882
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like you really want to canvas with us one Saturday.

516
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:33,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on crutches and it's just really demanding So I'd love to, in theory, and maybe we can figure out So Bob.

517
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:42,609
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bob, I've got You know, I've got my, I've got my electric art car which Anna has seen

518
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:50,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we could cruise around in the electric art car with Anna and do a little canvassing together.

519
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,000
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing.

520
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:58,942
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could knock on the door and then laugh at me out in the- We'll get a little speaker and I'll scat sing.

521
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:02,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, we'll think of some fun things to do.

522
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:09,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having some knee surgery next week, so I'm gonna be, you know, electronic for a while, but no, we'll figure it out.

523
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:15,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great that you have a canvassing program, and that's, you know, just, that's the secret to winning.

524
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:18,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of them, but that's a key, key thing.

525
00:38:20,051 --> 00:38:24,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Having a great candidate too, that definitely helps.

526
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:25,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking that for granted.

527
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:28,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

528
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

529
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:39,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And I should have said that if anyone has any other ideas, too, of things that we can be doing in the next seven weeks, beyond just questions for Anna or for the group.

530
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:42,270
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, anyone else jump in.

531
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,741
[SPEAKER_00]: The more video you can do, the better.

532
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:50,782
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing.

533
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:56,326
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Anna, short videos, here I am standing in front of, you know, I'm at the farmer's market and whatever.

534
00:38:56,727 --> 00:39:00,429
[SPEAKER_00]: People really like just to see little pieces and that's true for anybody.

535
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:08,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as long as you exercise some discretion about what you say and where you are, but.

536
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:09,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense.

537
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:10,997
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what post is for.

538
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:11,878
[SPEAKER_07]: We're recording this.

539
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:13,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Nick, go ahead.

540
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:17,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're recording this right now intentionally because we want to be able to use

541
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:18,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I withdraw everything else.

542
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:27,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Just please say something so we have you right where we want you.

543
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:44,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Possibly a future event could be a voter registration rally where we get folks.

544
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:50,617
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Ed Markey is doing something similar, I think, tomorrow night.

545
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:58,023
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm curious to see what he does and if we might get our usual crew together of our favorite progressive candidates in town.

546
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:01,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe some

547
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,831
[SPEAKER_16]: either more local or maybe even congressional campaigns.

548
00:40:07,332 --> 00:40:19,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Get our usual folks and explain to them why it's so important to, you know, they mail you the one form, then you have to fill it out, and then you have to send it back, and then they mail you another form, that's the ballot, and you have to send that back, and it's a lot of work.

549
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:25,299
[SPEAKER_16]: They've really made it, you know, you might even say they've made it difficult on purpose.

550
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I might say that.

551
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:31,666
[SPEAKER_07]: This state?

552
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:32,227
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

553
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:33,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would that be a thing?

554
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:34,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Nope.

555
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:43,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard that Galvin was going to not send out the applications unless the legislature passed some money for it or something.

556
00:40:45,102 --> 00:40:47,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's like a court case right now.

557
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:48,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Sweet.

558
00:40:50,342 --> 00:41:05,187
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely, we, part of, and this is one, and I actually should have mentioned this earlier, part of with the effort of, because with the mail-in ballot and it being so complex, and to be fair, any state that is going into such massive mail-in balloting for the first time, there's going to be bumps.

559
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:11,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe some are excusable, maybe some not, but the point is that this, August is really gonna be get-out-the-vote month.

560
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,490
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no such thing as get-out-the-vote weekend or week.

561
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming from, just personally from California, we have a 70% vote by mail.

562
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:21,934
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we're used to of just the entire month as soon as they're mailed out.

563
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:28,679
[SPEAKER_07]: And so part of our goal with the end of this month, we'll be getting accurate information out as much as possible so people really know what they need to do.

564
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:31,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And then starting August, it's going to be great.

565
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:31,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you voted yet?

566
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:32,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you voted yet?

567
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:32,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

568
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:33,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do that right now.

569
00:41:33,503 --> 00:41:35,704
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way it gets processed and quicker.

570
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:44,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'll definitely be a huge push as well, since there's gonna be a lot of unknowns, a lot of unknown factors with everything going on this cycle.

571
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:46,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will see.

572
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,751
[SPEAKER_04]: just add into that.

573
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:51,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Anna, have you registered to vote by mail yet?

574
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:58,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't I have to get my... Yeah, but I know what I meant before.

575
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:05,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you were already registered, because if you haven't, like when you do, we should definitely make that a social media thing.

576
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

577
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:10,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just like do it mindlessly, like we need to save that moment.

578
00:42:10,382 --> 00:42:13,504
[SPEAKER_11]: and a step-by-step video that we can use as an instruction.

579
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:14,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what a great idea.

580
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:19,167
[SPEAKER_04]: You can blur out your information, whatever, keep you safe.

581
00:42:19,527 --> 00:42:23,529
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely, we should definitely use that.

582
00:42:23,689 --> 00:42:27,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I don't know, just going off of what Joel, how does that look with Edmar?

583
00:42:28,352 --> 00:42:29,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing a step-by-step?

584
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:33,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know, I'm happy to go and talk to the city clerk,

585
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:43,438
[SPEAKER_04]: and like become an expert and like how to help people register if that would be useful and like maybe we can plan an event where we like step-by-step like we'll like work it out together.

586
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:44,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

587
00:42:44,818 --> 00:42:46,899
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like maybe like a huge organizing project.

588
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:54,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta talk to Aaron, but I'm thinking like we could do something like that to make it be like no like we are not just here to like get your votes.

589
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:59,403
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here to actually like help the community be engaged in the political process, which is one of Anna's big

590
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:00,818
[SPEAKER_04]: key talking point.

591
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:05,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we should actually do that and like, I don't know, maybe we can figure out how.

592
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:10,963
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have a question.

593
00:43:11,163 --> 00:43:18,067
[SPEAKER_14]: I am working for, I was interning for a state senator and so I had to read the bill and then make a step-by-step guide on how to vote by mail.

594
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:20,764
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want that, I can send that your way.

595
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:21,485
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.

596
00:43:21,586 --> 00:43:22,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, please.

597
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:25,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

598
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:28,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, I know.

599
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:30,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sing the step-by-step guide.

600
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:33,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my little video weirdness.

601
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:40,956
[SPEAKER_11]: And early voting for the primary starts, takes place over eight days, starts the 22nd.

602
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:43,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Just FYI.

603
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:45,379
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the in-person?

604
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,201
[SPEAKER_11]: It's early in-person voting.

605
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:49,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

606
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:50,803
[SPEAKER_11]: 22nd to the 28th.

607
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:55,146
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they're not doing election day voting, right?

608
00:43:55,186 --> 00:43:58,068
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just doing the early to keep it spread out.

609
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:03,406
[SPEAKER_16]: That was, that was my, that was my understanding was they didn't, I'm not sure.

610
00:44:04,586 --> 00:44:16,654
[SPEAKER_16]: There's also some, we have, we have more than one Matt on the campaign so apologies, I guess, as chances are none are on, but one pointed out to us that

611
00:44:18,977 --> 00:44:26,940
[SPEAKER_16]: the law was that some of this, it was required that it be sent out by a certain date, but the funding had not in fact been secured.

612
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,861
[SPEAKER_16]: So the law says it has to be sent out.

613
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:46,787
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had to be very careful, not that you'll receive it, but that it is required to have been sent out, which feels like precisely the kind of meaningless political machinery that we're trying to obviate, send to the moon.

614
00:44:49,372 --> 00:44:50,353
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a good place for it.

615
00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:55,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to say, Spencer, I just, I dropped my email in the chat.

616
00:44:56,317 --> 00:44:56,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Me too.

617
00:44:56,938 --> 00:44:58,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely want that.

618
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:00,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, Joel, we want that info.

619
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Give us the ballot.

620
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:07,585
[SPEAKER_16]: I put a link to the Google Docs.

621
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Hell yeah.

622
00:45:08,746 --> 00:45:09,126
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, yeah.

623
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

624
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Good strategy planning, everyone.

625
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

626
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:17,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other last questions?

627
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:18,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Wrapping up for the night.

628
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:24,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Either for Anna, thoughts for the crew, otherwise.

629
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:27,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

630
00:45:27,574 --> 00:45:31,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say thank you so, so much for not only being here, but all of the dedication.

631
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:40,991
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people here who do way too many hours every single week, and it would not be possible without all the amazing, all of it.

632
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm very happy and excited.

633
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:45,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And check out things in Slack, check out the public channels.

634
00:45:46,032 --> 00:45:51,193
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone here is not in Slack and wants to join, feel free to reach out to me directly and we can get you plugged in.

635
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:54,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I think for the most part, everyone here is, so we should be in good shape.

636
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:56,234
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, have a great, great night, everyone.

637
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And so excited, and phone banking tomorrow at 5.30, if anyone wants to join.

638
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:01,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, everyone.

639
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:02,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to see you.

640
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:07,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

641
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:07,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.
