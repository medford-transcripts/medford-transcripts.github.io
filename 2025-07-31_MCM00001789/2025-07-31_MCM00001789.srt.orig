1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,872
[SPEAKER_02]: evening, everybody.

2
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:05,834
[SPEAKER_02]: The air conditioning is on.

3
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:13,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We are just doing a major renovation of the historic windows, and the shades aren't in yet, so the sun was coming in.

4
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:20,243
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize that it's not extremely cool in here, like it should be, but thank you all for joining us.

5
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:20,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

6
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:28,268
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so happy to celebrate the installation of our newest Poet Laureate, Max Heinegg.

7
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:45,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna thank President Behrs for also being with us tonight, I think, representing the city council.

8
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:45,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here.

9
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:49,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and that.

10
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:59,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thrilled to have such a longstanding member of our local arts scene at the helm of this program for the next two years.

11
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:11,435
[SPEAKER_02]: In combination with his teaching experience, I know Max is the right person to carry on the legacy of this position that Terry Carter and Vijaya Sundaram cemented.

12
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:28,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Today would not be possible without the help and support of the Medford Arts Council, who work in conjunction with my office, Lisa Coliani, my Community Affairs Director, to run this Poet Laureate Program.

13
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:39,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into the program and hear from Max, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the incredible contributions of our outgoing Poet Laureate, Vijaya.

14
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:41,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all you have done.

15
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all you've done over the last two years.

16
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:57,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Your poems have been amazing and such a wonderful addition to our ceremonies and our community.

17
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:04,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And to begin the ceremony, I'm happy to introduce Terry E. Carter, our inaugural poet laureate.

18
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:36,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.

19
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:45,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I really believe in my spirit that poets are lions.

20
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just read the poem.

21
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,415
[SPEAKER_03]: When the lions don't roar.

22
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:07,090
[SPEAKER_03]: When the lions don't roar, how can the cubs learn to wrestle and pounce, to stalk and stealth, and to tell the pride stories?

23
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:12,475
[SPEAKER_03]: When the lions don't roar, what sounds do their mates make?

24
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they moan in grief?

25
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:16,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they squeal at the thief?

26
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they stomp in disbelief?

27
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:26,799
[SPEAKER_03]: When the lions don't roar, will the jackals and hyenas become more brazen and wicked?

28
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the zebra and giraffe strut more boldly?

29
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:36,228
[SPEAKER_03]: When the lions don't roar, will Anansi's tails be the most spicy?

30
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the peacocks and parrots fan their feathers mockingly?

31
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:52,091
[SPEAKER_03]: When the lions don't roar, whose voice resounds in the wind, runs the wildebeest to riot, moves the gazelles to galloping, gives the leopards pause.

32
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:56,172
[SPEAKER_03]: The jungle's an ever more frightful place.

33
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The loss of its leader is fearful to face.

34
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:05,095
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the predators gather to chase when the lions don't roar.

35
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,245
[SPEAKER_03]: The water buffalo huddles its crowd.

36
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:11,227
[SPEAKER_03]: The big-eared dogs bark very loud.

37
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:16,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Baboons assemble unhurried and proud when the lions don't roar.

38
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:22,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Warthogs snort with joyful glee as if they think they're finally free.

39
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:27,380
[SPEAKER_03]: The forest primeval breathes fitfully when the lions don't roar.

40
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Now hunters casually choose their prey.

41
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,527
[SPEAKER_03]: No other foe can rule the day.

42
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:38,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Slings and arrows will have their way when the lions don't roar.

43
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:44,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Man's dominion arrives in force, shaking paradise at its source.

44
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,665
[SPEAKER_03]: The lust for blood will run its course when the lions don't roar.

45
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:56,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretenders rush to snatch the throne as mothers raise their young alone.

46
00:04:56,822 --> 00:05:02,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Treason assaults both blood and bone when the lions don't roar.

47
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:09,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Evil intentions will scatter the pride as fear and contempt now creep inside.

48
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:15,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Chaos and ruin forever abide when the lions don't roar.

49
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,035
[SPEAKER_03]: The stranger scoffs at nature's rule, laying waste to the watering pool.

50
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:33,688
[SPEAKER_03]: The village is lost to the wandering fool when the lions don't roar, when the lions don't roar, when the lions don't roar anymore.

51
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:35,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

52
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Terry.

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,560
[SPEAKER_02]: That was wonderful.

54
00:05:53,921 --> 00:06:00,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, I'd like to welcome Leticia Rocha, the Medford Arts Council member.

55
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:09,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, without the support of the Medford Arts Council and my staff who work closely with the Medford Arts Council, this would not be possible.

56
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:17,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you in the entire committee for all you do to support this and many, many other things art related throughout the community.

57
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:17,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

58
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:36,068
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

59
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:36,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.

60
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:43,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Leticia Privy Rocha, and I'm currently co-chair of the Medford Arts Council.

61
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:49,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I joined the Arts Council a little bit over a year ago, and I became co-chair in May of this year.

62
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:56,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal as an Arts Council is to bring high-quality cultural programming to the Medford community.

63
00:06:57,066 --> 00:07:06,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We primarily do so by both advocating for the arts and funding grants for community members that seek to engage the Medford public through arts and culture.

64
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:11,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really proud to say that one of those programs that we fund is the Poet Laureate stipend.

65
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:16,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give a shameless plug, if you're interested in our work, please come chat with me.

66
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:21,997
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always looking for more volunteers and applications for our next grant cycle actually open in September.

67
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:26,772
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right around the corner and I'm happy to chat about any ideas that folks might have.

68
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:35,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I've given the shameless plug for the Medford Arts Council, I'd love to talk about our incredible poets that we're celebrating today.

69
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:44,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from being co-chair of the Medford Arts Council, I'm also a poet, so naturally I have to enthusiastically praise the art of poetry.

70
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:51,815
[SPEAKER_01]: The late Minnie Bruce Pratt once said that poetry helps us stay alive.

71
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:55,898
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps us remember why we're trying to make a better world.

72
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:02,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two poets that we're celebrating today perfectly encapsulate this quote.

73
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:08,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Their work shows us the joy, the inspiration, and the connection that poetry sparks.

74
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:24,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Our outgoing Poet Laureate Vijaya Sundaram infuses every image in her poems with beauty and tenderness, echoing a sincere curiosity, awe, and love for the world in all of its complexities.

75
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:34,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to spend time with Vijaya through the wonderful program that she started at the Arts Collaborative Medford, a monthly poetry and song open mic.

76
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:48,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Vijaya is such a warm and inviting presence who always nurtured a space where performers and audience members could feel not only comfortable, but empowered to receive the art of poetry.

77
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,292
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a program that I deeply cherish, and that has made me feel more tightly woven into the community of Medford.

78
00:08:56,772 --> 00:09:01,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Vijaya, we're really grateful for all that you've done as Poet Laureate over the last two years.

79
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:10,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Your service and all of the care that you've put into the role has had a lasting impact on our community, and we wish you all the best in your next chapter.

80
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:15,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'd like to say a few words about our new Poet Laureate, Max Heinig.

81
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:27,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the pleasure of hearing Max perform a couple of times and including at the Medford Brewing Company, which is a place that he has poured so much into that truly brings our community together.

82
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:35,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of his work paints the everyday rituals of living that we engage in as people with great precision and reverence.

83
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:43,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you read his poems, you're taken on a journey of immense emotional depth and lyricism that echoes his musical talents.

84
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:50,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I particularly enjoy the poems that reflect back Max's many years of service as a Medford Public School teacher.

85
00:09:50,871 --> 00:10:00,920
[SPEAKER_01]: In these poems, he bears witness to the classroom with both honesty and grace, radiating his devotion as an educator and earnest compassion for his students.

86
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:10,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Max, we're thrilled to welcome you as the third Poet Laureate of Medford, and we can't wait to experience all the poetry that you'll bring to our beloved city.

87
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.

88
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

89
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:34,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'd like to invite the outgoing Poet Laureate, Ms.

90
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:40,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Vijaya Sundaram, to do a poem named All Our Yesterdays.

91
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:40,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

92
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:41,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

93
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:05,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me well?

94
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,440
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

95
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid to tell me if I'm too soft.

96
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:18,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am embarrassed to say that I bring my computer up to these things.

97
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I should have it on a piece of paper, but my handwriting is absolutely terrible.

98
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So I prefer to type.

99
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never learned the art of handwriting.

100
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:29,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned the art of writing.

101
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:30,813
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a different thing.

102
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:31,934
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

103
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:39,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will start with the poem that I wrote and maybe say a few words about Max, if that is okay.

104
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:44,137
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a poem I wrote a while ago called All Our Yesterdays.

105
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:58,856
[SPEAKER_04]: All my yesterdays behind me galloped down the sloping road as I stood at the edge of the receding year, shielding my eyes from today and the rest of my life.

106
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:18,164
[SPEAKER_04]: The coming days fetches all, move through my cells and leave behind their husks, drifting away wraith-like even as I meet them, and keep meeting them, and will keep on meeting them as they move, will move, and have moved through me.

107
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:37,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And time has no meaning, no meaning at all, and still I check the clock, and still I mark my calendar, and still look forward to every new day, even as it passes through me into the rising dust of all the days galloping by.

108
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:44,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It is this movement I greet as I stand in the revolving spot of the eternal now.

109
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:49,468
[SPEAKER_04]: even as I age and wither and dissolve into gold dust.

110
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:52,050
[SPEAKER_04]: What this means does not matter.

111
00:12:52,791 --> 00:13:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: The revolving spot turns, and I turn and face everywhere, every when, at once, at the same time, running into my own face, even as I turn and turn to watch the days gallop past, fast.

112
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:11,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are my face, and you as well.

113
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am yours, and yours.

114
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:15,894
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.

115
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:19,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold hands here in the revolving now.

116
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:22,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the days pass through us all.

117
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:33,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we are at it, at our eternal solstice, let us make flowers bloom, sing our songs, and cleanse the air and feed the young.

118
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,564
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not know yet, but they will soon.

119
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And we must prepare them.

120
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:40,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

121
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Max, I too am a teacher.

122
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:57,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I taught for 17 years in the Winchester Public Schools, eighth grade English, and I loved being that.

123
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was done.

124
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:03,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm an associate professor at Bunker Hill Community College, and I love doing that.

125
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:09,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Because teaching is what connects us to our students and to the generations.

126
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:12,218
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do it well and with love,

127
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:17,076
[SPEAKER_04]: you are giving a gift beyond what you know and what they know.

128
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:23,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had messages from students from 17 years ago who tell me they still remember the books I talked about.

129
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that Max is that person for his students too.

130
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:37,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really one of the greatest gifts we can give our students, the gift of ourselves, the gift of language, the gift of art, of poetry, of science, of math.

131
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:42,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a scientist or a mathematician, but that is a great gift as well.

132
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And when someone does that well,

133
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,009
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no words to encapsulate that.

134
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, I didn't write this down.

135
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm extemporizing.

136
00:14:52,051 --> 00:15:01,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to say that Max being a teacher and a musician and a poet connects me to him in ways that are surprising and not surprising.

137
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally get Max.

138
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love that he's all of these things that I have been and still am.

139
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:11,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And Max, I'm so happy you're going to be our next Poet Laureate.

140
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to quote a couple of things.

141
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,062
[SPEAKER_04]: And here I'm going to look at my notes.

142
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:21,504
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from John Keats in his Ode on a Grecian Urn.

143
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:38,428
[SPEAKER_04]: When old age shall this generation waste, thou shalt remain in the midst of other woe than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou sayest, beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all ye know on earth.

144
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,188
[SPEAKER_04]: and all you need to know.

145
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And we poets, we aim to get that to you.

146
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:47,414
[SPEAKER_04]: We aim to bring the truth, the beauty of life and living to you.

147
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Beauty does not always mean pretty.

148
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't mix it up with pretty.

149
00:15:52,538 --> 00:16:04,628
[SPEAKER_04]: There are terrible things going on in the world, but if we see them and we speak of them and we awaken people's minds to them, we are creating a kind of beauty, the beauty of humanity.

150
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:06,350
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's remember that.

151
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

152
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:22,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We poets owe an allegiance to the truth and to beauty and to speak the words that come from somewhere beyond us, through us, to you.

153
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:31,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Any poet who is young enough thinks that their poetry comes only from them, but believe me, it comes from somewhere else.

154
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:39,182
[SPEAKER_04]: we tap into this thing that encircles the globe, we tap into it at different points in that stream.

155
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:43,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're lucky enough to be able to distill some of that and share them with you.

156
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:47,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no ego involved in poetry, in music, in the arts.

157
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,872
[SPEAKER_04]: There should not be any ego involved in it.

158
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is, then perhaps you have to look within and see where is it coming from?

159
00:16:55,977 --> 00:17:04,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all poetry is about sharing, caring, loving, speaking the voice of yourself and speaking for all.

160
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:16,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And those who think poetry is negligible, that, oh, it's just a bunch of, you know, la-di-da snobbish people speaking la-di-da words that I don't get, please think again, because poetry is not meant to be that.

161
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,915
[SPEAKER_04]: It's meant to be for you, for us.

162
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:21,137
[SPEAKER_04]: There's music in it.

163
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:23,859
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the music of music, and then there's the music of words.

164
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And we try to do both.

165
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,441
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a tribe apart.

166
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:35,485
[SPEAKER_04]: We belong to that tribe, Terry, and Leticia, and Max, and I, and anyone else here who writes poetry.

167
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:36,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We belong to a tribe.

168
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:41,408
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no tribe of humanity divided in any way other than

169
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we should not be divided in any way.

170
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We all should belong to this tribe.

171
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So I welcome you to the tribe of poetry.

172
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:52,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And Max, thank you so much for doing that for us.

173
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:58,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Your honesty as a teacher and as the passion that you bring is going to serve us well through your poetry.

174
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

175
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:26,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, thank you everyone for joining us today for this amazing celebration of art, culture, and poetry in Medford.

176
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:33,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I begin, I want to thank Leticia and the other members of the Arts Council for your partnership and guidance.

177
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:38,183
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a joint collaboration, and we're lucky to have such incredible partners.

178
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:50,287
[SPEAKER_02]: We started the Poet Laureate Program because fostering a love and appreciation for art from all perspectives makes for a more inclusive and welcoming community.

179
00:18:51,528 --> 00:19:04,017
[SPEAKER_02]: When we gathered to officially install Terry four years ago and Vijaya two years ago, I never could have imagined just how impactful, meaningful, and thought-provoking this position would become.

180
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:10,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Like last time, we know that finding a successor for Vijaya would be daunting.

181
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:19,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Her deep ties to the community and desire to make poetry and literature accessible to all have been amazing to watch over her tenure.

182
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:31,890
[SPEAKER_02]: When we saw Max's application and work, however, we knew we had the right person to continue this legacy and build upon the foundation created by Vijaya and Tariq.

183
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Max is a local poet, musician, and teacher that has taught in the Medford Public School System since 1998.

184
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:55,434
[SPEAKER_02]: He has published almost 300 poems, recorded 10 albums of original music and lyrics, and is the author of three poetry collections, Good Harbor, Going There, and Keepers of the House.

185
00:19:56,735 --> 00:20:01,716
[SPEAKER_02]: If those accomplishments don't prove his dedication to his craft, I don't know what would.

186
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:09,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in awe of Max's passion for the arts, his experiences in our schools, and most of all, his commitment to our city.

187
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:21,965
[SPEAKER_02]: In his new role as our official City Poet, I know Max has the knowledge, skills, and passion to help share the beauty of the arts with the entire community.

188
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:29,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, join me in officially welcoming our newest Poet Laureate, Max Heinig.

189
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:54,723
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

190
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:56,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.

191
00:20:56,804 --> 00:21:05,127
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do the somewhat contemporary thing of reading off the phone, something my students would do.

192
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,708
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to say thank you for coming.

193
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:12,149
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see, obviously, family, friends, and a couple of former students.

194
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:22,713
[SPEAKER_00]: When thinking about what I was going to read tonight, I didn't want to do one of my sort of traditional poems I was talking about with my wife.

195
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:25,272
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, why don't you write something for tonight?

196
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:31,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, why not write something that explains quite literally how I got here?

197
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:41,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you don't know me, or you don't know my work, or you don't know my connection to Medford, this should sort of take care of that.

198
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:45,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And should you want to read along, it's on the back.

199
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:48,499
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

200
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:55,243
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called Thank You or How I Got to Stand Here Today.

201
00:21:56,924 --> 00:22:01,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the call when I was 25, renting in the Fenway with Wendy.

202
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,229
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have bought that apartment, by the way.

203
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Shirley Count's principal of the Brooks Hobbs asked if I knew anything about Greek mythology.

204
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:15,437
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I did, I could teach English to sixth graders.

205
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:20,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I told her I'd lived in Greece and loved the myths since I was a child.

206
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:22,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough.

207
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Dr. Moriarty, who asked me if I knew The Sick Rose by William Blake, so I recited it.

208
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:37,283
[SPEAKER_00]: I shook Roy Bellson's hand, and he was the superintendent, and he told me to challenge them.

209
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:42,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined a team led by the venerable Pauline Walker, rest in peace.

210
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:54,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And we taught the oldest tales, from Hercules to Hestia to Hermes, and the maps, Athens, Sparta, and the Aegean, tales that bind themselves to places.

211
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:08,973
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, I made music in Boston, waking up for the tea to Sullivan Square, the 95 bus, an eggplant parm for lunch at Amici's, and Dom and Mario, who, side note, I just learned they're not brothers.

212
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:13,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still kind of like in disbelief over this.

213
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,900
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like something Medfordians have to debate.

214
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked the tunnel between the two buildings, because the Brookshobs used to be united by that, until they raised it.

215
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:29,644
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, the Andrews, working with Ralph Watson, playing concerts with my rock band in the gym.

216
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:33,885
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, 489 Winthrop Street for a generation.

217
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,067
[SPEAKER_00]: From the reign of Dr. Kruger to

218
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:41,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul D'Aleba, John Perella, and Ms.

219
00:23:41,914 --> 00:23:42,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabral.

220
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:46,658
[SPEAKER_00]: The Constance, my colleagues in humor and in health.

221
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:54,365
[SPEAKER_00]: From the field of dreams to COVID, we walked the walk with a fresh 125 students each fall, and now I've taught over 3,000.

222
00:23:54,405 --> 00:24:03,933
[SPEAKER_00]: From Park Drive and the Fens, to Professor's Row by Tufts, to our first house on Arden, 20 years this January.

223
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:09,417
[SPEAKER_00]: to our daughters, Ava and Stella, who went through our schools to college and are here in this room today.

224
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:19,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Our family walked the fells, hiked the fells, cross-country skied the fells, and skated the vernal pools, also in the fells.

225
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:22,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Wendy even wrote the fells' fairies.

226
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:30,065
[SPEAKER_00]: They swam at Wright's Pond, competed on the field of dreams, and learned to drive in Oak Grove Cemetery, which I was told maybe I shouldn't mention.

227
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:33,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of you might be guilty of that, too.

228
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:35,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year took to the good work.

229
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:41,670
[SPEAKER_00]: To Chaucer, Homer, to Dante, the Bard, and back again.

230
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year adding to the song until it resembled our world as it was being reborn.

231
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:52,198
[SPEAKER_00]: The languages and the halls reflecting our world as it changed.

232
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,461
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, Wendy and I contended with parenthood

233
00:24:56,172 --> 00:25:06,401
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned the work of adults, meals, and naps, and doctors, managing the backstage chaos teachers keep so well hidden behind a public grin.

234
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:11,385
[SPEAKER_00]: In stolen moments, we wrote, mused, edited, published.

235
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:18,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And I developed a little bit of a brewing, how shall we say, habit.

236
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:18,792
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years of that, too.

237
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:21,114
[SPEAKER_00]: All the while, Medford.

238
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:24,518
[SPEAKER_00]: was the canvas, the axis, the harmony.

239
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:31,224
[SPEAKER_00]: For half a century, the poems have been singing to me, and I have basked in the myths and the music.

240
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:40,593
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the constellations I stand beneath, lucky to trace the astral tales and to share them with anyone willing to listen.

241
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:42,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

242
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:14,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That concludes our short, but so very sweet ceremony this evening.

243
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so lucky to be graced with not just our three poet laureates, but Leticia as well, who's also a poet.

244
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:21,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Please stay.

245
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,527
[SPEAKER_02]: We have refreshments in the foyer.

246
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:24,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your photos.

247
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:28,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are so excited to begin this next term of our next poet laureate.

248
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations again, Max.
