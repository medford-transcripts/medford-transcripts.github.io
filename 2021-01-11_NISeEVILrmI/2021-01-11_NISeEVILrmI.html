For our incoming freshmen, testing can be accessed through the West Courtyard entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1124.283s">For</a>  our freshmen, their first time coming to the Medford High School Complex, there will be a freshman orientation this Wednesday, January 13th for ninth grade, and a detailed schedule was sent out to all students from Mr. Principal Paul DeLeva, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1146.73s">And</a>  although the focus will be on cohort B and C students, we welcome cohorts A and D students to participate in the freshman orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1162.173s">Principal</a>  DeLava and Principal Fallon will welcome all the students, discuss COVID safety protocols, student schedules, and conduct socially distanced tours throughout the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1179.35s">On</a>  a different note, I wanna remind our parents and guardians that students who qualify for free and reduced lunch under the National School Lunch Program, whether you are hybrid or fully remote, please know that the P-EBT funds are available to you until the end of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1202.523s">For</a>  those who might have questions about this assistance, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1206.478s">please</a>  contact the Department of Transitional Assistance at 877-382-2363. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1210.741s">That's</a>  877-382-2363. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1211.601s">Last</a>  week, on Thursday, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Principal DeLeva, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1236.522s">Dr.</a>  Riccadeli and I had the pleasure of welcoming Mr. Adamo Castellanuevo, Director of the Consul General of Italy's Education Office to the Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1251.929s">Mr.</a>  Castelnuovo presented the mayor with a check in the amount of $24,000 US euros. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1260.432s">It</a>  was 29,477 euros. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1264.714s">Last</a>  June, Dr. Riccadeli, who oversees the World Language Department, worked with lead teacher Vilma Bobo, who was fluent in Italian, to submit a grant application for direct funding from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1283.01s">connected</a>  to the Consulate General of Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1287.512s">Medford</a>  was selected to receive the highest funding amount of any school district in the entire country, based upon our strong support of our district-wide Italian language program. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1300.422s">We</a>  are so appreciative and extend our sincere thanks to Federica Serrini, the Consul General of Italy, Director Castelnuovo, and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their generous support of Medford's language program. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1319.314s">As</a>  Dr. Riccardelli reported to you at the last meeting, the funds will be used to defray the cost of the advanced placement Italian program at the high school level for school year 2020-2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1336.223s">In</a>  addition, last month, Tufts University Office of Community Relations hosted a holiday charity raffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1348.494s">Residents</a>  were asked via Facebook, the Tufts Facebook page, to nominate a nonprofit organization to win a $500 prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1360.038s">The</a>  nonprofit that had the most nominations in Medford was the Medford Family Network. <a

provide important services to our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1379.474s">And</a>  thank you to Tufts University for providing this wonderful donation to Medford Family Network.

was wonderful to have been asked to participate in this important and substantial conversation with the young assistant district attorneys of Middlesex County. <a

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1616.173s">Number</a>  two, we have a COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update given by nurse supervisor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1626.437s">Toni</a>  Rae and Medford Board of Health director, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1630.238s">Marianne</a>  O'Connor, as well as Mr. David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1634.279s">Hi,</a>  this is Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1638.861s">I</a>  think I'll let Toni go first on the school update and then we'll go into the community update if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1644.973s">Sounds</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1645.973s">Sounds</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1647.094s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor, Superintendent and members of school committee in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1651.975s">I'm</a>  going to give a summation of the COVID activity in our schools between December 22nd and January 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1660.418s">Medford</a>  Public Schools tested 900 students and staff on Tuesday, December 22nd, and we reported two positive student cases from that testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1670.902s">On</a>  that date, there were no staff that tested positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1675.033s">Between</a>  December 23rd, the start of the holiday vacation, and January 10th, we've reported 79 positive COVID cases to the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1687.662s">This</a>  is very consistent with the activity that is going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1693.006s">All</a>  the cases received follow-up instructions about isolation procedures and quarantine procedures for their close contacts from our school nurse contact tracers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1703.65s">The</a>  79 cases included 16 staff members and 63 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1711.415s">I</a>  have two reminders that I would like to make about the COVID testing that starts again this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1718.736s">Please</a>  do not send your child or if you are a staff person, do not come for testing if you are showing any illness symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1728.28s">Ill</a>  children and staff and families are advised to call their primary care physicians or go to a stop the spread testing site if you're feeling ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1739.66s">Also,</a>  as we resume hybrid learning, I want to remind our community to stay home from school if you feel ill with any symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1749.483s">This</a>  applies to staff and students, and our ability to reduce COVID transmission within the schools is very dependent upon keeping the illness out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1760.647s">So</a>  we would like everybody to do their part in achieving this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1764.528s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1768.97s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1769.49s">Ray.</a> </p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1772.611s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1773.011s">O'Connor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1773.772s">Yeah,</a>  it's Marian O'Connor.</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1775.352s">That's</a>  okay, I can go with the community update right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1779.353s">So</a>  to follow up with what Tony has said, so as the superintendent had already stated earlier, we are definitely in a surge. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1791.538s">You</a>  know, regardless of the public health warnings and headings of not gathering for the holidays and not traveling <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1800.17s">Unfortunately,</a>  we are in a search. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1803.332s">So</a>  since 1223, which I believe was the break from school to today at 530, we've had 720 cases in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1808.575s">So</a>  that's 720 cases in 20 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1811.196s">However,</a>  I did break them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1824.268s">And</a>  looking at the school age population, like Tony said, out of those 720, I went from zero to 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1832.511s">All</a>  right, and then I can break that down more for you, but from zero to 19 out of the 720, there's 97 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1841.874s">If</a>  you wanna look at just the five-year-olds, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1846.449s">So</a>  the 19-year-olds, that's four, two, three, four, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1853.755s">That's</a>  77 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1856.758s">So</a>  as Tony said, school-aged folks, I did include 19-year-olds. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1863.704s">There</a>  were 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1865.365s">If</a>  you take out the 19-year-olds, there were four of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1868.148s">So</a>  there's only 31 in the 15 to 18-year-old category. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1871.63s">So</a>  anyways, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1874.445s">So</a>  it's a small percentage is my point, I guess, what I'm trying to get at out of the 720. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1880.528s">Really</a>  the majority of our cases were the 20 and 30 year olds, again, as we had been seeing previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1887.111s">I</a>  do wanna thank the school nurses for all their help over the break, especially for the contact tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1894.575s">They've</a>  been incredible as far as following up with all the students and children and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1900.678s">Obviously</a>  not all of those, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1903.591s">school-aged</a>  kids were Medford school children. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1907.753s">There</a>  are certainly some private schools involved as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1913.316s">But</a>  as you know, and you probably have seen last week's report from the state put us in the red. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1919.679s">And</a>  we knew that was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1922.16s">We're</a>  at a 5.56% positivity rate now according to the state data. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1929.463s">And</a>  we're expecting that'll probably <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1931.837s">be</a>  close to the same this week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1936.699s">And</a>  there were 520 cases reported during that time period. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1941.122s">So</a>  we're in a search. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1945.284s">Unfortunately,</a>  we expected this with the holidays, which is why we delayed the opening a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1950.726s">And</a>  I'm glad that we're testing this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1954.308s">It's</a>  gonna be interesting to see what and how many we catch. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1958.51s">Most</a>  of this that we've seen in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1961.688s">has</a>  been household spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1964.53s">It's</a>  mostly, you know, you'll see it two, three, four, five, even six people within a household are getting, are becoming positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1975.857s">And</a>  that's what a lot of these cases are. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1977.538s">It's</a>  really a lot of household spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1980.34s">Once</a>  it's in the house, like we've seen before, it seems to spread pretty rapidly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1985.25s">Other</a>  than that, I'm happy to announce that we are doing our first responder testing this Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=1992.195s">We</a>  are in a regional effort with Malden, Melrose, Wakefield, Stoneham, and Winchester to vaccinate our first responders, police, fire, and EMS. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2004.082s">The</a>  first one kicking off right here at the Medford Police Station, Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2010.746s">And</a>  also happy to say that all of our school nurses are included <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2015.745s">in</a>  that program because they are COVID facing, because they are doing the surveillance testing, because they're involved in the surveillance testing and anyone involved with that as far as, you know, the helpers or management people there that anyone COVID facing is allowed to be vaccinated, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2035.576s">So</a>  all of our school nurses will be receiving their first vaccination if they haven't already due to other, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2043.185s">duties</a>  will be receiving it Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2046.227s">So</a>  that's terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2048.588s">K</a>  through 12 workers, teachers, are slated by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2053.911s">And</a>  again, we are at the mercy of the state as far as when we get vaccine and when we're able to vaccinate. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2060.274s">But</a>  they are in the state's plan for phase two of K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2065.737s">They</a>  are actually second in line in phase two, right behind the 75 plus and folks with two comorbidities. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2073.231s">So</a>  we will be working to get that done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2075.392s">And</a>  I'm sure I'll be working with Tony and the school nurses to accomplish that, much like we've done the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2081.016s">So</a>  more to come on that as soon as we know, you'll know, but we are at the mercy of the state as far as information goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2092.363s">And</a>  that's expected around early February. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2094.344s">So</a>  again, so happy to take any questions, thoughts, concerns.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2101.13s">Mayor,</a>  before we go to questions, could we just touch upon our testing program and how we're gonna be rolling that out over the next couple of weeks?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2108.535s">That'd</a>  be great if you could give the dates and in case any parents are watching, that'd be much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2113.558s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2114.719s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2115.139s">So</a>  as the school committee knows, and I know many in the community are familiar, we have been running staff testing throughout the district since September on a weekly basis and began student testing in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2129.953s">We've</a>  been working over the past couple of months with the Department of Education and other partners, including Tufts University, to talk through what we're doing in the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2143.495s">And</a>  we were recognized by Commissioner Riley last week as one of the districts that have been out front with regard to our testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2151.997s">That</a>  is in large measure due to all the work that Tony and Marianne have been reporting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2158.769s">to</a>  the committee over the past couple of weeks and that their teams have been involved in throughout each school over the course of the past several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2168.317s">And</a>  we will be speaking with other districts across the Commonwealth tomorrow in a webinar to talk a little bit about what our experiences have been with respect to testing and what we are anticipating with our continued testing over the next several weeks and several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2186.904s">And</a>  as has been communicated several times, including in correspondence that went to all staff and all families today from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2194.55s">Ray,</a>  we will do re-entry testing tomorrow from 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2200.635s">till</a>  5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2201.836s">at</a>  all schools, with the exception of the Curtis Tufts, but that school community has been given a specific communication and instructions as to how their staff and students can get their tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2213.373s">But</a>  with that exception, all schools 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2215.954s">till</a>  5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2217.294s">for</a>  cohorts A, high-need, most vulnerable students, cohort C, students who typically attend in-person instruction on Thursdays and Fridays, and all Medford Public Schools staff, consistent with the testing that they have done, as I said, since September. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2234.117s">Cohort</a>  B students will have the opportunity to receive their reentry tests on Friday, January 15th, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2243.298s">from</a>  1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2244.098s">till</a>  5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2245.439s">That</a>  is again at all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2248.861s">And</a>  then we will continue with our regularly scheduled weekly testing on Tuesday, January 19th, following the holiday, and pick that up again going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2259.906s">As</a>  of right now, we anticipate the transition to pooled testing to happen on the week of January 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2270.349s">So</a>  we'll have two more weeks, including the re-entry testing that takes place this week, and our regular testing that takes place next week, our individualized testing, and then we'll switch to the pooled testing the week of January 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2283.48s">That's</a>  our plan as of right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2286.443s">With</a>  respect to pooled testing, and we'll be communicating a lot of that out to families and staff, there is very little difference, as we were discussing with our administrators today, at the initial point of collection <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2299.65s">with</a>  regard to individual testing and pool testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2303.093s">The</a>  difference comes in what happens in the follow-up after that, where individual in a pool or a pool test positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2312.419s">And</a>  what that means is for anyone who hasn't followed this closely, and they can absolutely understand why you may not have, a pool testing means all of the swabs going into one vial. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2324.288s">They</a>  are then tested together. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2326.109s">And</a>  if there is positivity, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2329.536s">identified</a>  within that pool, the entire pool is contacted and given directions as to how to go about getting a follow-up test on the following day. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2340.704s">And</a>  the protocols are for that pool to be quarantined up and until they receive their negative test, which again, there'll be a designated follow-up testing location. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2351.031s">We</a>  call it the reflex testing that will take place on Wednesdays and Saturdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2356.189s">following</a>  our Tuesdays and Fridays. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2357.87s">That's</a>  why we established Tuesdays and Fridays as our testing days because we have a remote day on Wednesday and obviously the weekend on Saturday to give people that window of time to get their follow-up tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2370.72s">There</a>  are some specifics from an operational perspective that we still need to work out with regard to the location of the designated testing spot for the reflex testing and exactly how that's gonna play out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2381.728s">And</a>  those are conversations that we're gonna continue to have over the coming days <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2386.142s">But</a>  for our community members, there are no implications for the next two weeks, because we're just going to continue doing the same testing program that we've done over the last several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2395.326s">And</a>  when we iron out those final details as to where to send people when a pool tests positive, that's something that we'll be communicating out broadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2404.35s">Just</a>  in terms of final reminders, we still want to get to 100% with regard to consent forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2411.893s">I</a>  think the superintendent, Tony, and I were pleased when <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2415.927s">We</a>  were on a conference call with a couple of other district representatives, districts that don't need to be named, and our consent form intake was at a higher percentage than some of the others on the call, but we're not at 100% and we're hopeful that we'll be able to get there in the coming days.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2436.454s">Great,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2438.115s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2442.457s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2443.8s">A</a>  couple of questions and then there's also several emails, but I'll let those come after everybody else has spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2449.502s">I</a>  know that you're still working out the logistics around the reflex testing when somebody in a pool is positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2458.225s">I'm</a>  just wanna be, what I'm hearing that has been worked out is that we are depending on families on a Wednesday or over the weekend to go get their kid tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2469.228s">And</a>  I don't, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2472.285s">It's</a>  concerning because some families may not do that or be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2475.166s">But</a>  my question is, let's say there are 10 people in the pool test, one of them is positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2482.768s">Are</a>  we allowing those 10 people back before they have all, if one of those families does not go get a reflex test, are they allowed back in our building?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2491.851s">So</a>  under the protocols, Mr. Rousseau, the answer would be no, that if they're part of a pool and have not yet shown a negative test as part of the reflex testing, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2502.622s">the</a>  expectation is that they would not come back into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2505.363s">Now,</a>  while the protocol is to get tested the following day, most, although not all students, would not be due in for another five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2521.327s">It's</a>  a little more challenging with staff, and obviously with the Cohort A students, the expectation is they're back on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2527.848s">And</a>  I think that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2530.77s">It</a>  is absolutely one of the downsides of the pool testing, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2536.511s">The</a>  rationale to the pool testing for both the district and the state is sustainability, that it is dramatically different in terms of the financial resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2546.573s">And</a>  we are, one of the reasons we haven't ironed out, finalized those details, and one of the reasons that we will in the near future need to make a strategic decision as to whether to participate in the program that DESE is constructing is that <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2560.653s">we</a>  want it to be as easy as possible for our families to get the reflex testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2566.674s">And</a>  so if the DESI program, and again, we've been advised on multiple occasions that the DESI program is still trying to work out some details, and that's why it's unclear whether we would essentially want to volunteer to participate or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2578.877s">But</a>  what we'll be looking for to make that determination is whether it is operationally set up to be as less of a burden as possible for families <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2590.178s">for</a>  several reasons, but one of them is what you're identifying as a downside to pool testing.</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2599.442s">And</a>  just to interject, and I know I may be stating the obvious, this is Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2604.184s">If</a>  there's a positive pool, it doesn't mean there could be more than one positive in that pool, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2609.306s">It</a>  doesn't mean that there's just one, there could be two, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2611.827s">So</a>  it is really important that everyone gets that follow-up testing.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2621.136s">Member</a>  van de Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2624.337s">Oh,</a>  just unmute.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2626.478s">How</a>  many people are in the pool or expected to be in the pool?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2632.081s">At</a>  least eight, and we think 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2635.442s">That</a>  is one of the things that scientists are discussing in their laboratory right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2641.244s">And</a>  as the technology improves, there's potential for more swabs in the vial. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2648.767s">which</a>  would be great because that's less of a budgetary impact, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2652.569s">But</a>  typically, those who are working on the technology and the science behind this right now are using a window of eight to 10 swabs in a vial. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2661.675s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2662.235s">Standing</a>  is 10 is the max at this point.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2666.558s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2671.781s">Unmute</a>  yourself, Jenny. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2672.781s">Member</a>  Graham, please.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2675.92s">Sorry,</a>  I thought I did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2679.002s">When</a>  you talk about pooling folks, has there been discussion about pooling siblings in the same pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2688.467s">I</a>  know that's obviously can't be done like cross building, but is there a way to pool families within a building so that at least they're not sort of getting potentially snared by multiple pools?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2705.983s">Yeah,</a>  so we've looked at, we've had a few different discussions about whether our cohorting of students should have any relation to the cohorting that takes place when the testing is pooled. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2723.216s">And</a>  generally speaking, everyone, and when I say we, I'm talking about some of the folks on this call, but also the conversations that we're having with other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2733.233s">some</a>  of the partners that are involved in developing the technology and the partners that are involved in operationalizing this, which it was their advocacy in part that built the conversation with DESI that is responsible for the program that's being rolled out across the Commonwealth now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2750.386s">And</a>  the prevailing view right now is that the efficiency cost to trying to do anything other than putting the eight swabs in a vial <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2763.665s">is</a>  essentially not worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2766.146s">That</a>  particularly with the virus rates being what they are, that we're better off. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2773.168s">And</a>  what I mean by that, frankly, is that while we are in the midst of a surge and that the numbers are high, our in-school transmission is low enough in which we can operationalize pool testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2782.81s">But</a>  part of that is essentially putting the eight to 10 swabs in a vial, filling up as many vials as possible, and then getting the vials out the door to get tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2792.684s">the</a>  time that would be lost by trying to coordinate and the potential cost of unfilled vials that aren't filled to the maximum capacity is considered to outweigh the potential convenience that would be enjoyed by families if everyone was together. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2815.902s">The</a>  other thing I would say is <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2818.702s">Well,</a>  it is not true that if a sibling has COVID, everyone in the household must. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2823.564s">We</a>  know that, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2825.004s">Most</a>  of us have had one experience or another where that's been demonstrated, where somehow people, despite living in the same household, don't spread it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2835.647s">If</a>  they're in the same school, and we wouldn't be talking about this if they're not, and they're coming from the same household, there is an increased chance that they're going to be positive, which means that the pools, their families are going to be dealing with the same challenge and the same problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2848.456s">So</a>  the answer is it's been thought about that there are some upsides, but not probably not worth it.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2855.82s">Okay,</a>  that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2859.403s">Thanks</a>  for that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2860.743s">And</a>  you also said earlier that our participation is good, but it is not 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2868.788s">What</a>  percent is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2871.39s">It</a>  is...</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2878.021s">within</a>  the vicinity of 80% consent forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2881.723s">And</a>  I would want to go back and look at numbers that have come in over the last few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2887.266s">We're</a>  not getting a lot of consent forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2889.127s">We're</a>  fully remote right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2893.469s">But</a>  I would like to get back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2897.351s">It's</a>  in the vicinity of 80%. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2898.892s">I</a>  can say on a conference call with Desi, I said it was 80%. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2902.534s">And</a>  then as that was being heralded, it occurred to me that maybe I wanted <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2906.213s">get</a>  the exact number, but it is very close to 80%.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2910.195s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2910.515s">It</a>  may be over, it may be over.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2912.876s">Yeah,</a>  and it was over 1,700 students have signed up, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2916.918s">Frey</a>  just quote me from around four to 500 teachers or staff, or 450 or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2921.96s">400</a>  to 450 staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2922.34s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2929.585s">And</a>  has there been discussion across districts or with other superintendents about making this kind of testing mandatory as a condition for in-person learning? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2943.894s">And</a>  what's your thinking about that?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2945.995s">So</a>  there has been discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2948.077s">I</a>  think that discussion is going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2949.758s">I</a>  think the problem that we and other districts have run into is that families <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2956.23s">it's</a>  very hard to impose a condition ex post facto. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2961.014s">And</a>  while we do have the remote learning option that is available, and we are currently not structured to withstand a disproportionate influx of remote learners into all of our remote learning settings, particularly at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2982.93s">And</a>  so given that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2985.633s">I</a>  think it would be really hard to halfway through a school year impose that type of, when we logistically can't necessarily offer an alternative option and excluding students on this basis on such short notice, I think is definitely not viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3002.387s">So</a>  I think that, I do think that it is conversation we will need to have this spring and over the summer, depending on where we are with the virus going into next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3013.845s">when</a>  all options are back on the table and families can make potential, you know, we can first determine what decisions the district and the Commonwealth are gonna provide the families or what options rather, and then make sure that families have all the information available to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3028.329s">And</a>  that's certainly not a, you know, we didn't have this information, we didn't have, some of these testing strategies weren't even developed at the time that schools were making learning, you know, plans and providing options to families. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3040.852s">So</a>  I think that's, that is the, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3043.432s">hesitancy</a>  as to whether to wrestle that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3048.276s">And</a>  in the in the lieu of that wrestling match, we have been pushing strongly encouraging and asking principals to continue that dialogue with their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3059.166s">Because</a>  while we certainly want to provide this opportunity for people to stay healthy, this is really a public health <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3066.932s">obligation</a>  that we all have. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3068.573s">It</a>  is not so much about testing, because this is actually one of the sort of interesting conundrums of testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3073.935s">It's</a>  not really about keeping you safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3075.595s">By</a>  the time the swab goes into your nose, you either have it or you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3079.677s">And</a>  so this is about a community responsibility that we all have to one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3083.619s">And</a>  I think that's something that they'll write really interesting articles about in the future.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3091.689s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3092.67s">I</a>  if for those who are listening, I, I can't request strongly enough that everyone participate in this program like we are so lucky to have this program in Medford, I get emails every day from school committees across the state that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3108.868s">They</a>  have to go full remote because they just can't figure out, they can't isolate how their case counts are happening, where it's happening in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3118.373s">And</a>  they just have no choice but to make these really broad brush decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3122.654s">And</a>  I think we've been really lucky here that we can make really targeted decisions about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3130.038s">And</a>  if you haven't signed up for testing yet, please do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3135.36s">it</a>  is life-saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3136.28s">It</a>  may not save your life, but it may save somebody else's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3139.561s">So</a>  please seriously consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3143.381s">And</a>  then the last question that I have.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3146.262s">I</a>  just want to say thank you for echoing that because, you know, the principals know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3153.683s">We</a>  have, and teachers as well, been looking at every sort of communication avenue and sort of trying to identify <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3163.371s">who's</a>  the best messenger and how do we sort of really craft that message in a way where people can understand the importance of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3170.436s">And</a>  I think we all greatly appreciate you, all members of the testing family.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3178.461s">And</a>  then my last question about testing is whether cohort D families can test this week.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3184.805s">And</a>  the answer to that is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3186.506s">And</a>  that goes to the sort of public element that we were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3191.342s">I</a>  think this district and the municipal government and all other community entities would love to provide this, but from a financial perspective, while I think our testing program has run well, I think we've done a good job, we've also been patching it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3208.474s">And</a>  one of the key variables that has changed, that is changing this week and going forward is a partnership that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3216.74s">Ray</a>  cultivated with <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3219.102s">some</a>  higher ed institutions and a large influx of volunteer student nurses who are helping us to staff this and execute this, which we know other districts, even in response to Dessie's rollout of this program, have been unable to, they've been unable to do because they just don't have the personnel needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3239.471s">We</a>  don't necessarily, up until this point, we haven't necessarily had the personnel either. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3243.374s">We've</a>  just told a bunch of other people who typically do other stuff that they now work the testing registration desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3249.9s">And</a>  I think it's been heartening to see the extent to which people have been willing to dive in and take this up as an unexpected responsibility that everyone in the organization has. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3263.35s">And</a>  I think that without that partnership that Tony's developed, there would be real questions about the sustainability.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3269.946s">Awesome,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3271.647s">Dr.</a>  Edward-Vincent? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3273.628s">Yes,</a>  I just wanted to take this moment also to thank you, the school committee, for your support during this entire journey because we were kind of one of the districts that was the first one out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3288.694s">So</a>  thanking you for your leadership with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3291.496s">We</a>  have been kind of quietly tapped on the shoulder by Desi, which Mr. Murphy alluded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3300.664s">Tomorrow</a>  we will be part of a webinar with other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3305.293s">talking</a>  about the work that we have been doing here in Medford and how it's working for us to be able to help other districts think differently and how were we able to do it because it was a tremendous feat. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3322.453s">And</a>  so just in this moment, I want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3326.517s">our</a>  nursing supervisor, Toni Wray. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3330.059s">It's</a>  seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3331.119s">I</a>  get texts over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3333.4s">Maryann</a>  O'Connor texting me as well from the Board of Health on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3338.462s">And,</a>  you know, Mr. Murphy and his team, this was, no one thought that this would be such a huge <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3347.965s">task</a>  and undertaking, but we prioritize safety, equity, and consistency, and testing fell under the bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3357.031s">And</a>  so we're continuing to prioritize that to the best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3361.434s">So</a>  I just want to thank you, the school committee, the mayor, the city side for their support of <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3366.558s">paying</a>  for the testing the partnership with Tufts, but really I just want to say thank you because now the other districts that have found themselves with no choice but to have to shut down or no way to contact trace. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3380.538s">They</a>  did not have a system in place to remain open. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3384.7s">So</a>  I just wanted to let you know that we are doing what very, very few districts have been able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3393.503s">And</a>  they're now asking us to share what we've learned, our best practices to help other districts strategize and be able to come up with it, come up with something for their respective communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3408.989s">So</a>  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's been helping with the testing and keeping our community safe.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3418.356s">Thank</a>  you Dr. Edward-Vinson for all your hard work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3421.358s">It</a>  does not go unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3423.339s">It's</a>  definitely a team effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3426.241s">If</a>  I may ask a question, I think everybody, can you give some logistics about this Tuesday and Friday testing? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3434.552s">just</a>  any questions, little questions that have come in that maybe we can clear up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3438.134s">For</a>  example, if I'm a mom and I have somebody in elementary school, middle school, and high school, do I go to all three locations or can I get them all tested in one place? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3449.479s">What</a>  are we looking at for where, are we ready for having lines to <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3454.182s">have</a>  people waiting and then we're going to wait outside, kids on the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3457.923s">If</a>  we could just kind of talk through anything that you're hearing and maybe answer those two questions, that will be helpful for all those who are listening and getting ready to pack the kids in car or walk to get their kids tested.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3468.787s">And</a>  when they do, they can go to one location. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3471.068s">The</a>  siblings have been specifically identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3475.05s">So</a>  if you have children in multiple schools, you can choose the one that's most convenient. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3481.548s">and</a>  they should be able to get tested in whatever school you go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3488.352s">If</a>  there are other specific exceptions to that, I would just ask that you email your school nurse or principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3498.637s">They'll</a>  pass those on to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3501.078s">So</a>  generally speaking, we want people to go to their home schools that they attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3507.222s">That's</a>  for crowd control purposes, occupancy, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3510.958s">keeping</a>  the lines are set up and the signage is out to make sure that we don't have any overcrowding. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3516.721s">I</a>  would suspect that in history is sort of borne out over this testing program that people participating in COVID testing like to get there early. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3528.087s">And</a>  so it's probably more likely that there'll be lines in the earlier part of the one to 5pm window than at the later part. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3536.191s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3536.945s">If</a>  that's a concern, I would encourage you to go between 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3539.726s">and</a>  5 p.m., and then you can let me know if I was wrong about that, but that's been the case every week pretty much since September. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3546.81s">Again,</a>  if you have children in multiple schools, you can choose one and go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3553.373s">Some</a>  of the testing stations have been moved from their normal locations to be closer to exits and entrances, so you can come and go more easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3565.852s">it</a>  is possible, as I said, that the line might extend outdoors in some for purposes of maintaining the six feet of distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3573.577s">But</a>  I think that should be probably only at the beginning and not too common. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3578.24s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3581.803s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3582.203s">Ray.</a> </p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3582.884s">Yes,</a>  I just also wanted to remind parents that students who are in middle school and high school have been self swabbing during their testing and they should be able to enter the buildings by themselves so that we don't have an over occupancy between students and their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3603.694s">These</a>  students are used to doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3605.555s">They</a>  know the routine and they should move through the process pretty quickly.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3610.375s">And</a>  if I could just add really quickly to that, because this is the part of what we're gonna talk about with the rest of the state tomorrow, of all the things that the district has done well in this, and I think Tony spoke to the numbers and the level of participation, which is really good in and of itself, but the efficiency with which each school community has organized themselves, and then with Tony's staff and their own have executed this, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3640.062s">I</a>  think is in some ways, one of the more pleasant surprises, not that we didn't expect people would be able to be efficient or they would, obviously they would be trying, but we're moving students, large cohorts of students in and out of the testing station in a matter of just a few minutes, which both ensures, I think in some respects, better participation, but importantly, it prevents the school day <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3664.801s">from</a>  becoming all about the COVID test. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3667.762s">And</a>  that was one of the concerns that some of us had going in that most of these students are only in two days a week to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3675.884s">And</a>  we didn't want to reduce the instructional day to just time spent in line waiting to get your COVID test. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3682.746s">Because</a>  the point of the COVID test is to stay in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3685.087s">And</a>  then if you don't even get to class, then what was the point of coming to school to begin with? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3690.328s">And</a>  we've done a really, really good job at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3693.894s">And</a>  so to the principals and the nurses who have made that possible, I think we owe them a big debt of gratitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3700.52s">But</a>  to that point, I guess this is why I started saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3704.803s">For</a>  parents, particularly from sixth grade and up, it would be great if you stayed in the car because that will reduce the chance that anyone has to stand in line outside in the cold.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3716.453s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3717.534s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3720.125s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3720.625s">Um,</a>  I have, uh, if there, uh, did other members have questions just cause I have a couple of emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3726.647s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3731.869s">I</a>  know it's short notice, but if there's any way you could do a reverse call, because I think that's a great information that parents shouldn't, I was planning on going in with Nevin and Rowan to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3743.173s">So</a>  I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3744.013s">If</a>  someone could put out a call that grade six through 12, the parents can wait in their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3748.872s">just</a>  because of the numbers in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3751.133s">I</a>  don't know if that's too short notice to get a call out.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3754.174s">Well,</a>  I think it might be worth doing a call tomorrow, one more call tomorrow morning, just to get people out generally. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3759.656s">We</a>  did one this evening in which we said K to five parents should accompany their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3766.379s">Obviously</a>  the inference being six to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3767.959s">To</a>  be honest, that was worded intentionally because for some parents, if they feel strongly that they would like to be with their child when they test, we're not prohibiting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3777.695s">and</a>  we want to leave that option available. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3781.236s">But</a>  I think emphasizing that point that secondary students can come in on their own, I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3787.539s">And</a>  I think another robo call tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3789.299s">I</a>  don't know that we need to do another letter because we've already done several, but I think a robo call tomorrow morning would be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3794.841s">And</a>  I'm sure we can do that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3800.264s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3801.124s">Maybe</a>  we can add in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3802.905s">Yep,</a>  and just add them. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3804.465s">If</a>  you have multiple children in multiple schools, you can test at one location.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3808.268s">That</a>  wasn't today, but we'll put it in tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3810.51s">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3811.891s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3813.452s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3814.273s">This</a>  is an email from Jane Hamill on Maynard Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3820.017s">As</a>  we all watch with horror at our increasing infections, I have been so grateful about the testing program at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3826.943s">Thank</a>  you for making that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3828.907s">Is</a>  it possible to get information about participation rate and number of positives? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3833.111s">I'm</a>  specifically interested in seeing the percent of students per cohort per school who have submitted their paperwork and percentage of students who actually participate any given week at the high school, since it is up to them to remember to go rather than the middle school where they are actually get called to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3851.007s">And</a>  the number of positive cases identified per cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3855.243s">possible</a>  to get the information before school starts on the 14th and the 20th, and after that on an ongoing basis, such as every two weeks, it would help ease my family's concerns about heading back in during this surge. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3869.389s">I</a>  will forward the specifics of that email since that was probably a lot to digest.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3873.19s">Yeah,</a>  I think most of that data can be and is readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3876.872s">I'm</a>  not sure that it's broken down exactly along the way the community member is asking for, but we can <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3884.628s">If</a>  you want to just forward it, Mr. Soto, we're happy to take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3887.691s">We'll</a>  be able to provide whatever information we can.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3893.636s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3894.236s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3894.717s">I</a>  do know that the committee has, I mean, in numerous meetings, we haven't made a motion per se, but we have asked, you know, for the percentage of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3903.584s">I</a>  thought we had asked by grade level and school that had submitted their paperwork because I, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3911.231s">Ray</a>  will know this number much quicker than <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3913.305s">I</a>  could do a Google search, but 80% is not a number that is considered acceptable to... My understanding before we began all this was it was 90, 92% or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3925.858s">That</a>  was really the number we needed to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3929.081s">And</a>  80%, that's not anywhere near that, frankly.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3938.322s">HAB-Masyn</a>  Moyer): I don't have a recall Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3940.343s">HAB-Masyn</a>  Moyer): We Chris doors, the Tufts rep and he never meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3944.825s">He</a>  said, you want at least a large majority, but to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3949.047s">I</a>  know I don't ever recall the 92% or 90% HAB-Danny Teodorusilo & Collin Mastodoni, Jr.:</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3954.09s">:</a>  I would just, we're not satisfied with 80% either. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3956.971s">I'm</a>  also not. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3957.711s">I'd</a>  love to do the math before I say that the number 80% anymore because it may be a little lower, maybe a little bit higher, but <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3965.794s">we're</a>  not done collecting consent forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3968.316s">And</a>  there are some issues related to the potential involvement with the DESE program that we're going to have to factor into our communications with regard to collection of additional consents. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3981.565s">But</a>  we haven't stopped, and we've used almost every communication opportunity we've had since the consent form was developed and the student testing began. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3991.647s">and</a>  we'll continue to push that aggressively. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3993.288s">So</a>  I don't want any of the members of the committee to think that we are boasting about 80%. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3997.71s">I</a>  guess I did say we were boasting about it, but that was compared to districts that were lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4001.713s">So</a>  that was just in that moment, my Medford pride took over, I think, but the number, it needs to be higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4008.116s">There's</a>  no doubt about that.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4012.579s">I</a>  have another email, Mayor, but I think Member McLaughlin's hands up.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4017.662s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4019.389s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4019.969s">And</a>  thank you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4020.95s">I</a>  wanted to respond regarding that email before we moved on. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4024.373s">So</a>  if that information could be included in the bi-monthly reporting, that's what's being asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4033.941s">But</a>  what I'm hearing is we're not asking for a motion specific to that date, but that will occur as part of the dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4042.948s">Is</a>  that accurate?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4044.529s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4044.809s">Looking</a>  forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4045.45s">That's</a>  right, because I'd like to read the email closely <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4048.825s">to</a>  make sure that all of the information is information that we can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4052.626s">I</a>  mean, part of the challenges with this is that almost every number there is very, very fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4058.947s">And</a>  so our ability to incorporate new data and then publish it and keep, maintain its accuracy is not a light lift. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4076.05s">That's</a>  not how we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4077.918s">I</a>  just, before we make any sweeping commitments as to exactly how this data can be reported, I just want to look at it more closely.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4084.943s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4085.623s">So</a>  then I would ask that we make a motion that we put this on the agenda for the January 26th school committee meeting, just as a follow-up, if we could do that, Mr. Murphy, so that you could tell us what was workable, what wasn't, and how it will be reported out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4101.074s">That</a>  would be really helpful.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4102.234s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4102.995s">We</a>  can include that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4104.256s">Can</a>  I get a second?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4105.196s">Motion</a>  by Member McLaughlin, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4108.779s">member</a>  Van der Kloot, roll call member McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4111.721s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4113.843s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4115.845s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4117.426s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4120.008s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4121.99s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4123.251s">Member</a>  Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4124.332s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4125.573s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4127.294s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4128.375s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4131.377s">She</a>  said yes, she's muted, yes.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4133.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4133.819s">Member,</a>  I mean, Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4135.761s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4136.44s">Yes,</a>  so the affirmative zero and the negative, that would be placed on the January 25th agenda.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4143.344s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4147.787s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4148.227s">I</a>  actually just had a quick thought question of my own, actually not related to the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4155.211s">We</a>  are sending out the communications to seek parents to sign this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4161.976s">Are</a>  we also, are we receiving, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4166.443s">affirmations</a>  that we will not be getting tested? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4169.384s">Are</a>  we getting a positive declines? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4171.745s">And</a>  are we collecting those? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4173.425s">And</a>  if so, what do those look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4175.386s">Because</a>  I'm worried about, you know, when my son was in elementary school, we got all of his notices once a year when we emptied his locker. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4185.149s">And,</a>  you know, I just worry that, you know, do we have families who are still completely oblivious because we just are communicating with them in a way? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4193.432s">And</a>  if we get a positive no, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4196.509s">we</a>  can take them off the list and work the list of those that haven't responded directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4201.131s">But</a>  if it's hundreds of people, then it's much harder to work that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4204.673s">So</a>  that's my question.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4206.314s">So</a>  there's a couple of different parts to this answer, member Rousseau, and I'll try to keep it brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4214.639s">The</a>  system works based on positive consent forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4221.182s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4225.783s">In</a>  the actual data system that essentially produces the vial that your test goes into, if a student who has either, we've got a note from mom and dad saying, nope, do not test my kid, or we just didn't get anything, the system just won't produce a vial to test. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4245.355s">And</a>  therefore the student couldn't be tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4248.777s">We</a>  do have a record from <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4254.737s">all</a>  school communities in which there was an affirmative communication, as you say, saying, I don't want my child tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4264.559s">That</a>  doesn't have any impact in terms of the actual technology that permits the student to actually receive a test. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4273.08s">There've</a>  also been very, very few people who have volunteered that they don't want their child being tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4280.582s">So</a>  few in fact, that <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4282.966s">The</a>  note that we have in our own internal data systems, frankly, is so that when we get to a point where we've gotten a response from everyone, and we hope to, because we want to get 100% on that, the hope is that we can then engage with the family through the health services department to identify why it is they don't want to participate in the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4307.065s">And</a>  it is certainly the family's choice to go to the point that we spoke about earlier in response to Dr. Graham's question, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4313.037s">about</a>  potentially making it compulsory. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4315.819s">They</a>  do have the option to opt out, but given the implications for public health, I do think the district has a responsibility up to a certain point to inquire as to why that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4328.508s">The</a>  family certainly has a right to hang up the phone and say, because I said no, that's certainly their right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4334.593s">We</a>  certainly wouldn't suggest otherwise for the time being, but the hope is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4340.352s">through</a>  a conversation, even those numbers could ultimately be reduced.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4345.92s">May</a>  I just follow up on what David had to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4349.442s">I</a>  have fielded some of those emails and conversations myself, and oftentimes it's a parent or a student, especially an older student, who just doesn't understand the process and who has some unanswered question, like a fear about what it's going to mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4365.909s">And</a>  after the conversation, in many instances, we're able to gain the consent from the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4373.508s">You</a>  know, they'll say, oh, that wasn't what I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4376.009s">This</a>  sounds much easier, less invasive. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4378.73s">So</a>  yes, we, of course we agree to be tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4381.592s">So</a>  the conversations are very worthwhile between the school nurses and the parents.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4388.915s">Non-invasive</a>  has been some of the most persuasive words that we've used throughout this campaign.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4398.619s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4399.4s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4403.008s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4403.429s">Yes,</a>  to that end I was interested very much in the data as well in terms of who is not offering consent and so has it, you know, is there a way that it can be made really clear to please you know in the robocalls and the communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4419.307s">what</a>  have you, to let us know either way, one way or the other, yes or no, because we need to, you know, have that data, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4426.496s">So</a>  I think what we're hearing is, what I'm hearing as a parent anyway, is to please send in your consent form for <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4434.453s">your</a>  child to test and I'm not hearing if you don't want to test to let us know or you know if you have any questions to let us know and so I think that that's equally important because I think a lot of families probably just assume well if I don't respond they'll get that it's no and then it doesn't include that data set of people who like member Ruseau said you know whose notices are sitting in their kids mailbox uh email box or <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4459.308s">in</a>  their own spam folder or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4461.569s">So</a>  that data set I think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4464.309s">And</a>  is there a way that we're sort of cross-referencing if it is, you know, say 20%, so 500, 1,000 roughly, you know, students, you know, is there any cross-reference? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4476.252s">And</a>  my other, you know, real concern is, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4479.594s">Again,</a>  would the data tell us anything about, you know, families of children with disabilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4483.437s">So,</a>  for example, if there are a lot of children, you know, with disabilities that, you know, for whatever reason might need additional support in testing, whether it's from, you know, a specialized educator or somebody else that, you know, I'm sure that through the Arc of Mass or Northeast Arc or any of those organizations, this must be an ongoing issue for a lot of schools that <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4503.834s">you</a>  know, they're individuals who just, you know, probably need some support, getting some testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4509.76s">So</a>  who they might be, and then also for any of our families who, you know, just what have you, either whether it's that, you know, there's situations at home or homelessness or they're not getting the message or whatever, how we can help with that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4524.173s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4524.733s">I</a>  guess I'm asking if there's any way to disaggregate the data a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4530.837s">And</a>  then also how we as school committee members can help get out the word for the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4537.201s">Any</a>  suggestions that you might have, you know, other than obviously our own social media, but anything else that we can do, please give us some guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4543.746s">And</a>  then lastly, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4547.029s">How</a>  are we making it very explicit to families? <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4549.45s">Because</a>  my intention is to definitely say, please let the school know whether you do or do not want testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4554.513s">It's</a>  not just whether you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4556.855s">So</a>  how can we message that?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4558.636s">Well,</a>  Member McLaughlin, if I could respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4562.818s">I</a>  do think that there is some strategic consideration as to articulating too explicitly the opt-out <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4574.677s">option</a>  that is available to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4576.458s">As</a>  we said, it's not mandatory as of right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4580.48s">I</a>  think that the strategy we've employed so far is to communicate repeatedly so that there, I'm sure there are some consent forms that are still on backpacks or collars, proverbially speaking, but we want to reduce that by continuing to give the option to opt in as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4599.529s">To</a>  be just really, really candid, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4603.098s">Part</a>  of the reason we only talk about opting in is because in the absence of making it mandatory, we don't, our hope is that, well, the point about if you have any questions, we certainly say that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4615.103s">We</a>  need to continue saying that because we want to answer every question possible, but we don't really want to plant the seeds of what might be a good idea, why it might be a good idea to opt out because our position as an organization is that there really isn't a good reason to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4631.634s">And</a>  I know at a much more complicated level, this conversation takes place around vaccines and that when we legitimize an option that is contrary to public health, we are increasing the risk that people exercise that option that is contrary to public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4648.744s">And</a>  that is, frankly, there is a strategic implication for not talking too much about how you can say no if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4657.929s">They</a>  certainly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4659.613s">and</a>  then they'll get a phone call from Tony and we'll try to talk them out of it, but they certainly have that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4664.474s">But</a>  there is no sound basis to not participate in testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4672.476s">And</a>  that is part of why we weigh the communications the way that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4676.496s">And</a>  that's just a question as to how the committee can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4679.937s">I</a>  think that we are at each sort of threshold that we hit, we had the sort of initial, like try to get all the consent forms, <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4689.505s">in</a>  the days surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday, which wasn't ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4693.066s">And</a>  then we made a next push and we made some progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4695.346s">Then</a>  we were collecting around a huge snowstorm that required canceling school two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4699.968s">And</a>  then we had the holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4701.048s">And</a>  so like, as has been the case sort of with everything related to the pandemic, any challenge that we could think of eventually comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4707.65s">We've</a>  still got an 80%. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4708.47s">We</a>  need to sort of regroup now and see where's that last gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=4712.611s">And</a>  I think we can put on specific strategies that the committee can help with.</p>
