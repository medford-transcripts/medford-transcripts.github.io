00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:57,204
You should first ask if there are any other nominations, and then the nomination has to be said by saying the name.

50
00:03:58,444 --> 00:03:58,764
Correct.

51
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,226
Are there any other nominations for vice chair?

52
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,431
And yes, please state the name on both this and for secretary.

53
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:14,173
Member Graham.

54
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:21,177
So I say the name of the person I am nominating, is that correct?

55
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,355
that I'm voting for?

56
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:27,298

00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:27,698

Thank you very much.

74
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:22,139
I did speak to Member Rousseau earlier today, and we agreed that if any letters come in today, since I wasn't familiar yet with the process, that he would read them today.

75
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,321
And I'll take over in the future.

76
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,343
And you'll be the secretary one more night?

77
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:29,504
No, I'm kidding.

78
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:30,665
I'm kidding.

79
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:38,231
Is there a nomination for secretary of the Medford School Committee for 2021?

80
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:40,953

I just closed it.

00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:09,915
Member McLaughlin.

90
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:11,355

96
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,698
Mia, that's the best audio you've had so far.

97
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,178
Oh, thank you.

98
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:26,119
I'm using Teagan's laptop.

99
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:28,099
The kids have better stuff than us.

100
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:30,019
Member Roussel.

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,140

Member McLaughlin.

104
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,854
I'd also like to put my vote to Member McLaughlin.

00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:45,217

Thank you.

134
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,280
I just wanted to, um.

135
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,501
Member McLaughlin probably does not have a pad for the vote

136
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:15,421
pre printed pad with our names, but you can write what it is and then do the votes on that.

137
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:27,007
Um, so I just, um, want to make sure that one that Susie or Lisa or somebody is taking the votes down and not relying on those pads.

138
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:29,308
Thank you.

139
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:29,628
I am.

140
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:30,569
Um, thank you.

141
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:31,529
May I, ma'am?

142
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,190
Yes.

143
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,850
McLaughlin.

144
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,565
Thank you, Member Russo.

145
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:39,587
I am recording them on a Google Doc and also on my notebook in the interim.

146
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,328
And I'm sure Susie is in her minutes as well.

147
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:46,610
But if there's a formal stationery or something that folks want me to use, that's fine.

148
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:55,913
I can pick that up at the central administration, assuming there are some there, Superintendent or Susie.

149
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,137
Um.

150
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:05,160
We'll definitely get the stationary to you.

151
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:15,208
But for the purposes of today, we'll have between Susie and Lisa will have, you know, backup in terms of recording that information.

152
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:16,269
Thank you.

153
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,431
And then may I just ask or I can ask offline.

154
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,993
I just how the forms are submitted, but I'll ask that later.

155
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:21,373
Thank you.

156
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:28,779

176
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:23,425
Finally, a lot of bills came through for food service, which I had been sort of on the lookout for, so I was glad to see them.

177
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,708
Everything else seemed to be in order.

178
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:30,113
I want to thank all of the secretaries, particularly

179
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:49,769
Gina Citrano, who sort of helps organize the bills for me, but everybody who is involved in the process of getting the bills together and making sure that we are in order and our bills are being paid as they should be appropriately.

180
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,832
There's a lot of paperwork involved and I just am very appreciative.

181
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:56,034
Thank you.

182
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:56,715
Member McLaughlin?

183
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:14,155
Yeah, I just also wanted to add, you know, thank you to member Russo for his service as vice chair in the past session and to member van de Kloet and her service as secretary in the past session, because there is extra work involved and just wanted to say we appreciate that, thank you.

184
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:17,596
Thank you.

185
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:21,498
We have number five, report of committees.

186
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:27,240
Six, I don't know, we don't have any reports on the committee.

187
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,640
Up next is community participation.

188
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:40,002
Again, public participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

189
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:46,304
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

190
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,505
Member Russo, do you see any yet?

191
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:52,286
Yes, we have one.

192
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,148
This is an email from Sarah Florence of Marion Street in Medford.

193
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,070
I hope this.

194
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,695
Hello everyone I hope this message finds you well in these strange times.

195
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:14,106
I wrote last spring in support of the resolution to change the name of the Columbus Elementary School I was surprised by the length of the debate, but the solution ultimately passed.

196
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,988
I understand that this issue is not

197
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:16,617
the name change.

198
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:21,680
It's not anyone's top priority at the moment, but I also feel that you made a commitment to the community to make this change.

199
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,861
I have missed multiple deadlines.

200
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,442
I would appreciate an update.

201
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:28,164
Whether still be a committee to choose the new name.

202
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:30,585
Can we still expect the name change this summer?

203
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:31,285
Thank you.

204
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:36,629
I make a

205
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:49,098
January 26 agenda so that we can discuss and respond to the email.

206
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:50,778
Absolutely.

207
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:55,719
I plan on responding to I can reply all I didn't get to that today, but I will.

208
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,720
I know we're through another 20 subcommittees.

209
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,700
We have a committee of the whole meetings we have to schedule and vision committee was up first.

210
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,341
So do I have a second?

211
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:13,182
Second second seconded by member Graham roll call.

212
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:16,025
Oh, that's me.

213
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:18,886
This is going to be tricky.

214
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:19,606
I'll get used to it.

215
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:20,947
Member Graham?

216
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:21,767
Yes.

217
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:23,288
Member Kretz?

218
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:26,249
Yes.

219
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:28,509
Member McLaughlin?

220
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:28,869
Yes.

221
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,750
Member McStone?

222
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,290
Yes.

223
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,491
Member Russo?

224
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:34,271
Yes.

225
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:36,352
Member Van de Kloot?

226
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:36,872
Yes.

227
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:39,213
Mayor Longo-Kern?

228
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,474
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

229
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:46,914
paper passes, so we'll be on the 1-26 agenda.

230
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:53,375
Number seven, we have report of superintendent's updates and comments.

231
00:13:57,835 --> 00:13:58,816
Good evening, everyone.

232
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:00,996
Happy New Year.

233
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:11,718
It is my hope that 2021 will bring with it much happiness and good health for all in our Mustang family and the Medford community at large.

234
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:20,395
However, the year didn't exactly begin as we had expected.

235
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:39,448
It started promising with the arrival of the vaccine, but no matter what your political leaning, the events that transpired last Wednesday at the United States Capitol was a horrendous show of the very worst of America.

236
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:45,845
I am, as the majority of people in our country, a child of immigrants.

237
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:51,348
My parents immigrated here from Haiti in the early 1960s.

238
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:03,695
This type of action, what transpired last Wednesday, I would always say to myself, does not happen here.

239
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,637
For the first time ever,

240
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:15,664
the Confederate flag entered the United States Capitol building, the seat of our government.

241
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:23,089
Our democracy, which has always been the shining star in the world, was damaged.

242
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:35,717
It was scary, unsettling, and it once again shed light on both the fragility of our democracy while also bringing to the forefront

243
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:39,033
the inequality in our country.

244
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:50,317
As Vice President-elect Kamala Harris stated, it is just one example of blatant social inequity in the United States.

245
00:15:55,058 --> 00:16:05,722
Additionally, we have known for generations that much has to be done to create a more just, equitable, and unified society.

246
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:18,864
The Medford Public Schools, we are committed to engaging in conversations that will promote understanding across lines of division.

247
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:33,573
We will support our students and teach them to be leaders against hate while working aggressively to address racist beliefs, practices, and systems.

248
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:42,370
Next week would have been the 92nd birthday of Dr. King.

249
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:49,473
January 15th is his official birthday and we're celebrating it on the 18th.

250
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:58,917
Dr. King said, we must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.

251
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:14,187
I believe that it is imperative during this time of heightened stress and anxiety that we provide the structure and support that our children require right here.

252
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:24,169
Unfortunately, as all of us know, we are facing a surge with the COVID-19 cases, even here in Medford.

253
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:28,970
We're aware that there's an uptick and we are working diligently

254
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:37,214
to prepare for the safe return of hybrid staff and students when they come back to our buildings on Thursday, January 14th.

255
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:43,815
We are continuing with all of our safety protocols to allow for this to happen.

256
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:56,758
To that end, I again encourage all hybrid students to come to their schools for testing prior to their return to in-person learning.

257
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:09,618
I've stated in many updates and commercials and in the communications that have gone out, if you have not completed a consent form, please do so.

258
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,100
You can email it, you can drop it off at the school.

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,262
Testing is going to take place tomorrow from 1 to 5 p.m.

260
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:22,485
That's for all staff and students in cohorts A and C.

261
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:43,268
And again, on Friday, from 1 to 5 p.m., we're going to test all students in Cohort B. For our incoming freshmen, testing can be accessed through the West Courtyard entrance.

262
00:18:44,283 --> 00:19:05,355
For our freshmen, their first time coming to the Medford High School Complex, there will be a freshman orientation this Wednesday, January 13th for ninth grade, and a detailed schedule was sent out to all students from Mr. Principal Paul DeLeva,

263
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:17,932
And although the focus will be on cohort B and C students, we welcome cohorts A and D students to participate in the freshman orientation.

264
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:35,755
Principal DeLava and Principal Fallon will welcome all the students, discuss COVID safety protocols, student schedules, and conduct socially distanced tours throughout the building.

265
00:19:39,350 --> 00:20:00,842
On a different note, I wanna remind our parents and guardians that students who qualify for free and reduced lunch under the National School Lunch Program, whether you are hybrid or fully remote, please know that the P-EBT funds are available to you until the end of this school year.

266
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:05,465
For those who might have questions about this assistance,

267
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:10,681
please contact the Department of Transitional Assistance at 877-382-2363.

268
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:11,541
That's 877-382-2363.

269
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:15,444
Last week, on Thursday, Mayor Lungo Kern, Principal DeLeva,

270
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:50,090
Dr. Riccadeli and I had the pleasure of welcoming Mr. Adamo Castellanuevo, Director of the Consul General of Italy's Education Office to the Medford High School.

271
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:59,972
Mr. Castelnuovo presented the mayor with a check in the amount of $24,000 US euros.

272
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:03,834
It was 29,477 euros.

273
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:21,421
Last June, Dr. Riccadeli, who oversees the World Language Department, worked with lead teacher Vilma Bobo, who was fluent in Italian, to submit a grant application for direct funding from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs

274
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,991
connected to the Consulate General of Italy.

275
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:39,497
Medford was selected to receive the highest funding amount of any school district in the entire country, based upon our strong support of our district-wide Italian language program.

276
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:57,668
We are so appreciative and extend our sincere thanks to Federica Serrini, the Consul General of Italy, Director Castelnuovo, and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their generous support of Medford's language program.

277
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:13,021
As Dr. Riccardelli reported to you at the last meeting, the funds will be used to defray the cost of the advanced placement Italian program at the high school level for school year 2020-2021.

278
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:26,388
In addition, last month, Tufts University Office of Community Relations hosted a holiday charity raffle.

279
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:38,338
Residents were asked via Facebook, the Tufts Facebook page, to nominate a nonprofit organization to win a $500 prize.

280
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:45,801
The nonprofit that had the most nominations in Medford was the Medford Family Network.

281
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:51,323
Congratulations to our own Marie Cassidy and her staff.

282
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:58,473
who have continued despite COVID to provide important services to our families.

283
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:07,300
And thank you to Tufts University for providing this wonderful donation to Medford Family Network.

284
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:14,246
Thank you for all of you who voted for the network as well, Medford Family Network.

285
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:16,548
Last Thursday,

286
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:31,104
Our district attorney, Marion Ryan, invited me to take part in a professional development training for incoming assistant district attorneys that focused on the effect of school discipline on black girls.

287
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:45,055
Joining me on the panel was Melanie Rush from the Appleseed Center, who discussed the study they completed highlighting the disproportionate impact of school discipline on black girls.

288
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:56,972
Superintendent Christine Elow of the Cambridge Police Department, who discussed the importance of establishing connections between students and the police.

289
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:12,340
Dr. Yvonne Spicer, Mayor of Framingham, who was also an educator, and she discussed how our different educational roles have assisted her in her new role as a Chief Executive Officer of her city.

290
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:19,265
I discussed the importance of inclusivity and equity here at the Medford Public Schools.

291
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:30,432
It was wonderful to have been asked to participate in this important and substantial conversation with the young assistant district attorneys of Middlesex County.

292
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:43,240
Just prior to our winter break, DA Ryan also hosted the first virtual Cut It Out program with the vocational cosmetology and health assisting students.

293
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:49,908
We appreciate the continued collaboration we have with our district attorney's office.

294
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:59,054
Despite COVID, our CCSR students continue to find ways to improve our community.

295
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:09,521
Nathan Quinn and Charlotte Foti, sixth graders at the McGlynn and Abigail Charlton, a sixth grader at the Andrews.

296
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:17,941
noticed that the majority of the little free libraries around the city featured books for an older audience.

297
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:24,708
So they held a book drive for middle school age students collecting a remarkable 249 books.

298
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:26,450
They have distributed the books

299
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:36,909
to the little free libraries around Medford and plan to continue to do so over the next months.

300
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,574
Great job, Nathan, Charlotte, and Abigail.

301
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:53,525
Thank you for your advocacy and your leadership and replenishing the book supplies and the little libraries to encourage reading during this COVID time.

302
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:55,767
So congratulations to you and thank you so much.

303
00:25:57,403 --> 00:26:03,408
I would like to close my remarks this evening with a quote from President Abraham Lincoln.

304
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:14,236
It's from his first inaugural address given back in 1861 and rings true, especially after last Wednesday's riots.

305
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,579
We are not enemies, but friends.

306
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,663
We must not become, we must not be enemies.

307
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:30,658
Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.

308
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,462
Let us all please remember that, united we stand, divided we fall.

309
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:39,682
Thank you.

310
00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:45,525
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

311
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:47,406
Mayor?

312
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:48,786
Member Rousseau.

313
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:51,567
Oh, actually, I apologize.

314
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:52,768
I'm too early for what I wanted to say.

315
00:26:56,173 --> 00:27:06,397
Number two, we have a COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update given by nurse supervisor, Ms.

316
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:10,178
Toni Rae and Medford Board of Health director, Ms.

317
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:14,259
Marianne O'Connor, as well as Mr. David Murphy.

318
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,821
Hi, this is Marianne.

319
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:24,263
I think I'll let Toni go first on the school update and then we'll go into the community update if that's okay.

320
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:25,433
Sounds great.

321
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:26,434
Sounds great.

322
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:31,375
Good evening, Mayor, Superintendent and members of school committee in the community.

323
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:39,458
I'm going to give a summation of the COVID activity in our schools between December 22nd and January 10th.

324
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:50,182
Medford Public Schools tested 900 students and staff on Tuesday, December 22nd, and we reported two positive student cases from that testing.

325
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,783
On that date, there were no staff that tested positive.

326
00:27:55,033 --> 00:28:06,661
Between December 23rd, the start of the holiday vacation, and January 10th, we've reported 79 positive COVID cases to the Department of Education.

327
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:11,665
This is very consistent with the activity that is going on in the community.

328
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:22,593
All the cases received follow-up instructions about isolation procedures and quarantine procedures for their close contacts from our school nurse contact tracers.

329
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:29,534
The 79 cases included 16 staff members and 63 students.

330
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:37,579
I have two reminders that I would like to make about the COVID testing that starts again this week.

331
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:47,360
Please do not send your child or if you are a staff person, do not come for testing if you are showing any illness symptoms.

332
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:57,865
Ill children and staff and families are advised to call their primary care physicians or go to a stop the spread testing site if you're feeling ill.

333
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:08,963
Also, as we resume hybrid learning, I want to remind our community to stay home from school if you feel ill with any symptoms.

334
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:20,146
This applies to staff and students, and our ability to reduce COVID transmission within the schools is very dependent upon keeping the illness out.

335
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:24,228
So we would like everybody to do their part in achieving this.

336
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:24,928
Thank you.

337
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,450
Thank you, Ms.

338
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:29,690
Ray.

339
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:32,911
Ms.

340
00:29:33,011 --> 00:29:33,652
O'Connor?

341
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,092
Yeah, it's Marian O'Connor.

342
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:37,853
That's okay, I can go with the community update right now.

343
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:50,817
So to follow up with what Tony has said, so as the superintendent had already stated earlier, we are definitely in a surge.

344
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:58,640
You know, regardless of the public health warnings and headings of not gathering for the holidays and not traveling

345
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,972
Unfortunately, we are in a search.

346
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:08,555
So since 1223, which I believe was the break from school to today at 530, we've had 720 cases in the community.

347
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:11,176
So that's 720 cases in 20 days.

348
00:30:11,196 --> 00:30:13,097
However, I did break them down.

349
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:32,431
And looking at the school age population, like Tony said, out of those 720, I went from zero to 19.

350
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:40,073
All right, and then I can break that down more for you, but from zero to 19 out of the 720, there's 97 cases.

351
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,935
If you wanna look at just the five-year-olds,

352
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:52,774
So the 19-year-olds, that's four, two, three, four, sorry.

353
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,717
That's 77 cases.

354
00:30:56,758 --> 00:31:03,604
So as Tony said, school-aged folks, I did include 19-year-olds.

355
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:04,444
There were 31.

356
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,087
If you take out the 19-year-olds, there were four of them.

357
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:11,590
So there's only 31 in the 15 to 18-year-old category.

358
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,211
So anyways,

359
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:19,708
So it's a small percentage is my point, I guess, what I'm trying to get at out of the 720.

360
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:27,091
Really the majority of our cases were the 20 and 30 year olds, again, as we had been seeing previously.

361
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:34,535
I do wanna thank the school nurses for all their help over the break, especially for the contact tracing.

362
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:40,158
They've been incredible as far as following up with all the students and children and their families.

363
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:41,959
Obviously not all of those,

364
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:47,713
school-aged kids were Medford school children.

365
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:52,115
There are certainly some private schools involved as well.

366
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:58,918
But as you know, and you probably have seen last week's report from the state put us in the red.

367
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,000
And we knew that was coming.

368
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:09,443
We're at a 5.56% positivity rate now according to the state data.

369
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:11,204
And we're expecting that'll probably

370
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:14,778
be close to the same this week as well.

371
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:20,341
And there were 520 cases reported during that time period.

372
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:24,323
So we're in a search.

373
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:30,526
Unfortunately, we expected this with the holidays, which is why we delayed the opening a bit.

374
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:32,627
And I'm glad that we're testing this week.

375
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:38,430
It's gonna be interesting to see what and how many we catch.

376
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,651
Most of this that we've seen in the community

377
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:42,949
has been household spread.

378
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:55,276
It's mostly, you know, you'll see it two, three, four, five, even six people within a household are getting, are becoming positive.

379
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,478
And that's what a lot of these cases are.

380
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:00,219
It's really a lot of household spread.

381
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,282
Once it's in the house, like we've seen before, it seems to spread pretty rapidly.

382
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:11,954
Other than that, I'm happy to announce that we are doing our first responder testing this Thursday.

383
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:22,801
We are in a regional effort with Malden, Melrose, Wakefield, Stoneham, and Winchester to vaccinate our first responders, police, fire, and EMS.

384
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:30,126
The first one kicking off right here at the Medford Police Station, Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon.

385
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:34,809
And also happy to say that all of our school nurses are included

386
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:55,496
in that program because they are COVID facing, because they are doing the surveillance testing, because they're involved in the surveillance testing and anyone involved with that as far as, you know, the helpers or management people there that anyone COVID facing is allowed to be vaccinated, which is great.

387
00:33:55,576 --> 00:34:01,439
So all of our school nurses will be receiving their first vaccination if they haven't already due to other,

388
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:06,187
duties will be receiving it Thursday.

389
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:07,507
So that's terrific.

390
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:13,851
K through 12 workers, teachers, are slated by the state.

391
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:18,833
And again, we are at the mercy of the state as far as when we get vaccine and when we're able to vaccinate.

392
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:25,036
But they are in the state's plan for phase two of K through 12.

393
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:32,320
They are actually second in line in phase two, right behind the 75 plus and folks with two comorbidities.

394
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,372
So we will be working to get that done as well.

395
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,936
And I'm sure I'll be working with Tony and the school nurses to accomplish that, much like we've done the testing.

396
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:49,241
So more to come on that as soon as we know, you'll know, but we are at the mercy of the state as far as information goes.

397
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:54,304
And that's expected around early February.

398
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:59,167
So again, so happy to take any questions, thoughts, concerns.

399
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:07,814
Mayor, before we go to questions, could we just touch upon our testing program and how we're gonna be rolling that out over the next couple of weeks?

400
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:13,538
That'd be great if you could give the dates and in case any parents are watching, that'd be much appreciated.

401
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:14,098
Thank you.

402
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:14,939
Sure.

403
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:28,888
So as the school committee knows, and I know many in the community are familiar, we have been running staff testing throughout the district since September on a weekly basis and began student testing in November.

404
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:42,795
We've been working over the past couple of months with the Department of Education and other partners, including Tufts University, to talk through what we're doing in the Medford public schools.

405
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:51,977
And we were recognized by Commissioner Riley last week as one of the districts that have been out front with regard to our testing.

406
00:35:51,997 --> 00:35:57,998
That is in large measure due to all the work that Tony and Marianne have been reporting on.

407
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:08,137
to the committee over the past couple of weeks and that their teams have been involved in throughout each school over the course of the past several months.

408
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:26,132
And we will be speaking with other districts across the Commonwealth tomorrow in a webinar to talk a little bit about what our experiences have been with respect to testing and what we are anticipating with our continued testing over the next several weeks and several months.

409
00:36:26,904 --> 00:36:34,430
And as has been communicated several times, including in correspondence that went to all staff and all families today from Ms.

410
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,595
Ray, we will do re-entry testing tomorrow from 1 p.m.

411
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:41,656
till 5 p.m.

412
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:52,584
at all schools, with the exception of the Curtis Tufts, but that school community has been given a specific communication and instructions as to how their staff and students can get their tests.

413
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:55,874
But with that exception, all schools 1 p.m.

414
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:56,854
till 5 p.m.

415
00:36:57,294 --> 00:37:13,617
for cohorts A, high-need, most vulnerable students, cohort C, students who typically attend in-person instruction on Thursdays and Fridays, and all Medford Public Schools staff, consistent with the testing that they have done, as I said, since September.

416
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:22,479
Cohort B students will have the opportunity to receive their reentry tests on Friday, January 15th,

417
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:24,038
from 1 p.m.

418
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:24,919
till 5 p.m.

419
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,940
That is again at all schools.

420
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:39,226
And then we will continue with our regularly scheduled weekly testing on Tuesday, January 19th, following the holiday, and pick that up again going forward.

421
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:48,871
As of right now, we anticipate the transition to pooled testing to happen on the week of January 26th.

422
00:37:50,349 --> 00:38:03,420
So we'll have two more weeks, including the re-entry testing that takes place this week, and our regular testing that takes place next week, our individualized testing, and then we'll switch to the pooled testing the week of January 26th.

423
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,901
That's our plan as of right now.

424
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:18,553
With respect to pooled testing, and we'll be communicating a lot of that out to families and staff, there is very little difference, as we were discussing with our administrators today, at the initial point of collection

425
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,672
with regard to individual testing and pool testing.

426
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:31,659
The difference comes in what happens in the follow-up after that, where individual in a pool or a pool test positive.

427
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:43,427
And what that means is for anyone who hasn't followed this closely, and they can absolutely understand why you may not have, a pool testing means all of the swabs going into one vial.

428
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,089
They are then tested together.

429
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,351
And if there is positivity,

430
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:59,783
identified within that pool, the entire pool is contacted and given directions as to how to go about getting a follow-up test on the following day.

431
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:11,011
And the protocols are for that pool to be quarantined up and until they receive their negative test, which again, there'll be a designated follow-up testing location.

432
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:15,294
We call it the reflex testing that will take place on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

433
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,830
following our Tuesdays and Fridays.

434
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:30,320
That's why we established Tuesdays and Fridays as our testing days because we have a remote day on Wednesday and obviously the weekend on Saturday to give people that window of time to get their follow-up tests.

435
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:41,308
There are some specifics from an operational perspective that we still need to work out with regard to the location of the designated testing spot for the reflex testing and exactly how that's gonna play out.

436
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:44,910
And those are conversations that we're gonna continue to have over the coming days

437
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:54,866
But for our community members, there are no implications for the next two weeks, because we're just going to continue doing the same testing program that we've done over the last several months.

438
00:39:55,326 --> 00:40:03,810
And when we iron out those final details as to where to send people when a pool tests positive, that's something that we'll be communicating out broadly.

439
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:10,153
Just in terms of final reminders, we still want to get to 100% with regard to consent forms.

440
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:15,415
I think the superintendent, Tony, and I were pleased when

441
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:33,113
We were on a conference call with a couple of other district representatives, districts that don't need to be named, and our consent form intake was at a higher percentage than some of the others on the call, but we're not at 100% and we're hopeful that we'll be able to get there in the coming days.

442
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:37,415
Great, thank you very much.

443
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:39,075
Member Russo?

444
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:42,757
Thank you.

445
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,722
A couple of questions and then there's also several emails, but I'll let those come after everybody else has spoken.

446
00:40:49,502 --> 00:40:57,184
I know that you're still working out the logistics around the reflex testing when somebody in a pool is positive.

447
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:08,348
I'm just wanna be, what I'm hearing that has been worked out is that we are depending on families on a Wednesday or over the weekend to go get their kid tested.

448
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:11,449
And I don't, you know,

449
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:15,146
It's concerning because some families may not do that or be able to do that.

450
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:22,548
But my question is, let's say there are 10 people in the pool test, one of them is positive.

451
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:31,431
Are we allowing those 10 people back before they have all, if one of those families does not go get a reflex test, are they allowed back in our building?

452
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:41,234
So under the protocols, Mr. Rousseau, the answer would be no, that if they're part of a pool and have not yet shown a negative test as part of the reflex testing,

453
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:45,303
the expectation is that they would not come back into the building.

454
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:59,026
Now, while the protocol is to get tested the following day, most, although not all students, would not be due in for another five days.

455
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:07,828
It's a little more challenging with staff, and obviously with the Cohort A students, the expectation is they're back on Thursday.

456
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,789
And I think that is,

457
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,651
It is absolutely one of the downsides of the pool testing, I think.

458
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:25,873
The rationale to the pool testing for both the district and the state is sustainability, that it is dramatically different in terms of the financial resources.

459
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:40,115
And we are, one of the reasons we haven't ironed out, finalized those details, and one of the reasons that we will in the near future need to make a strategic decision as to whether to participate in the program that DESE is constructing is that

460
00:42:40,653 --> 00:42:46,094
we want it to be as easy as possible for our families to get the reflex testing.

461
00:42:46,674 --> 00:42:58,477
And so if the DESI program, and again, we've been advised on multiple occasions that the DESI program is still trying to work out some details, and that's why it's unclear whether we would essentially want to volunteer to participate or not.

462
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:09,380
But what we'll be looking for to make that determination is whether it is operationally set up to be as less of a burden as possible for families

463
00:43:10,178 --> 00:43:15,580
for several reasons, but one of them is what you're identifying as a downside to pool testing.

464
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:23,243
And just to interject, and I know I may be stating the obvious, this is Marianne.

465
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:29,186
If there's a positive pool, it doesn't mean there could be more than one positive in that pool, right?

466
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,687
It doesn't mean that there's just one, there could be two, three.

467
00:43:31,827 --> 00:43:37,449
So it is really important that everyone gets that follow-up testing.

468
00:43:41,136 --> 00:43:41,936
Member van de Kloot?

469
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:44,938
Oh, just unmute.

470
00:43:46,478 --> 00:43:50,200
How many people are in the pool or expected to be in the pool?

471
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:54,602
At least eight, and we think 10.

472
00:43:55,442 --> 00:44:00,864
That is one of the things that scientists are discussing in their laboratory right now.

473
00:44:01,244 --> 00:44:07,407
And as the technology improves, there's potential for more swabs in the vial.

474
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:12,509
which would be great because that's less of a budgetary impact, obviously.

475
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:20,594
But typically, those who are working on the technology and the science behind this right now are using a window of eight to 10 swabs in a vial.

476
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:22,035
Thank you.

477
00:44:22,235 --> 00:44:24,376
Standing is 10 is the max at this point.

478
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:27,318
Member Graham?

479
00:44:31,781 --> 00:44:32,661
Unmute yourself, Jenny.

480
00:44:32,781 --> 00:44:33,862
Member Graham, please.

481
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,381
Sorry, I thought I did that.

482
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:47,126
When you talk about pooling folks, has there been discussion about pooling siblings in the same pool?

483
00:44:48,467 --> 00:45:05,276
I know that's obviously can't be done like cross building, but is there a way to pool families within a building so that at least they're not sort of getting potentially snared by multiple pools?

484
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:22,475
Yeah, so we've looked at, we've had a few different discussions about whether our cohorting of students should have any relation to the cohorting that takes place when the testing is pooled.

485
00:45:23,216 --> 00:45:32,783
And generally speaking, everyone, and when I say we, I'm talking about some of the folks on this call, but also the conversations that we're having with other districts.

486
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:49,785
some of the partners that are involved in developing the technology and the partners that are involved in operationalizing this, which it was their advocacy in part that built the conversation with DESI that is responsible for the program that's being rolled out across the Commonwealth now.

487
00:45:50,386 --> 00:46:02,595
And the prevailing view right now is that the efficiency cost to trying to do anything other than putting the eight swabs in a vial

488
00:46:03,665 --> 00:46:05,606
is essentially not worth it.

489
00:46:06,146 --> 00:46:12,408
That particularly with the virus rates being what they are, that we're better off.

490
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:22,790
And what I mean by that, frankly, is that while we are in the midst of a surge and that the numbers are high, our in-school transmission is low enough in which we can operationalize pool testing.

491
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:32,213
But part of that is essentially putting the eight to 10 swabs in a vial, filling up as many vials as possible, and then getting the vials out the door to get tested.

492
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:55,001
the time that would be lost by trying to coordinate and the potential cost of unfilled vials that aren't filled to the maximum capacity is considered to outweigh the potential convenience that would be enjoyed by families if everyone was together.

493
00:46:55,902 --> 00:46:56,923
The other thing I would say is

494
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:03,523
Well, it is not true that if a sibling has COVID, everyone in the household must.

495
00:47:03,564 --> 00:47:04,524
We know that, obviously.

496
00:47:05,004 --> 00:47:12,306
Most of us have had one experience or another where that's been demonstrated, where somehow people, despite living in the same household, don't spread it around.

497
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:27,931
If they're in the same school, and we wouldn't be talking about this if they're not, and they're coming from the same household, there is an increased chance that they're going to be positive, which means that the pools, their families are going to be dealing with the same challenge and the same problem.

498
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:35,740
So the answer is it's been thought about that there are some upsides, but not probably not worth it.

499
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,882
Okay, that makes sense.

500
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:40,723
Thanks for that answer.

501
00:47:40,743 --> 00:47:48,748
And you also said earlier that our participation is good, but it is not 100%.

502
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:51,310
What percent is it?

503
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:51,510
It is...

504
00:47:58,021 --> 00:48:00,822
within the vicinity of 80% consent forms.

505
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:07,246
And I would want to go back and look at numbers that have come in over the last few days.

506
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:09,107
We're not getting a lot of consent forms.

507
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:10,788
We're fully remote right now.

508
00:48:13,469 --> 00:48:17,331
But I would like to get back to it.

509
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:18,271
It's in the vicinity of 80%.

510
00:48:18,892 --> 00:48:21,373
I can say on a conference call with Desi, I said it was 80%.

511
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:25,295
And then as that was being heralded, it occurred to me that maybe I wanted

512
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:29,615
get the exact number, but it is very close to 80%.

513
00:48:30,195 --> 00:48:30,435
Okay.

514
00:48:30,515 --> 00:48:32,456
It may be over, it may be over.

515
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:36,898
Yeah, and it was over 1,700 students have signed up, and Ms.

516
00:48:36,918 --> 00:48:41,940
Frey just quote me from around four to 500 teachers or staff, or 450 or so.

517
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,320
400 to 450 staff.

518
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:42,480
Okay.

519
00:48:49,585 --> 00:49:03,194
And has there been discussion across districts or with other superintendents about making this kind of testing mandatory as a condition for in-person learning?

520
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:05,455
And what's your thinking about that?

521
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:08,037
So there has been discussion.

522
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:09,738
I think that discussion is going to continue.

523
00:49:09,758 --> 00:49:14,981
I think the problem that we and other districts have run into is that families

524
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:20,293
it's very hard to impose a condition ex post facto.

525
00:49:21,014 --> 00:49:42,270
And while we do have the remote learning option that is available, and we are currently not structured to withstand a disproportionate influx of remote learners into all of our remote learning settings, particularly at the elementary level.

526
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,071
And so given that we,

527
00:49:45,633 --> 00:50:02,287
I think it would be really hard to halfway through a school year impose that type of, when we logistically can't necessarily offer an alternative option and excluding students on this basis on such short notice, I think is definitely not viable.

528
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:13,297
So I think that, I do think that it is conversation we will need to have this spring and over the summer, depending on where we are with the virus going into next school year.

529
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:27,668
when all options are back on the table and families can make potential, you know, we can first determine what decisions the district and the Commonwealth are gonna provide the families or what options rather, and then make sure that families have all the information available to them.

530
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:40,832
And that's certainly not a, you know, we didn't have this information, we didn't have, some of these testing strategies weren't even developed at the time that schools were making learning, you know, plans and providing options to families.

531
00:50:40,852 --> 00:50:42,552
So I think that's, that is the,

532
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:47,195
hesitancy as to whether to wrestle that particular issue.

533
00:50:48,276 --> 00:50:58,666
And in the in the lieu of that wrestling match, we have been pushing strongly encouraging and asking principals to continue that dialogue with their families.

534
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:05,892
Because while we certainly want to provide this opportunity for people to stay healthy, this is really a public health

535
00:51:06,932 --> 00:51:08,413
obligation that we all have.

536
00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:13,635
It is not so much about testing, because this is actually one of the sort of interesting conundrums of testing.

537
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:15,535
It's not really about keeping you safe.

538
00:51:15,595 --> 00:51:19,217
By the time the swab goes into your nose, you either have it or you don't.

539
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:23,599
And so this is about a community responsibility that we all have to one another.

540
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:29,601
And I think that's something that they'll write really interesting articles about in the future.

541
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:32,650
Yeah, absolutely.

542
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:47,427
I if for those who are listening, I, I can't request strongly enough that everyone participate in this program like we are so lucky to have this program in Medford, I get emails every day from school committees across the state that.

543
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:58,353
They have to go full remote because they just can't figure out, they can't isolate how their case counts are happening, where it's happening in schools.

544
00:51:58,373 --> 00:52:02,174
And they just have no choice but to make these really broad brush decisions.

545
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:09,097
And I think we've been really lucky here that we can make really targeted decisions about this.

546
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:13,719
And if you haven't signed up for testing yet, please do it.

547
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,260
it is life-saving.

548
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,461
It may not save your life, but it may save somebody else's life.

549
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:22,801
So please seriously consider that.

550
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:26,162
And then the last question that I have.

551
00:52:26,262 --> 00:52:33,263
I just want to say thank you for echoing that because, you know, the principals know this.

552
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:42,985
We have, and teachers as well, been looking at every sort of communication avenue and sort of trying to identify

553
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:50,296
who's the best messenger and how do we sort of really craft that message in a way where people can understand the importance of it.

554
00:52:50,436 --> 00:52:56,239
And I think we all greatly appreciate you, all members of the testing family.

555
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:03,744
And then my last question about testing is whether cohort D families can test this week.

556
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:05,806
And the answer to that is no.

557
00:53:06,506 --> 00:53:10,909
And that goes to the sort of public element that we were talking about.

558
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:27,853
I think this district and the municipal government and all other community entities would love to provide this, but from a financial perspective, while I think our testing program has run well, I think we've done a good job, we've also been patching it together.

559
00:53:28,474 --> 00:53:36,700
And one of the key variables that has changed, that is changing this week and going forward is a partnership that Ms.

560
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,641
Ray cultivated with

561
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:58,446
some higher ed institutions and a large influx of volunteer student nurses who are helping us to staff this and execute this, which we know other districts, even in response to Dessie's rollout of this program, have been unable to, they've been unable to do because they just don't have the personnel needs.

562
00:53:59,471 --> 00:54:02,934
We don't necessarily, up until this point, we haven't necessarily had the personnel either.

563
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:09,259
We've just told a bunch of other people who typically do other stuff that they now work the testing registration desk.

564
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:22,890
And I think it's been heartening to see the extent to which people have been willing to dive in and take this up as an unexpected responsibility that everyone in the organization has.

565
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,994
And I think that without that partnership that Tony's developed, there would be real questions about the sustainability.

566
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:30,646
Awesome, thank you.

567
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:32,667
Dr. Edward-Vincent?

568
00:54:33,628 --> 00:54:47,634
Yes, I just wanted to take this moment also to thank you, the school committee, for your support during this entire journey because we were kind of one of the districts that was the first one out of the gate.

569
00:54:48,694 --> 00:54:50,856
So thanking you for your leadership with that.

570
00:54:51,496 --> 00:55:00,484
We have been kind of quietly tapped on the shoulder by Desi, which Mr. Murphy alluded to.

571
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:04,086
Tomorrow we will be part of a webinar with other districts.

572
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:21,772
talking about the work that we have been doing here in Medford and how it's working for us to be able to help other districts think differently and how were we able to do it because it was a tremendous feat.

573
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,555
And so just in this moment, I want to thank

574
00:55:26,517 --> 00:55:29,278
our nursing supervisor, Tony Ray.

575
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:31,039
It's seven days a week.

576
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,860
I get texts over the weekend.

577
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,461
Maryann O'Connor texting me as well from the Board of Health on the city side.

578
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:47,005
And, you know, Mr. Murphy and his team, this was, no one thought that this would be such a huge

579
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:56,411
task and undertaking, but we prioritize safety, equity, and consistency, and testing fell under the bucket.

580
00:55:57,031 --> 00:56:01,034
And so we're continuing to prioritize that to the best of our ability.

581
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:05,798
So I just want to thank you, the school committee, the mayor, the city side for their support of

582
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:19,687
paying for the testing the partnership with Tufts, but really I just want to say thank you because now the other districts that have found themselves with no choice but to have to shut down or no way to contact trace.

583
00:56:20,538 --> 00:56:24,159
They did not have a system in place to remain open.

584
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:32,543
So I just wanted to let you know that we are doing what very, very few districts have been able to do.

585
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:48,409
And they're now asking us to share what we've learned, our best practices to help other districts strategize and be able to come up with it, come up with something for their respective communities.

586
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:56,555
So I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's been helping with the testing and keeping our community safe.

587
00:56:58,356 --> 00:57:01,338
Thank you Dr. Edward-Vinson for all your hard work as well.

588
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:03,019
It does not go unnoticed.

589
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:04,640
It's definitely a team effort.

590
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:14,007
If I may ask a question, I think everybody, can you give some logistics about this Tuesday and Friday testing?

591
00:57:14,552 --> 00:57:17,994
just any questions, little questions that have come in that maybe we can clear up.

592
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:29,039
For example, if I'm a mom and I have somebody in elementary school, middle school, and high school, do I go to all three locations or can I get them all tested in one place?

593
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:33,321
What are we looking at for where, are we ready for having lines to

594
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:37,363
have people waiting and then we're going to wait outside, kids on the playgrounds.

595
00:57:37,923 --> 00:57:48,347
If we could just kind of talk through anything that you're hearing and maybe answer those two questions, that will be helpful for all those who are listening and getting ready to pack the kids in car or walk to get their kids tested.

596
00:57:48,787 --> 00:57:51,028
And when they do, they can go to one location.

597
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:54,430
The siblings have been specifically identified.

598
00:57:55,050 --> 00:58:00,892
So if you have children in multiple schools, you can choose the one that's most convenient.

599
00:58:01,548 --> 00:58:07,531
and they should be able to get tested in whatever school you go to.

600
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:18,377
If there are other specific exceptions to that, I would just ask that you email your school nurse or principal.

601
00:58:18,637 --> 00:58:20,698
They'll pass those on to us.

602
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:26,681
So generally speaking, we want people to go to their home schools that they attend.

603
00:58:27,222 --> 00:58:29,723
That's for crowd control purposes, occupancy,

604
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:36,541
keeping the lines are set up and the signage is out to make sure that we don't have any overcrowding.

605
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:47,346
I would suspect that in history is sort of borne out over this testing program that people participating in COVID testing like to get there early.

606
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:56,031
And so it's probably more likely that there'll be lines in the earlier part of the one to 5pm window than at the later part.

607
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:56,311
So

608
00:58:56,945 --> 00:58:59,706
If that's a concern, I would encourage you to go between 3 p.m.

609
00:58:59,726 --> 00:59:05,989
and 5 p.m., and then you can let me know if I was wrong about that, but that's been the case every week pretty much since September.

610
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:12,692
Again, if you have children in multiple schools, you can choose one and go there.

611
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:24,017
Some of the testing stations have been moved from their normal locations to be closer to exits and entrances, so you can come and go more easily.

612
00:59:25,852 --> 00:59:32,537
it is possible, as I said, that the line might extend outdoors in some for purposes of maintaining the six feet of distance.

613
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:38,220
But I think that should be probably only at the beginning and not too common.

614
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,701
Thank you.

615
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:42,143
Thank you, Ms.

616
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:42,383
Ray.

617
00:59:42,884 --> 01:00:02,093
Yes, I just also wanted to remind parents that students who are in middle school and high school have been self swabbing during their testing and they should be able to enter the buildings by themselves so that we don't have an over occupancy between students and their parents.

618
01:00:03,694 --> 01:00:05,295
These students are used to doing that.

619
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:09,257
They know the routine and they should move through the process pretty quickly.

620
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:39,057
And if I could just add really quickly to that, because this is the part of what we're gonna talk about with the rest of the state tomorrow, of all the things that the district has done well in this, and I think Tony spoke to the numbers and the level of participation, which is really good in and of itself, but the efficiency with which each school community has organized themselves, and then with Tony's staff and their own have executed this,

621
01:00:40,062 --> 01:01:04,308
I think is in some ways, one of the more pleasant surprises, not that we didn't expect people would be able to be efficient or they would, obviously they would be trying, but we're moving students, large cohorts of students in and out of the testing station in a matter of just a few minutes, which both ensures, I think in some respects, better participation, but importantly, it prevents the school day

622
01:01:04,801 --> 01:01:07,722
from becoming all about the COVID test.

623
01:01:07,762 --> 01:01:15,364
And that was one of the concerns that some of us had going in that most of these students are only in two days a week to begin with.

624
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:22,306
And we didn't want to reduce the instructional day to just time spent in line waiting to get your COVID test.

625
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,047
Because the point of the COVID test is to stay in school.

626
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:30,168
And then if you don't even get to class, then what was the point of coming to school to begin with?

627
01:01:30,328 --> 01:01:33,129
And we've done a really, really good job at that.

628
01:01:33,894 --> 01:01:39,459
And so to the principals and the nurses who have made that possible, I think we owe them a big debt of gratitude.

629
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,943
But to that point, I guess this is why I started saying this.

630
01:01:44,803 --> 01:01:53,330
For parents, particularly from sixth grade and up, it would be great if you stayed in the car because that will reduce the chance that anyone has to stand in line outside in the cold.

631
01:01:56,453 --> 01:01:57,154
Thank you very much.

632
01:01:57,534 --> 01:01:58,575
Member Russo.

633
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:00,445
Thank you.

634
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:05,787
Um, I have, uh, if there, uh, did other members have questions just cause I have a couple of emails.

635
01:02:06,647 --> 01:02:08,488
I'm sorry.

636
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:22,653
I know it's short notice, but if there's any way you could do a reverse call, because I think that's a great information that parents shouldn't, I was planning on going in with Nevin and Rowan to the Andrews.

637
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:23,973
So I think that's great.

638
01:02:24,013 --> 01:02:28,355
If someone could put out a call that grade six through 12, the parents can wait in their car.

639
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:31,113
just because of the numbers in the building.

640
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:33,894
I don't know if that's too short notice to get a call out.

641
01:02:34,174 --> 01:02:39,616
Well, I think it might be worth doing a call tomorrow, one more call tomorrow morning, just to get people out generally.

642
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:45,739
We did one this evening in which we said K to five parents should accompany their students.

643
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:47,919
Obviously the inference being six to 12.

644
01:02:47,959 --> 01:02:57,183
To be honest, that was worded intentionally because for some parents, if they feel strongly that they would like to be with their child when they test, we're not prohibiting it.

645
01:02:57,695 --> 01:03:00,856
and we want to leave that option available.

646
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:07,499
But I think emphasizing that point that secondary students can come in on their own, I think that's fine.

647
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:09,259
And I think another robo call tomorrow.

648
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:14,701
I don't know that we need to do another letter because we've already done several, but I think a robo call tomorrow morning would be appropriate.

649
01:03:14,841 --> 01:03:15,902
And I'm sure we can do that.

650
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:20,564
Thank you.

651
01:03:21,124 --> 01:03:22,404
Maybe we can add in there.

652
01:03:22,905 --> 01:03:23,945
Yep, and just add them.

653
01:03:24,465 --> 01:03:27,628
If you have multiple children in multiple schools, you can test at one location.

654
01:03:28,268 --> 01:03:30,029
That wasn't today, but we'll put it in tomorrow.

655
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,130
Oh, thank you.

656
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:32,411
Member Rousseau?

657
01:03:33,452 --> 01:03:33,792
Thank you.

658
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:39,097
This is an email from Jane Hamill on Maynard Street in Medford.

659
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:46,563
As we all watch with horror at our increasing infections, I have been so grateful about the testing program at the schools.

660
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,224
Thank you for making that happen.

661
01:03:48,907 --> 01:03:53,031
Is it possible to get information about participation rate and number of positives?

662
01:03:53,111 --> 01:04:10,306
I'm specifically interested in seeing the percent of students per cohort per school who have submitted their paperwork and percentage of students who actually participate any given week at the high school, since it is up to them to remember to go rather than the middle school where they are actually get called to do it.

663
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,849
And the number of positive cases identified per cohort.

664
01:04:15,243 --> 01:04:28,328
possible to get the information before school starts on the 14th and the 20th, and after that on an ongoing basis, such as every two weeks, it would help ease my family's concerns about heading back in during this surge.

665
01:04:29,389 --> 01:04:33,030
I will forward the specifics of that email since that was probably a lot to digest.

666
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:36,672
Yeah, I think most of that data can be and is readily available.

667
01:04:36,872 --> 01:04:44,295
I'm not sure that it's broken down exactly along the way the community member is asking for, but we can

668
01:04:44,628 --> 01:04:47,651
If you want to just forward it, Mr. Soto, we're happy to take a look at it.

669
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:51,534
We'll be able to provide whatever information we can.

670
01:04:53,636 --> 01:04:54,156
That'd be great.

671
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:54,536
Thank you.

672
01:04:54,717 --> 01:05:02,223
I do know that the committee has, I mean, in numerous meetings, we haven't made a motion per se, but we have asked, you know, for the percentage of students.

673
01:05:03,584 --> 01:05:11,190
I thought we had asked by grade level and school that had submitted their paperwork because I, Ms.

674
01:05:11,231 --> 01:05:12,832
Ray will know this number much quicker than

675
01:05:13,305 --> 01:05:25,378
I could do a Google search, but 80% is not a number that is considered acceptable to... My understanding before we began all this was it was 90, 92% or something.

676
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:28,080
That was really the number we needed to be safe.

677
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:35,488
And 80%, that's not anywhere near that, frankly.

678
01:05:38,322 --> 01:05:39,843
HAB-Masyn Moyer): I don't have a recall Tufts.

679
01:05:40,343 --> 01:05:44,765
HAB-Masyn Moyer): We Chris doors, the Tufts rep and he never meant.

680
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:48,967
He said, you want at least a large majority, but to be safe.

681
01:05:49,047 --> 01:05:54,090
I know I don't ever recall the 92% or 90% HAB-Danny Teodorusilo & Collin Mastodoni, Jr.:

682
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,491
: I would just, we're not satisfied with 80% either.

683
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:57,631
I'm also not.

684
01:05:57,711 --> 01:06:05,495
I'd love to do the math before I say that the number 80% anymore because it may be a little lower, maybe a little bit higher, but

685
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,535
we're not done collecting consent forms.

686
01:06:08,316 --> 01:06:20,404
And there are some issues related to the potential involvement with the DESE program that we're going to have to factor into our communications with regard to collection of additional consents.

687
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:31,192
But we haven't stopped, and we've used almost every communication opportunity we've had since the consent form was developed and the student testing began.

688
01:06:31,647 --> 01:06:33,208
and we'll continue to push that aggressively.

689
01:06:33,288 --> 01:06:37,610
So I don't want any of the members of the committee to think that we are boasting about 80%.

690
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:41,673
I guess I did say we were boasting about it, but that was compared to districts that were lower.

691
01:06:41,713 --> 01:06:48,096
So that was just in that moment, my Medford pride took over, I think, but the number, it needs to be higher.

692
01:06:48,116 --> 01:06:49,177
There's no doubt about that.

693
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:57,021
I have another email, Mayor, but I think Member McLaughlin's hands up.

694
01:06:57,662 --> 01:06:58,342
Member McLaughlin.

695
01:06:59,389 --> 01:06:59,829
Thank you.

696
01:06:59,969 --> 01:07:00,930
And thank you, Member Rousseau.

697
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,472
I wanted to respond regarding that email before we moved on.

698
01:07:04,373 --> 01:07:13,760
So if that information could be included in the bi-monthly reporting, that's what's being asked.

699
01:07:13,941 --> 01:07:22,908
But what I'm hearing is we're not asking for a motion specific to that date, but that will occur as part of the dashboard.

700
01:07:22,948 --> 01:07:23,648
Is that accurate?

701
01:07:24,529 --> 01:07:24,789
Yes.

702
01:07:24,809 --> 01:07:25,430
Looking forward.

703
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,332
That's right, because I'd like to read the email closely

704
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:32,606
to make sure that all of the information is information that we can provide.

705
01:07:32,626 --> 01:07:38,367
I mean, part of the challenges with this is that almost every number there is very, very fluid.

706
01:07:38,947 --> 01:07:55,750
And so our ability to incorporate new data and then publish it and keep, maintain its accuracy is not a light lift.

707
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,410
That's not how we do it.

708
01:07:57,918 --> 01:08:04,502
I just, before we make any sweeping commitments as to exactly how this data can be reported, I just want to look at it more closely.

709
01:08:04,943 --> 01:08:05,543
That'd be great.

710
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:20,954
So then I would ask that we make a motion that we put this on the agenda for the January 26th school committee meeting, just as a follow-up, if we could do that, Mr. Murphy, so that you could tell us what was workable, what wasn't, and how it will be reported out.

711
01:08:21,074 --> 01:08:21,974
That would be really helpful.

712
01:08:22,234 --> 01:08:22,455
Sure.

713
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:23,755
We can include that.

714
01:08:24,256 --> 01:08:24,956
Can I get a second?

715
01:08:25,196 --> 01:08:27,298
Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by

716
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:31,301
member Van de Kloot, roll call member McLaughlin?

717
01:08:31,721 --> 01:08:32,062
Yes.

718
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,444
Member Graham?

719
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:36,105
Yes.

720
01:08:37,426 --> 01:08:39,368
Member Kretz?

721
01:08:40,008 --> 01:08:40,188
Yes.

722
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,191
Member McLaughlin, yes.

723
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:44,031
Member Mustone?

724
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:44,592
Yes.

725
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:46,393
Member Rousseau?

726
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:47,514
Yes.

727
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,295
Member Van de Kloot?

728
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,159
She said yes, she's muted, yes.

729
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:53,619
Thank you.

730
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:55,040
Member, I mean, Mayor.

731
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:55,961
Yes.

732
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:02,284
Yes, so the affirmative zero and the negative, that would be placed on the January 25th agenda.

733
01:09:03,344 --> 01:09:03,724
Thank you.

734
01:09:07,787 --> 01:09:08,007
Thank you.

735
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:15,171
I actually just had a quick thought question of my own, actually not related to the emails.

736
01:09:15,211 --> 01:09:21,195
We are sending out the communications to seek parents to sign this.

737
01:09:21,976 --> 01:09:24,937
Are we also, are we receiving,

738
01:09:26,443 --> 01:09:28,864
affirmations that we will not be getting tested?

739
01:09:29,384 --> 01:09:31,325
Are we getting a positive declines?

740
01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:32,965
And are we collecting those?

741
01:09:33,425 --> 01:09:35,366
And if so, what do those look like?

742
01:09:35,386 --> 01:09:43,409
Because I'm worried about, you know, when my son was in elementary school, we got all of his notices once a year when we emptied his locker.

743
01:09:45,149 --> 01:09:52,752
And, you know, I just worry that, you know, do we have families who are still completely oblivious because we just are communicating with them in a way?

744
01:09:53,432 --> 01:09:55,773
And if we get a positive no,

745
01:09:56,509 --> 01:10:00,851
we can take them off the list and work the list of those that haven't responded directly.

746
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:04,253
But if it's hundreds of people, then it's much harder to work that list.

747
01:10:04,673 --> 01:10:06,294
So that's my question.

748
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:12,678
So there's a couple of different parts to this answer, member Rousseau, and I'll try to keep it brief.

749
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:20,682
The system works based on positive consent forms.

750
01:10:21,182 --> 01:10:21,302
So

751
01:10:25,783 --> 01:10:44,634
In the actual data system that essentially produces the vial that your test goes into, if a student who has either, we've got a note from mom and dad saying, nope, do not test my kid, or we just didn't get anything, the system just won't produce a vial to test.

752
01:10:45,355 --> 01:10:47,116
And therefore the student couldn't be tested.

753
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:53,540
We do have a record from

754
01:10:54,737 --> 01:11:04,179
all school communities in which there was an affirmative communication, as you say, saying, I don't want my child tested.

755
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:12,500
That doesn't have any impact in terms of the actual technology that permits the student to actually receive a test.

756
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:19,982
There've also been very, very few people who have volunteered that they don't want their child being tested.

757
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:22,502
So few in fact, that

758
01:11:22,966 --> 01:11:46,605
The note that we have in our own internal data systems, frankly, is so that when we get to a point where we've gotten a response from everyone, and we hope to, because we want to get 100% on that, the hope is that we can then engage with the family through the health services department to identify why it is they don't want to participate in the testing.

759
01:11:47,065 --> 01:11:52,610
And it is certainly the family's choice to go to the point that we spoke about earlier in response to Dr. Graham's question,

760
01:11:53,037 --> 01:11:54,638
about potentially making it compulsory.

761
01:11:55,819 --> 01:12:08,408
They do have the option to opt out, but given the implications for public health, I do think the district has a responsibility up to a certain point to inquire as to why that's the case.

762
01:12:08,508 --> 01:12:14,553
The family certainly has a right to hang up the phone and say, because I said no, that's certainly their right.

763
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:19,436
We certainly wouldn't suggest otherwise for the time being, but the hope is that,

764
01:12:20,352 --> 01:12:23,242
through a conversation, even those numbers could ultimately be reduced.

765
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,422
May I just follow up on what David had to say?

766
01:12:29,442 --> 01:12:45,309
I have fielded some of those emails and conversations myself, and oftentimes it's a parent or a student, especially an older student, who just doesn't understand the process and who has some unanswered question, like a fear about what it's going to mean.

767
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:53,172
And after the conversation, in many instances, we're able to gain the consent from the family.

768
01:12:53,508 --> 01:12:55,749
You know, they'll say, oh, that wasn't what I thought.

769
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:58,410
This sounds much easier, less invasive.

770
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:01,011
So yes, we, of course we agree to be tested.

771
01:13:01,592 --> 01:13:08,415
So the conversations are very worthwhile between the school nurses and the parents.

772
01:13:08,915 --> 01:13:15,278
Non-invasive has been some of the most persuasive words that we've used throughout this campaign.

773
01:13:18,619 --> 01:13:18,979
Thank you.

774
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,360
Member McLaughlin.

775
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:23,388
Thank you.

776
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:38,226
Yes, to that end I was interested very much in the data as well in terms of who is not offering consent and so has it, you know, is there a way that it can be made really clear to please you know in the robocalls and the communication.

777
01:13:39,307 --> 01:13:46,416
what have you, to let us know either way, one way or the other, yes or no, because we need to, you know, have that data, number one.

778
01:13:46,496 --> 01:13:52,864
So I think what we're hearing is, what I'm hearing as a parent anyway, is to please send in your consent form for

779
01:13:54,453 --> 01:14:18,428
your child to test and I'm not hearing if you don't want to test to let us know or you know if you have any questions to let us know and so I think that that's equally important because I think a lot of families probably just assume well if I don't respond they'll get that it's no and then it doesn't include that data set of people who like member Russo said you know whose notices are sitting in their kids mailbox uh email box or

780
01:14:19,308 --> 01:14:21,509
in their own spam folder or whatever it might be.

781
01:14:21,569 --> 01:14:23,789
So that data set I think is really important.

782
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:36,212
And is there a way that we're sort of cross-referencing if it is, you know, say 20%, so 500, 1,000 roughly, you know, students, you know, is there any cross-reference?

783
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:38,513
And my other, you know, real concern is,

784
01:14:39,594 --> 01:14:43,397
Again, would the data tell us anything about, you know, families of children with disabilities?

785
01:14:43,437 --> 01:15:03,494
So, for example, if there are a lot of children, you know, with disabilities that, you know, for whatever reason might need additional support in testing, whether it's from, you know, a specialized educator or somebody else that, you know, I'm sure that through the Arc of Mass or Northeast Arc or any of those organizations, this must be an ongoing issue for a lot of schools that

786
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:08,839
you know, they're individuals who just, you know, probably need some support, getting some testing.

787
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:24,113
So who they might be, and then also for any of our families who, you know, just what have you, either whether it's that, you know, there's situations at home or homelessness or they're not getting the message or whatever, how we can help with that situation.

788
01:15:24,173 --> 01:15:24,273
So

789
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:29,756
I guess I'm asking if there's any way to disaggregate the data a little bit more.

790
01:15:30,837 --> 01:15:36,441
And then also how we as school committee members can help get out the word for the testing.

791
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:43,645
Any suggestions that you might have, you know, other than obviously our own social media, but anything else that we can do, please give us some guidance.

792
01:15:43,746 --> 01:15:45,146
And then lastly,

793
01:15:47,029 --> 01:15:49,370
How are we making it very explicit to families?

794
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:54,453
Because my intention is to definitely say, please let the school know whether you do or do not want testing.

795
01:15:54,513 --> 01:15:55,774
It's not just whether you do.

796
01:15:56,855 --> 01:15:58,136
So how can we message that?

797
01:15:58,636 --> 01:16:02,398
Well, Member McLaughlin, if I could respond.

798
01:16:02,818 --> 01:16:12,624
I do think that there is some strategic consideration as to articulating too explicitly the opt-out

799
01:16:14,677 --> 01:16:16,298
option that is available to everyone.

800
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:18,979
As we said, it's not mandatory as of right now.

801
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:39,169
I think that the strategy we've employed so far is to communicate repeatedly so that there, I'm sure there are some consent forms that are still on backpacks or collars, proverbially speaking, but we want to reduce that by continuing to give the option to opt in as much as possible.

802
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:42,210
To be just really, really candid,

803
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:55,083
Part of the reason we only talk about opting in is because in the absence of making it mandatory, we don't, our hope is that, well, the point about if you have any questions, we certainly say that as well.

804
01:16:55,103 --> 01:17:11,230
We need to continue saying that because we want to answer every question possible, but we don't really want to plant the seeds of what might be a good idea, why it might be a good idea to opt out because our position as an organization is that there really isn't a good reason to opt out.

805
01:17:11,634 --> 01:17:28,124
And I know at a much more complicated level, this conversation takes place around vaccines and that when we legitimize an option that is contrary to public health, we are increasing the risk that people exercise that option that is contrary to public health.

806
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:37,669
And that is, frankly, there is a strategic implication for not talking too much about how you can say no if you want.

807
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:38,650
They certainly can.

808
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:43,794
and then they'll get a phone call from Tony and we'll try to talk them out of it, but they certainly have that right.

809
01:17:44,474 --> 01:17:51,815
But there is no sound basis to not participate in testing.

810
01:17:52,476 --> 01:17:56,216
And that is part of why we weigh the communications the way that we do.

811
01:17:56,496 --> 01:17:59,877
And that's just a question as to how the committee can help.

812
01:17:59,937 --> 01:18:08,499
I think that we are at each sort of threshold that we hit, we had the sort of initial, like try to get all the consent forms,

813
01:18:09,505 --> 01:18:12,726
in the days surrounding the Thanksgiving holiday, which wasn't ideal.

814
01:18:13,066 --> 01:18:15,326
And then we made a next push and we made some progress.

815
01:18:15,346 --> 01:18:19,648
Then we were collecting around a huge snowstorm that required canceling school two days.

816
01:18:19,968 --> 01:18:20,988
And then we had the holidays.

817
01:18:21,048 --> 01:18:27,209
And so like, as has been the case sort of with everything related to the pandemic, any challenge that we could think of eventually comes up.

818
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:28,270
We've still got an 80%.

819
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:32,271
We need to sort of regroup now and see where's that last gap.

820
01:18:32,611 --> 01:18:36,312
And I think we can put on specific strategies that the committee can help with.

821
01:18:38,892 --> 01:18:44,355
Thank you, and so is there a way, I appreciate that, and just as a follow-up, is there a way to disaggregate that data?

822
01:18:44,435 --> 01:18:47,096
So I would agree with you wholeheartedly, Mr. Murphy.

823
01:18:47,136 --> 01:18:51,799
I don't think that in the interest of public health, there's good reason to opt out at all.

824
01:18:51,919 --> 01:19:03,825
I just wanna make sure that families are being communicated with and that they understand, and I really appreciate Toni and her team following up to assuage people's concerns for people who do have concerns, because I think they're legitimate.

825
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:06,707
Certainly we know that there are children with anxiety and what have you,

826
01:19:07,227 --> 01:19:09,148
Again, the non-invasive piece is a big piece.

827
01:19:09,228 --> 01:19:13,791
We've had both the invasive and non-invasive tests, and it makes a big difference.

828
01:19:13,811 --> 01:19:18,414
Some families are willing to wait even longer in line for the non-invasive.

829
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:20,455
I'm certainly in that category.

830
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:21,936
So I understand that.

831
01:19:21,976 --> 01:19:31,242
But I guess also the question is, is there a way to disaggregate that data so that we can make sure that there aren't any patterns, anything that we need to make sure that we're having additional support for?

832
01:19:32,003 --> 01:19:32,403
Absolutely.

833
01:19:32,603 --> 01:19:36,926
We can incorporate that into the data we share at the next meeting in terms of

834
01:19:37,383 --> 01:19:40,506
what the percentages are within each cohorts and by schools.

835
01:19:40,886 --> 01:19:53,958
And while, again, we are very grateful to all the work that's happened at the school level to get the consent forms in, I will just use this as an opportunity to remind all principals who may be on the call that we will be disaggregating that data at the next school committee meeting.

836
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:58,242
And so if there's other efforts that we can lean into to get those consent forms up,

837
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:01,511
I think that would be great and we want to continue to do that.

838
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:20,144
And I just might add, sorry, and I just might add if there are patterns with, you know, students with disabilities or students that are English learners or, you know, other sort of specific patterns, there are certainly, at least in the special education community team meetings where, you know, this can be part of the team discussion and, you know, the coordinators can be

839
01:20:20,604 --> 01:20:21,265
ensuring that.

840
01:20:21,345 --> 01:20:27,049
So I think that there's a process that you know there could be there again if there's data that suggests there needs to be.

841
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:27,850
So thank you.

842
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:33,294
I think the answer is that we can definitely show that data and certainly early on there was a correlation.

843
01:20:33,314 --> 01:20:38,678
I think that gap is as narrowed but I think we can share it and we can put a spotlight on it.

844
01:20:43,222 --> 01:20:43,722
Thank you both.

845
01:20:44,443 --> 01:20:44,903
Member Russo.

846
01:20:46,617 --> 01:20:49,260
I have just one more email, I'll get that done.

847
01:20:50,021 --> 01:20:55,486
Hello, my name is Leticia Rocha at Mystic Valley Parkway.

848
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:59,210
I have the following questions regarding the public health updates provided.

849
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:02,193
How often will students and staff have access to testing?

850
01:21:02,828 --> 01:21:06,811
Medford is at the high risk level with 394 cases in just one week.

851
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:09,533
School transmission occurred with Brooks teachers.

852
01:21:10,154 --> 01:21:21,363
I am aware that there are multiple measures being looked at, but what are the levels of these metrics that would trigger remote only learning within a school district or just within a school or district wide?

853
01:21:21,783 --> 01:21:26,487
And how many weeks do we need to be in the red before action is taken by administrators or guides?

854
01:21:28,415 --> 01:21:35,642
So as the community member said, we did have a situation in which the school was moved into fully remote just prior to the holiday recess.

855
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:53,819
And as was communicated at the time, that was attributable one to a variety of conditions that we had not seen in any other schools at that time, specifically the rate of infection and the evidence of suspected in-school transmission.

856
01:21:55,143 --> 01:22:00,287
and also, frankly, the personnel implications of the number of quarantining that needed to occur.

857
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:06,912
So it was really those three variables that came together to require the Brooks School to go into remote.

858
01:22:07,733 --> 01:22:23,226
We've been, I think, pretty clear for some time now that there are essentially three buckets of data that are looked at to make those types of determinations, and none of them are dispositive in and of themselves.

859
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:35,841
meaning there is no one variable that if it were to change based on the number of weeks or the color code or the exact rate of transmission, that it's always looking at all of the circumstances, all of the variables.

860
01:22:36,681 --> 01:22:46,885
And when the conditions are such that it is not safe to be in school, then those actions are taken as they were at the Brooks.

861
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:51,067
And safe doesn't just mean potential virus transmission, it also means inability to function.

862
01:22:52,077 --> 01:22:57,199
which, you know, specifically, if you have a total number of people that are in quarantine, that becomes a necessity.

863
01:22:57,259 --> 01:23:21,209
But the three buckets are the readiness, which we're going to include personnel and infrastructure, the community rates and where we are with regard to the transmission rates, as Marianne spoke to earlier, and then what's happening within the school itself, which is really the one that, in the case of the Brooks, really put us over the line where it was necessary to move that school into full remote.

864
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:37,890
There isn't one single variable, and that's because all of this information is, again, it is so fluid, and all of those circumstances have to be taken into account with safety, consistency, and equity at the center of each equation that has to be looked at.

865
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:42,493
Thank you.

866
01:23:46,776 --> 01:23:47,216
Thank you, Ms.

867
01:23:47,276 --> 01:23:47,636
Ryan.

868
01:23:47,696 --> 01:23:48,057
Thank you, Ms.

869
01:23:48,097 --> 01:23:50,298
O'Connor, Mr. Murphy, for the presentation.

870
01:23:52,899 --> 01:23:59,660
Number three, we have a report about the highlights of the Andrews Middle School, Principal Michael Downs and Dr. Stephen Burnham.

871
01:24:01,521 --> 01:24:02,461
Good evening, everyone.

872
01:24:02,601 --> 01:24:08,642
First and foremost, happy new year to all of you and hope 2021 is a better year for you and your families.

873
01:24:09,763 --> 01:24:17,024
And to piggyback on the superintendent, you know, as someone who served 20 years to protect democracy, we need to protect ourselves.

874
01:24:17,684 --> 01:24:21,045
The message from the Andrews this whole year has been one of kindness,

875
01:24:21,795 --> 01:24:25,417
And now's the time more than ever to be kind to one another and to understand one another.

876
01:24:25,497 --> 01:24:28,618
And we'll continue that at the Andrews for this year as well.

877
01:24:28,718 --> 01:24:30,459
So again, happy new year to all of you.

878
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,501
It's fitting that Madeline Duggar Andrews is the first school this year.

879
01:24:35,782 --> 01:24:37,923
And Dr. Burnham, I am very happy to be here.

880
01:24:38,143 --> 01:24:40,364
And he's on the call if he wants to introduce himself quickly.

881
01:24:40,384 --> 01:24:44,206
Nice to meet you, everybody.

882
01:24:44,266 --> 01:24:45,046
I'm Dr. Burnham.

883
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:48,328
Nice to have you.

884
01:24:48,648 --> 01:24:48,928
Thank you.

885
01:24:49,382 --> 01:24:51,363
He took quickly to heart on that one.

886
01:24:54,186 --> 01:25:03,713
So, you know, as we start 2021, I like to take a minute to look back on this year as it started.

887
01:25:03,993 --> 01:25:09,797
And, you know, during a pandemic, you have to really look at what's gone on that is positive.

888
01:25:09,877 --> 01:25:12,880
And luckily for me, there's been a lot of positive things at the Andrews.

889
01:25:13,753 --> 01:25:18,857
The first thing I'd like to do is I really want to thank quite a few groups of people.

890
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:20,698
The first is the custodians.

891
01:25:21,919 --> 01:25:33,107
I can't tell you how many times they had to rearrange desk in every classroom and cafeteria and move this and move that and hang signs and little feet everywhere.

892
01:25:33,247 --> 01:25:35,989
And I really want to thank the custodians first and foremost.

893
01:25:36,709 --> 01:25:41,455
Because without them, you know, there's no way we can open up schools as well as we did.

894
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:44,318
I also really want to thank our nursing staff.

895
01:25:45,379 --> 01:25:55,971
You know, since we've been back in school, my nurse in particular, Nurse Hines, and those who have helped her, have really helped keep our protocols at the forefront.

896
01:25:56,899 --> 01:26:03,186
Whether it be social distancing, washing our hands, and of course, all the contact tracing and everything else.

897
01:26:03,246 --> 01:26:06,089
So I really want to thank those two first groups.

898
01:26:06,889 --> 01:26:11,895
And then our first true success this year, I would say, is our cohort A students.

899
01:26:12,755 --> 01:26:16,800
From the beginning of the year and from the beginning of when we were going to open up schools,

900
01:26:17,574 --> 01:26:22,997
The superintendent and central office have made it very clear that our cohort a students need to be in school.

901
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:39,348
And because of the teachers miss Sullivan and Mr Mr viscus and their pair professionals our cohort a students have come to school on a daily basis and have really been reintegrated back into school after so many months of being away and.

902
01:26:39,906 --> 01:26:42,529
Again, I really want to thank that group of teachers.

903
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:48,034
And I'm very happy for that group of students who were able to start right away or as soon as we could.

904
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:52,038
So that is our first true highlight when it comes to teaching and learning.

905
01:26:53,039 --> 01:27:00,205
And some other things that we'd like to share that I think are very important when it comes to being part of our community.

906
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:06,508
In November, we held a food drive to support local food pantries and the families of the Andrews.

907
01:27:06,528 --> 01:27:12,829
And this pandemic has not been away from us.

908
01:27:13,029 --> 01:27:14,950
This has affected some of our families.

909
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:19,531
We had families that donated winter coats, clothing, and gift cards.

910
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:25,193
Our own member, Mestone, did a little drive in her neighborhood with her clan.

911
01:27:25,253 --> 01:27:29,814
And they showed up with lots of food and lots of clothing items from their neighborhood.

912
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:50,132
Due to the tremendous generosity of the Andrews community, we were able to support several of our own families for the holiday season and give them hundreds of dollars in gift cards, provide winter coats for the caring closets in the district and in particular at the high school at the Medford Family Network, and thousands of food items to our local pantries.

913
01:27:50,993 --> 01:28:09,041
Additionally, there were several parents who stepped up to provide complete Thanksgiving meals to several of our families, and they wish to remain anonymous, but if they're on this, or they're listening, or they watch it later, from the bottom of my heart, I can't thank them enough for providing those meals for those families during that time.

914
01:28:10,362 --> 01:28:13,443
And then, of course, as the winter holiday season approached,

915
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:20,103
The Andrew staff, as they usually do, really steps up and we have a secret snowflake program.

916
01:28:20,923 --> 01:28:27,249
And this year they donated thousands of dollars and gifts and gift cards to our families of the injuries that were in need.

917
01:28:27,809 --> 01:28:31,552
The Rotary Club provided us hundreds of dollars and wagons gift cards as well.

918
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:39,895
And I could not be more grateful to not only my staff, but the community for helping us help others.

919
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:48,838
Again, it just shows you what a great city Medford is because people come together as Mustang Nation when other people really need it.

920
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:51,986
I really want to commend my clinical team.

921
01:28:52,686 --> 01:28:59,650
The pandemic has really shown that with a lot of our remote students, and even with hybrid, our students are in need.

922
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:16,798
And my clinical team, Elizabeth Tampton, Elizabeth Cooper, Tom Lynch, and Yvonne Santos have really done a great job in reaching out to families who are needing support during this time, and especially our students who are fully remote.

923
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:26,682
Before I go on, I would like Dr. Burnham to, if he could, to speak a little bit about another initiative that we are starting this year at the Andrews.

924
01:29:28,022 --> 01:29:28,903
Thank you, Mr. Downs.

925
01:29:29,023 --> 01:29:31,826
I promised it just like my introduction, this will be very brief.

926
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:41,636
I know that it's easy for us to stop and say, maybe this is not the best time to introduce something new to Medford Public Schools.

927
01:29:42,237 --> 01:29:49,244
But as we're looking at restorative practices, I think this is the perfect time to start to introduce them to Medford Public Schools.

928
01:29:50,517 --> 01:29:55,699
During the course of my doctoral research, I investigated numerous predictors of student success.

929
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:04,243
And by far, the number one predictor was how strongly a student rated their connection level to school.

930
01:30:04,923 --> 01:30:12,447
In other words, the stronger a student said their connection to school was, the more likely they are to be successful, both in and out of school.

931
01:30:13,347 --> 01:30:21,172
Now here we are in a moment of hybrid and remote learning, which severely impacts our ability to keep kids connected.

932
01:30:22,407 --> 01:30:26,810
The good thing about restorative practices is that it's all about student connections.

933
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:34,135
So I am very excited to be exploring how we might be able to bring some of this to the Andrews Middle School and to Medford Public Schools.

934
01:30:34,635 --> 01:30:44,421
We've begun talking about maybe trying to create a pilot program, which could unite the three secondary schools around some common restorative practices.

935
01:30:44,962 --> 01:30:48,864
And I look forward to investigating that and reporting more back out to you as we go along.

936
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:49,985
Thank you, Mr. Downs.

937
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:52,214
Thank you, Dr. Burnham.

938
01:30:53,735 --> 01:30:55,636
And I have two more things, if I may.

939
01:30:57,237 --> 01:31:00,920
One is that at the Andrews, we are gonna have our book club starting very soon.

940
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:09,305
Our book that we are starting the focus on is by Dr. Rick Wormelli, and the book is called, Fair isn't Always Equal.

941
01:31:09,746 --> 01:31:17,931
And through this book club, several staff members of the Andrews will be exploring different ways to look at assessments and at grading.

942
01:31:18,051 --> 01:31:20,353
And we find between that and restorative justice,

943
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:24,052
It's a good start to the new year for us at the Andrews.

944
01:31:25,037 --> 01:31:28,818
And last but definitely not least, I have to thank my staff.

945
01:31:29,799 --> 01:31:34,340
The Andrews teachers this year, we hit the ground running from day one.

946
01:31:35,321 --> 01:31:38,662
They do their very best each and every day to make hybrid work.

947
01:31:39,842 --> 01:31:52,827
We've had some staffing issues and some challenges like every school, but this year I have to say, they've really stepped up and they truly have tried to make this the best year possible for all of our students.

948
01:31:53,467 --> 01:32:10,088
And I just can't thank them enough for everything they do every day to try to make hybrid as work as best as possible for all of our students in your packet you do have some quotes from some of our of our families that did the survey, it's good.

949
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:15,572
There's quite a few in there, obviously, and I can't thank the parents enough for providing us feedback.

950
01:32:16,173 --> 01:32:22,816
You can improve if you don't receive feedback, and you really can improve if you get the feedback but don't act on it.

951
01:32:22,976 --> 01:32:32,400
And some of the suggestions and comments not only validate what we do at the Andrews, but also give us some pause for thought of ways that we can do things better.

952
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:37,182
Again, I want to thank you for your time, again, and I appreciate it.

953
01:32:39,705 --> 01:32:40,586
Thank you, Mr. Downs.

954
01:32:41,927 --> 01:32:42,687
Member Van de Kloop?

955
01:32:43,988 --> 01:32:46,650
Yes, thank you, Mr. Downs and Dr. Burnham.

956
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:50,893
I'm very interested in hearing about the restorative justice piece that you mentioned.

957
01:32:51,773 --> 01:33:05,743
Mr. Downs, I did notice in your report you included some great comments, very positive comments, and showcasing real success, especially many comments around the just gratefulness for

958
01:33:06,963 --> 01:33:11,567
expressed that the kids were able to be attending school in a hybrid way.

959
01:33:12,307 --> 01:33:18,251
However, I did notice that you didn't necessarily tell us what the negative comments were.

960
01:33:18,672 --> 01:33:31,681
So if I were to just ask you about what one or two of the most insightful comments on how you could improve, what areas were most suggested?

961
01:33:32,929 --> 01:33:34,891
So you're assuming there were negative comments.

962
01:33:35,431 --> 01:33:35,751
I am.

963
01:33:36,732 --> 01:33:42,897
And I'm assuming that because you said, here are the positive comments.

964
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,051
You know, I honestly, most of them were very positive.

965
01:33:48,472 --> 01:33:56,816
You know, if there were a negative one, it would, I wouldn't even call it negative, because kids are so happy to be back at school.

966
01:33:57,536 --> 01:34:03,519
One of the repeating themes was that they wish their kids could come to school more days.

967
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:08,742
That's really, you know, that's something that, you know, you can really take, you know, is that, you know,

968
01:34:09,482 --> 01:34:11,203
we all can't wait for that day to happen.

969
01:34:11,823 --> 01:34:13,403
You know, all of us, right?

970
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:18,025
I mean, school committee, teachers, parents, we're really looking forward to that day.

971
01:34:18,045 --> 01:34:23,147
And if there was anything, it would be about, you know, again, communicating more and more often.

972
01:34:23,227 --> 01:34:29,349
You know, we, I think we as a district, especially from the central down, we do a great job of communicating with our families, but

973
01:34:29,809 --> 01:34:36,497
Again, communication, you know, especially when it comes to grades, and that's why grading is going to be a little bit of a focus with this book club.

974
01:34:37,378 --> 01:34:41,242
You know, we could always do better with communicating performance out.

975
01:34:41,803 --> 01:34:45,887
And it does speak sometimes to some of our parents who aren't as tech savvy.

976
01:34:46,909 --> 01:34:50,413
You know, they don't always know how to use Google Classroom or even

977
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:54,537
Today, we know some parents have a hard time understanding what Zoom really is.

978
01:34:55,498 --> 01:35:00,462
So we can always find ways to get to all the parents as best as we can.

979
01:35:00,562 --> 01:35:11,232
So there is no negative comments, but there are definitely some that we can definitely look forward to having more students in more days a week and definitely always improve on communication.

980
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:14,319
And I really do applaud the book club.

981
01:35:14,379 --> 01:35:21,255
I think it's great when you've got your staff coming together to discuss, you know, some new ideas and

982
01:35:22,712 --> 01:35:26,453
really reflect on thinking, so I think that's terrific.

983
01:35:26,893 --> 01:35:44,238
I just want to also ask you though, is there any, I was just kind of been kind of curious, we haven't heard much about transportation issues this year, and I've been wondering how the transportation and the bus, whether many students are using it, what you're seeing, and if you could just address that.

984
01:35:44,858 --> 01:35:49,600
You know, we haven't had a lot of issues regarding the buses.

985
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:55,622
I know we changed the stops and we've only had a few inquiries regarding bus stops.

986
01:35:56,062 --> 01:36:00,143
I think overall, it's gone very smoothly considering we did change them this year.

987
01:36:00,544 --> 01:36:12,188
And, you know, from what I can tell in the morning, you know, there's still quite a few kids that, well, to, you know, safe distance, of course, but there are kids that are using the buses both in the afternoon and in the morning.

988
01:36:13,611 --> 01:36:17,014
You know, I'm glad we were able to keep that service for a majority of our students.

989
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:22,517
And like I said, I haven't really got a lot of emails or phone calls regarding the new bus stops.

990
01:36:22,537 --> 01:36:28,241
So I think that's a positive for us or for you and the school committee.

991
01:36:28,261 --> 01:36:28,522
So.

992
01:36:28,922 --> 01:36:29,642
Thank you very much.

993
01:36:30,003 --> 01:36:30,423
You're welcome.

994
01:36:32,084 --> 01:36:32,825
Member McLaughlin.

995
01:36:34,606 --> 01:36:35,286
Thank you.

996
01:36:35,546 --> 01:36:36,467
Hello, Mr. Downs.

997
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:37,428
Hi, Dr. Barnum.

998
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:39,409
Nice to see you.

999
01:36:39,449 --> 01:36:40,470
Thank you for the report.

1000
01:36:41,442 --> 01:36:47,423
I wanted to also say thank you for being so inclusive with the Special Ed Parent Advisory Council over the years and hosting the meetings there.

1001
01:36:47,503 --> 01:36:49,204
And we miss seeing you all.

1002
01:36:49,224 --> 01:36:53,505
We miss seeing the janitor staff and everybody that helps us all the time.

1003
01:36:53,545 --> 01:37:01,106
And we're looking forward to getting back into the building in terms of parents, speaking for myself as a parent of the Special Ed Parent Advisory Council.

1004
01:37:01,126 --> 01:37:04,187
But I know from Tanya and Alex, the co-chairs, they would

1005
01:37:04,627 --> 01:37:05,788
I want to say thank you as well.

1006
01:37:05,868 --> 01:37:17,572
And also for folks maybe who are watching who don't know, Dr. Burnham is the new vice principal who had transferred over from the high school to the Andrews.

1007
01:37:17,652 --> 01:37:20,433
And we knew Dr. Burnham at the high school.

1008
01:37:20,594 --> 01:37:23,355
And we also miss you very much over there, Dr. Burnham.

1009
01:37:23,415 --> 01:37:27,296
So looking forward to seeing you in the building when the time comes.

1010
01:37:27,376 --> 01:37:33,879
And couldn't agree more about the mental health capacity of people wanting to get back into our schools.

1011
01:37:34,721 --> 01:37:45,377
just had the opportunity to make a lunch for one of my students to go to school and I never thought I would enjoy making a lunch for my students so much, but I did I was really like this is so great.

1012
01:37:46,398 --> 01:37:51,065
And who would have thought right those little things that we don't realize that we even miss that we're able to get to do again.

1013
01:37:51,485 --> 01:38:04,792
I'd like to ask what sort of communication and inter-school collaboration, if you will, do you have with the McGlynn Middle School right next door to you?

1014
01:38:04,852 --> 01:38:07,893
So that's always been something that I've been interested in.

1015
01:38:07,913 --> 01:38:12,155
We're right next door to each other, and how are you guys interacting and working together?

1016
01:38:12,636 --> 01:38:14,336
So we talk almost every day.

1017
01:38:16,538 --> 01:38:20,901
You know, for instance, we are gonna be starting up our clubs and activities fairly soon.

1018
01:38:20,921 --> 01:38:35,350
And, you know, we've been in touch with that because as you may or may not know, we share clubs and activities and though they're gonna be virtual, it's very important for the two of us to offer the same opportunities for both of our student populations.

1019
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:42,995
So, you know, I don't wanna speak for Nick, but I would say that we communicate almost daily, whether it be about,

1020
01:38:43,655 --> 01:38:50,881
The clubs activities, even the handbook, we've had some talk about that, along with Paul to share who is on this on this as well.

1021
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:56,686
So I would say, you know, although we are two schools, we very much are team Medford.

1022
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,509
And so, and oh, one other thing we are going to do a

1023
01:39:02,871 --> 01:39:29,304
we are going to do a an assembly with a speaker for both schools and so that's another example of the two schools getting the same opportunity instead of being separated as they have been maybe prior to Nick and I taking over but I would say we again we are team Medford and so I don't see us as two schools we're just part of you know the Medford public school system so

1024
01:39:30,648 --> 01:39:31,569
That's great, thank you.

1025
01:39:31,649 --> 01:39:39,032
And just in response to the clubs as well and the combination of the clubs, I know that you're also committed to inclusion and including all students.

1026
01:39:39,052 --> 01:39:46,636
So I really appreciate reaching out to the EL and to the Director of Pupil Services and making sure that the clubs are inclusive across both schools.

1027
01:39:46,676 --> 01:39:48,638
But I know that you guys do that already.

1028
01:39:49,038 --> 01:39:54,561
So I just wanted to put that out there so that the community knows that they're available to all students, of course.

1029
01:39:54,641 --> 01:39:54,821
Thank you.

1030
01:39:54,841 --> 01:39:55,241
Absolutely.

1031
01:39:55,601 --> 01:39:56,722
Yes, absolutely.

1032
01:39:57,402 --> 01:39:58,463
And we encourage it.

1033
01:40:04,257 --> 01:40:04,737
Thank you both.

1034
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:14,043
Number four, we have report on English Learners EL programming, Mr. Paul Texera.

1035
01:40:15,144 --> 01:40:16,324
Hi, good evening, everyone.

1036
01:40:16,845 --> 01:40:17,445
Happy New Year.

1037
01:40:18,933 --> 01:40:30,822
In my report, I started with the access testing, which is typically done this month in January and through the first week of February, but the state did push that out to May 20th for us.

1038
01:40:31,762 --> 01:40:39,328
So we've decided to start the testing in April because we won't get the test results any sooner if we start testing the students sooner.

1039
01:40:39,428 --> 01:40:45,412
So we're looking to kind of recapture some of the lost time last year with the building closures in March.

1040
01:40:46,323 --> 01:40:51,065
and we'll work around the MCAS schedules as those come out in the individual buildings.

1041
01:40:53,806 --> 01:40:57,628
There is no option for a remote access test.

1042
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:59,129
It has to be done in person.

1043
01:40:59,629 --> 01:41:02,130
So even our remote students, we can make

1044
01:41:03,004 --> 01:41:07,307
accommodations for them to come into the building to take the testing if they choose to.

1045
01:41:07,927 --> 01:41:15,912
The state is aware that we do have remote students, so I'm not sure how they're going to calculate the participation rate this year.

1046
01:41:16,973 --> 01:41:22,437
I think they'll be a little bit forgiving due to the circumstances, but we'll obviously encourage people to

1047
01:41:23,317 --> 01:41:28,201
come in and test and that's the other advantage of waiting until April because people have been vaccinated.

1048
01:41:28,701 --> 01:41:38,088
With the testing we have going on, I think we have a better chance of getting more students in if we wait until April to administer the tests.

1049
01:41:39,449 --> 01:41:42,231
I think I share my screen, Dr. Cushing.

1050
01:41:45,574 --> 01:41:50,057
Yeah, so we have

1051
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:58,324
So this is the EL data dashboard that came out this year.

1052
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:06,249
Yeah, this is what's in your report.

1053
01:42:08,571 --> 01:42:16,276
We did take access in 2020, because it was done in January before the buildings closed, but the Department of Ed hasn't put the data up yet.

1054
01:42:17,751 --> 01:42:21,755
Most recent data I have for access testing is, you know, 2019.

1055
01:42:22,435 --> 01:42:30,162
I just wanted to show you, let me see if I can actually show you the actual website.

1056
01:42:30,983 --> 01:42:44,235
It's a neat tool because they're adding, in-cast data, you can compare yourself to a variety of different districts for the purpose of this.

1057
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:54,409
I gave you Malden and Somerville, and that's mostly because those are the communities that we share students with.

1058
01:42:55,049 --> 01:43:02,977
Students who are enrolling into Medford, transferring from other school districts, are coming from either Malden or Somerville are the two biggest.

1059
01:43:04,103 --> 01:43:10,725
And so if you look here, this was, I know it's kind of small, this is 2017.

1060
01:43:10,785 --> 01:43:22,228
This was the 16, 17 school year, the entire, the state could dip, every community took a dip because they changed the test from access to access 2.0 and they changed the cut scores.

1061
01:43:22,828 --> 01:43:29,510
And so this line here is the Medford line, because I realized you probably have a black and white copy and can't differentiate the lines.

1062
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:32,411
So although Malden has,

1063
01:43:33,497 --> 01:43:42,429
decreased, Somerville has decreased, State has decreased, Medford has been going up for our test scores.

1064
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:47,295
And again, I don't have the 2020 data yet to see where we fall on that.

1065
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:50,761
and to compare us with some other districts.

1066
01:43:52,322 --> 01:43:56,326
But we do get individual score reports on students.

1067
01:43:56,386 --> 01:44:00,329
So we know which students didn't make progress on access for 2020.

1068
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:09,497
And we have systems in place in all of the buildings where the teachers create an individualized learning plan for students who aren't making progress.

1069
01:44:09,537 --> 01:44:14,902
We look at the area, because if you recall, the access test is actually four different tests.

1070
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:18,924
and it's listening, reading, writing, and speaking assessments.

1071
01:44:19,905 --> 01:44:33,895
And so we look at what area the student needs support in, and they put together a building-based team to give that student supports across all classes, not just in the EL classroom.

1072
01:44:35,316 --> 01:44:40,620
And so hopefully we will see an improvement the following year.

1073
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:43,162
And then again, with the advantage of getting

1074
01:44:43,993 --> 01:44:48,477
the tests delayed, we can kind of recapture some of that time that we lost last year.

1075
01:44:49,918 --> 01:45:08,733
I also wanted to give you an elementary newcomer program update, because last year we debated and discussed about moving the newcomer program to, from the Brooks for grades one and two, and the Roberts grades three through five, we put grades one through four at the Columbus.

1076
01:45:09,706 --> 01:45:13,529
in grade five at the McGlynn because that's where the majority of our students live.

1077
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:35,126
And I know we debated with all of the changes happening this year, but I have to say that I think it really, it was the right decision to do it this year because bringing cohort A in first gave us the opportunity to kind of get used to the school, get the systems and structures in place before the rest of the students came, you know, came in.

1078
01:45:35,626 --> 01:45:39,009
So it did actually work out really well and I'm happy to report that

1079
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:43,415
you know, the Columbus and the McGlynn, the newcomer classrooms are, you know,

1080
01:45:44,991 --> 01:45:49,254
and they were kind of the leaders of the school when the other cohorts came in.

1081
01:45:50,175 --> 01:45:51,276
So that was kind of nice.

1082
01:45:51,977 --> 01:45:56,120
Additionally, we haven't had to utilize vans for transportation.

1083
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:02,966
We've been able to accommodate all of the students, transportation needs with the standard yellow buses.

1084
01:46:03,046 --> 01:46:07,430
So the two vans that we're spending about $45,000 on last year, we haven't had to use this year.

1085
01:46:12,555 --> 01:46:16,880
I gave you a report a couple of months ago about a Saturday program.

1086
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:20,345
We got a grant to do a Saturday learning program.

1087
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,382
And so that's going to begin on January 30th.

1088
01:46:25,402 --> 01:46:34,827
We're in the process of hiring and recruiting teachers for that, and then they'll do the outreach and recruiting of the students.

1089
01:46:35,227 --> 01:46:38,769
We're targeting, again, newcomer students level one and two.

1090
01:46:39,509 --> 01:46:40,910
That will be our first phase.

1091
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:45,512
And then depending upon the numbers, we can extend it out to three and four students.

1092
01:46:45,572 --> 01:46:47,093
And we're doing this at the high school.

1093
01:46:47,633 --> 01:46:59,536
We're targeting high school for this intervention because high school students have a finite period of time to develop their English language development to a point where they can pass MCAS and meet their graduation requirements.

1094
01:47:00,576 --> 01:47:04,478
So we wanna give them as much support as we possibly can.

1095
01:47:05,078 --> 01:47:13,620
We'll break it down into English language development, fundamental math skills, algebra one, and some social emotional learning in there as well.

1096
01:47:14,745 --> 01:47:23,729
In addition to that, we've come up with some field trips that we can use Title III money for, for our English learners.

1097
01:47:23,749 --> 01:47:27,691
And this is available at the elementary school.

1098
01:47:27,931 --> 01:47:32,053
The New England Aquarium is offering some virtual field trips.

1099
01:47:32,093 --> 01:47:35,354
I met with the teachers today who will be facilitating this.

1100
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:48,107
and coordinating this with the students and they're going to do the great sea turtle rescue and meeting the penguins, I think is the other one that was chosen.

1101
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:51,370
So that will be happening the first week in February.

1102
01:47:52,956 --> 01:47:57,601
And then we have professional development happening at the McGlynn Middle School.

1103
01:47:57,681 --> 01:47:59,823
We're in year three of the co-teaching model.

1104
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:04,368
We obviously had to make a change this year in terms of what that co-teaching looked like.

1105
01:48:05,069 --> 01:48:13,658
It was an additional challenge for the content and the EL teachers because we really have three EL programs in that building.

1106
01:48:14,078 --> 01:48:15,540
We have our four day a week

1107
01:48:16,794 --> 01:48:21,905
Cohort A, we have our typical hybrid students, and then we have our remote students.

1108
01:48:22,326 --> 01:48:25,032
So they're juggling a lot where the EL students are.

1109
01:48:26,005 --> 01:48:26,885
you know, are concerned.

1110
01:48:26,925 --> 01:48:33,848
And I have to say the content teachers and the EL teachers, I have to give them a big shout out because they've continued with this.

1111
01:48:33,928 --> 01:48:52,797
They see the value in this inclusion model, even though it looks very different from what we did when we were in person, they're still connected to the mainstream classrooms, even though they're in the same building, it's virtually because we can't over put a capacity over in a classroom, but that connection is still there.

1112
01:48:52,837 --> 01:48:55,778
And the teachers are working really hard to ensure that that continues.

1113
01:48:56,683 --> 01:49:00,744
So we've had some professional development, you know, on that and what that looks like.

1114
01:49:01,344 --> 01:49:14,548
And right now we're in the coaching phase where, you know, teachers are signing up to meet with the EL coaches on either common planning time or observing a co-teaching lesson to get feedback.

1115
01:49:14,628 --> 01:49:16,388
And that's where they're at now.

1116
01:49:18,017 --> 01:49:22,119
And then we're also doing some PD on culturally responsive teaching.

1117
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,681
We're doing it in the form of a book club.

1118
01:49:26,221 --> 01:49:31,764
Again, this is a Title III sponsored event where Title III purchased the books for the teachers who sign up.

1119
01:49:32,845 --> 01:49:35,226
It will be a three month PD.

1120
01:49:36,066 --> 01:49:53,765
We'll read a memoir about a student's or a family's process of immigrating here to the United States and the challenges that they faced with that whole process and the impact it will have on students in their classrooms.

1121
01:49:55,783 --> 01:50:00,366
And then we have the Massachusetts Vision for Blueprint and English Learner Success.

1122
01:50:00,926 --> 01:50:02,927
I mentioned this at a previous meeting as well.

1123
01:50:02,947 --> 01:50:06,009
I'm on the advisory committee for this.

1124
01:50:06,089 --> 01:50:20,017
It's going to be piloted in three districts this year, but we're developing self-assessment tools that districts can use to evaluate their own English learner education programs, curriculum.

1125
01:50:21,738 --> 01:50:23,479
I like this program because it

1126
01:50:24,938 --> 01:50:33,125
is based on four different areas at the classroom level, the school level, the district level, and the state level.

1127
01:50:33,846 --> 01:50:40,011
And I included an attachment, it's I think nine pages, that goes into much more detail about what the program is.

1128
01:50:40,671 --> 01:50:44,735
When we restructured the McGlynn Middle School, I was on the

1129
01:50:45,796 --> 01:50:53,982
initial advisory committee for this, and they called it out as possibly being a model that fits their blueprint.

1130
01:50:54,262 --> 01:51:08,452
And so I'm continuing with the work with them, because ideally, you know, this is something that will benefit the district and the EL and mainstream students in the district K through 12, not just at the middle school level.

1131
01:51:09,653 --> 01:51:12,035
And then I gave you updates on our enrollment numbers.

1132
01:51:12,735 --> 01:51:14,436
Our EL numbers are down.

1133
01:51:14,696 --> 01:51:15,297
We do have

1134
01:51:16,016 --> 01:51:25,222
As of Friday, when I put this together, we had 415 students, represents 10.3% of our total student population.

1135
01:51:27,043 --> 01:51:32,747
Interestingly, the number of Yale students who have come in this year have been 114.

1136
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:38,103
And I think I told you, it's trying to hit a moving target.

1137
01:51:38,123 --> 01:51:39,765
We have a very fluid population.

1138
01:51:40,185 --> 01:51:43,408
So I always look at that one moment in time to get my numbers.

1139
01:51:44,189 --> 01:51:48,573
And so the numbers that you're looking at here for 2021 were as of that date.

1140
01:51:51,636 --> 01:51:55,899
the numbers for all the previous years was how we ended the school year.

1141
01:51:56,300 --> 01:52:08,769
But that doesn't mean we only had 454 EL students in the district, because we have students move in and move out upwards of 30 to 40 students a year.

1142
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:17,016
So with that said, I don't know where our numbers will end for this school year, but we're currently at 415.

1143
01:52:19,010 --> 01:52:27,937
With new students coming in, we have 114 students compared to 193 students at this time last year.

1144
01:52:27,957 --> 01:52:32,121
I can't tell you how many students have come in.

1145
01:52:32,141 --> 01:52:39,387
In the past, I've given you the number of students who have come in that we've tested, and some of them haven't qualified.

1146
01:52:40,462 --> 01:52:49,228
I'm only giving you the number of students who have qualified because the testing and how that was determined this year because of COVID changed.

1147
01:52:49,248 --> 01:52:52,050
So I can only give you the actual EL student numbers.

1148
01:52:52,550 --> 01:53:02,697
So even though we're down 80, almost 80 students, for new students coming into the district, our overall EL numbers are only down by about 40 students.

1149
01:53:05,089 --> 01:53:07,892
And our numbers at the high school continue to grow.

1150
01:53:07,972 --> 01:53:10,293
We're, I think, 116 students.

1151
01:53:10,494 --> 01:53:12,555
That's where the bulk of our students are coming in.

1152
01:53:12,595 --> 01:53:18,420
And like I said, they're transferring in from other districts, not necessarily from other countries.

1153
01:53:22,663 --> 01:53:23,844
Thank you, Mr. Tixera.

1154
01:53:25,486 --> 01:53:26,286
Very thorough.

1155
01:53:27,227 --> 01:53:27,988
Any questions?

1156
01:53:31,731 --> 01:53:32,371
We appreciate it.

1157
01:53:32,451 --> 01:53:33,032
I have a question.

1158
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,644
I hope nobody's recruiting you because I will take action.

1159
01:53:43,226 --> 01:53:44,367
You're not leaving us ever.

1160
01:53:45,868 --> 01:53:46,529
Thank you so much.

1161
01:53:47,670 --> 01:53:48,030
Thank you.

1162
01:53:48,891 --> 01:53:49,632
Member McLaughlin.

1163
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:56,565
Yeah, I'm really, thank you, Mr. Teixeira for the report, very thorough as always, appreciated.

1164
01:53:57,066 --> 01:54:08,016
And I'm really interested in learning more about the co-teaching model and would love to sort of look at that, especially as you're talking about inclusion and what the inclusion rates are for that.

1165
01:54:08,056 --> 01:54:10,759
I think that's a really important model and base.

1166
01:54:10,799 --> 01:54:14,623
And so, that's something that I'm interested in exploring more.

1167
01:54:15,463 --> 01:54:20,666
because it seems like it's been working and it's been a model from the department level as well.

1168
01:54:20,706 --> 01:54:21,467
Is that accurate?

1169
01:54:22,528 --> 01:54:24,609
Yes.

1170
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:31,993
I mean, the advantage to this model is that it's a shared responsibility.

1171
01:54:32,814 --> 01:54:36,456
And that's what we're seeing from the EL side as well as the content side.

1172
01:54:37,206 --> 01:54:40,789
And we are lucky in Medford that we have a newcomer program.

1173
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:49,818
We don't necessarily have to have it to the level that we do, but it's just about how we're using our resources.

1174
01:54:49,838 --> 01:54:57,285
And I think we're using our resources much more wisely that allows us to have that newcomer program to provide support.

1175
01:54:57,765 --> 01:55:09,735
to the students, but also to the content teachers, because it's challenging for a content teacher to have a non-English speaker in their classroom when they're responsible for getting through heavy duty content.

1176
01:55:10,075 --> 01:55:12,977
And so this co-teaching kind of helps balance that out.

1177
01:55:14,278 --> 01:55:14,759
Exactly.

1178
01:55:14,819 --> 01:55:15,279
And thank you.

1179
01:55:15,339 --> 01:55:18,762
And the similarities between that and students with disabilities are not lost on me.

1180
01:55:19,557 --> 01:55:33,320
in terms of the inclusion aspect as well because of the difficulty just in language and universal design for learning and being able to differentiate instruction across the board makes better teachers and access to all the students for the children as well so that we're all having exposure to each other.

1181
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:38,441
So I love that you have this model and I'm clearly interested in hearing more about it.

1182
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:46,102
So thank you and thank you to the teachers who are working hard because I know that's sort of an extra level, an extra layer of work to be able to do that collaborative piece.

1183
01:55:46,502 --> 01:55:48,543
But it's such an important way to hone their own skills.

1184
01:55:48,583 --> 01:55:49,103
So thank you.

1185
01:55:55,627 --> 01:55:59,369
Next up, we have report on athletics during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1186
01:55:59,770 --> 01:56:02,371
Mr. Bobby Maloney and Dr. Peter Cushing.

1187
01:56:06,134 --> 01:56:06,774
Thank you very much.

1188
01:56:06,874 --> 01:56:16,400
I want to take a moment before I hand it over to Mr. Maloney to really thank him and all the members of the GPL athletic departments for their tireless work

1189
01:56:16,932 --> 01:56:24,874
to try to make sure that we can actually have athletic seasons, despite some of our member communities being pretty heavily in the red.

1190
01:56:25,795 --> 01:56:30,836
So I'll turn it over to Mr. Maloney, and then happy to jump in at any point along the way.

1191
01:56:32,697 --> 01:56:33,717
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1192
01:56:33,757 --> 01:56:34,998
Happy New Year's to everybody.

1193
01:56:35,038 --> 01:56:36,458
Hopefully everyone stays safe.

1194
01:56:38,259 --> 01:56:41,240
Yeah, it's been a... I wanna thank Rachel Perry.

1195
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,120
She does the GBL schedules.

1196
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:45,601
She's done it about 12 times this year, but

1197
01:56:47,235 --> 01:56:52,896
We're confident and we're gonna do everything in our power to try to get these kids some kind of season.

1198
01:56:54,196 --> 01:56:57,677
Currently, the winter season is pushed back to March 1st.

1199
01:56:58,797 --> 01:57:06,718
We currently have girls gymnastics and girls hockey going because it's the only time of the season they can participate in.

1200
01:57:09,219 --> 01:57:12,299
We're gonna try to get three seasons in the next 18 weeks.

1201
01:57:16,936 --> 01:57:19,858
Winter will go March 1st to April 10th.

1202
01:57:20,779 --> 01:57:23,360
Fall will go April 12th to May 15th.

1203
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:26,662
And spring will go May 7th to July 3rd.

1204
01:57:27,922 --> 01:57:32,225
We're looking forward to trying to do everything in our power to get the winter season in.

1205
01:57:32,245 --> 01:57:36,087
We're confident that we'll be able to get the last two seasons because they're outdoor sports.

1206
01:57:38,228 --> 01:57:43,891
Again, I want to thank everyone's support, Dr. Vincent, Peter Cush and Dave Murphy.

1207
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:45,452
Everyone's been fantastic.

1208
01:57:46,173 --> 01:57:48,594
And our student athletes are struggling.

1209
01:57:48,814 --> 01:57:50,395
We're trying to give them some kind of hope.

1210
01:57:51,435 --> 01:58:02,040
We keep pushing the cattle in the back, but I think this is the safest plan that the greater Boston league came up with.

1211
01:58:03,741 --> 01:58:07,163
Currently, we just went into the red prior to this week.

1212
01:58:07,783 --> 01:58:09,124
We had Revere in the red.

1213
01:58:09,164 --> 01:58:10,344
We had Everett in the red.

1214
01:58:10,384 --> 01:58:11,905
We had the two Lins in the red.

1215
01:58:11,965 --> 01:58:14,346
We had Chelsea in the red and we had Malden in the red.

1216
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:25,162
All these communities are working together and through the leadership of the high school, we're hoping that our kids will have some kind of athletic season.

1217
01:58:26,663 --> 01:58:34,765
And so we're also working to make sure that we can have at least one parent spectator be in the venue.

1218
01:58:35,345 --> 01:58:36,946
There'll be no outside visitors.

1219
01:58:37,186 --> 01:58:40,187
It will only be Medford parents or guardians or caregivers.

1220
01:58:41,107 --> 01:58:44,688
We'll work with Tony Ray and Marian O'Connor on that.

1221
01:58:45,807 --> 01:59:00,156
but other schools are not planning to have spectators within the GBL, but if we can have at least one of our parents be able to be there to see their child participate, I think that would be a huge help emotionally for a lot of people in our city.

1222
01:59:01,256 --> 01:59:13,543
I also think that the way the GBL is trying to make sure that we can get, at the time it was Lynn, the two Lynn schools, classical and English, Chelsea and Revere,

1223
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:28,965
could be wrong, but feel free to jump in, Mr. Maloney, but really trying to make sure that we're helping to bring those schools and those communities in as well because of the benefits of interscholastic play to support students.

1224
01:59:29,966 --> 01:59:36,488
We're also working to bring middle school sports on board in intramural fashion.

1225
01:59:37,022 --> 01:59:54,487
There is currently no appetite across the GVL for middle school sports, but if we can do something to have our middle school athletes participate and be involved, even if it's between the two schools or amongst themselves, however it may be, I think that would be a big help.

1226
01:59:57,788 --> 01:59:58,048
Mayor?

1227
01:59:58,688 --> 01:59:59,409
Yes, thank you.

1228
01:59:59,509 --> 02:00:00,409
Member Van de Kloet.

1229
02:00:01,227 --> 02:00:14,093
Yes, I just wanted to ask, when I look at the schedule, that last piece, the spring sports going to July 3rd, that means that our seniors would have already graduated.

1230
02:00:15,054 --> 02:00:17,395
Will they continue to be eligible to play?

1231
02:00:17,415 --> 02:00:21,096
And how's that going to work?

1232
02:00:22,477 --> 02:00:23,878
Yes, they'll be eligible to play.

1233
02:00:23,898 --> 02:00:30,661
The MIA has given local districts a free pass this year on some of the rules.

1234
02:00:31,965 --> 02:00:39,967
uh, through the leadership of Paul de labor and the principals in the GBL, uh, prior years, the seniors would be out too.

1235
02:00:40,007 --> 02:00:42,787
If we went to the post season, their problems would be over and everything.

1236
02:00:42,867 --> 02:00:46,788
So, uh, this is the only fair way to get three seasons in.

1237
02:00:46,828 --> 02:00:50,549
We didn't want to cancel one season because we didn't think it was fair to the fall athlete.

1238
02:00:51,089 --> 02:00:54,530
So we're trying to get three seasons in, and this is the only possible way to do it.

1239
02:00:56,098 --> 02:01:08,768
Do you think that the fact that the season will go beyond the end of school, will our students still continue to participate and not be deterred by that late cutoff date?

1240
02:01:09,588 --> 02:01:12,731
Yeah, I believe so, for the love of the game and the love of the school.

1241
02:01:13,331 --> 02:01:15,933
And I think they really appreciate what we're trying to do.

1242
02:01:16,013 --> 02:01:17,774
And we understand their frustration.

1243
02:01:17,794 --> 02:01:24,820
When last year's spring season got cut, we just figured we would roll this year.

1244
02:01:26,098 --> 02:01:29,842
Uh, I think we'll be able to do this successfully with the support of everyone.

1245
02:01:30,763 --> 02:01:31,423
I hope it works.

1246
02:01:31,784 --> 02:01:32,164
Thank you.

1247
02:01:32,624 --> 02:01:33,025
Thank you.

1248
02:01:34,286 --> 02:01:47,378
And Mr Maloney, can you, this is you talking just high school or would the, will these seasons be, um, cause we did plan for the middle school to also have their fall season and the March timeframe.

1249
02:01:47,538 --> 02:01:49,320
So can you just elaborate on that a bit?

1250
02:01:50,402 --> 02:01:57,565
Yeah, we would be able to, if you look at this schedule, we'd be able to consolidate the middle school schedules once we got outside.

1251
02:01:58,766 --> 02:02:06,889
For the indoor basketball, Dr. Cush and I were talking about trying to get an intramural thing off the ground for the next six to eight weeks.

1252
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:19,415
But I believe once we get outside and we can social distancing a little bit better and we'll be able to utilize Hormel Stadium, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to get all the middle school sports in.

1253
02:02:20,926 --> 02:02:21,926
Great, thank you.

1254
02:02:22,986 --> 02:02:23,447
Thank you both.

1255
02:02:27,628 --> 02:02:32,029
Number six, we have report on Racial Equity Task Force, Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

1256
02:02:36,449 --> 02:02:37,290
Good evening again.

1257
02:02:40,110 --> 02:02:47,372
Earlier today, I had the opportunity to meet with our Racial Equity Task Force

1258
02:02:49,408 --> 02:02:58,651
And I wanted to read my report this evening and share the work that we have been doing.

1259
02:03:00,512 --> 02:03:14,757
I think now more than ever, in light of all of the challenges that we are facing both, I think as a nation, the challenges that we're dealing with, meeting with the Racial Equity Task Force,

1260
02:03:15,850 --> 02:03:26,558
and the exercises that we participated in today and just sharing the different thoughts, different perspectives on the events of last week.

1261
02:03:27,798 --> 02:03:45,351
It was really gratifying, a gratifying experience to see how we were able to come together, students, parents, and administrators, staff who are part of the Racial Equity Task Force.

1262
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:50,781
I am going to read the report that I submitted.

1263
02:03:52,662 --> 02:04:02,505
During the summer of 2020, the Medford Public Schools put out a call for applications for constituents to serve as members of a racial equity task force.

1264
02:04:03,846 --> 02:04:10,528
A diverse selection committee selected the members of the task force from the more than 80 applications we received.

1265
02:04:12,063 --> 02:04:21,410
Our goal was to develop a strategic and coordinated approach to address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion within the Medford Public Schools.

1266
02:04:23,772 --> 02:04:33,700
This summer, the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color

1267
02:04:34,592 --> 02:04:43,338
sparked nationwide conversations about race, equity, and the experiences of people of color across the United States.

1268
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:49,743
These events reignited a national outcry for justice.

1269
02:04:52,265 --> 02:05:03,473
This national outcry was further amplified through the voices of our own Medford students who took to social media to list their experiences as students of color

1270
02:05:05,301 --> 02:05:18,731
As we expressed throughout the summer, the Medford Public Schools is committed to creating and sustaining an anti-racist district community and ensuring an equitable, excellent education for all of our students.

1271
02:05:20,532 --> 02:05:31,900
This Racial Equity Task Force has been tasked to explore all available resources and options to improve the culture and climate for all of our students and school community.

1272
02:05:33,642 --> 02:05:43,765
The voices and ideas of our community members who serve as members of this task force are essential to improving the staff and student experience.

1273
02:05:45,445 --> 02:05:59,829
The Medford Public Schools Racial Equity Task Force has been empowered to research, examine, and make recommendations to create an anti-racist, equitable, and socially just school district for our students.

1274
02:06:01,738 --> 02:06:09,742
The Racial Equity Task Force is currently meeting every two weeks with a current time expectation of three hours a month.

1275
02:06:10,922 --> 02:06:14,464
We are presently exploring a district-wide equity audit.

1276
02:06:15,885 --> 02:06:27,130
The Racial Equity Task Force has met with a consultant who provided insight into conducting an audit in pieces so it was manageable to digest and understand the information.

1277
02:06:28,303 --> 02:06:44,634
Beyond an equity audit, the task force will be examining the following topics, staff recruitment, hiring and retention, curriculum revisions, professional development, and student disciplinary practices.

1278
02:06:46,636 --> 02:06:47,937
The task force members

1279
02:06:49,098 --> 02:06:58,362
are a collaborative of students, faculty, parents, administrators, and city staff who serve as volunteers to assist our efforts.

1280
02:07:00,162 --> 02:07:01,423
I am on the task force.

1281
02:07:02,243 --> 02:07:07,105
Sophia Jean, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Ms.

1282
02:07:07,165 --> 02:07:08,505
Jodi Lu, Ms.

1283
02:07:08,525 --> 02:07:11,907
Sharose Walker, Dr. Nicole Chiesa,

1284
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:13,070
Ms.

1285
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:16,333
Stacey Schulman, Dr. Peter Cushing, Ms.

1286
02:07:16,353 --> 02:07:38,351
Susanna Campbell, Leticia Rocha, Sophia Hernandez, Noah Brew, Sidonie Pierce, Paulette Doiley, Karen Chen, Beth Myers, Michelle Godfrey, Elizabeth Baez, Kaya Dios-Golden, Tope Fadaran, Christina Dios,

1287
02:07:39,434 --> 02:07:47,263
William Barbarino, Liza Lopes, Alexandra Watkins, and Grace Caldera.

1288
02:07:48,364 --> 02:07:50,547
Those are the people who are meeting with us

1289
02:07:52,452 --> 02:08:10,918
twice a month, dedicating their time, giving their energy, writing the joint report, contributing to that, and continuing to help us as a district look at all of the things that I listed to improve and become a better Medford Public Schools.

1290
02:08:11,778 --> 02:08:19,461
And so I wanted to formally just present that report to you and let you know that we will be working on a press release

1291
02:08:20,321 --> 02:08:31,424
later in the week, but that the entire task force is committed and working very hard to improve our district.

1292
02:08:33,964 --> 02:08:35,365
Thank you very much, Dr. Edwards.

1293
02:08:35,425 --> 02:08:38,305
Sounds like a great committee.

1294
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:42,026
How many members is that?

1295
02:08:42,846 --> 02:08:44,887
Today we met with approximately 15.

1296
02:08:45,447 --> 02:08:46,527
Let me look.

1297
02:08:50,785 --> 02:08:52,106
No, it's just great attendance.

1298
02:08:53,668 --> 02:08:56,430
Yes, the attendance sometimes there are conflicts.

1299
02:08:57,772 --> 02:09:04,478
So sometimes different members have stated that they can't make a particular meeting.

1300
02:09:05,969 --> 02:09:13,413
But the people that we have listed were people who attended different meetings.

1301
02:09:13,453 --> 02:09:21,376
So if they weren't at today's meeting today, I believe it was about approximately 15 people who participated in today's meeting.

1302
02:09:23,497 --> 02:09:24,758
Member McLaughlin and Member Graham?

1303
02:09:26,888 --> 02:09:27,348
Thank you.

1304
02:09:27,408 --> 02:09:29,109
Thank you for this information superintendent.

1305
02:09:29,269 --> 02:09:42,593
I wanted to ask if I understand you're doing a press release, it would be helpful to post this obviously on the district website as well so folks know, you know, who's on and if there are community members they want to talk to.

1306
02:09:43,433 --> 02:09:44,454
if they want to put things forward.

1307
02:09:44,474 --> 02:09:56,286
And also can we, in the published document for the anti-racism task force, can you also include what role that each of the individuals has?

1308
02:09:56,346 --> 02:10:04,654
So for example, student, community member, staff member, what have you, so that we can see the breakdown and how that is applied.

1309
02:10:04,674 --> 02:10:06,756
It would be really helpful for the community to be able to see that.

1310
02:10:08,617 --> 02:10:12,079
And then you said the meetings take place twice a month.

1311
02:10:12,519 --> 02:10:24,204
Are they on a consistent time or if a school committee member wants to observe or have a sit in, should we just reach out to you or one of the anti-racism task force members?

1312
02:10:25,791 --> 02:10:26,912
Yes, certainly.

1313
02:10:26,972 --> 02:10:27,952
We meet on Mondays.

1314
02:10:28,833 --> 02:10:33,596
So we met today, we'll be meeting again on the 25th of January.

1315
02:10:34,336 --> 02:10:37,819
We normally meet at 2.45 p.m.

1316
02:10:38,379 --> 02:10:45,663
so that the students finish their classes and are able to jump on and join the call.

1317
02:10:47,885 --> 02:10:52,948
And so we meet for about an hour to an hour and a half consistently at 2.45.

1318
02:10:55,383 --> 02:10:55,803
Thank you.

1319
02:10:55,863 --> 02:11:02,229
And would it be okay to have that information for the information about the membership and the press release on the district site?

1320
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:03,750
Yes.

1321
02:11:03,930 --> 02:11:19,164
I mean, we haven't written, we're going to take from the report to write that piece, but we wanted to at least present formally to the school committee what has the task force been doing?

1322
02:11:19,224 --> 02:11:21,005
What have we been working on?

1323
02:11:23,425 --> 02:11:36,897
And so, you know, what are the discussions that we've had, you know, articles, pieces that they're reading and everyone speaks, the students talk, the parents.

1324
02:11:37,098 --> 02:11:38,279
It's not one sided.

1325
02:11:38,339 --> 02:11:45,185
Everyone has an opportunity to kind of weigh in and kind of share their thoughts and opinions.

1326
02:11:46,666 --> 02:11:47,107
Thank you.

1327
02:11:47,667 --> 02:11:47,967
Thank you.

1328
02:11:48,168 --> 02:11:48,568
Member Graham.

1329
02:11:54,179 --> 02:11:54,380
Hi.

1330
02:11:54,861 --> 02:12:02,797
Can you talk a little bit about where the task force is at regarding the equity audit and how you're planning to approach that?

1331
02:12:04,722 --> 02:12:13,725
So the equity audit, we had one consultant already present to the task force about what are the pieces of data.

1332
02:12:14,205 --> 02:12:23,688
So we have actually been speaking with different or looking at different vendors to say how could we

1333
02:12:24,408 --> 02:12:32,375
So it's when the task force met and said, this would be something that we would like to have about the schools and about the district.

1334
02:12:32,915 --> 02:12:42,503
And so we're in the process of trying to look at what would the final equity audit look like where we're on COVID time right now.

1335
02:12:42,583 --> 02:12:47,867
That's one of the things that we talked about that it's not a traditional school year.

1336
02:12:48,728 --> 02:12:58,416
So this would most likely be something that we would be looking at hopefully for next school year, but trying to lay down the foundational pieces.

1337
02:12:58,516 --> 02:13:04,941
So for the equity audit, looking at data, one of the

1338
02:13:06,519 --> 02:13:22,021
people who spoke with us talked about like looking at our current data, looking at discipline data, looking at data that already exists within schools, and then eventually being able to come in and look at schools and maybe conduct some maybe

1339
02:13:24,292 --> 02:13:34,176
targeted groups where they could talk with different members of a school building, staff or administrators and students.

1340
02:13:34,216 --> 02:13:46,041
So it would be something that would be more elaborate, but it is one of the tasks that they have asked that we could do to be able to produce that information about the district.

1341
02:13:46,401 --> 02:13:49,903
So it is not, we don't have a date for an equity audit.

1342
02:13:51,063 --> 02:14:03,893
per se, it's just, this is one of the things that the team has expressed, they would love to be able to have baseline data on where the district is.

1343
02:14:04,494 --> 02:14:18,965
And one of the ways to get that baseline data would be to do an equity audit, but they understand we're on COVID schedules, so we're really not trying to have too many other people come into the buildings right now, limiting outside,

1344
02:14:19,945 --> 02:14:20,546
exposure.

1345
02:14:21,087 --> 02:14:24,310
But another task has been professional development.

1346
02:14:25,311 --> 02:14:30,056
And with the task of asking about professional development,

1347
02:14:32,476 --> 02:14:53,203
know we have been looking at additional ways to supplement professional development for both indoor workshops for both staff and administration and so those opportunities we have definitely followed up on and that's another charge that the

1348
02:14:54,363 --> 02:15:00,427
task force has asked that we, you know, we do, not just saying that we're going to do it, but that we actually do it.

1349
02:15:00,947 --> 02:15:14,055
And so on January 20th, we will have a cultural proficiency workshop for all staff, close to 500 members, a two-hour workshop on Wednesday, January 20th.

1350
02:15:15,055 --> 02:15:17,096
And between February 23rd

1351
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:32,044
And April 27th, administrators have an opportunity to participate in 10 hours of professional development titled the Racial Ethnic Identity Development and Practice.

1352
02:15:33,465 --> 02:15:39,867
It's five two-hour sessions and several administrators have already signed up for that.

1353
02:15:40,667 --> 02:15:47,329
So just again, demonstrating and showing that this is something that we're committed to

1354
02:15:50,946 --> 02:15:52,446
we're committed to as a district.

1355
02:15:53,247 --> 02:16:10,132
So that's kind of, so I don't have anything specific for you right now regarding an actual equity audit, because we don't have an equity audit taking place, but that is one of the charges that they would like for us to be able to have for the district.

1356
02:16:11,492 --> 02:16:16,533
And is it the plan that this equity audit would be conducted by an external party?

1357
02:16:17,474 --> 02:16:17,754
Yes.

1358
02:16:18,574 --> 02:16:18,754
Okay.

1359
02:16:19,991 --> 02:16:22,017
Yes, not internal, definitely external.

1360
02:16:22,398 --> 02:16:23,561
Okay, great.

1361
02:16:23,822 --> 02:16:24,183
Thank you.

1362
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:27,132
Member Rousseau?

1363
02:16:29,097 --> 02:16:29,437
Thank you.

1364
02:16:29,477 --> 02:16:30,318
Thank you for the report.

1365
02:16:31,299 --> 02:16:48,250
I just want to get, you know, down to the details a bit, which I realized putting the carpet before the horse here, but I just want to be sure that when we, I'm assuming equity audits do not cost, you know, $80 and that you can be sure to include that in our budget.

1366
02:16:48,931 --> 02:16:54,915
I think the committee's commitment to this requires us to prioritize this.

1367
02:16:55,751 --> 02:17:07,724
And, you know, with so many dollars that, with only so many dollars, that means this, if we decide is more important than something else, we need to have the opportunity to make that statement and support this work.

1368
02:17:08,906 --> 02:17:16,474
I just, you know, to expect that you just will magically find the money somewhere in some hidden closet, which doesn't exist.

1369
02:17:17,514 --> 02:17:19,075
I don't want to put that on you.

1370
02:17:19,136 --> 02:17:27,182
I think it's really important that you let the committee support you and the work that this task force is doing.

1371
02:17:27,242 --> 02:17:40,452
So I just want to urge you to think about the timeline around the budget and make sure that if something is going to be needed for next year, that it's actually spec'd out to the dollars so that it can be included.

1372
02:17:40,472 --> 02:17:41,453
Thank you.

1373
02:17:46,553 --> 02:17:48,755
Thank you, and the committee for that important work.

1374
02:17:52,237 --> 02:17:53,138
No further questions.

1375
02:17:53,438 --> 02:17:56,380
We have old business, which I don't believe we have any.

1376
02:17:56,580 --> 02:17:58,862
Yes, member Rousseau.

1377
02:17:58,922 --> 02:18:00,643
There is a person with his hand up, Adam.

1378
02:18:01,363 --> 02:18:02,164
I don't know who that is.

1379
02:18:08,468 --> 02:18:08,688
Adam?

1380
02:18:09,289 --> 02:18:09,669
Hi.

1381
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:14,493
I'm wondering, thank you for all the work you're doing on the task force.

1382
02:18:15,686 --> 02:18:22,166
I'm just wondering if this is the task force, are you going to be coming up with a curriculum for the kids in the schools?

1383
02:18:25,555 --> 02:18:37,286
So what we will be looking at is how to find ways to integrate and supplement the existing curriculum, because we still have to follow the curriculum and state standards.

1384
02:18:37,847 --> 02:18:39,969
But we are looking at that.

1385
02:18:40,429 --> 02:18:45,754
Dr. Chiesa and Dr. Riccadeli, they both are also on the task force.

1386
02:18:48,637 --> 02:18:57,085
That is something that is, you know, everyone as a district, the directors are looking at ways to supplement our existing curricula.

1387
02:18:57,605 --> 02:19:10,096
So that is something that hopefully, um, as we continue to meet and look at additional resources, how that can be added to what our portfolio of offerings is right now.

1388
02:19:11,517 --> 02:19:12,038
Thank you.

1389
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:14,740
Thank you.

1390
02:19:20,613 --> 02:19:21,113
old business.

1391
02:19:22,134 --> 02:19:25,397
We have any number nine communications.

1392
02:19:25,577 --> 02:19:27,478
Also, we don't have anything.

1393
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:45,172
And for new business, we do have a resolution offered by member McLaughlin, Massachusetts family school partnership initiative, the department in partnership with Pat Spradley, former chief of parent and community engagement for Springfield Public Schools, and the school in Maine Institute is offering up

1394
02:19:46,136 --> 02:19:54,323
to three school districts a new opportunity to strengthen district systems for family engagement through the Massachusetts Family School Partnership Initiative.

1395
02:19:54,823 --> 02:20:01,628
Districts that are interested in being part of the pilot will be asked to submit a brief application by Tuesday, January 26.

1396
02:20:02,949 --> 02:20:03,590
Member McLaughlin?

1397
02:20:05,468 --> 02:20:05,928
Thank you.

1398
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:14,832
I thought this was a great opportunity for Medford to apply to be part of this pilot initiative on family school and partnerships.

1399
02:20:16,053 --> 02:20:23,756
It's based on the Massachusetts family school and partnership community partnership fundamentals which can be shared for folks who are interested.

1400
02:20:23,816 --> 02:20:25,217
I'm happy to share it or share it with

1401
02:20:26,923 --> 02:20:28,204
Lisa Evangelista to share.

1402
02:20:29,345 --> 02:20:35,832
And it, you know, supports the innovation and implementation of powerful family engagement strategies for this year and beyond.

1403
02:20:36,413 --> 02:20:42,679
So there'll be a webinar tomorrow from three to four on Tuesday, January 12 that requires

1404
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:49,282
registration for any community members that might be interested or educators that are interested.

1405
02:20:50,023 --> 02:20:50,903
I'll be attending that.

1406
02:20:51,063 --> 02:20:55,705
And then as you stated, Mayor, the application itself is due January 26.

1407
02:20:56,385 --> 02:20:59,166
Only three districts across the state will be chosen for this pilot.

1408
02:20:59,787 --> 02:21:03,568
And I'd like to throw Medford's hat into the ring.

1409
02:21:03,588 --> 02:21:12,612
I wanted to put that out to the superintendent here and ask her opinion on that and whether that's something the district might consider.

1410
02:21:17,845 --> 02:21:34,064
I think one of the things that we've learned if anything, especially this year is the importance and the power of communication and trying to communicate and reach out to families, and being intentional about translation services.

1411
02:21:35,065 --> 02:21:43,973
and reaching out to those that may not get it in the simple, you know, whatever form of communication that we do to try to be more inclusive.

1412
02:21:44,614 --> 02:21:46,415
I think this is a good opportunity.

1413
02:21:46,475 --> 02:21:54,022
I know it's highly competitive, but what we can do is definitely throw our hat in and

1414
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:57,281
know, give it a try.

1415
02:21:57,401 --> 02:22:07,052
So I will definitely try to jump on the webinar tomorrow and see if I can have a few members of the team jump on the webinar just to hear

1416
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:18,758
how they really explain it and what is it that districts will end up receiving if they are chosen to be part of this initiative.

1417
02:22:18,778 --> 02:22:27,805
It might come with funding or it might come with just some very interesting strategies that we haven't thought about.

1418
02:22:28,626 --> 02:22:37,573
So I definitely am willing to at least go to the webinar or participate in it and see if there's something we can do

1419
02:22:38,571 --> 02:22:42,652
continue to increase parental involvement and engagement in Metro Public Schools.

1420
02:22:43,372 --> 02:22:43,792
Thank you.

1421
02:22:45,413 --> 02:22:45,753
Thank you.

1422
02:22:45,873 --> 02:22:47,513
Member Graham, then Member Vandekloot.

1423
02:22:49,434 --> 02:22:49,854
Thank you.

1424
02:22:50,034 --> 02:23:01,317
So the one thing that I would say if we do decide to move forward is that we passed a resolution earlier this year to sort of build a complete communication strategy.

1425
02:23:01,337 --> 02:23:05,358
And one of the key elements of that strategy is family engagement.

1426
02:23:05,438 --> 02:23:06,258
So I feel like

1427
02:23:06,978 --> 02:23:12,221
We are well positioned to be able to say like, we, we know we need to do this work.

1428
02:23:12,802 --> 02:23:27,170
We are trying to get this work started and this would be like a great fit for us so I feel like from an application perspective there's probably a great way to integrate some of that work that we are doing as part as part of the communication engagement and strategic planning subcommittee already.

1429
02:23:29,131 --> 02:23:35,354
And I know we have an upcoming meeting slated for this very topic, I think in April.

1430
02:23:35,934 --> 02:23:40,696
So which is obviously like probably one of many meetings that we'll have on this topic.

1431
02:23:40,756 --> 02:23:48,439
So I just wanted to reinforce that this committee unanimously supported that effort.

1432
02:23:48,679 --> 02:23:50,860
And I think that would make us really attractive.

1433
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:53,381
Thank you.

1434
02:23:53,401 --> 02:23:55,982
That's a good point for persuasive writing.

1435
02:23:57,063 --> 02:23:57,883
Incorporate that.

1436
02:23:59,284 --> 02:24:04,687
and thank you member McLaughlin for bringing this forward and Dr Edward Vincent for taking the lead on it.

1437
02:24:04,787 --> 02:24:19,796
If we could maybe as a committee just get an update if we are going to submit an application who will be drafting that and make sure it's in my role as mayor, there's so many grant opportunities out there and I just am always on people to make sure they're meeting their deadlines.

1438
02:24:19,836 --> 02:24:24,718
So if we can just kind of get an update before the 26th to know if and when it went out, that'd be great.

1439
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:26,339
Okay, thank you.

1440
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:27,340
Yes.

1441
02:24:29,706 --> 02:24:37,934
Motion for an actual resolution or do you want anything voted on member McLaughlin?

1442
02:24:37,954 --> 02:24:39,035
Are you satisfied?

1443
02:24:40,096 --> 02:24:40,817
No, I'm satisfied.

1444
02:24:40,837 --> 02:24:48,304
I'll be in the webinar tomorrow and I'm sure Dr. Edward Vincent and I will talk more, but I'm satisfied with the presentation.

1445
02:24:48,682 --> 02:24:49,142
Thank you.

1446
02:24:49,463 --> 02:24:51,024
And member van de Kloet, my apologies.

1447
02:24:51,284 --> 02:24:51,504
Yes.

1448
02:24:52,605 --> 02:24:55,008
First, I want to thank Melanie for bringing it to our attention.

1449
02:24:55,748 --> 02:24:58,731
Melanie, I know you sent out information to us today.

1450
02:24:58,771 --> 02:25:00,572
Did that have the webinar link in it?

1451
02:25:01,473 --> 02:25:02,434
Yes, it does.

1452
02:25:02,574 --> 02:25:02,794
OK.

1453
02:25:03,715 --> 02:25:04,836
So thank you.

1454
02:25:07,779 --> 02:25:12,463
Paul has his hand up.

1455
02:25:12,943 --> 02:25:13,244
Thank you.

1456
02:25:15,353 --> 02:25:16,833
I don't know if we have negotiations.

1457
02:25:16,873 --> 02:25:23,635
I just wanna ask a question about when we will begin contract negotiations for contracts that are up this year.

1458
02:25:25,215 --> 02:25:28,215
And if that's what we're gonna talk about tonight, then that's fine.

1459
02:25:29,236 --> 02:25:36,257
But it seems like the teachers, the MTA contract is up and we have not begun any negotiations of any sort and I'm quite concerned.

1460
02:25:40,258 --> 02:25:41,258
Mayor, would you like me to respond?

1461
02:25:43,947 --> 02:25:46,628
That'd be great, thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1462
02:25:46,868 --> 02:26:08,033
I think that, just for background context purposes, I've seen negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement that's expiring at the end of June begin as early as the previous September and as late as the preceding April.

1463
02:26:08,893 --> 02:26:12,074
I think the latter is more unusual and probably not advisable.

1464
02:26:12,672 --> 02:26:30,736
I think the variable that distinguishes our current situation is that due to the conditions under which we're operating, we as in the administration, and then earlier this year, the representatives of the School Committee and the Negotiating Committee have been in very frequent communication with the union leadership.

1465
02:26:30,876 --> 02:26:35,417
And that's an ongoing dialogue that we've been having.

1466
02:26:37,638 --> 02:26:41,719
So I think that as a result of that, given where both parties sort of know where

1467
02:26:42,344 --> 02:26:51,412
each other stands, there maybe hasn't been as much of a sense of urgency to begin the formal dialogue related to a successor agreement.

1468
02:26:51,792 --> 02:26:55,215
But I think that, to your point, I think that time is approaching soon.

1469
02:26:56,196 --> 02:27:06,204
We've received only one communication amongst the 11 bargaining units inviting us to begin negotiations on a successor agreement.

1470
02:27:07,065 --> 02:27:10,348
That's usually sort of the traditional sort of starting gun is that,

1471
02:27:11,217 --> 02:27:16,161
the union will notify the district of their intent to enter into collective bargaining negotiations.

1472
02:27:16,241 --> 02:27:20,864
And so, as I said, I say that there is one, but I think that union represents three bargaining units.

1473
02:27:20,904 --> 02:27:21,585
So really three of 11.

1474
02:27:22,545 --> 02:27:37,556
And I think we'll be receiving more of those very soon and putting together, we'll be wanting to meet with the school committee and executive session to put together a set of bargaining priorities and goals prior to the initiation of that.

1475
02:27:37,616 --> 02:27:40,478
So I think, I don't think we're,

1476
02:27:41,126 --> 02:27:44,790
late necessarily, particularly because of the ongoing dialogue.

1477
02:27:44,810 --> 02:27:54,442
But I do think that we'll be seeking an audience with you in the very near future to begin that conversation in a more formal way.

1478
02:27:56,184 --> 02:27:56,504
Thank you.

1479
02:27:56,524 --> 02:27:59,628
I just want to be clear that when I first came into office,

1480
02:28:00,897 --> 02:28:05,521
I was brand new and I just hit the rubber stamp button like most new members do.

1481
02:28:06,462 --> 02:28:09,704
Even though I thought there were things that we should have done different, it was just too late.

1482
02:28:10,865 --> 02:28:14,748
So I kept notes of the things I thought we should have done differently.

1483
02:28:14,788 --> 02:28:19,332
And I hope we don't get expected to hit the rubber stamp button just because it's a COVID year.

1484
02:28:20,233 --> 02:28:23,115
Because I'm not really interested in that myself, but thank you.

1485
02:28:26,918 --> 02:28:27,338
Thank you both.

1486
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:32,440
We have a number of condolences.

1496
02:30:03,849 --> 02:30:06,029
If we all may take a moment of silence, please.

1497
02:30:16,331 --> 02:30:16,631
Thank you.

1498
02:30:22,026 --> 02:30:25,408
I don't believe we have any negotiations in legal matters, so.

1499
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:28,430
