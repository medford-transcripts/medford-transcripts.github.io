 这是2024年3月13日人权委员会的会议。
 这取决于你，巴克利警长。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=13.853s">[Jack Buckley]</a>: 我是杰克·巴克利（Jack Buckley），曾担任警察局长、人权事务主管六年，并曾在人权委员会任职一段时间。
 莫琳。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=23.275s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 嗨，我是莫琳·柯利。
 我在梅德福生活了近 25 年，自秋天以来一直在委员会任职。
 戴安娜.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=33.332s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 嗨，我是黛安·麦克唐纳。
 我自去年 11 月或 2022 年 11 月以来一直在该委员会任职。
 埃斯特法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=39.577s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 大家好，斯蒂芬妮·康奈尔。
 我在梅德福生活了大约两年，从秋天开始就加入了该委员会。
 我会把它转给罗布。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=54.688s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 您好，Rob Klein，自 2014 年起居住在梅德福，自 2020 年起担任委员会成员。我想我是最后一位委员。
 我也在电话中看到了萨娜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=70.302s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 是的。
 谢谢罗布。
 您是最后一位委员。
 我要打断萨娜的演讲，直到表演时间为止。
 有委员想看一下CDH的会议和标准吗？
 我可以做到这一点。
 嗯，谢谢斯蒂芬。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=91.663s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 是的。
 出席、欢迎、欢迎。
 会议顺序是委员会先开会讨论议程。
 在会议议程结束时，邀请公众发表评论。
 说话前请举手，避免打断别人。
 为自己说话，并以尊重他人真相的方式说出自己的真相； 承认他人的生活经历，以促进人的尊严； 深入倾听； 相信，有可能焕然一新、感到惊讶、不那么不知所措； 期待并接受当事情变得困难时，没有结束的感觉； 再次问自己。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=138.743s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 非常感谢。
 干得好，巴克利警长。
 下一个就是你了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=145.287s">[Jack Buckley]</a>: 谢谢你，弗朗西斯科，也谢谢你从一开始就把我列入议程。
 今晚我道歉。
 我正在处理至少一个警察问题，然后我必须参加另一场公开会议。
 所以除了我自己，我不能留下来。
 我认为至少参加今晚会议的开始很重要，因为我有一个请求。
 这是必需品。
 我要求提出一项动议，修改上个月批准的梅德福市议会决议，以支持与以色列和加沙有关的停火。
 如果本委员会以这种方式投票并允许我修改我的投票，我将寻求取消我的赞成票并插入我的弃权票。
 自上个月以来，我一直在思考这个话题，对这个话题进行了一些教育，有了一些更清晰的理解。
 在我看来，作为警察局长，
 我不能也不应该像今天许多政客那样对存在分歧的社区问题进行投票。
 我知道，作为警察局长和人权委员会成员，我并不总是能够避免分裂政治，但我必须努力保持中立。
 原因是我必须为我们社区的所有成员提供警察服务、公共安全和保护。
 我想澄清的是：我的动议、我要求再次投票或改变投票的动议，并不是质疑本人权委员会认可、拒绝或发表声明本身的权利的动议。
 但我可以说，我们都非常了解彼此，你们中的许多人已经认识我六年了。
 正如这些问题中简要讨论的那样，我们都反对仇恨，特别是反犹太主义和仇视伊斯兰教。
 在某些方面，参与该委员会的每个人可能对所有这一切都有个人感受以及个人和政治观点。
 但我扮演着不同的角色。
 我可能会被要求调查反犹太主义和伊斯兰恐惧症的罪行。
 我认为保持中立非常非常重要。
 我要求将投票视为公平的晋升，让我简单地修改我的投票以弃权。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=298.692s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 巴克利局长，我只是想明确表示，您正在提出一项动议，改变您的投票，并在上个月关于人权委员会的支持或市议会的认可的投票中投弃权票，好吗？
 所以我们只需要另外一个人支持这项动议，如果没有人支持，那么你就可以记录下来，酋长。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=324.991s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，第二。
 我们尊重这一点，老板。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=330.852s">[Jack Buckley]</a>: 谢谢。
 我想我们现在需要投票，黛安？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=336.059s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 是的，有点啰嗦，但我想你们都知道我在说什么。
 所以巴克利酋长的动议是
 更改二月份的投票，我不记得确切的日期，我想是 2 月 14 日，将投票更改为对 CDH 支持或认可等等的决定弃权。
 我会把文字弄对的。
 但每个人都需要去。
 那我就吃爆米花吧，莫琳。
 是还是不是？
 活。
 戴安娜？
 活。
 一切都好吗，斯蒂芬？
 活。
 罗布呢？
 是的。
 好的，谢谢。
 因此，我不能投票，因为你知道有五位酋长，因为该动议是你的，并且你们都被认为是一致的，因为你提出了该动议并有四票赞成。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=398.592s">[Jack Buckley]</a>: 好吧，我只是想感谢你的考虑、尊重和理解，至少，如果有必要的话，有时很难将人与你的东西分开。
 但话虽这么说，我还是得走了。
 这很戏剧性，但我必须走了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=420.0s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 总有一天，老板，我们会明白的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=422.802s">[Jack Buckley]</a>: 我想下一场也会是亲自的，这让我时不时地跳起来。
 谢谢。
 这总是那些日子之一。
 我很欣赏这一点。
 祝你晚安。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=431.707s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 再见再见。
 小心。
 好吧，桑娜，非常感谢你忍受我们。
 委员们，如果我时不时提到桑娜，我们稍后做会议记录和其他事情，可以吗？
 好吧，谢谢。
 那么桑娜，轮到你了。
 来吧，介绍一下你自己并与我们分享你的演讲。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=459.591s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Thank you, members of the Human Rights Commission.
 My name is Sana Fadel.
 I'm the deputy director at Citizens for Juvenile Justice.
 We are a statewide organization, a statewide policy organization that advocates for young people who are at risk of or with legal system involvement.
 We do our work statewide, and I appreciate being able to meet with you all on this.
 So I'm actually here asking for your support or endorsement of legislation that deals with youth justice reforms called Raise the Age.
 It is a legal system reform, but I do want to talk about it because it's both an economic and racial justice issue.
 So this is the bill.
 It's a bill that was filed by Rep.
 O'Day from West Boylston, Rep.
 Cruz from Salem, and Senator Friendly from Lynn.
 This bill is currently pending in the Judiciary Committee, and what it does, it ends the automatic prosecution of a teenager, older teens, as adults, and moves them into the juvenile justice system.
 So I'm just gonna give you a little bit of background on why we even have this campaign.
 This campaign started several years ago, because when we looked at issues of recidivism in Massachusetts, what we saw was that young people have the highest recidivism rate of any age group.
 So when we talk about recidivism, there's different decision points that young people come back to the system on.
 So we look at two specific ones.
 One is rearrangement, which means you come in, you've been convicted of another crime, you've served your time, and now you're back in court again and you have a totally new crime.
 That's the rearrangement.
 The second one is reconviction.
 That means you've come out of the incarceration, you've come out and you have a totally new crime and you've been found guilty of it.
 So when we looked at this, we say, what is our legal system doing with young people?
 So we have two systems.
 One is our juvenile system, which if a young person between the ages of 12 up to 17, right before their 18th birthday, if they're in conflict with the law, they would be part of the juvenile justice system.
 If they're 18 and over, they wouldn't be in adult criminal justice system.
 This data looks at,
 kids who have, young people who have been incarcerated, because that's the deepest end of the system.
 Every point of the legal system says, are you someone that we want to keep out of society because of a crime you've been alleged to commit?
 And, you know, from the point of arrest all the way to sentencing, that's the question it asks.
 So all of these young people have been incarcerated.
 The legal system says, yes, we found you liable.
 We're going to incarcerate you.
 So what are we buying with that legal system, right?
 We're looking at do young people come out better off, less likely to commit crime.
 And what I want to show you here is when we look at teenagers, we're doing two very different systems have two very different outcomes.
 So our juvenile system does serve the incarceration quite does serve young people up until the 21st birthday.
 So there is some overlap.
 The data isn't perfect because we're looking at 18 to 24 versus 21 and under.
 However, overall, when we look at recidivism, young people coming out of the adult system are almost like a one and a half times more likely to be rearranged and more than double the likelihood to be reconvicted.
 I'm hyper on this because
 those are all the same young people.
 They're all adolescents, especially when they're talking about anybody under the age of 21, by pediatric standards, they're all adolescents.
 Well, not up to that age.
 But we have two very, so their development is the same, their offense, what they get arrested for is the same.
 Everything about them is the same, except how do we interact with them as a society?
 And that's what this campaign is about.
 So when we look at young people,
 that age group, like the 18 to 20 year olds is really the heart of this campaign.
 These are young people who would be in high school or they'd be just starting in college.
 Their brains, everything in their life is designed to learn.
 So wherever you put them, they're gonna learn that environment they're in.
 So if you put them in environments that are more toxic, that prevent them from meeting developmental milestones, you're actually increasing the likelihood of them re-offending.
 So things like, you know,
 is our intervention likely to help them or derail them from getting a job, having a family, getting a home, or having stable housing, finishing education, all of those things, if we put barriers to those, we're more likely to have them come back for totally new crime.
 And this is supported by research.
 So this pathway to desistance study came out of,
 It was housed in the University of Pittsburgh, but several universities were involved across the country.
 They tracked 1,300 young people.
 All of them were adolescents.
 Every single one of them committed a serious or violent offense.
 And they did monthly check-ins with them for a seven-year period.
 And they asked the question, why do some of these young people with these offenses desist from crime?
 And why do some of them persist in crime?
 And by the nature of the study, the offense itself is not, the severity of this offense itself is not an indicator of future offending, which is one of the things, you know, our laws are like the more serious offense, the higher the risk that you're presented to society.
 This, just the premise of the study says, it's actually not the case.
 And this is what they look for.
 They look for serious offense, how often they offended, socioeconomic status, education, housing, income, substance use, mental health,
 race, geography, family status, like everything you can possibly think of.
 And they found not a single one of them had an impact on future funding.
 Only two things did.
 The first was the belief in the legitimacy of authority.
 And the second is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 I will translate those into English.
 The first one is, do you believe that whenever you do something, that you have some kind of control of what happens to you?
 That the person in authority is going to treat you in what you perceive as fair?
 That means, every time I go to the store, will I always be followed?
 You know what?
 It doesn't matter.
 I've been labeled as a criminal regardless of my behavior.
 That is a risk factor of having someone re-effect.
 So when you say, and I've seen this play out in the young people I work with, they do not, it's not, it's less likely of how harsh the punishment was or the consequence was.
 It's the was, did I get it, was it fair?
 So if it was, if I perceived it as fair, even if it was harsh,
 I will say those young people are much more likely to start reoffending because, you know what, I knew I took that risk and I got what I deserved.
 That's what this means.
 So when we do all this work around racial justice and the criminal justice system, it is not just because it's ethical and moral and the right thing to do, it is also a public safety measure in our legal system.
 The second piece which is relevant for this bill is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 So do you have any children or adolescents in your lifetime?
 It means as a baby, can you feed yourself?
 Can you talk?
 Can you walk?
 Can you do full paragraphs?
 When it comes to adolescents, can you have judgment?
 Can you think before you act and think about the consequences?
 Those are all things that young people develop gradually over time.
 And what the researchers found was if the intervention itself blocks a young person's ability to meet those developmental milestones, they're much more likely to persist in crime.
 The likelier they are to meet those developmental milestones on time, the much sooner they will desist from re-offending.
 And those things that young people need to meet developmental milestones are education, employment or skills,
 family connection, physical or mental health, and civic and social engagement.
 So when we look at these systems, this is what we're looking at.
 Those systems, when you're in the adult system, you have a quarry.
 That's a huge barrier to education and employment.
 There's no impact, there is, unlike the juvenile system that looks at education as a priority, education in the adult system is pretty rare when it comes to this age population.
 Family connections, sorry, you're 18, you're on your own, there's no role for family, where even if you're under 21 in the juvenile system, family always has a role.
 Civic engagement, part of the education, our K through 12 frameworks include civic engagement.
 That is the kind of, if you're in DYS, that framework is in the education in DYS.
 So when we're talking about this, that's what we're talking about intervention.
 And in addition, it's also a racial justice issue.
 So this is looking at incarceration.
 Again, the data, we have pretty decent data in the juvenile system.
 Our adult system data is pretty lacking.
 So I try to do the best we can.
 This is looking at rates of incarceration between white men and boys compared to black men and boys.
 We have data on Latino kids.
 The federal data does not exist in a usable way.
 That's the only reason I only look at that.
 But when we look at this, we see that racial disparities for our 18 and 19-year-olds is the highest of any age group.
 And that's something that's consistent across the country, not just in Massachusetts.
 When we look at this one, we know that our legal system, and we're not saying our juvenile justice system is great, right?
 The difference is,
 Our juvenile justice system has both federal and state requirements to reduce racial disparities.
 So we measure it.
 It's still not fixed, right?
 Not gonna say it's there, but the requirement does not exist anywhere in the adult system.
 So when we look at these disparities, we have disparities where it's not just the over-representation and the sheer number, it's the collateral consequences
 that the class is falling disproportionately falling on young men of color.
 So it means you have a system that is less developmentally appropriate.
 So you don't get what you need to mature and get reintegrate back fully into society.
 The focus on punishment and rather than development means you don't get those skills as you mature.
 And then you have the collateral consequences that are pretty severe.
 So there are collateral consequences to juvenile adjudications as well as adult convictions.
 However, the adult conviction collateral consequences are much more significant and many of them are mandatory.
 So no matter what, you have those collateral consequences stick no matter what.
 And then when I talk about this as an economic justice issue, I'm assuming many of you know about, every sector I talk about,
 That we have a labor crisis, we have a labor crisis.
 That's always been the case.
 The labor crisis has actually been, and I was following what economists have been saying, they've been raising that flag at least 2016, 2017, so before COVID.
 What they said in Massachusetts, we have a rate of baby boomers retiring at a higher rate than young people entering into our workforce.
 COVID just made it worse.
 And the recovery from COVID, we just have not been able, there's been some recovery, but we haven't been able to get back to where we were before, where that crisis has been a long time in the coming.
 So the arguments are, first, let's talk about the young person themselves.
 If a young person is involved in an adult system,
 where it does not look at their education and having a quarry limits your ability to get a job.
 That limits that young person's own lifetime earnings potential.
 If you look at it from the labor market, when we say all of these young people are less likely to contribute to our labor market, that means our businesses are not able to hire.
 We have a labor shortage that we say, we need more young people.
 except those young people, right?
 You're not, we think those are, and this is, they're just not going to be part of the equation.
 They're not part of the denominator.
 And then when we do that, we're basically saying that group
 So every generation, we have a cohort of young people that just have a lifetime exclusion from fully integrating into our society.
 And that means us as a commonwealth don't benefit from their economic participation in our economy.
 And ultimately, our legal system is not an equal opportunity employer.
 We talked about the fact that the legal system targets low-income communities and communities of color disproportionately.
 That means when you look at where young people are excluded from our economy, excluded from our education and employment opportunities, they tend to be concentrated in those same communities that they come from, which means those communities, the economic potential of those communities is also diminished.
 And then finally,
 Going back to my first slide, we have a potential of reducing crime if we deal with young people in a developmentally appropriate way.
 Reducing crime also means we're also benefiting our taxpayers as a whole.
 We have less people who are victimized and require some kind of repair.
 Our legal system is not going to be as, you know, having all the workings of the legal system, we just won't have as much if we have,
 Again, it's not a criminal justice panacea, I'm not solving everything, but for those young people, shrinking that potential has an economic impact.
 And just conclude with just the thought that this is not new.
 I actually wanna say that our legal system is far behind the rest of our society in looking at young people under the age of 21 as adolescents.
 I started off by talking about pediatrics.
 Pediatricians work with young people
 under 21 and up to 21 and maybe sometimes older, depending on their medical needs, that's been going on for a long, long time.
 You can't drink, you can't smoke pot or smoke tobacco or gamble or own a gun or be a police officer until you're 21.
 There's also all sorts of other milestones because
 You can start a job at 14, you can get your driver's license at 16, but with lots of limitations until you're 18.
 But you can pre-register to vote because we want you to vote by 18.
 But then all these other things we want to delay.
 You can't rent a car until you're 25.
 You can be on your parents' health insurance until 26.
 Because our society does not have a hard line of adults.
 we have a transition to adulthood, which means things that we want young people to grow up and make up into a habit into your adulthood, we want to encourage you to do more of that younger.
 The younger you are, the more likely you're going to stick.
 Things that are a risk to yourself or to others, which we believe legal system involvement is one of those, we want to delay so that when you are more mature, you can make those decisions and it's less likely to stick.
 So, I'm just going to end with just what I would love for this commission to consider ways of supporting.
 So, like this is legislation that's out there.
 I shared ahead of time fact sheets about this legislation, but there's many things that you could do to support.
 And just so you know, I've been trying to meet with all the human rights commissions across the state, and some of them are able to endorse, and some of them are like, oh, we're part of the state government, we can, but there's other ways to support.
 So these are all just ideas of things you can do if this is something you want to support.
 They could go from formal endorsement to we'll just make some connections or we'll publicize it to let our constituents know or our residents know about it.
 But without us, depending on, or we can say yes, we'll support it.
 We'll send our legislators a letter in support.
 It's really up to you all.
 So I just want to thank you for this opportunity.
 This is my contact information and I would love to open up to any questions.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1505.795s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 非常感谢您的介绍。
 看来我们的一位专员已经走了。
 我不知道。
 我稍后会回来看看他们是否正在尝试重新连接。
 但我们其他三位委员对此有疑问吗？
 有什么问题想问萨娜吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1532.503s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 嗨，索娜，我叫斯蒂芬。
 谢谢您的介绍。
 你好，索娜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1536.987s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 这是...你好，罗布。
 史蒂芙只是在说话。
 当斯蒂芬完成后我会通知你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1550.397s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 谢谢您的介绍。
 当你谈论某种发展里程碑时，这是否是目前青少年系统所面临的？
 您是否拥有或应该向青少年系统添加额外的资金或资源，以帮助支持比该年龄段更年轻的人度过这些发展里程碑？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1576.58s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 所以我们的青训体系已经具备了。
 所以我们有
 因此，自 20 世纪 70 年代以来，马萨诸塞州在青少年司法改革方面一直处于全国领先地位。
 我们进行了五年的改革，并在 20 世纪 70 年代关闭了所有少年监狱。
 90年代很糟糕。
 我们对国家和这里都是不利的。
 但自 2003 年以来，DYS 特别关注这种积极的青少年发展，努力减少监禁，认识到监禁有危害，
 从那时起，它就一直在增长，就好像一开始就没有最大限度地减少监禁的使用一样。
 所以这就好像，哦，我们必须这样做，教育一直存在，但我们需要优化它。
 现在我们在卫生部门工作。
 现在我们想要制定下一个战略，我们目前的战略计划是围绕住房保障展开的。
 所以所有这些东西一直都在那里，而且每年都在积累。
 但一种积极的青少年发展理念已经成为我们少年司法体系的一部分。
 我指的不仅仅是 DYS、缓刑、法院、公设辩护人和地方检察官。
 每个人都会看着青少年说：我们的工作就是帮助他们成熟。
 有很多像我们这样的组织，因为我们需要进行宣传，以确保我们让这些机构负责实现这些目标。
 但至少这些是目标。
 所以我们有经验，我们有能力。
 现在有一个关于数字的问题。
 该法案本身并未同时涵盖所有 18 至 20 岁的人。
 首先，我们的目标是18岁。
 这是一个较小的数字。
 开发该系统，认识到可能需要将一些资金从成人系统转移到青少年系统，以服务 19 岁并最终为 20 岁的人。
 这就是佛蒙特州制造的模型。
 佛蒙特州是迄今为止唯一将年龄提高到 18 岁以上的州。
 截至 2020 年，他们已有 18 岁的孩子，预计今年夏天将他们纳入其中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1710.314s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1714.818s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 谢谢萨娜。
 好的，罗布，如果你能听到我的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1720.262s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，我有你。
 谢谢。
 并对我上面的奇怪音频表示歉意。
 你已经回答了我的问题之一。
 其他州或社区已成功实施此类政策。
 很高兴知道我们最近的邻居之一正在做这样的事情，因为这确实是一个非常重要的问题和变化。
 为此，他提到了我们可以帮助您倡导和表达我们支持的几种不同方式。
 我认为你说的是​​正式认可或致立法机关人员的信函。
 您是否有任何可用资源来表明这些不同的选项用于表达支持和倡导？
 如果存在的话，我们是否拥有它们或可以访问它们？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1768.653s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 那么，弗朗西斯，你有那个寻呼机，对吧，上面有经济影响声明？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1773.738s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 是的，我有一个寻呼机。
 事实上，我想问是否可以提供该演示文稿，因为将其包含在我们的会议记录中会很好，因为我们有人可能会通过不同的方式收听并且可能对此感兴趣。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1793.786s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 我很高兴。
 之后我很乐意向您发送此 PowerPoint 的 PDF 版本。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1797.288s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 好吧，那就太棒了。
 非常感谢。
 然后我会得到 PDF。
 我会将版本发送给所有委员，我相信委员们已经有了第一页。
 如果你还没有的话我可以再发一次。
 大家还有其他问题吗。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1820.503s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 我已经习惯了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1823.938s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 非常感谢桑娜。
 我很欣赏这一点。
 我会与您联系。
 非常感谢大家。
 我真的很感激你。
 谢谢。
 一切都好。
 小心。
 一切都好。
 那么，我们要回到我们错过的地方吗？
 必须有人提出动议才能批准 2024 年 2 月的会议纪要。
 并且必须有人支持他。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1862.174s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 批准上个月会议记录的动议。
 还有第二个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1870.16s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 莫琳排第二？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1873.082s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的，这是正确的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1878.977s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 非常好，棒极了。
 所以现在只是快速投票。
 黛安，是、不还是弃权？
 只需快速致电即可获得批准。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1893.07s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 哦，打电话，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1895.852s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 是的，好的。
 斯蒂芬？
 活。
 噢，这很有趣，莫琳。
 你们有两个人，其中一个迟到了。
 你们中的一个在走路，另一个已经坐着了。
 但没关系，无论是或否，无论莫琳是谁。
 Immacula 和 Rob，接受还是不接受二月份的会议纪要？
 活。
 嗯，谢谢罗布。
 完美无瑕？
 是的，一切都很好，谢谢。
 谢谢。
 一切都好。
 在下一个议程中，黛安，您请求公证人帮助您完成三月和四月的会议记录。
 我已经开始为三月做一些笔记，所以我要完成它。
 有专员可以帮忙做四月份的记录吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1972.214s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 我可能无法参加我要告诉你的四月份的会议。
 所以我不能自愿这样做，因为我可能不会在这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1983.321s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 好的。
 进行测试。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1987.984s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 一切都好。
 谢谢，斯蒂芬。
 谢谢，斯蒂芬。
 谢谢，斯蒂芬。
 是的。
 好的，Sian，轮到你查看日历了。
 抱歉，我没有从文件夹中取出日历。
 你有吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2008.932s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 哦好的。
 我已将其打开，因此我将单击“共享屏幕”并打开我的 Word 文件。
 请稍等一下。
 大家都能看到这个吗？
 不。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2025.218s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 没有啊，有机会分享一下吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2028.241s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 我不知道。
 啊，我以为我按了按钮。
 哦不，它说主机已禁用屏幕共享，抱歉。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2033.926s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 非常好，现在就尝试一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2041.673s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 完美的。
 好吧，现在你能看到吗？
 是的。
 因此，我们原本计划在本月晚些时候的妇女历史月期间与王室和森扎拉一起举办贝琳达庆祝活动。
 老实说，我有点在水下。
 这是我工作最忙的时候。
 我还见到了基拉·辛格尔顿（Kiera Singleton），她有很多事情要做。
 如果您一直关注新闻，您会发现她已被招募到波士顿市的赔偿工作组。
 所以她一直非常忙碌。
 我们正在讨论将 6 月 19 日更改为 6 月的公共假期。
 6 月 19 日是星期三。
 那么大家愿意组织这个活动吗？
 它确实非常适合解放，也适合我们北方的奴隶制历史。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2112.908s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 所以，澄清一下，黛安，我们不是东道主，王室才是东道主，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2118.531s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 这就是我们的样子...这就是我们的样子，对吧？
 就像我们去年二月份为黑人历史月举办的活动一样，弗朗西斯，我不知道我用的词是否正确，所以请随时纠正我，因为有时候，我想去年，它是合作伙伴还是赞助商？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2140.324s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 基本上，HRC 将与王室合作组织这次活动。
 我现在可以告诉你，尽管这个日期看起来不错，但西梅德福社区中心将在这一天庆祝六月节。
 所以我推荐
 将活动保留到明年或另选日期，因为该市将在前一天升起六月节旗帜，因为六月节是公共假期。
 遗憾的是西梅德福社区中心和王室就在街对面，我们可以在那里建立这种三方合作伙伴关系并度过美好的一天。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2201.163s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 现在是 6 月 18 日。
 如果我们在19号放假期间组织这个活动，有可能吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2208.995s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 实际的假期是西梅德福社区中心组织的日子。
 哦。
 前一天是该市升起 6 月 16 日旗帜的日子。
 哦好的。
 我们前一天升旗是因为那天城市关闭。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2229.481s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 嗯，我明白了。
 您知道西梅德福社区中心的活动时间是几点吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2238.442s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 我现在不知道，但这将是一件大事。
 再次强调，我强烈建议您不要在同一天将其放入。
 是的，他们正计划这样做……我不想透露太多，因为这还不是一成不变的。
 你知道，这都是我们必须进行的对话的一部分，以确保我们的活动相辅相成，并且不会变得......
 就像，我想这将是漫长的一天。
 我想那会是一个下午，可能是中午 12 点到下午 4 点，这是他们通常做的时间，是的。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2277.577s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 所以我要和 Kiara 谈谈，也许会有另一个支点，或者我们会把她留到明年。
 大家都还好吗？
 当然。
 你觉得怎么样，弗朗西斯科？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2292.471s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 我的意思是，我想这取决于你。
 我支持把它推迟到明年，或者可能在年底举行另一场庆祝活动，你知道，那是合适的。
 好，好。
 也许在某些重要的日子里，这一点会得到落实。
 我必须看看今天的国家日历才能提出一些建议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2324.62s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，那么让我们修复一切。
 所以也许我会在下次会议上更新。
 所以，谢谢大家。
 因为人们真的很喜欢它。
 是的，是的，完全正确。
 很好，很棒。
 所以这个日历的其他元素非常简单，四月，有地球日，然后是弗朗西斯，我已经将所有即将推出的黑人健康系列添加到了梅德福公共图书馆的这个日历中。
 就是这样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2366.195s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 嗯，太棒了，非常感谢你，黛安。
 我只是想确保所有委员都发出某种信号，表明他们同意暂时取消 6 月份 Belinda Sutton 活动的讨论。
 你们都好吗？
 当然，是的。
 那么很好
 所以，黛安娜和弗朗西斯，我们将考虑其他日期。
 我将分享一些建议，然后将其发送给团队，以便他们为四月份的会议做好准备。
 因为请记住，您在六月会议后去度假，直到九月才回来。
 嗯，莫琳，我想在奥斯汀律师加入我们之前我还有三分钟的时间。
 那么我就带大家来聊聊PRIDE。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2441.175s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的，它实际上是一个非常小的元素。
 上次会议上只是提到我们过去曾参与赞助过一次骄傲活动。
 我很好奇那是什么。
 我在城市日历上找不到任何内容，或者我只是想查找有关它的信息。
 我不知道是否有人知道这是我当时唯一的承认。
 参与其中似乎是合乎逻辑的事情。
 但我不提出任何建议。
 今年尝试做任何事情可能都已经太晚了。
 有人有这方面的经验吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2474.619s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 因此，HRC 没有赞助骄傲活动。
 2022 年，当该市举办首次年度理事会活动时，人权委员会挑选了两名成员撰写一份声明，在骄傲升旗仪式上宣读。
 那是经过一些谈判之后，所以我认为你可以回来。
 我的意思是四月、四月、2022 年 4 月。
 以及 2022 年 5 月会议的图片。
 看吧，但这实际上只是升旗期间演讲系列的一部分。
 这是CDH可以反思的。
 如果 CDH 想要更大的份额，如果 CDH 想要最小的份额。
 但请记住，当您说赞助时，这意味着您实际上正在做某事。
 所以这意味着
 你正在买食物。
 因此，就好像午餐是由 HRC 赞助的或者您正在主办该活动一样。
 所以这是分开的。
 但如果 CDH 有兴趣参加升旗活动，您可以讨论并告诉我您对参与的设想。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2569.347s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 我在今年的城市日历上寻找但没有找到的一件事是提及城市。
 持续活动。
 我在哪里可以找到这个？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2581.437s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 你不会在日历上找到它，因为我按照市长的日程安排工作，而今年的骄傲节是在星期六，这让事情变得更加困难。
 骄傲月从星期六开始。
 因此，如果市长不在，市政厅周六就会关闭，而且你知道周六升旗要困难得多。
 我也喜欢非常有目的。
 随着这些事件。
 这不仅仅是人们聚集在一起。
 你知道，必须有一个目的和意义。
 所以我在幕后与不同的人联系。
 一旦我从市长那里得到同意的日期，市长就会在那一天、那时、在一定的时间内有空，现在我必须连接幕后的所有其他点，移动并改变它们，然后我们才能说，好吧，这是坚定的“是”。
 但我可以肯定地说，我只想说，这座城市不会寻求保留骄傲升旗日活动，并将其保留到 3 月 31 日。
 你知道，这听起来，你知道，这听起来很愚蠢，但是除了这些群体之外还有其他人。
 这是我的 DPW 团队。
 我必须确保它们已经准备好，标牌、油漆没有剥落，它们已经重新粉刷过，我们有新油漆，并且有人在早上第一件事就是把这些标牌贴起来。
 因此，在该日期出现在电子邮件中之前，幕后发生了很多事情。
 我的意思是，它在日历上。
 不知道这个城市之前是怎么做的。
 我不知道。
 但这就是过去两年的运作方式。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2686.885s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 所以我猜我想做什么。
 我们的建议是今年可能不会。
 看起来好像很多。
 我不知道，在广播中我无法理解，也许我会说，如果这个机构明年能做点什么，那就太好了，然后如果我们可以的话，如果今年为时已晚，或者我不确定发生了什么，这似乎非常不确定。
 我们可以。
 我想，我们自己做点什么吧。
 我们不必在城市的参数范围内这样做。
 所以我只是向我的同事们建议，这实际上是我们正在考虑的事情，我们明年可能会做，无论我们是在寻找其他非营利组织还是我不知道是否有人感兴趣。
 我正在观察每个人是否有兴趣共同完成某件事。
 所有这些感觉就像，你知道，现在感觉我不确定。
 有点像当我们试图安排一些事情时，协调所有其他小组，你知道，这是一个更大的挑战。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2748.939s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 有人……是的，莫琳，我实际上不确定真正的问题是什么。
 你是的，因为你说事情似乎悬而未决。
 我只是想明确表示，这座城市已经举办了两年的升旗仪式并没有举行。
 这确实正在发生。
 因此，在我们让人们正在倾听和可能通过其他方式倾听的人之前，我想确保这一点非常非常清楚。
 您还没有看到日期的原因是今年恰逢周末。
 所以我必须改变策略。
 但是人权委员会非常欢迎A，你自己做点什么吧，
 像过去一样参加城市活动还是支持其他需求？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2808.045s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 好吧，我只是问我的同事们明年是否有兴趣自己做点什么。
 我不知道是否有，或者也许，你知道，我只是，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2822.128s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 我可以玩，是的，所以我认为无论是今年作为个人参加升旗，然后明年，是的，寻找一些东西，另一个合作机会，我们当然可以看看明年是否会发展。莫琳，我对此持开放态度并同意你的看法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2848.726s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 我认为，如果我们今年能够以任何方式参与，那就太好了，一旦明确了，比如具体时间、时间或其他什么。
 好的，太好了。
 我很乐意致力于我们能做的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2865.912s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，我完全支持今年和明年帮助举办这项活动的想法。
 如果我没记错的话，弗朗西斯，我想去年，
 您在整个六月在城市周围策划了几项活动来庆祝骄傲节，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2886.887s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 是的。
 2022 年和 2023 年，骄傲节将是为期一个月的庆祝活动。
 骄傲节在六月庆祝，但骄傲节实际上是十月的事情，这就是为什么有些州在十月庆祝骄傲节。
 所以这比仅仅举起旗帜要深刻得多。
 这其中有公民权利的成分。
 如果我忠于自己的角色和专业工作，那就太好了。
 我认可民权运动。
 在这背后，是残疾人的自豪感和权利，
 你们都以某种方式、形状或形式联系在一起。
 因此，当我们举办为期一个月的活动时，在那个月内发生一些事情对我来说很重要。
 这并不一定意味着你必须做每项活动，但即使我们正在制作一个日历，你知道，显示并为人们提供 02155 中发生的不同事情的选择，我认为这也是健康的。
 这对那些从 LGBTQ 群体成员造成的创伤中恢复的人，或者对那些认为自己想住在墨西哥的人有帮助，对吧？
 自从我来到这里，这两年，每一次，你知道，至少每周都会发生一些事情，如果不是每周两次的话。
 但我不是，我不对他们每一个人负责。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2986.869s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 第一年是的，但第二年……我想这就是我想要达到的目标，不仅仅是升旗。
 并不是说飘扬旗帜不酷，而是我想知道这个团体是否会对，你知道，
 看看明年六月我们也许还能做些什么。
 我认为至少有几个人表示他们对此感兴趣。
 那么那就太好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3013.797s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 把这件事提上日程吧。
 我会说出来，然后由你把它记在日历上。
 我要把它放在公园里，这样它就会不断旋转。
 但奥斯汀律师现在就在我们身边，我想将电话转给 KP Law 的奥斯汀律师。
 对于公开会议法律的审查和同一主题的讨论，每个人都应该已经收到更新的 48 页公开会议法律文件。
 所以我希望你已经准备好你的问题了，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3057.75s">[Austin]</a>: 谢谢大家今晚邀请我来这里。
 也谢谢你，弗朗西斯科。
 很高兴见到大家。
 我认为这是一个好机会。
 如您所知，有一位新的代理总检察长，总检察长办公室最近更新了公开会议的法律指南。
 我始终认为，对已经服务了一段时间的会员和新会员进行一点复习是个好主意，只需向他们提供公开会议法的基础知识即可。
 在全州范围内，我们看到对公开会议法的质疑和投诉有所增加。
 我这样说是为了让每个人真正了解我们所生活的环境，尤其是在一个依靠技术的使用而蓬勃发展的环境中。
 我在与英联邦各城镇的公开会议中处理许多法律事务，自 2006 年以来一直从事这项工作。我希望这是一次真正非正式的会议，能够回答任何人的问题。
 我当然可以提供一个概述，而且我知道弗朗西斯科也分发了一些材料。
 我总是按照时间顺序开始并思考公开培训会议或概述。
 会议通知经会议纪要批准后予以公布。
 这就是我对连续体的看法。
 因此，我们收到警告，我们知道，像您这样的公共机构的法定人数所讨论的任何事情通常都必须在我们所谓的公开会议上完成，而不是在执行会议上，这意味着向公众开放，以便能够看到您的工作。
 实时。
 当我们今晚在这里时，这可以在 Zoom 上完成。
 这可以亲自完成。
 我们将四年前于 2020 年开始的远程订单延长至 2025 年 3 月 31 日。
 我们相信还有许多悬而未决的立法，这些立法将从这些立法中得到扩展。
 有很多谈判。
 必须采取哪些流程来继续这一工作。
 这就是为什么我们正在密切监视它，并将随时向您通报最新情况。
 但现在我们可以在 Zoom 上见面。
 我们从议程开始。
 所有事情都必须纳入议程，并在讨论内容方面具有合理的具体性。
 这意味着什么？
 嗯，这意味着坐在家里的公众会拿起或查看屏幕上的会议通知并进行实际分析。
 我想参加这个会议吗？
 这是我想感兴趣的话题吗？
 我想看到关于这个特定主题的公开、透明的讨论吗？
 所以我总是说，当你在社区工作或做志愿者时，你了解所使用的语言或缩写词，例如所使用的语言，但我们真的很想成为这样的人，你知道。
 向公众提供信息，以便他们可以自行决定是否参与。
 这些是会议通知的基础知识。
 我们知道，除非有紧急情况，否则需要提前48个工作小时发布，真正确保在公共机构的业务方面没有不发布的讨论。
 这是会议通知的概述。
 然后我们开始商议并在会议上讨论什么。
 我们知道没有理由参加执行会议，我很乐意回答有关此问题的任何问题。
 我们知道，公共机构的事务必须在公开会议上进行。
 这意味着公共机构的任何法定人数都不能以团体或系列的形式，从一个成员到另一个成员讨论问题。
 在正式公布的会议之外。
 如果我们退一步，公共记录法和公开会议法的目的是，你知道，我们称它们为太阳能法，以提高透明度并确保公众知道他们的社区正在发生什么。
 从这个意义上说，随着技术的使用，我们看到了增长。
 我总是警告这只是一个概述，所以今晚我们不会详细讨论。
 但我始终警告不要使用电子邮件、手机或短信与其他成员交流。
 根据公开会议法和公共记录法，这都具有法律意义。
 所以只是要意识到这一点。
 在这一具体问题上，我们从总检察长的开放政府部门得到了很多指导。
 包括多年前的许多裁决，这些裁决规定，一个成员向另一个成员发送电子邮件或短信，然后对其进行回复，无论是连续还是在正确发布的会议之外以小组形式再次回复，都可能构成审议。
 所以这是需要注意的事情。
 在投票和讨论方面，我们知道公共机构的业务是由公共机构的法定人数进行的。
 如果没有法定人数，这项业务肯定无法完整开展。
 总检察长办公室建议，如果没有达到法定人数，则不应举行会议并推迟到公共机构法定人数可以开会和召开的其他时间，无论是亲自还是远程，无论委员会的偏好如何。
 从那里我们知道会议纪要必须及时编写和批准。
 我们通常说这会在接下来的 30 天或三次会议中发生，根据您的会议安排以先到者为准。
 但当然，就像会议通知或议程一样，您必须小心，确保坐在家里的人得到会议纪要的副本并真正了解发生了什么。
 我们知道你必须有一些基本信息，你知道的，会议的日期和时间，出席或缺席的成员。
 如果会议是远程会议，则必须采用唱名表决方式，并且将进行所有投票。
 再说一次，有人，我称之为四角规则，有人记录会议记录，真正了解投票了哪些票，做了什么，你知道，有人知道会议中实际发生了什么吗？
 从那时起，这些会议记录将受到公开会议法和公共记录法的约束。
 社区成员当然可以提出要求。
 如果有执行会议，则这些会议记录有单独的流程。
 但同样，它们的起草方式必须精确而详细。
 我很高兴回答任何细节。
 我知道这是一次公开会议。
 这就是为什么我总是说我们所处的位置仅供一般信息参考。
 如果您对我们在哪里担任市议员有具体问题，我只是要求您直接或通过弗朗西斯科联系我，就这些具体问题考虑到其特权性质，但我很乐意回答或提供任何主题的概述。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3505.093s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 珍妮尔，非常感谢你。
 您多次提到执行会议，自从我进入这个领域以来，我不必将会议变成执行会议。
 你能分享一点不同吗
 可能会加入我们的人，或者可能不熟悉执行会议是什么、为什么要召开执行会议，以及如果我们使用虚拟技术（我们没有虚拟技术）参加执行会议时会出现的一些参数。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3541.843s">[Austin]</a>: 好问题。
 可以这么说，我们从这个命题开始
 公共机构需要举行公开会议。
 再次，透明的太阳定律。
 原因已列出，我可以通过弗朗西斯科向所有成员提供摘要，说明公共机构可能进入执行会议的具体原因。
 执行会议实际上是秘密或机密会议。
 基本上，立法机关决定存在保密或隐私考虑，我们将讨论这意味着什么，以及什么证明对特定主题进行非公开讨论是合理的。
 我想说的是，在我看来，它们的解释非常狭隘。
 那么，例如，是否存在悬而未决的争议，如果公开讨论，可能会影响委员会的诉讼立场？
 并且确定对此事的公开讨论将影响案件或潜在案件。
 是否存在会触发某人隐私权的具体投诉？
 这是第一个目的。
 如果是这种情况，您应该让那个人知道。
 我们通常在就业方面更多地看到这一点。
 有没有具体的法律规定
 您在执行会议上开会。
 其中原因之一是审查执行会议的会议记录。
 我们知道您可以召开执行会议来审查它们。
 因此，他们做得非常非常严格。
 执行会议必须以与公开会议相同的方式发布，提前 48 小时，提前 48 工作小时，除非有紧急情况。
 本质上，您需要召开并发布公开会议和执行会议。
 您在公开会议中开始会议，在公开会议中继续，公众可以观看您投票结束并进入执行会议。
 正如我们今晚所看到的，使用像 Zoom 这样的电子或虚拟平台来完成这一任务的方式通常是由总统、董事会、委员会投票并说，让我们进入执行会议的公开会议。
 进行了唱名投票。
 然后举行分组讨论或提供单独的 Zoom 链接。
 然后，从技术角度来看，可以说，考虑到机密性，可以保证不存在公众成员。
 然后，执行会议的这些会议记录将保持机密，或者根据公开会议法不得公开发布，直到执行会议的目的到期为止。
 根据讨论的性质，如果有争议需要解决，例如对于某些公共机构而言，可能会很快解决，或者可能需要更长的时间，具体取决于所涉及的隐私利益。
 谢谢你，法国。
 谢谢你珍妮尔。
 谢谢。
 例如，还有其他问题或主题吗？
 我知道通常有很多关于电子产品的问题。
 讨论我们的电子产品、电子产品的使用。
 我很高兴介绍这一点，或者是否还有任何其他主题需要指导。
 我知道是这样，我知道您收到了该指南的副本，但还有很多东西需要消化。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3765.467s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 一般来说，我们有时遇到的挑战之一是......等一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3772.109s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 对不起，罗布。
 莫琳启动并提高了声音。
 不知道大家有没有遇到过延迟的情况呢？
 没关系，你没事。
 不，罗布，继续吧。
 好的，继续吧，罗布，然后是莫琳。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3790.22s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 谢谢你，莫琳。
 我会快点的。
 我只是考虑可能出现的电子邮件信息，如果有任何问题，我们希望对整个团队做出回应。
 到目前为止，我们还没有这样做，因为担心违反公开会议的规则，因为这是一次非常密切和封闭的沟通，通常不是审议。
 我很想听听你的意见。
 关于这是否合适或者我们应该继续避免做的事情。
 同样，这个例子是，您知道，发送了一些信息，我们希望对整个组做出回应。
 那时我们回复了弗朗西斯，然后她联系了该小组。这是我们应该遵循的流程吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3834.869s">[Austin]</a>: 好问题。
 因此，总检察长会说，根据公开会议法，电子邮件的唯一适当使用方式是：
 公共机构论坛应仅限于规划目的。
 您可以在 3 月 13 日参加六点钟的会议吗？
 您在这个特定时间有空吗？
 任何意见表达，即使涉及共享材料，并且有人做出回应（我认为是个好主意），都有可能违反公开会议法。
 如果有关于
 你知道，我们应该就这个特定话题见面吗？我们可以把这个列入会议议程吗？
 也许这封电子邮件会到达弗朗西斯科和总统。
 在文件沟通方面，我见过根据其实质程度而可能发生这种情况的裁决，但我认为任何意见或信念的表达都可能导致违反公开会议法。
 这是非常严格的。
 这背后的思考过程是，
 一般来说，我们都很忙，并且使用电子邮件和通信来处理很多事情，这可能会以某种方式变成实质性对话，或者成员可能会通过电子邮件根据其他成员的立场形成意见，而公众没有机会看到。
 这就是为什么我总是谈论最佳实践。
 在我看来，在这种情况下最好的做法是只沟通
 您知道，直接发送给弗朗西斯，或者可能发送给弗朗西斯和其他成员，但您不能转发任何基于意见的电子邮件。
 我知道这很困难。
 你知道，这个问题一直在出现，比如，我们可以，你知道，人们可以使用谷歌文档共享吗？或者我们，你知道，每个人都已经习惯了使用技术和开放会议，真的希望以这种方式完成业务吗？
 所以公众可以看到。
 这能回答你的问题吗，罗布？
 是的，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3966.135s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 好的，太好了。
 抱歉，太快了。
 作为专员会收到很多信息，无论是这位专员还是另一个委员会，他们可能在某个地方看到即将举行的培训或看到他们认为小组会感兴趣的东西。
 这些信息通常会发送给我或以某种形式存在于我的收件箱中。
 我发送。
 大家和我抄送发件人并代表某人分享，无需回复，有兴趣的请随时订阅。
 我知道有时人们觉得我正在关闭他们，因为我说没有必要回答，但我什至不需要得到完整的答案。
 这是为了避免最无辜的人，天哪，我参加了那个活动，太棒了。
 因为这就是意见的来源。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4024.346s">[Austin]</a>: 或者一些天真的事情，我认为这个活动很棒，我真的认为这对城市有益，我们应该考虑实施它。
 然后其他人回应每个人说：我同意。
 这本身就是一种意见的表达。
 在这种情况下，我认为最好的做法是由弗朗西斯科发送。
 而我合作的一些公共机构在底部有文字，这是出于公开会议法律的考虑，请不要回复所有人。
 这可以作为一个提醒，一种温和的提醒人们，并不是他们不想向选民或社区居民做出回应或提供反馈，但这实际上是在即将举行的会议上讨论的事情。
 有时议程上会提到培训机会或空乘人员的最新情况。
 然后会有一个部分可以讨论这些类型的问题，公众可以看到讨论。
 一些公共机构还会列出会议之间的信件，然后列出到达的不同信件。
 然后可能又会引起讨论
 成员之间就特定通讯员而言。
 所以这也是另一种选择。
 但是，与我合作的很多很多公共机构在会议结束时或在任何电子邮件中都有这样的警告语言：请避免完全这样回复，因为它可能，可能非常无意，但是如果有人提出公共记录请求，然后
 他们看到几个人在回应。
 这是否违反了公开会议法？
 所以你必须考虑所有的事情。
 莫琳，你有什么问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4139.648s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的，我做到了。
 我实际上有一些，但我会接受任何妨碍别人的东西。
 所以我仔细阅读了方济各将我们联系到的公开会议法。
 我没有看到任何提及我所说的委员会。
 举例来说，我们决定要计划一项特定活动或赞助某项活动。
 还有两个人，
 少于大多数人决定他们将致力于此。
 我们每个月只能在一个半小时内做这么多事情。
 有点令人沮丧的是我们没有太多时间。
 如果事实上的目的是让会议人数少于多数，并且目的是在下次会议上向更多的机构提供信息以便进行审议，那么这是否受公开会议法的约束？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4201.547s">[Austin]</a>: 然后，总检察长办公室将考虑小组委员会是否由公共机构设立的问题。
 通常情况下，如果它是主要公共机构的法定人数，如果有成员组成，这并不重要，而且它可以是，你知道，它不必是正式的小组委员会，它可以是一个工作组，一个工作组，任何类型，
 作为委员会的子集，如果投票决定 Rob 和 Maureen 将负责这一特定事件，你们将组建一个小组委员会或工作组，这可能会受到公共记录法的约束，对吗？
 你知道，人们当然需要理解并能够完成这项工作。
 我合作的一些社区会指定一个特定的社区，召开公开会议，并说，Maureen 将处理这个特定的问题，Rob 将处理这个特定的问题，然后我们将在下次会议上再次见面并重新组合。
 但如果一个公共机构做出具体决定将该工作委托给该公共机构的一个子集，那么我认为公开会议法可能会适用。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4279.631s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 所以你所说的，让我澄清一下，你是说，如果这个机构说我们投票支持莫林和罗布来解决这个问题，那将需要举行公开会议。
 如果他们没有投票而是说，是的，莫琳，你为什么不调查一下这个呢？
 你能告诉莫琳和罗布可以处理这个问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4298.376s">[Austin]</a>: 嗯，我想我们必须看看这个。
 我认为我们应该非常自由地看待这个问题。
 我的意思是，唯一的例外是如果市长，对，这不是
 根据公开会议法，你说我要请弗朗西斯、莫林和罗布代表我做某事，对吗？
 这一切都归结为，我很高兴对此进行研究并提供一些书面指导，但本质上这取决于我的工作内容和目的是什么。
 本例的目标是向整个公共机构提供建议，对吧？
 在你的假设例子中，
 我认为，对此，检方会说，成立了一个工作组或小组委员会，援引公开会议法的规定。
 我很乐意检查它是一个还是两个成员，但它在应用程序和流程方面相当广泛。
 我总是把它看作一个流程图，就像谁创建了这个工作组？
 公共机构创造这个的方式，如果你自己或者弗朗西斯科正在与你合作，
 您可能需要遵守公开会议法的要求。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4372.721s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 我认为该小组不一定是为了提供建议，而是为了带回研究，但事实并非如此，我认为这与提供建议不是一回事。
 我并不是说他们会表明立场说，好吧，我们做了研究，我们认为你应该这样做。
 它更像是，
 他们这样做了，这就是委员会经常做的事情。
 他们不一定这样做，但你说即使那样也意味着他们在提供建议，因此，但如果我们这样做，我们可以告诉人们，提前 48 小时通知，邀请他们参加这个两人会议讨论，
 一个事件然后我们就没事了。
 然后，我们将继续将收集到的所有信息提交给全体机构。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4425.617s">[Austin]</a>: 是的，我基本上想提请您注意总检察长指南的第七页，其中解释了公共机构的构成。
 总检察长特别表示，虽然没有完整的公共机构名单，但内部的任何多成员董事会、委员会、委员会或小组委员会
 行政或立法权。
 这包括为审查公共机构或向公共机构提出建议而创建的任何多成员机构。
 所以它的范围相当广泛。
 这就是我所说的这个小组向谁报告的问题。
 再说一次，通常只有例外
 作为一个特别工作组，它将由学校负责人或市长创建，因为他们本身不受公开会议法规定的约束。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4481.063s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 但最重要的是，无论你怎么称呼它，该机构实际上是在提出建议。
 这就是我一直听到你说的。
 但如果这不仅仅是一个建议，如果它是研究，你是说这本身就是一个建议吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4501.395s">[Austin]</a>: 好吧，我们必须研究界限在哪里，但根据我为我们的特别工作组和特别工作组处理有关公开会议法的投诉的经验，我可以告诉你，它的适用范围相当广泛。
 在这一点上我有具体的决定，所以我很乐意和弗朗西斯科分享，让大家真正清楚应该走的方向。
 如果这是你感兴趣的事情，莫琳，我很乐意这样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4529.797s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 嗯，我还有另一个问题，我读到的内容是，会议纪要应在 10 天内向公众公开，无论它们是已获得批准还是草稿版本。
 所以我的问题是。
 它们如何可用？
 我想知道开放法则是否决定了这一点。
 例如，我们的会议时间不在市政府网站上。
 所以，举例来说，作为一个新成员，如果你想知道六月发生了什么，或者如果你是公众，你会说，哇，你们谈论了什么？
 我不确定它们的可接受位置是什么，以及它们是否会存在，我的意思是，这是主要的事情，另一件事是，如果它们完成了，无论它们是否被批准或以草案形式，那么它们将被最终批准的会议记录所取代，一旦获得批准，是的，那么会议记录就会被写入。不知道大家都怎么样了</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4599.139s">[Austin]</a>: 指定谁来写，无论是轮流写还是只有一个人写，但会议记录是要拟定的。
 当它们写成时，即使它们没有被批准，我们知道这是公开会议法的要求，如果它们是草案形式，并且公众已经提交了公共记录请求或公开会议法请求这些会议记录，即使它们没有被批准，有时你每月开会一次，
 这些会议记录必须以草稿形式提交。
 它们是公共记录，所以任何记录，让我备份一下，由城市雇员、官员、志愿者、理事会成员、委员会成员、委员会成员创建或接收的任何记录，都受公共记录法的约束。
 这包括在您的个人计算机上创建的文档，这包括短信，这包括电子邮件，只要是城市事务。
 然后公众中的某个人说，他们通常会将其发送给法律部门并说，你知道，珍妮丝，她是记录访问官，我想要一份这些会议记录的副本。
 如果是草稿，Janice 会联系您并询问：您有这些会议记录的副本吗？
 哦，是的，它们只是草案形式。
 好吧，他们在这里，对吗？
 假设它们是公开会议而非行政会议的分钟数。
 一旦获得批准，如果收到相同的请求并且会议纪要获得批准，公众将收到批准的会议纪要。
 会议纪要无需发布在市政府网站上。
 有些社区确实如此。
 有些人不会把所有会议记录都放在网上。
 这通常是市政资源的行使。
 但话虽这么说，他们仍然受公共记录法和公开会议法的约束。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4705.229s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 这意味着如果有人想要某样东西，他们就必须提出要求。
 这就是简短的答案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4712.071s">[Austin]</a>: 正确的。
 所以这里有两块。
 首先，公开会议法要求撰写、批准和签署这些会议记录。
 这是根据公开会议法进行的。
 所以另一部分是，是的，公众可以
 请求他们并遵守公共记录法和公开会议法的要求。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4735.277s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 好的，所以对于它可能在哪里没有要求。
 人们只需要到城里说：请给我这些分钟。
 如果我想看去年的会议记录，这就是我必须做的。
 您必须正式请求他们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4752.186s">[Austin]</a>: 我的意思是，是的，或者我不知道谁有，我不知道谁有会议记录，但是你可以，是的，我的意思是，通常你不必为他们提出正式的公共记录请求，但是，你知道，我认为这可以在内部处理，作为公共机构的成员，莫林，但我认为我们希望，通常有某种一致性，因为会议记录必须永久保存。
 你可能想检查一下，
 你知道，他们的演讲以及他们是否出现或者这方面的做法是什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4787.24s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 事实上，我更多地考虑的是大众，而不是我自己。
 你知道，有人说，天哪，我想看看他们在做什么。
 我只是想弄清楚人们如何找到它们。
 就这样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4798.686s">[Austin]</a>: 是的，我想我通常会通过向记录访问官员提出特定的公共记录请求，或者根据公开法向公共机构主席请求他们通常拥有的会议记录来实现这种情况。
 当我看到他们进来时。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4815.635s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 所以我只是想澄清一下，会议记录存储在三个不同的位置。
 然后是电子版，需要更长的时间，因为它会转到梅德福社区媒体。
 好了，这就是我们的视频。
 但是市委书记 在这次会议结束时发生的事情
 我，你知道，如果会议记录获得批准，也就是说，如果笔记获得批准并且没有任何更改，我会走到走廊，在页面上盖上日期戳，我会复印七份。
 现在有八本，我会买一本。
 一份和我一起留在这里，原件和其余副本都保存在市政府办公室。
 你总是在市秘书处。
 任何人都可以参加并要求查看会议纪要。
 我只能从2022年4月到现在讲。
 但我不太擅长的一件事是成绩。
 我通常将你的草稿作为笔记发送，然后将它们变成会议。
 所以这是我们都必须喜欢并开始链接的东西。
 莫琳为你澄清了吗？
 好的，罗布，然后是黛安。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4902.737s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 是的，谢谢。
 我想，我会很快深入讨论有关小组委员会、建议和信息共享的对话。
 我很好奇司法部长对如何推进相关问题有何指导。
 除了我们每月一次的 90 分钟会议之外，它们是否属于委员会的范围？
 为了在会议期间在这些问题上取得一些进展，办公室有何建议？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4939.699s">[Austin]</a>: 所以我认为，如果有一组成员想要同时单独或作为一个团队工作，那么可以与
 您知道，非公共机构的成员、城市官员，当然还有 2 或 3 名成员希望聚在一起参加这些讨论会议。
 我只想指出它们将是公开的，对吗？
 并遵守公开会议法。
 或者，我猜。
 简单地安排额外的会议将是一个建议或最佳实践。
 嗯，但显然这是一个政治决定，成员们需要考虑改变事情以适应他们的议程等等。
 嗯，你知道，有些公共机构会开会，尤其是在一年中最繁忙的时候，而且会更定期开会。
 然后我们将根据是否有重要工作要做来更改会议日程，但这些是一些不同的选择。
 正如我所说，人们总是可以选择独立工作或与非公共机构的成员合作，然后根据需要向整个公共机构报告。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5014.173s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我明白。
 我认为我们面临的挑战之一是我们的创始章程中明确规定了会议时间表。
 将其解释为最低限度的、非具体的指导是否公平？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5031.95s">[Austin]</a>: 当然。
 我的意思是，我想我当然可以看看该法规
 建立公共机构来看看灵活性是什么，但就会议开放和同时遵守而言，所需要的只是适当地发布并通知公众安排额外的会议。
 所以，你知道，我们可以看看法规的语言。
 我很高兴这样做并就这一点向弗朗西斯科通报。
 但从公开会议法的角度来看，只要及时发布，而且有一些公共机构会发布然后取消，当然，如果他们没有达到法定人数，或者会发布并说，我们真的不需要这个会议。
 所以我们取消吧。
 但至少可以这么说，书中是这样的，罗布。
 再说一次，有时公共机构在一年中特定时间的繁忙程度会出现起伏。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5086.017s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 我明白。
 谢谢。
 是的，如果你能检查一下，那就太好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5089.159s">[Austin]</a>: 是的，我很高兴这样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5092.02s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 很好，戴安娜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5093.08s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 谢谢。
 出色的。
 我注意到你在做演示时检查了你的 Google 分享，我只是想
 你知道，这一点非常清楚，因为我在对其他人权委员会的研究中注意到，他们似乎发布了他们的会议记录，你知道，按年份和月份非常整齐地组织在文件夹中。
 我听说有些人会协作，你知道，提前发布会议，然后使用 Google 文档进行协作。
 关于发表特别声明或其他内容。
 我只是想弄清楚通过 Google 分享的规则是什么。
 也许如果 Google Drive 在人权委员会网站上做广告，阳光就能解决这个问题？
 我只是想了解这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5157.557s">[Austin]</a>: 显然，这是我们近年来看到的一项更新的不断发展的技术。
 而且，你知道，在我看来，根据公开会议法、其执行情况以及我们迄今为止审查的指导方针，任何就 Google 文件进行的合作如果进行，都可能构成不适当的审议。
 同时，但更有可能使用 Google Docs 或任何类型的协作工具，它将是串行的。
 因此，我经常使用的例子是，有一组特定的会议纪要，罗布首先进来并进行更改。
 然后黛安进来并做出改变，但你可以看到罗布的改变，然后这一切都完成了，而不是在公开会议上。
 然后，当您参加会议时，您会看到公共机构其他成员对这些具体问题的意见。
 会议记录。
 因此，公开会议法要求的是，有人实际上可以记录会议记录或起草文件，但对特定文件的讨论和审议必须再次在公开会议中进行，以便公众能够看到公共机构本身的审议过程。
 技术很复杂，黛安。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5247.43s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 技术很复杂，我知道我来自于技术，我们不使用谷歌。
 所以我真的抓住了这一点。
 有人对谷歌表示担忧，现在我们有了人工智能，我的 ADA 方面说，是的，我们提高了可访问性，我们已经做到了。
 我的 DEI 方面是这样的，哦，不。
 所以现在这是一场战斗，
 有很多好的事情和很多不太好的事情，我只是希望有人帮助我做出决定，这样我就可以说，好吧，这就是我们正在做的事情。
 委员们还有其他问题吗？
 因为我们有公众在场，我很乐意给他们机会提出问题。
 我没有看到委员们提出任何问题。
 巴里，你想继续问你的问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5310.006s">[Barry Ingber]</a>: 我希望其他人会读它。
 事实上，我得走了，这似乎凸显了罗布提出的问题。
 请您介绍一下自己好吗？
 我叫巴里·英格贝尔。
 我住在北梅德福。
 但当谈到谷歌文档时，我想知道如果该文件可以公开访问，这样公众就可以看到审议的进展，这种观点是否会改变。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5351.13s">[Austin]</a>: 我认为我对此的看法不会改变。
 原因是，尽管公众可以实时看到评论，但根据公开会议法，这不会是公开的。
 因此，公众基本上必须反复访问 Google Drive 或登录，才能查看是否有人更新了特定文档。
 所以我回到了公开会议法的时间顺序观点
 你知道，首先，通过通知和会议议程来提醒公众，这是公共机构的事情，这就是要做的事情。
 如果没有这一点，你知道，本质上是考虑公众是否愿意这样做，你基本上会将责任转移给公众，让他们说，这是网站，这可能随时发生，也可能不会发生。
 在我看来，根据公开会议法的要求，这将是有问题的。
 好问题。
 我在这里还有另一个问题，我很高兴阅读它。
 弗朗西斯科，如果这对你有用的话。
 假设，您需要找到举办活动的地点。
 罗布和斯蒂芬自愿考虑各种选择，但不做出决定。
 他们需要协调他们的外展工作，这样他们就不会打电话到同一个地方。
 这是否受到公开会议法的约束？
 那么让我们来看看最佳实践。
 今晚有一个这样的会议，罗布和斯蒂芬是志愿者。
 在沟通方面，他们不是公共机构的法定人数，但公众可以看到他们都是自愿这样做的。
 然后每个人都会做自己独立的工作，对吗？
 然后向整个公共机构通报后续步骤。
 我很高兴地告诉您，在我收到的前五个问题中，最重要的（我想说的第二个问题）可能是工作组和小组委员会。
 和工作组。
 所以我明白人们很难驾驭。
 因此，我很高兴继续做出一些具体的决定，向您展示发挥作用的事实模式，以便您能够履行自己的职责，对吗？
 因为它非常复杂。
 总检察长办公室就此问题发布了非常好的指导，以帮助公共机构开展工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5491.072s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 因为今晚我们遇到了这种情况，即使我们正在谈论明年是否真的计划为骄傲月做任何事情。
 该委员会中有两个人有兴趣调查此事。
 那么这需要什么呢？
 首先，了解一下这个城市正在发生什么。
 其次，
 我们可以提出哪些想法？
 然后继续工作并向这个小组报告我们的发现，不是我们确定的，而是我们发现的。
 我们必须单独做这件事然后再回来吗？
 你是这么说的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5529.61s">[Austin]</a>: 是的，所以您可以单独进行并进行协调或沟通。
 你知道，实际上是通过弗朗西斯科提供更新，然后向整个公共机构通报后续步骤。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5550.323s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 这很有趣，因为它实际上并没有建立一个社区。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5553.764s">[Austin]</a>: 它只是分开。
 我知道。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5555.664s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 我觉得这真的很令人沮丧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5559.185s">[Austin]</a>: 重点是，我们知道公开会议法在技术上并不要求公开征求意见，但我们确实知道的是
 根据公开会议法，这种情况在过去四年中已经出现了数百万次，公众有权基本上实时观察正在发生的事情。
 所以我们的目标是真正能够平衡所有这一切。
 但让我发布这个具体指南，以便每个人都清楚可以完成的工作范围。
 当然，这是在没有法定人数的公共机构的一部分之间进行的，因此他们将对莫琳有具体的指导。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5607.276s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 我只是想再举一个例子。
 如果您还记得，上个月黛安参加时，我们作为马萨诸塞州人权联盟的一部分都收到了相同的信息。
 他们正在做一些 Zoom 的事情。
 黛安娜独自出席。
 黛安没有给委员会发电子邮件。
 黛安没有问弗朗西斯她是否可以参加。
 黛安独自出席，但黛安说：
 租客们，可以把我列入你们的日历吗？
 我想分享我的经验。
 委员会的任何成员都可以这样做。
 你们没有像我的其他委员会那样有那么多不同类型的会议或外部培训机会，因为 MBTA 正在做一些事情，其中一些，
 对它更感兴趣。
 因此，如果我能得到它，我会通过电子邮件发送，然后人们自行发送。
 如果他们觉得自己有一些有价值的东西想要与其他委员分享，他们会联系我，要求将其列入议程。
 或者有时他们对我说：弗朗西斯，你能分享这个吗？
 这次我没能成功，但也许我的一位专员可以。
 那时他们可以代表某人分享，而无需回应。
 电子邮件。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5692.485s">[Austin]</a>: 我认为，明确地说，在我看来，如果你们都想参加培训机会，就可以这样做。
 这并不违反公开会议法。
 我相信你们都非常积极地参与城市和社区活动。
 您当然有权这样做。
 你知道，你有第一修正案的权利这样做。
 还有两个，
 你知道，公开会议法并不禁止这样做。
 您知道，您可以参加社交聚会或城里的活动。
 问题是，你知道，公共机构的成员是否在会议之外审议问题？
 因此，这些年来我看到了无数的抱怨，说，这两个人参加了这个社区活动，你知道，是为了纪念这个人。
 嗯，但我看到他们在走廊里窃窃私语。
 所以我知道他们正在谈论一些他们应该在会议上谈论的事情，对吧？
 或者这些人正在参加一个社交聚会，但是，你知道，听起来他们正在说话，而我听到了一些有关 X、Y 或 Z 的信息，而这种情况不应该发生。
 嗯，所以这很简单，或者有一个会议，你们中的许多人都对专业和个人层面的主题感兴趣。
 然后你就可以去做了。
 一切都好。
 我的意思是，你可以去参加培训机会。
 真正的问题是：可以这么说，作为成员，讨论目前在您管辖范围内悬而未决的事项时，您是否越界了？
 所以我只是想确保这一点也清楚。
 公开会议法试图平衡人们，你知道，尽可能地平衡所有这一切。
 好问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5795.704s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 谢谢你珍妮尔。
 还有其他人有疑问吗？
 有委员吗？
 好吧，我只看到两名公众和我们在一起。
 请问两位市民对公开集会法例有任何疑问吗？
 论坛的构成是什么？
 会议什么时候会被取消？
 好吧，我没有看到有人举手。
 所以现在是709。
 律师。
 奥斯汀，非常感谢您的时间和解释。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5836.195s">[Austin]</a>: 谢谢你们，很高兴见到你们大家。
 我将跟进现状问题以及小组委员会工作组问题。
 很高兴见到大家。
 如果您需要任何帮助，弗朗西斯有我的联系信息。
 我总是很乐意讨论您可能遇到的任何问题。
 我感谢您今晚抽出时间。
 祝你晚安。
 非常感谢。
 小心。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5854.622s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 你也是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5855.043s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 好吧，有很多东西需要消化，但我希望我们能够你知道，文件很多，因为我必须这样做，我有一个最后期限来阅读它，以确保我没有任何问题，以防你在律师到达之前有任何问题。
 但是，您知道，请尝试消化这些信息，并从尝试在我们的工作方式方面对社区更加透明的角度来思考它。
 如果我们陷入这样的心态，即我们只有 X 次会议或我们无法做到这一点，那么我们自己就会制造障碍，阻止我们完成工作。
 再说一遍，议程对所有人开放，对吧？
 我们不需要三个人知道谁在做哪个事件。
 如果弗朗西斯对某件事充满热情，她可以去看看，然后要求将其列入议程并提出自己的意见。
 并不总是需要在小组中这样做。
 如果我们需要更大的小组委员会和工作组，我们需要额外的会议，只要这些会议提前公布即可。
 这实际上更多的是公众的透明度和可及性问题。
 我希望你觉得它有用。
 还有其他问题吗？
 我只是留意时间，因为我必须在早上 7:30 之前跑到办公室。
 否则，我们的印章将保留在明天的日期。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5969.114s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 我可以说句话吗？
 出色地。
 我谢谢大家。
 非常好，完美无瑕。
 我想是的。
 出色地。
 我感谢大家，今晚的会议非常非常好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5982.993s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 嗯,非常感谢,好的,谢谢,那么这个时候,我要按停止录音按钮开会,呃,但是在这之前,需要有人提出休会动议来结束会议。所以我请求推迟会议。好吧，谁支持？
 谢谢，斯蒂芬。
 有人真的想过夜吗？
 好的。
 我没有看到任何志愿者。
 一切都好。
