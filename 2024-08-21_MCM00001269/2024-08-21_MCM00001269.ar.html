    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=459.591s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Thank you, members of the Human Rights Commission.
 My name is Sana Fadel.
 I'm the deputy director at Citizens for Juvenile Justice.
 We are a statewide organization, a statewide policy organization that advocates for young people who are at risk of or with legal system involvement.
 We do our work statewide, and I appreciate being able to meet with you all on this.
 So I'm actually here asking for your support or endorsement of legislation that deals with youth justice reforms called Raise the Age.
 It is a legal system reform, but I do want to talk about it because it's both an economic and racial justice issue.
 So this is the bill.
 It's a bill that was filed by Rep.
 O'Day from West Boylston, Rep.
 Cruz from Salem, and Senator Friendly from Lynn.
 This bill is currently pending in the Judiciary Committee, and what it does, it ends the automatic prosecution of a teenager, older teens, as adults, and moves them into the juvenile justice system.
 So I'm just gonna give you a little bit of background on why we even have this campaign.
 This campaign started several years ago, because when we looked at issues of recidivism in Massachusetts, what we saw was that young people have the highest recidivism rate of any age group.
 So when we talk about recidivism, there's different decision points that young people come back to the system on.
 So we look at two specific ones.
 One is rearrangement, which means you come in, you've been convicted of another crime, you've served your time, and now you're back in court again and you have a totally new crime.
 That's the rearrangement.
 The second one is reconviction.
 That means you've come out of the incarceration, you've come out and you have a totally new crime and you've been found guilty of it.
 So when we looked at this, we say, what is our legal system doing with young people?
 So we have two systems.
 One is our juvenile system, which if a young person between the ages of 12 up to 17, right before their 18th birthday, if they're in conflict with the law, they would be part of the juvenile justice system.
 If they're 18 and over, they wouldn't be in adult criminal justice system.
 This data looks at,
 kids who have, young people who have been incarcerated, because that's the deepest end of the system.
 Every point of the legal system says, are you someone that we want to keep out of society because of a crime you've been alleged to commit?
 And, you know, from the point of arrest all the way to sentencing, that's the question it asks.
 So all of these young people have been incarcerated.
 The legal system says, yes, we found you liable.
 We're going to incarcerate you.
 So what are we buying with that legal system, right?
 We're looking at do young people come out better off, less likely to commit crime.
 And what I want to show you here is when we look at teenagers, we're doing two very different systems have two very different outcomes.
 So our juvenile system does serve the incarceration quite does serve young people up until the 21st birthday.
 So there is some overlap.
 The data isn't perfect because we're looking at 18 to 24 versus 21 and under.
 However, overall, when we look at recidivism, young people coming out of the adult system are almost like a one and a half times more likely to be rearranged and more than double the likelihood to be reconvicted.
 I'm hyper on this because
 those are all the same young people.
 They're all adolescents, especially when they're talking about anybody under the age of 21, by pediatric standards, they're all adolescents.
 Well, not up to that age.
 But we have two very, so their development is the same, their offense, what they get arrested for is the same.
 Everything about them is the same, except how do we interact with them as a society?
 And that's what this campaign is about.
 So when we look at young people,
 that age group, like the 18 to 20 year olds is really the heart of this campaign.
 These are young people who would be in high school or they'd be just starting in college.
 Their brains, everything in their life is designed to learn.
 So wherever you put them, they're gonna learn that environment they're in.
 So if you put them in environments that are more toxic, that prevent them from meeting developmental milestones, you're actually increasing the likelihood of them re-offending.
 So things like, you know,
 is our intervention likely to help them or derail them from getting a job, having a family, getting a home, or having stable housing, finishing education, all of those things, if we put barriers to those, we're more likely to have them come back for totally new crime.
 And this is supported by research.
 So this pathway to desistance study came out of,
 It was housed in the University of Pittsburgh, but several universities were involved across the country.
 They tracked 1,300 young people.
 All of them were adolescents.
 Every single one of them committed a serious or violent offense.
 And they did monthly check-ins with them for a seven-year period.
 And they asked the question, why do some of these young people with these offenses desist from crime?
 And why do some of them persist in crime?
 And by the nature of the study, the offense itself is not, the severity of this offense itself is not an indicator of future offending, which is one of the things, you know, our laws are like the more serious offense, the higher the risk that you're presented to society.
 This, just the premise of the study says, it's actually not the case.
 And this is what they look for.
 They look for serious offense, how often they offended, socioeconomic status, education, housing, income, substance use, mental health,
 race, geography, family status, like everything you can possibly think of.
 And they found not a single one of them had an impact on future funding.
 Only two things did.
 The first was the belief in the legitimacy of authority.
 And the second is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 I will translate those into English.
 The first one is, do you believe that whenever you do something, that you have some kind of control of what happens to you?
 That the person in authority is going to treat you in what you perceive as fair?
 That means, every time I go to the store, will I always be followed?
 You know what?
 It doesn't matter.
 I've been labeled as a criminal regardless of my behavior.
 That is a risk factor of having someone re-effect.
 So when you say, and I've seen this play out in the young people I work with, they do not, it's not, it's less likely of how harsh the punishment was or the consequence was.
 It's the was, did I get it, was it fair?
 So if it was, if I perceived it as fair, even if it was harsh,
 I will say those young people are much more likely to start reoffending because, you know what, I knew I took that risk and I got what I deserved.
 That's what this means.
 So when we do all this work around racial justice and the criminal justice system, it is not just because it's ethical and moral and the right thing to do, it is also a public safety measure in our legal system.
 The second piece which is relevant for this bill is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 So do you have any children or adolescents in your lifetime?
 It means as a baby, can you feed yourself?
 Can you talk?
 Can you walk?
 Can you do full paragraphs?
 When it comes to adolescents, can you have judgment?
 Can you think before you act and think about the consequences?
 Those are all things that young people develop gradually over time.
 And what the researchers found was if the intervention itself blocks a young person's ability to meet those developmental milestones, they're much more likely to persist in crime.
 The likelier they are to meet those developmental milestones on time, the much sooner they will desist from re-offending.
 And those things that young people need to meet developmental milestones are education, employment or skills,
 family connection, physical or mental health, and civic and social engagement.
 So when we look at these systems, this is what we're looking at.
 Those systems, when you're in the adult system, you have a quarry.
 That's a huge barrier to education and employment.
 There's no impact, there is, unlike the juvenile system that looks at education as a priority, education in the adult system is pretty rare when it comes to this age population.
 Family connections, sorry, you're 18, you're on your own, there's no role for family, where even if you're under 21 in the juvenile system, family always has a role.
 Civic engagement, part of the education, our K through 12 frameworks include civic engagement.
 That is the kind of, if you're in DYS, that framework is in the education in DYS.
 So when we're talking about this, that's what we're talking about intervention.
 And in addition, it's also a racial justice issue.
 So this is looking at incarceration.
 Again, the data, we have pretty decent data in the juvenile system.
 Our adult system data is pretty lacking.
 So I try to do the best we can.
 This is looking at rates of incarceration between white men and boys compared to black men and boys.
 We have data on Latino kids.
 The federal data does not exist in a usable way.
 That's the only reason I only look at that.
 But when we look at this, we see that racial disparities for our 18 and 19-year-olds is the highest of any age group.
 And that's something that's consistent across the country, not just in Massachusetts.
 When we look at this one, we know that our legal system, and we're not saying our juvenile justice system is great, right?
 The difference is,
 Our juvenile justice system has both federal and state requirements to reduce racial disparities.
 So we measure it.
 It's still not fixed, right?
 Not gonna say it's there, but the requirement does not exist anywhere in the adult system.
 So when we look at these disparities, we have disparities where it's not just the over-representation and the sheer number, it's the collateral consequences
 that the class is falling disproportionately falling on young men of color.
 So it means you have a system that is less developmentally appropriate.
 So you don't get what you need to mature and get reintegrate back fully into society.
 The focus on punishment and rather than development means you don't get those skills as you mature.
 And then you have the collateral consequences that are pretty severe.
 So there are collateral consequences to juvenile adjudications as well as adult convictions.
 However, the adult conviction collateral consequences are much more significant and many of them are mandatory.
 So no matter what, you have those collateral consequences stick no matter what.
 And then when I talk about this as an economic justice issue, I'm assuming many of you know about, every sector I talk about,
 That we have a labor crisis, we have a labor crisis.
 That's always been the case.
 The labor crisis has actually been, and I was following what economists have been saying, they've been raising that flag at least 2016, 2017, so before COVID.
 What they said in Massachusetts, we have a rate of baby boomers retiring at a higher rate than young people entering into our workforce.
 COVID just made it worse.
 And the recovery from COVID, we just have not been able, there's been some recovery, but we haven't been able to get back to where we were before, where that crisis has been a long time in the coming.
 So the arguments are, first, let's talk about the young person themselves.
 If a young person is involved in an adult system,
 where it does not look at their education and having a quarry limits your ability to get a job.
 That limits that young person's own lifetime earnings potential.
 If you look at it from the labor market, when we say all of these young people are less likely to contribute to our labor market, that means our businesses are not able to hire.
 We have a labor shortage that we say, we need more young people.
 except those young people, right?
 You're not, we think those are, and this is, they're just not going to be part of the equation.
 They're not part of the denominator.
 And then when we do that, we're basically saying that group
 So every generation, we have a cohort of young people that just have a lifetime exclusion from fully integrating into our society.
 And that means us as a commonwealth don't benefit from their economic participation in our economy.
 And ultimately, our legal system is not an equal opportunity employer.
 We talked about the fact that the legal system targets low-income communities and communities of color disproportionately.
 That means when you look at where young people are excluded from our economy, excluded from our education and employment opportunities, they tend to be concentrated in those same communities that they come from, which means those communities, the economic potential of those communities is also diminished.
 And then finally,
 Going back to my first slide, we have a potential of reducing crime if we deal with young people in a developmentally appropriate way.
 Reducing crime also means we're also benefiting our taxpayers as a whole.
 We have less people who are victimized and require some kind of repair.
 Our legal system is not going to be as, you know, having all the workings of the legal system, we just won't have as much if we have,
 Again, it's not a criminal justice panacea, I'm not solving everything, but for those young people, shrinking that potential has an economic impact.
 And just conclude with just the thought that this is not new.
 I actually wanna say that our legal system is far behind the rest of our society in looking at young people under the age of 21 as adolescents.
 I started off by talking about pediatrics.
 Pediatricians work with young people
 under 21 and up to 21 and maybe sometimes older, depending on their medical needs, that's been going on for a long, long time.
 You can't drink, you can't smoke pot or smoke tobacco or gamble or own a gun or be a police officer until you're 21.
 There's also all sorts of other milestones because
 You can start a job at 14, you can get your driver's license at 16, but with lots of limitations until you're 18.
 But you can pre-register to vote because we want you to vote by 18.
 But then all these other things we want to delay.
 You can't rent a car until you're 25.
 You can be on your parents' health insurance until 26.
 Because our society does not have a hard line of adults.
 we have a transition to adulthood, which means things that we want young people to grow up and make up into a habit into your adulthood, we want to encourage you to do more of that younger.
 The younger you are, the more likely you're going to stick.
 Things that are a risk to yourself or to others, which we believe legal system involvement is one of those, we want to delay so that when you are more mature, you can make those decisions and it's less likely to stick.
 So, I'm just going to end with just what I would love for this commission to consider ways of supporting.
 So, like this is legislation that's out there.
 I shared ahead of time fact sheets about this legislation, but there's many things that you could do to support.
 And just so you know, I've been trying to meet with all the human rights commissions across the state, and some of them are able to endorse, and some of them are like, oh, we're part of the state government, we can, but there's other ways to support.
 So these are all just ideas of things you can do if this is something you want to support.
 They could go from formal endorsement to we'll just make some connections or we'll publicize it to let our constituents know or our residents know about it.
 But without us, depending on, or we can say yes, we'll support it.
 We'll send our legislators a letter in support.
 It's really up to you all.
 So I just want to thank you for this opportunity.
 This is my contact information and I would love to open up to any questions.

 يبدو أن أحد مفوضينا قد غادر.
 لا أعرف.
 سأتحقق لاحقًا لمعرفة ما إذا كانوا يحاولون إعادة الاتصال.

 عندما تتحدث عن مرحلة معينة من التطور، هل هذا ما يواجهه نظام الشباب حاليا؟
 هل ينبغي إضافة أدوات أو موارد إضافية إلى نظام الشباب لمساعدة الشباب في هذه المراحل من التنمية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1576.58s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: ដូច្នេះប្រព័ន្ធបណ្តុះបណ្តាលយុវជនរបស់យើងបានត្រៀមរួចរាល់ហើយ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងមាន
 ជាលទ្ធផល រដ្ឋ Massachusetts បានដឹកនាំប្រទេសជាតិក្នុងកំណែទម្រង់យុត្តិធម៌អនីតិជនចាប់តាំងពីទសវត្សរ៍ឆ្នាំ 1970 ។
 យើងបានអនុវត្តកំណែទម្រង់រយៈពេលប្រាំឆ្នាំ ហើយបានបិទពន្ធនាគារយុវជនទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងទសវត្សរ៍ឆ្នាំ 1970 ។
 ទសវត្សរ៍ទី 90 គឺគួរឱ្យភ័យខ្លាច។
 យើង​ជា​អ្នក​ធ្វើ​បាប​ប្រទេស​នេះ និង​កន្លែង​នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែចាប់តាំងពីឆ្នាំ 2003 មក DYS បានផ្តោតជាពិសេសលើការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍យុវជនជាវិជ្ជមាន ដោយធ្វើការកាត់បន្ថយការជាប់ឃុំ ដោយទទួលស្គាល់ពីផលប៉ះពាល់ដ៏គ្រោះថ្នាក់នៃការជាប់ឃុំឃាំង។
 វាបានវិវត្តន៍តាំងពីពេលនោះមក ដូចជាប្រសិនបើការប្រើប្រាស់ការឃុំឃាំងមិនដែលត្រូវបានបង្រួមអប្បបរមាពីដំបូងឡើយ។
 ដូច្នេះ វាដូចជា អូ យើងត្រូវធ្វើបែបនេះ ការអប់រំតែងតែមាន ប៉ុន្តែយើងត្រូវបង្កើនប្រសិទ្ធភាពវា។
 បច្ចុប្បន្ន​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​ការ​ក្នុង​ផ្នែក​វេជ្ជសាស្ត្រ។
 ឥឡូវនេះ យើងចង់អភិវឌ្ឍយុទ្ធសាស្ត្របន្ទាប់របស់យើង ហើយផែនការយុទ្ធសាស្រ្តបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់យើងគឺជុំវិញសុវត្ថិភាពលំនៅដ្ឋាន។
 ដូច្នេះ​វត្ថុ​ទាំង​អស់​នេះ​គឺ​នៅ​ទី​នោះ ហើយ​វា​ត្រូវ​បាន​សាង​សង់​ជា​រៀង​រាល់​ឆ្នាំ។
 ប៉ុន្តែទស្សនៈនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍យុវជនជាវិជ្ជមានបានក្លាយជាផ្នែកមួយនៃប្រព័ន្ធយុត្តិធម៌យុវជនរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំមិនមែនគ្រាន់តែនិយាយអំពី DYS ការសាកល្បង តុលាការ អ្នកការពារសាធារណៈ និងមេធាវីស្រុកនោះទេ។
 មនុស្សមើលក្មេងជំទង់ហើយនិយាយថា: ការងាររបស់យើងគឺជួយពួកគេឱ្យធំឡើង។
 មានអង្គការដូចយើងដែរ ពីព្រោះយើងត្រូវការពារ ដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា យើងទទួលខុសត្រូវចំពោះអង្គការទាំងនេះ ដើម្បីសម្រេចបាននូវគោលដៅទាំងនេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ទាំងនេះគឺជាគោលដៅ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​មាន​បទពិសោធន៍ ហើយ​យើង​មាន​សមត្ថភាព។
 ឥឡូវនេះមានសំណួរអំពីលេខ។
 វិក័យប័ត្រខ្លួនវាមិនគ្របដណ្តប់លើមនុស្សគ្រប់រូបដែលមានអាយុពី 18 ទៅ 20 ឆ្នាំក្នុងពេលតែមួយនោះទេ។
 ទីមួយ គោលដៅរបស់យើងគឺ 18 ឆ្នាំ។
 នេះគឺជាលេខតូចជាង។
 ប្រព័ន្ធនេះត្រូវបានបង្កើតឡើងជាមួយនឹងការទទួលស្គាល់ថាមូលនិធិមួយចំនួនអាចនឹងត្រូវផ្ទេរពីប្រព័ន្ធមនុស្សពេញវ័យទៅប្រព័ន្ធយុវជន ដើម្បីបម្រើដល់ក្មេងអាយុ 19 ឆ្នាំ និងនៅទីបំផុតក្មេងអាយុ 20 ឆ្នាំ។
 ម៉ូដែលនេះត្រូវបានផលិតនៅ Vermont ។
 រហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះរដ្ឋ Vermont គឺជារដ្ឋតែមួយគត់ដែលបង្កើនអាយុលើសពី 18 ឆ្នាំ។
 គិតត្រឹមឆ្នាំ 2020 ពួកគេមានអាយុ 18 ឆ្នាំ ហើយត្រូវបានគេរំពឹងថានឹងត្រូវបានដាក់បញ្ចូលក្នុងក្រុមនៅរដូវក្តៅនេះ។</p>

 شكرا لك
 وآسف على الصوت الغريب أعلاه.
 لقد أجبت على أحد أسئلتي.
 وقد نجحت دول أو مجتمعات أخرى في تنفيذ مثل هذه السياسات.
 من الجميل أن نعرف أن أقرب جيراننا يفعلون شيئًا كهذا لأنها مشكلة حقيقية والتغيير مهم.
 وأخيراً، ذكر بعض الطرق التي يمكننا من خلالها مساعدتك وإظهار دعمنا لك.
 أعتقد أنك تتحدث عن موافقة رسمية أو رسالة إلى أحد أعضاء البرلمان.
 هل لديك الموارد التي يمكنها تقديم هذه الخيارات لإظهار الدعم والمناصرة؟
 وإذا كان الأمر كذلك، فهل نمتلكها أم يمكننا الوصول إليها؟</p>

 وسيكون هناك مقترح للموافقة على محضر الاجتماع في فبراير 2024.
 ويجب أن يدعمه شخص ما.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1862.174s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: عرض الموافقة على محضر اجتماع الشهر الماضي.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1878.977s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: جيد جدا، عظيم.
 والآن فقط قم بالتصويت بسرعة.

 مجرد دعوة سريعة للموافقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1893.07s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: يا سيئة، هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1895.852s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: نعم حسنا.
 ستيفن؟
 مباشر
 يا مورين مثيرة للاهتمام.
 كنا اثنان، وواحد منا تأخر.
 أحدنا يمشي والآخر يجلس.

 التالي على جدول أعمال ديانا هو كاتب العدل لمساعدتك في تدوين محاضر اجتماعات مارس وأبريل.
 لقد بدأت التسجيل في شهر مارس، لذا سأنتهي منه.
 هل هناك أي متخصصين يمكنهم المساعدة في الأعمال الورقية لشهر أبريل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1972.214s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: قد لا أتمكن من حضور اجتماع أبريل الذي سأتحدث عنه معكم.
 لذلك لا أستطيع التطوع للقيام بهذا لأنه لا ينبغي لي أن أكون هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1983.321s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: حسنا
 للتحقق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1987.984s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 شكرا لك ستيفن.
 شكرا لك ستيفن.
 شكرا لك ستيفن.
 هذا صحيح.
 حسنًا يا سيان، حان الوقت للتحقق من التقويم الخاص بك.
 عذرًا، لم أقم بإزالة التقويم من المجلد بعد.
 هل لديك ذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2008.932s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: أوه جيد جدا
 لقد قمت بفتحه بالفعل، لذا سأنقر على شاشة المشاركة وأفتح مستند Word.
 من فضلك انتظر لحظة.
 هل ترى كل هذا؟
 مُطْلَقاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2025.218s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: لا، هل سنحت لك الفرصة لمشاركة هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2028.241s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: لا أعرف.
 آه، أعتقد أنني ضغطت على الزر.
 أوه لا، تقول أن الخادم قام بتعطيل مشاركة الشاشة، آسف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2033.926s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: حسنا، جربه الآن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2041.673s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مثالي.
 حسنًا، هل تراه الآن؟
 هذا صحيح.
 ونتيجة لذلك، فإننا نخطط لتكريم بليندا والعائلة المالكة وسنسارا خلال حدث تاريخي للمرأة في وقت لاحق من هذا الشهر.
 لأكون صادقًا، كنت تحت الماء قليلاً.
 هذا هو وقتي الأكثر ازدحاما في العمل.
 التقيت أيضًا بكيرا سينجلتون التي ساعدتني كثيرًا.
 إذا كنت تتابع الأمر، فأنت تعلم أنه تم تجنيده للعمل في فريق الإصلاحيات في بوسطن.
 لذلك كان مشغولاً للغاية.
 نحن نناقش انتقال يوم 19 يونيو إلى يوم العطلة الرسمية Juneteenth.
 19 يونيو - الأربعاء.
 هل تريد تنظيم هذا الحدث؟
 وهذا مهم جدًا لتحررنا وأيضًا لتاريخ العبودية في الشمال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2112.908s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: إذن لإثبات أن ديانا، نحن جميعًا لا نملك السلطة، فالسلالة لديها السلطة، أليس كذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2118.531s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: هذا نحن... هذا نحن، أليس كذلك؟
 كما هو الحال مع الحدث الذي عقدناه في فبراير الماضي بمناسبة شهر تاريخ السود، فرانسيس، لا أعرف إذا كنت أستخدم الكلمة بشكل صحيح لذا يرجى تصحيحي لأنني أعتقد أحيانًا أنه كان شريكًا أو راعيًا في العام الماضي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2140.324s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: تعمل لجنة حقوق الإنسان عادةً مع العائلة المالكة لتنظيم الحدث.
 أستطيع الآن أن أخبرك أنه على الرغم من أن اليوم قد يبدو يومًا كبيرًا، إلا أن مركز مجتمع ويست ميدفورد سيحتفل بيوم Juneteenth اليوم.
 لذلك أوصي
 احفظ هذا الحدث للعام المقبل أو ليوم آخر حيث سترفع المدينة العلم في اليوم السابق ليوم 17 يونيو نظرًا لأن Juneteenth هو يوم عطلة رسمية.
 من المؤسف أن غرب ميدفورد ومراكز المجتمع الملكي يعبرون الشارع من حيث يمكننا الحصول على هذه الشراكة الثلاثية وقضاء اليوم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2201.163s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: إنه يوم 18 يونيو.
 هل يمكن أن يقام هذا الحدث في العيد التاسع عشر؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2208.995s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: يتم تنظيم الاحتفال هذا العام من قبل مركز مجتمع ويست ميدفورد.
 أوه
 وفي اليوم السابق، رفعت المدينة علمها السادس عشر.
 أوه جيد جدا
 لقد رفعنا العلم في اليوم السابق لأن المدينة كانت مغلقة في ذلك اليوم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2229.481s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: حسنا، أنا أفهم.
 هل تعرف متى سيكون حدث مركز مجتمع ويست ميدفورد؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2238.442s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: لا أعرف الآن، لكنه سيحدث فرقًا كبيرًا.
 مرة أخرى، أنصح بشدة بعدم الحجز في نفس اليوم.
 نعم، إنهم يخططون للقيام بذلك... لا أريد التضحية كثيرًا لأن الأمر ليس مستدامًا بعد.
 كما تعلم، في هذا الجزء من المحادثة، علينا أن نتأكد من أن تصرفاتنا تكمل بعضها البعض ولا تصبح...
 أعتقد أن اليوم هو يوم طويل.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون في فترة ما بعد الظهر، في مكان ما بين الساعة 12 و16 ظهرًا، وهذا ما يفعلونه عادةً.
 هذا صحيح.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2277.577s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: لذا سأتحدث مع سيارا وربما يكون هناك المزيد من التغييرات أو سنؤجلها حتى العام المقبل.
 هل أنت بخير؟
 بالتأكيد.
 ما رأيك يا رفاق، فرانسيسكو؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2292.471s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: أعني، أعتقد أنه أنت.
 أود نقل هذا إلى العام المقبل أو ربما أقيم احتفالًا آخر في وقت لاحق من العام، كما تعلمون أن هذا مناسب.
 حسنًا
 ربما تكون بعض هذه الأيام المهمة قد مرت بالفعل.
 سألقي نظرة على التقويم الوطني اليوم للحصول على بعض الاقتراحات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2324.62s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: حسنا، دعونا معرفة ذلك.
 لذلك ربما سأقوم بالتحديث في الاجتماع القادم.
 لذا أشكركم جميعا.
 لأن الناس يحبون ذلك حقًا.
 نعم، نعم، بالضبط.
 جيد جدا، عظيم.
 إذن العنصر الآخر في هذا التقويم البسيط للغاية، أبريل، هو يوم الأرض، وبعد ذلك، فران أوا، أضفت السلسلة الكاملة عن صحة السود المأخوذة من هذا التقويم من مكتبة ميدفورد العامة.
 هذا كل شيء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2366.195s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: جيد، جيد جدًا، شكرًا جزيلاً لك يا ديانا.
 أريد فقط التأكد من أن المفوضين يرسلون إشارة من نوع ما بأنهم وافقوا على إلغاء المفاوضات مؤقتًا في حدث بليندا ساتون في يونيو.
 كيف حالك؟
 بالطبع هناك.
 حسنًا إذن.
 لذلك سنتحدث عن ديانا وفرانسيس في يوم آخر.
 سأشارك بعض الاقتراحات وأرسلها إلى الفريق للتحضير لاجتماع أبريل.
 تذكر أنه بعد اجتماع يونيو ستكون في إجازة ولن تعود حتى سبتمبر.
 حسنًا يا مورين، أعتقد أنه كان لدي ثلاث دقائق قبل أن ينضم إلينا المحامي أوستن.
 ثم سآخذك للحديث عن الفخر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2441.175s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: نعم، هذا عامل صغير.
 لقد ذكر للتو في الاجتماع الأخير أننا اعتدنا على رعاية الفخر.
 وأتساءل ما هو؟
 لا يمكنني العثور على أي شيء في تقويم المدينة أو أحاول فقط العثور على معلومات حوله.
 لا أعرف إذا كان أي شخص يعرف أن هذا كان تسجيلي الوحيد في ذلك الوقت.
 يبدو من المعقول الحضور.
 لكنني لا أقترح أي شيء.
 قد يكون الوقت قد فات هذا العام لتجربة أي شيء.
 هل لديها خبرة في هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2474.619s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: ولذلك، فإن HRC لا ترعى أحداث الفخر.
 في عام 2022، عندما عقدت المدينة أول حدث سنوي للمجلس، اختارت لجنة حقوق الإنسان عضوين لكتابة إعلان في حفل علم الفخر.
 هذا بعد بعض المفاوضات، لذلك أعتقد أنه يمكنك العودة.
 أعني أبريل أبريل أبريل 2022.
 والصور من لقاء مايو 2022.
 ألقِ نظرة، ولكن هذا مجرد جزء من سلسلة من الخطب في حفل رفع العلم.
 إليك ما قد يفكر فيه CDH.
 إذا كان CDH يريد الجزء الأكبر. إذا كان CDH يريد جزءًا أصغر.
 لكن تذكر: عندما تقول رعاية، فهذا يعني أنك تفعل شيئًا بالفعل.
 هذا ما يعنيه
 تشتري الطعام.
 لذا تصرف كما لو أن الغداء برعاية HRC أو أنك تستضيف الحدث.
 لذلك هذا منفصل.
 ولكن إذا كانت CDH مهتمة بحضور حدث رفع العلم، فيمكنك مناقشة الأمر وإخباري كيف تتصور مشاركتك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2569.347s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: الشيء الوحيد الذي بحثت عنه ولم أجده في تقويم المدينة لهذا العام هو ذكر المدينة.
 العمل بشكل مستمر.
 أين يمكنني العثور عليه؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2581.437s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: لن تجده في التقويم لأنني أعمل على جدول العمدة والفخر يصادف يوم سبت هذا العام، مما يجعل الأمر أكثر صعوبة.
 يبدأ شهر الفخر يوم السبت.
 لذا، إذا لم يكن العمدة موجودًا، فسيتم إغلاق قاعة المدينة يوم السبت وأنت تعلم أنه سيكون من الصعب رفع العلم يوم السبت.
 أنا أيضا أحب الكثير من الرؤوس.
 بهذه الأحداث.
 لا يقتصر الأمر على اجتماع الناس معًا.
 كما تعلمون، يجب أن يكون هناك غرض ومعنى.
 لذلك أتحدث مع أشخاص مختلفين خلف الكواليس.
 بمجرد أن حصلت على الموعد المتفق عليه مع عمدة المدينة في ذلك اليوم، في وقت معين، كان عليّ الآن ربط جميع النقاط الأخرى خلف الكواليس وتحريكها وتغييرها قبل أن نتمكن من القول، "حسنًا، هذه شركة نعم."
 لكن يمكنني أن أقول على وجه اليقين، لا يسعني إلا أن أقول إن المدينة لا تريد الحفاظ على يوم الفخر والاحتفال به حتى 31 مارس.
 كما تعلمون، قد يبدو هذا غبيًا، ولكن هناك آخرون في هذه المجموعات.
 هذا هو فريق DPW الخاص بي.
 يجب أن أتأكد من أنها جاهزة، وأن العلامات لا تبهت، ويجب إعادة تلوينها وتلوينها أولاً في الصباح.
 هناك الكثير مما يحدث في الخلفية قبل ظهور هذا التاريخ في البريد الإلكتروني.
 أعني أنه موجود في التقويم.
 لا أعرف ماذا فعلت هذه المدينة من قبل.
 لا أعرف.
 ولكن هذا هو بالضبط ما حدث خلال العامين الماضيين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2686.885s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: لذلك أفكر في ما أريد أن أفعله.
 قد لا ينعقد مجلسنا هذا العام.
 يبدو مثل الكثير.
 لا أعرف على الراديو، لا أفهم، ربما أقول إذا كانت هذه الوكالة يمكنها فعل شيء ما في العام المقبل، فهذا رائع، وإذا كان بإمكاننا القيام بذلك، إذا تأخر هذا العام أو لم أكن متأكدًا مما حدث، يبدو الأمر غير مؤكد للغاية.
 يمكننا أن نفعل ذلك.
 أعتقد أننا يجب أن نفعل شيئًا بأنفسنا.
 لسنا بحاجة للقيام بذلك في معلمات المدينة.
 لذلك أنا فقط أقترح على زملائي أن هذا هو الشيء الذي ننظر إليه، وربما في العام المقبل سننظر في المنظمات غير الربحية الأخرى، أو لا أعرف إذا كان أي شخص مهتمًا بذلك.
 أتطلع لمعرفة ما إذا كان الناس مهتمين بتحقيق شيء ما معًا.
 كما تعلمون، كل هذا يبدو غامضا بالنسبة لي الآن.
 على سبيل المثال، عندما نحاول تنظيم شيء ما للتنسيق بين جميع الفرق الأخرى، فهي مهمة أكثر صعوبة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2748.939s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: شخص ما... حسنًا يا مورين، لست متأكدًا من السؤال الحقيقي.
 هذا صحيح، لأنك قلت أن الأمور تسير على ما يرام.
 أريد فقط أن أخبرك أن موكب العلم الذي كانت المدينة تقيمه خلال العامين الماضيين لم يقام بعد.
 هذا صحيح.
 لذلك أريد التأكد من أن كل شيء واضح قبل أن نصل إلى أولئك الذين يستمعون والذين قد يستمعون في الاتجاه الآخر.
 سبب عدم رؤيتك للتاريخ هو أنه عطلة نهاية الأسبوع هذا العام.
 لذلك اضطررت إلى تغيير استراتيجيتي.
 لكن لجنة حقوق الإنسان ترحب بـ أن يقوم أ. بشيء من تلقاء نفسه،
 حضور حدث في المدينة كما كان من قبل، أو دعم قضايا أخرى؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2808.045s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: حسنًا، أنا فقط أسأل زملائي عما إذا كانوا يريدون القيام بشيء ما بأنفسهم في العام المقبل؟
 لا أعرف إذا كان هناك شيء من هذا القبيل أو ربما تعلم أنني فقط</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2822.128s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: يمكنني أن أكون قادرًا على المنافسة، لذلك أعتقد أنني إذا كنت أرغب حقًا في رفع العلم الوطني هذا العام والعام المقبل والعثور على شيء آخر للعمل عليه، فسنرى بالتأكيد ما إذا كان ذلك سيتطور في العام المقبل. مورين، أنا منفتح على هذا وأتفق معك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2848.726s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: أعتقد أنه سيكون من الجيد أن نتمكن بطريقة أو بأخرى من المشاركة هذا العام، وهذه المرة بنفس القدر من الوضوح مثل الوقت أو التوقيت أو أي شيء آخر.
 حسنًا، عظيم.
 أنا متحمس للعمل على ما يمكننا القيام به.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2865.912s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: نعم، أؤيد تماما فكرة دعم هذا الحدث هذا العام والعام المقبل.
 إذا كنت أتذكر بشكل صحيح، فرانسيس، أعتقد العام الماضي
 هل تخططون لإقامة أي فعاليات في المدينة خلال شهر يونيو للاحتفال بهذه المناسبة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2886.887s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 وفي عامي 2022 و2023، سيستمر الكبرياء لمدة شهر.
 يتم الاحتفال بالفخر في يونيو، ولكن يتم الاحتفال بالفخر فعليًا في أكتوبر، لذلك تحتفل بعض الولايات بالفخر في أكتوبر.
 لذا فإن الأمر أعمق من مجرد رفع العلم.
 هناك عنصر الحقوق المدنية في هذا.
 إذا ظللت صادقًا بشأن دوري ومسيرتي المهنية، فسيكون ذلك رائعًا.
 أنا أعترف بحركة الحقوق المدنية.
 ووراء ذلك الفخر وحقوق الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة.
 أنتم جميعًا مرتبطون بطريقة أو بأخرى بشكل أو بآخر.
 لذلك عندما نقوم بحدث لمدة شهر، من المهم بالنسبة لي أن يحدث شيء ما خلال ذلك الشهر.
 هذا لا يعني أنه يتعين عليك اتخاذ كل إجراء، ولكن على الرغم من أننا نخطط له ونعرضه ونعطي الأشخاص خيارات لما سيحدث في 02155، أعتقد أنه مفيد.
 هل سيكون هذا مفيدًا لأولئك الذين يتعافون من الصدمة التي سببها أفراد مجتمع LGBTQ، أو لأولئك الذين يعتقدون أنهم يريدون العيش في المكسيك؟
 كما تعلمون، منذ أن جئت إلى هنا قبل عامين، يحدث شيء ما من وقت لآخر، على الأقل كل أسبوع، إن لم يكن مرتين في الأسبوع.
 ولكن هذا ليس صحيحا، أنا لست مسؤولا عن كل شيء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2986.869s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: السنة الأولى نعم، لكن السنة الثانية... أعتقد أن هذا هو المكان الذي أريد الذهاب إليه، وليس مجرد رفع العلم.
 لا يعني ذلك أن رفع العلم أمر سيء، لكني أتساءل عما إذا كان هذا الفريق يهتم، هل تعلم؟
 دعونا نرى ما يمكننا القيام به في يونيو.
 أعتقد أن بعض الأشخاص على الأقل قالوا إنهم مهتمون.
 مدهش.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3013.797s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: ضعه على جدول الأعمال.
 سأخبرك وأضعه في التقويم الخاص بك.
 سأضعه في الحديقة لإبقائه يدور.
 ولكن الآن لدينا محامي أوستن معنا، وأريد الاتصال بمحامي أوستن من KP Law.
 لمراجعة قواعد الاجتماع المفتوح والمناقشات حول نفس الموضوع، سيتلقى الجميع مستند قواعد الاجتماع المفتوح المكون من 48 صفحة.
 لذلك، آمل أن يكون لديك سؤال جاهز، ونعم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3057.75s">[Austin]</a>: 谢谢大家今晚邀请我来这里。
 也谢谢你，弗朗西斯科。
 很高兴见到大家。
 我认为这是一个好机会。
 如您所知，有一位新的代理总检察长，总检察长办公室最近更新了公开会议的法律指南。
 我始终认为，对已经服务了一段时间的会员和新会员进行一点复习是个好主意，只需向他们提供公开会议法的基础知识即可。
 在全州范围内，我们看到对公开会议法的质疑和投诉有所增加。
 我这样说是为了让每个人真正了解我们所生活的环境，尤其是在一个依靠技术的使用而蓬勃发展的环境中。
 我在与英联邦各城镇的公开会议中处理许多法律事务，自 2006 年以来一直从事这项工作。我希望这是一次真正非正式的会议，能够回答任何人的问题。
 我当然可以提供一个概述，而且我知道弗朗西斯科也分发了一些材料。
 我总是按照时间顺序开始并思考公开培训会议或概述。
 会议通知经会议纪要批准后予以公布。
 这就是我对连续体的看法。
 因此，我们收到警告，我们知道，像您这样的公共机构的法定人数所讨论的任何事情通常都必须在我们所谓的公开会议上完成，而不是在执行会议上，这意味着向公众开放，以便能够看到您的工作。
 实时。
 当我们今晚在这里时，这可以在 Zoom 上完成。
 这可以亲自完成。
 我们将四年前于 2020 年开始的远程订单延长至 2025 年 3 月 31 日。
 我们相信还有许多悬而未决的立法，这些立法将从这些立法中得到扩展。
 有很多谈判。
 必须采取哪些流程来继续这一工作。
 这就是为什么我们正在密切监视它，并将随时向您通报最新情况。
 但现在我们可以在 Zoom 上见面。
 我们从议程开始。
 所有事情都必须纳入议程，并在讨论内容方面具有合理的具体性。
 这意味着什么？
 嗯，这意味着坐在家里的公众会拿起或查看屏幕上的会议通知并进行实际分析。
 我想参加这个会议吗？
 这是我想感兴趣的话题吗？
 我想看到关于这个特定主题的公开、透明的讨论吗？
 所以我总是说，当你在社区工作或做志愿者时，你了解所使用的语言或缩写词，例如所使用的语言，但我们真的很想成为这样的人，你知道。
 向公众提供信息，以便他们可以自行决定是否参与。
 这些是会议通知的基础知识。
 我们知道，除非有紧急情况，否则需要提前48个工作小时发布，真正确保在公共机构的业务方面没有不发布的讨论。
 这是会议通知的概述。
 然后我们开始商议并在会议上讨论什么。
 我们知道没有理由参加执行会议，我很乐意回答有关此问题的任何问题。
 我们知道，公共机构的事务必须在公开会议上进行。
 这意味着公共机构的任何法定人数都不能以团体或系列的形式，从一个成员到另一个成员讨论问题。
 在正式公布的会议之外。
 如果我们退一步，公共记录法和公开会议法的目的是，你知道，我们称它们为太阳能法，以提高透明度并确保公众知道他们的社区正在发生什么。
 从这个意义上说，随着技术的使用，我们看到了增长。
 我总是警告这只是一个概述，所以今晚我们不会详细讨论。
 但我始终警告不要使用电子邮件、手机或短信与其他成员交流。
 根据公开会议法和公共记录法，这都具有法律意义。
 所以只是要意识到这一点。
 在这一具体问题上，我们从总检察长的开放政府部门得到了很多指导。
 包括多年前的许多裁决，这些裁决规定，一个成员向另一个成员发送电子邮件或短信，然后对其进行回复，无论是连续还是在正确发布的会议之外以小组形式再次回复，都可能构成审议。
 所以这是需要注意的事情。
 在投票和讨论方面，我们知道公共机构的业务是由公共机构的法定人数进行的。
 如果没有法定人数，这项业务肯定无法完整开展。
 总检察长办公室建议，如果没有达到法定人数，则不应举行会议并推迟到公共机构法定人数可以开会和召开的其他时间，无论是亲自还是远程，无论委员会的偏好如何。
 从那里我们知道会议纪要必须及时编写和批准。
 我们通常说这会在接下来的 30 天或三次会议中发生，根据您的会议安排以先到者为准。
 但当然，就像会议通知或议程一样，您必须小心，确保坐在家里的人得到会议纪要的副本并真正了解发生了什么。
 我们知道你必须有一些基本信息，你知道的，会议的日期和时间，出席或缺席的成员。
 如果会议是远程会议，则必须采用唱名表决方式，并且将进行所有投票。
 再说一次，有人，我称之为四角规则，有人记录会议记录，真正了解投票了哪些票，做了什么，你知道，有人知道会议中实际发生了什么吗？
 从那时起，这些会议记录将受到公开会议法和公共记录法的约束。
 社区成员当然可以提出要求。
 如果有执行会议，则这些会议记录有单独的流程。
 但同样，它们的起草方式必须精确而详细。
 我很高兴回答任何细节。
 我知道这是一次公开会议。
 这就是为什么我总是说我们所处的位置仅供一般信息参考。
 如果您对我们在哪里担任市议员有具体问题，我只是要求您直接或通过弗朗西斯科联系我，就这些具体问题考虑到其特权性质，但我很乐意回答或提供任何主题的概述。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3505.093s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: جانيل، شكرا جزيلا لك.
 لقد ذكرت اجتماعات القيادة عدة مرات، وبما أنني دخلت هذا المجال، فلا أحتاج إلى تحويل الاجتماعات إلى اجتماعات قيادة.
 هل يمكنك مشاركة شيء مختلف قليلاً؟
 الأشخاص الذين قد يأتون إلينا أو الذين لا يعرفون ما هو الاجتماع التنفيذي، ولماذا نستضيف اجتماعًا تنفيذيًا، وبعض المعلمات المشاركة في حضور اجتماع تنفيذي إذا كنا نستخدم التكنولوجيا الافتراضية (التي ليس لدينا تكنولوجيا افتراضية).

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3765.467s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: عادةً ما تكون إحدى المشاكل التي نواجهها هي... الانتظار قليلاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3772.109s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: آسف، روب.
 وقفت مورين ورفعت صوتها.
 وأتساءل عما إذا كان أي شخص قد واجه تأخير؟
 حسنًا، أنت بخير.
 لا، واصل روب.
 حسنًا، دعنا ننتقل إلى روب ثم مورين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3790.22s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: شكرا لك مورين.
 سوف اسرع.
 أفكر فقط في رسائل البريد الإلكتروني الواردة وإذا كانت هناك أية أسئلة، فنحن نريد الإجابة عليها كمجموعة.
 ولم نفعل ذلك بعد، خوفاً من مخالفة قواعد اللقاءات المفتوحة، فهذه علاقة وثيقة ومغلقة وليست نقاشاً.
 أريد أن أسمع رأيك.
 أما هل هذا مناسب أم أنه شيء يجب أن نستمر في تجنبه.
 مرة أخرى، هذا المثال هو إرسال بعض المعلومات ونريد من الفريق بأكمله الرد.
 وذلك عندما عدنا إلى فرنسا واتصلنا بالفريق. هل هذه عملية يجب أن نتبعها؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3834.869s">[Austin]</a>: سؤال جيد.
 ولذلك، فإن المدعي العام يقول إن الاستخدام المناسب الوحيد للبريد الإلكتروني بموجب قانون الجمعية هو:
 يجب أن تقتصر المنتديات الحكومية على أغراض التخطيط فقط.
 هل ستتمكنون من حضور اللقاء يوم الجمعة 13 مارس؟
 هل أنت مستعد لهذا الوقت الخاص؟
 أي خطاب، حتى لو كان يتضمن مشاركة المستندات مع المشاركين (والتي أعتقد أنها فكرة جيدة)، من المحتمل أن ينتهك قواعد الاجتماع المفتوح.
 إذا كان هناك معلومات حول
 أتساءل عما إذا كان ينبغي لنا أن نجتمع حول هذا الموضوع الخاص؟ هل يمكننا وضع هذا على جدول الأعمال؟
 ربما ستصل هذه الرسالة إلى فرانسيسكو والرئيس.
 عندما يتعلق الأمر بتبادل المستندات، فقد رأيت الحلول الممكنة حسب مستوى المحتوى، لكنني أعتقد أن أي تعبير أو اعتقاد يمكن أن يؤدي إلى انتهاك قواعد الاجتماع.
 انها صارمة جدا.
 هناك عملية تفكير وراء ذلك
 نحن جميعًا مشغولون ونستخدم البريد الإلكتروني والبريد في أشياء كثيرة، ويمكن أن يتحول هذا إلى محادثة جادة، أو يمكن لأحد المشاركين ترك تعليق بناءً على وجهة نظر مشارك آخر في رسالة بريد إلكتروني دون أن يتمكن الجمهور من رؤيتها.
 ولهذا السبب أتحدث دائمًا عن أفضل الممارسات.
 في رأيي، أفضل شيء يمكنك القيام به في هذه الحالة هو التواصل ببساطة.
 أنت تعرف فرانسيس بشكل مباشر، أو ربما فرانسيس وأعضاء آخرين، لكن لا يمكنك إرسال رسائل بريد إلكتروني بناءً على أي تعليقات.
 أعلم أن الأمر صعب.
 كما تعلمون، يظهر هذا السؤال دائمًا، كما تعلمون، هل يستطيع الأشخاص مشاركة مستندات Google؟ أو هل تعلم أننا أشخاص اعتدنا على استخدام التكنولوجيا ولدينا اجتماعات نريد حقًا إدارة هذا النوع من الأعمال فيها؟
 ليرى الجمهور.
 هل هذا هو الجواب على سؤالك؟
 نعم شكرا لك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3966.135s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: حسنًا، عظيم.
 آسف، الوقت مبكر جدًا.
 يحتاج المفوض إلى الكثير من المعلومات، سواء كان هذا المفوض أو مفوضًا آخر، فربما يكون قد شاهد تدريبًا في مكان ما أو شاهد شيئًا يعتقد أنه سيكون ذا أهمية للفريق.
 عادةً ما يتم إرسال هذه الرسائل إليّ أو بشكل ما إلى صندوق الوارد الخاص بي.
 لقد أرسلت
 أي نسخة ترسلها إليّ وتشاركها نيابة عن الآخرين لا تحتاج إلى الرد، إذا كنت مهتمًا، فيرجى التسجيل.
 أعرف أحيانًا أن الناس يشعرون وكأنني أطفئهم لأنني أخبرهم أنهم لا يحتاجون إلى الإجابة، لكنني أيضًا لا أحتاج إلى الحصول على الإجابة الكاملة.
 لتجنب أكثر الناس براءة، يا إلهي، حضرت هذا الحدث، كان رائعا.
 لأن هذا هو المكان الذي تأتي منه الآراء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4024.346s">[Austin]</a>: أو أن هناك خطأ ما، أعتقد أن هذا الحدث جيد جدًا، وأعتقد حقًا أنه سيفيد المدينة ويجب أن نفكر في القيام به.
 ثم يجيب الآخرون واحدًا تلو الآخر: أنا موافق.
 وهو تعبير في حد ذاته.
 في هذه الحالة، أعتقد أنه من الأفضل إرسالها إلى فرانسيسكو.
 وبعض الجهات الحكومية التي أعمل بها لديها المستندات التالية بسبب قواعد الاجتماعات المفتوحة، لذا يرجى عدم الرد.
 قد يُنظر إلى هذا على أنه تذكير لطيف لأولئك الذين يترددون في الاستجابة أو تقديم المشورة للناخبين أو أفراد المجتمع، ولكن في الواقع هذا شيء ستتم مناقشته في الاجتماع التالي.
 في بعض الأحيان، ستكون فرص تدريب الطاقم أو ترقية الطاقم مدرجة على جدول الأعمال.
 ثم سيكون هناك قسم حيث يمكن مناقشة هذه القضايا ويمكن للجمهور مراقبة المناقشة.
 كما تقوم بعض الوكالات الحكومية أيضًا بإدراج المراسلات بين الاجتماعات ومن ثم إدراج الرسائل المرسلة.
 هذا قد يؤدي إلى النزاعات.
 بين الأعضاء حول المقرر الخاص.
 لذلك هذا خيار آخر.
 لكن العديد من الوكالات الحكومية التي أعمل معها لديها هذا التحذير في نهاية الاجتماع أو في أي بريد إلكتروني: يرجى تجنب الإجابة بالضبط لأنه قد لا يكون ذلك مقصودًا، ولكن إذا طلب شخص ما هذا السجل العام
 وقد شوهد بعض المستجيبين.
 فهل هذا يعد انتهاكا لقانون الاجتماعات؟
 لذلك عليك أن تأخذ كل شيء في الاعتبار.
 مورين هل لديك أي أسئلة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4139.648s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: نعم، لقد فعلت ذلك.
 لدي البعض، لكني سأتقبل ما يحدث للآخرين.
 لذلك قرأت بعناية قانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة الذي قدمه لنا فرانسيس.
 لا أرى أي ذكر للجنة التي أتحدث عنها.
 على سبيل المثال، نقرر ما إذا كنا نريد استضافة حدث معين أو جهة راعية معينة.
 هناك نوعان آخران
 وقد قرر عدد أقل من الأغلبية أنهم سيقدمون هذا الالتزام.
 يمكننا أن نفعل الكثير في ساعة ونصف في الشهر.
 إنه أمر محزن بعض الشيء لأنه ليس لدينا الكثير من الوقت.
 إذا كان الغرض في الواقع أقل من الأغلبية في الاجتماع وكان الغرض هو توفير معلومات شاملة للنظر فيها في الاجتماعات اللاحقة، فهل يخضع ذلك لقانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4201.547s">[Austin]</a>: وسيقوم مكتب المدعي العام بعد ذلك بالنظر فيما إذا كانت الوكالة الحكومية ستنشئ لجنة فرعية.
 لا يهم عادةً ما إذا كان النصاب القانوني لهيئة عامة كبيرة طالما أن هناك أعضاء، وكما تعلمون، ليس من الضروري أن تكون لجنة فرعية رسمية، بل يمكن أن تكون أي مجموعة عمل.
 باعتبارك عضوًا في اللجنة، إذا صوتوا لصالح تحميل روب ومورين المسؤولية عن هذا الحادث بالذات، فهل ستشكل لجنة فرعية أو فريق عمل، ربما بموجب قانون السجلات العامة؟
 كما تعلمون، يجب على الناس أن يفهموا ويكونوا قادرين على فعل كل شيء.
 بعض المجتمعات التي أعمل معها تنشئ مجتمعًا محددًا، وتعقد اجتماعات عامة وتقول إن مورين ستهتم بهذه القضية الخاصة، وسيهتم روب بهذه القضية الخاصة، وبعد ذلك سنلتقي مرة أخرى في الاجتماع التالي ونعيد تنظيم المجموعة.
 لكن إذا اتخذت جهة حكومية قرارًا محددًا بنقل العمل إلى ذلك الجزء من الجهة الحكومية، فأعتقد أن قانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة هو الذي ينطبق.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4279.631s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: لذا، مهما كان ما تقوله، أود أن أؤكد أنك تقول أنه إذا قالت هذه المنظمة أننا صوتنا لمورين وروب لحل هذه المشكلة، فستكون هناك حاجة إلى عقد اجتماع عام.
 وعلى العكس من ذلك، إذا صوتوا بنعم، مورين، لماذا لا تتحقق من ذلك؟
 هل يمكنك إخبار مورين وروب أنهما سيتجاوزان هذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4298.376s">[Austin]</a>: حسنًا، أعتقد أنه سيتعين علينا أن نرى.
 أعتقد أننا يجب أن ننظر إلى هذا بشكل فضفاض.
 أعني أن الاستثناء الوحيد هو إذا لم يفعل العمدة ذلك
 وفقًا لقواعد الاجتماع، قلت أنني سأطلب من فرانسيس ومورين وروب أن يفعلوا شيئًا من أجلي، أليس كذلك؟
 مهما كان الأمر، أحب اختباره وتقديم بعض النصائح في الكتابة، لكن الأمر يعتمد في الغالب على وظيفتي وأهدافي.
 الغرض من هذا المثال هو تقديم المشورة لجميع الجهات الحكومية، أليس كذلك؟
 في المثال الخاص بك، الفرضيات
 أعتقد ردًا على ذلك، سيقول المدعي العام إنه تم إنشاء مجموعة عمل أو لجنة فرعية ستثير مسألة قانون التجمعات.
 سأتحقق مما إذا كان مساهمًا واحدًا أو اثنين، ولكنه واسع جدًا من حيث التنفيذ والتشغيل.
 أنا دائمًا أنظر إلى الأمر على أنه رسم تخطيطي: من أنشأ هذا الفريق؟
 كيف تقوم الوكالات الحكومية بإنشائه إذا كنت أنت أو فرانسيسكو يعملان معك
 قد يُطلب منك الالتزام بقواعد الاجتماع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4372.721s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: لا أعتقد أن الفريق بحاجة إلى التواجد هناك لتقديم المشورة، بل لاستئناف البحث، لكن هذا ليس هو الحال ولا أعتقد أن هذه نصيحة.
 أنا لا أقول أنهم سيقفون ويقولون، "حسنًا، لقد أجرينا البحث ونعتقد أنه يجب عليك القيام بذلك."
 إنه أشبه
 لقد فعلوا ذلك، وهذا ما فعلته اللجنة.
 ليس عليهم فعل ذلك، لكنك تقول أن هذا يعني أنهم يقدمون النصائح، لذا إذا فعلنا ذلك، يمكننا إخبار الناس، ومنحهم إشعارًا قبل 48 ساعة، ودعوتهم للانضمام إلى هذه المناقشة، اجتماع لشخصين.
 حادثة ونحن بخير.
 وسنقوم بعد ذلك بتقديم جميع المعلومات التي تم جمعها إلى الوكالة بأكملها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4425.617s">[Austin]</a>: نعم، أريد حقًا أن ألفت انتباهكم إلى الصفحة السابعة من دليل النائب العام، والتي توضح ما يشكل كيانًا عامًا.
 ويذكر النائب العام على وجه التحديد أنه لا توجد قائمة كاملة بالهيئات الحكومية أو مجالس الإدارة أو اللجان أو اللجان أو اللجان الفرعية التي تتكون من أكثر من عضو واحد.
 السلطة التنفيذية أو التشريعية.
 ويشمل ذلك أي هيئة متعددة الأعضاء يتم إنشاؤها لمراجعة أو تقديم توصيات إلى الوكالات الحكومية.
 لذلك فهي واسعة جدًا.
 هذا ما أعنيه ومن المسؤول أمام هذه المجموعة.
 مرة أخرى، عادة ما تكون هناك استثناءات فقط.
 ويجب أن يتم تشكيل فريق العمل من مدير المدرسة أو رئيس البلدية الذي لا يخضع لأحكام قانون عقد الاجتماعات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4481.063s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: لكن الأمر هو، بغض النظر عما تسميه، أن الوكالة تقدم توصيات بالفعل.
 هذا ما أستمر في الاستماع إليك تقوله.
 وإذا لم يكن مجرد اقتراح، إذا كان بحثًا، فأنت بنفسك تقول إنه اقتراح، أليس كذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4501.395s">[Austin]</a>: حسنًا، سيتعين علينا أن نرى أين يقع الخط الفاصل، ولكن يمكنني أن أخبركم من خلال الخبرة، عندما يتعلق الأمر بالشكاوى حول قواعد الاجتماع المفتوح لفريقنا وفريقنا، فإن هذه القواعد واسعة جدًا.
 في الوقت الحالي، لدي حل ملموس، لذا يسعدني مشاركته مع فرانسيسكو لمساعدة الجميع في الحصول على فكرة واضحة عن المكان الذي يجب أن يذهبوا إليه.
 إذا كنتِ مهتمة يا مورين، سأكون سعيدًا للقيام بذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4529.797s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: حسنًا، لدي سؤال آخر، قرأت أن محضر الاجتماع سيتم نشره خلال 10 أيام، بغض النظر عما إذا تمت الموافقة عليه أو تحريره.
 لذلك سؤالي هو.
 كيف يمكن استخدامها؟
 وأتساءل عما إذا كان هذا يؤسس لقانون الانفتاح؟
 على سبيل المثال، عندما لا تكون اجتماعاتنا موجودة على موقع المدينة الإلكتروني.
 لذلك، على سبيل المثال، إذا تم سؤالك، كعضو جديد، عما حدث في يونيو، أو إذا كنت في مكان عام، فسوف تفكر، "أوه، ما الذي تتحدث عنه؟"
 لست متأكدًا من المواقف التي يتخذونها وما إذا كانوا كذلك أم لا. أعني، هذا مهم، والشيء الآخر هو، إذا تم الانتهاء منها، إذا تمت الموافقة عليها أو في شكل مسودة، فسيتم استبدالها بأخرى تمت الموافقة عليها في اللحظة الأخيرة، وعندما تتم الموافقة عليها، نعم، سيتم كتابة اليوميات. أنا لا أعرف كيف كل شيء معك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4599.139s">[Austin]</a>: قرر من سيكتب بدلاً من ذلك، أو شخصًا واحدًا فقط، ولكن احتفظ بالدقائق.
 عندما يتم تسجيلها، حتى لو لم تتم الموافقة عليها، نعلم أنه من متطلبات قانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة إذا كانت في شكل مسودة ويقدم الجمهور سجلًا عامًا أو طلب قانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة للحصول على محاضر تلك الاجتماعات، حتى لو لم تتم الموافقة عليها، أحيانًا تجتمع مرة واحدة في الشهر.
 ويجب تقديم هذا البروتوكول في شكل مسودة.
 هذا سجل عام، لذا فإن أي سجل يسمح لي بإنشاء نسخ احتياطية لأي سجلات تم إنشاؤها أو استلامها من قبل موظفي البلدية، والمسؤولين، والمتطوعين، وأعضاء المجلس، وأعضاء اللجنة، وأعضاء اللجنة يخضع لقانون السجلات العامة.
 يتضمن ذلك الملفات التي تم إنشاؤها على جهاز الكمبيوتر الشخصي الخاص بك، بما في ذلك الرسائل النصية القصيرة، بما في ذلك رسائل البريد الإلكتروني إذا كانت تتعلق بأعمال تجارية في المدينة.
 ثم قال أحد الأشخاص إنهم عادةً ما يرسلونها إلى الإدارة القانونية ويقولون، كما تعلم، جانيس، إنها كانت مسؤولة الوصول إلى السجلات وأحتاج إلى نسخة من هذه السجلات.
 إذا كانت هذه مسودة، فسوف تتصل بك جانيس وتسألك عما إذا كان لديك نسخة من هذا النص.
 أوه نعم، إنها مجرد مسودة.
 نعم، أليس كذلك؟
 ربما تكون هذه محاضر اجتماعات عامة وليست جلسات تنفيذية.
 بمجرد الموافقة، سيحصل الجمهور على منشور معتمد إذا تلقوا نفس الطلب ووافقوا على المنشور.
 لا يلزم نشر محضر الاجتماع على موقع المدينة الإلكتروني.
 بعض المجتمعات تفعل هذا.
 بعض الأشخاص لا ينشرون جميع محاضر اجتماعاتهم عبر الإنترنت.
 غالبًا ما تكون هذه أنشطة تستهلك موارد المدينة.
 لكن هذا يشير إلى أنهم ما زالوا خاضعين للبروتوكول العام وقواعد الاجتماعات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4705.229s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: وهذا يعني أنه إذا أراد شخص ما شيئًا ما، فيجب عليه أن يطلبه.
 هذه هي الإجابة القصيرة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4712.071s">[Austin]</a>: بالضبط.
 لذلك هذا هو جزأين.
 أولاً، يشترط قانون الاجتماعات كتابة هذه المحاضر والموافقة عليها والتوقيع عليها.
 ويتم ذلك وفقا لقانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة.
 لذلك كل شيء آخر يعتمد على الجمهور.
 طلب والامتثال لقانون السجلات العامة ومتطلبات الاجتماعات القانونية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4735.277s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: لذلك لا توجد ظروف يمكن أن يحدث فيها هذا.
 يحتاج الناس فقط أن يأتوا إلى المدينة ويقولوا: "أعطني هذه الدقائق".
 إذا كنت تريد أن ترى محاضر العام الماضي، فسيتعين عليك القيام بذلك.
 تحتاج إلى تقديم طلب رسمي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4752.186s">[Austin]</a>: أعني نعم أو لا أعرف من لديه. لا أعرف من لديه سجل، ولكن يمكنك، أعني، عادةً لا يتعين عليك إنشاء سجل عام رسمي لهم، لكن كما تعلم، أعتقد أنه يمكنهم التعامل مع الأمر داخليًا كموظفة في الخدمة العامة، مورين، لكنني أعتقد بشكل عام أننا نريد الحفاظ على الاتساق في هذه المرحلة.
 يمكنك التحقق
 أنت تعرف العروض التقديمية وكيف ظهرت أو ما هو النهج المتبع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4787.24s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: في الواقع، أفكر في الجمهور أكثر من نفسي.
 كما تعلمون، يقول بعض الناس: "يا إلهي، أريد أن أرى ماذا يفعلون."
 أنا فقط أحاول أن أفهم كيف يجدهم الناس.
 هذا كل شيء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4798.686s">[Austin]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنني سأفعل ذلك عادةً عن طريق طلب سجل عام محدد من موظف لديه حق الوصول إلى هذا السجل، أو عن طريق مطالبة رئيس وكالة حكومية بإنشاء سجل، وهو ما كان سيحصل عليه عادةً بموجب قواعد الإفصاح.
 عندما أراهم قادمين</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4815.635s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أؤكد أن محضر الاجتماع محفوظ في ثلاثة أماكن مختلفة.
 ثم هناك النسخة الإلكترونية، التي تستغرق وقتًا أطول لأنها تذهب إلى Medford Community Media.
 نعم، هذا هو الفيديو لدينا.
 ولكن ما حدث في نهاية الاجتماع
 أعلم أنه إذا تمت الموافقة على المذكرة، فهذا يعني أنه إذا تمت الموافقة على المذكرة ولم يتم تغييرها، فسوف أنزل إلى غرفة الزيارة وأقوم بعمل سبع نسخ.
 يوجد حاليًا ثماني نسخ وسأشتري واحدة.
 لا تزال لدي نسخة، الأصل والباقي محفوظ في مكتب العمدة.
 أنت لا تزال في أمانة المدينة.
 يمكن لأي شخص الانضمام وطلب مراجعة المحضر.
 لا أستطيع أن أقول إلا من أبريل 2022 حتى الوقت الحاضر.
 لكنني لست جيدًا في تدوين الملاحظات.
 عادةً ما أرسل مسودتك كملاحظة ثم أرسلها مرة أخرى إلى الاجتماع.
 لذلك هذا شيء نحتاج جميعًا إلى أن نحبه ونبدأ في التواصل معه.
 هل أكدت لك مورين هذا؟
 حسنًا ، روب وديان.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4902.737s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نعم شكرا لك.
 أعتقد أنني سأنضم إلى اللجنة الفرعية المعنية بالمشورة وتبادل المعلومات قريبًا.
 أود أن أرى المدعي العام يقود الطريق إلى الأمام.
 هل هم تحت اختصاص اللجنة بعد اجتماعنا الشهري الذي يستمر 90 دقيقة؟
 ما هي الاقتراحات التي لدى المكتب لإحراز بعض التقدم في هذه القضايا خلال الاجتماع؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4939.699s">[Austin]</a>: لذلك أعتقد أنه إذا أراد أحد أعضاء الفريق العمل بشكل فردي أو ضمن فريق في نفس الوقت، فيمكنني التعاون معه.
 كما تعلمون، الأعضاء ليسوا وكلاء، أو مسؤولي المدينة، وبالتأكيد اثنان أو ثلاثة أعضاء يرغبون في الاجتماع معًا لإجراء هذه المناقشات.
 أريد فقط أن أشير إلى أنه سيتم عرضها للجمهور، أليس كذلك؟
 واتباع قواعد الاجتماع.
 أو هكذا أعتقد.
 إن جدولة اجتماعات إضافية ستكون مجرد اقتراح أو ممارسة جيدة.
 حسنًا، ولكن من الواضح أن هذا قرار سياسي ويجب على الأعضاء أن يفكروا في تغيير الأمور بما يتناسب مع جدول أعمالهم وما إلى ذلك.
 كما تعلمون، هناك وكالات حكومية تجتمع، خاصة خلال الأوقات الأكثر ازدحامًا في العام وفي كثير من الأحيان.
 سنقوم بعد ذلك بإعادة جدولة الاجتماعات اعتمادًا على ما إذا كان هناك عمل مهم يتعين القيام به أم لا، ولكن إليك بعض الخيارات المختلفة.
 وكما قلت، هناك دائمًا خيار العمل بمفردك أو مع أحد أعضاء لجنة خاصة ومن ثم تقديم التقارير إلى مجموعة عامة صغيرة حسب الحاجة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5014.173s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: أرى
 أعتقد أن إحدى المشكلات التي نواجهها هي جدول الاجتماعات المكتوب في مقالة التكامل الخاصة بنا.
 هل من العدل تفسير ذلك على أنه نصيحة غامضة بعض الشيء؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5031.95s">[Austin]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 أعني، أعتقد أنني أستطيع حقًا اختبار القواعد.
 لقد أنشأوا وكالة حكومية لمعرفة مدى المرونة، ولكن بما أن المواعيد مفتوحة وتعاونية، فكل ما هو مطلوب هو الإعلان المناسب وإخطار الجمهور عند جدولة مواعيد إضافية.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، يمكننا أن ننظر إلى لغة القانون.
 يسعدني القيام بذلك وإخبار فرانسيسكو بذلك.
 لكن من الناحية القانونية للاجتماع المفتوح، إذا تم نشره بشكل صحيح، وبعض المنظمات المجتمعية ستقوم بالنشر والرفض، بالطبع، ما لم يكتمل النصاب القانوني، أو يقومون بالنشر ويقولون إننا لا نحتاج إلى هذا الاجتماع.
 لذا استسلم.
 ولكن على الأقل هذا هو الحال في كتاب روب.
 مرة أخرى، في أوقات معينة من العام، هناك صعود وهبوط في عبء العمل في الوكالات الحكومية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5086.017s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: أرى
 شكرا لك
 نعم، سيكون أمرا رائعا إذا قمت بفحصه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5089.159s">[Austin]</a>: نعم، أحب القيام بذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5092.02s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: أحسنت يا ديانا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5093.08s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا لك
 رائع.
 لقد لاحظت أنك كنت تتحقق من مواردك على Google أثناء العرض وفكرت للتو
 كما تعلمون، من الواضح أن هذا يرجع إلى أنني لاحظت في بحثي عن لجان حقوق الإنسان الأخرى أنهم يبدو أنهم ينشرون مذكراتهم، كما تعلمون، منظمة بشكل جيد حسب السنة والشهر.
 لقد سمعت عن بعض الأشخاص الذين يتعاونون، مثل النشر قبل الاجتماعات واستخدام محرّر مستندات Google للتعاون.
 حول البيانات الخاصة أو المحتوى الآخر.
 أحاول فقط تعلم قواعد المشاركة عبر Google.
 ومن يدري، لو تم الإعلان عن Google Drive على موقع لجنة حقوق الإنسان لكانت شركة صن قادرة على حل هذه المشكلة؟
 أريد فقط أن أفهم هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5157.557s">[Austin]</a>: من الواضح أن هذه تقنية جديدة رأيناها في السنوات الأخيرة.
 وكما تعلمون، في رأيي، فإن أي تعاون في محرر مستندات Google، إذا حدث، فمن المرجح أن يعتبر مناسبًا بموجب قانون الاجتماعات المفتوحة وتنفيذه والمبادئ التي رأيناها حتى الآن.
 حسنًا، من المحتمل أنه عند استخدام محرّر مستندات Google أو أي أداة تعاون أخرى، سيحدث هذا باستمرار.
 لذلك، غالبًا ما أستخدم مثال مجموعة محددة من الدقائق ويأتي روب أولاً ويقوم بإجراء التغييرات.
 ثم جاءت ديانا وأجرت تغييرات، ولكن يمكنك رؤية تغييرات روب، وبعد ذلك تم تحديد كل شيء، وليس في اجتماع عام.
 وبعد ذلك، عندما تحضر اجتماعًا، سترى آراء الأعضاء الآخرين في الوكالة الحكومية حول هذه القضايا المحددة.
 محضر الاجتماع.
 ولذلك، يتطلب القانون أنه يجوز للفرد تدوين محضر اجتماع أو كتابة وثيقة، ولكن يجب إجراء المناقشة والنظر في وثائق محددة في جلسة مفتوحة حتى يتمكن الجمهور من رؤية مداولات الوكالة الحكومية نفسها.
 التكنولوجيا المعقدة ديانا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5247.43s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: التكنولوجيا معقدة وأنا أعلم أنني أعمل في مجال التكنولوجيا ولا نستخدم Google.
 لذلك أنا متمسك به حقًا.
 قالت شركة Google المعنية، والآن بعد أن حصلنا على ADA AI الخاص بي، نعم، لقد قمنا بتحسين التجربة، لقد فعلنا ذلك.
 الجانب الخاص بي من DEI هو، أوه لا.
 إذن الآن هي الحرب
 هناك الكثير من الأشياء الجيدة والعديد من الأشياء السيئة، وأريد فقط أن يساعدني شخص ما في اتخاذ القرار حتى أتمكن من القول: "حسنًا، هذا ما نفعله".
 المفوض، هل لديك أي أسئلة أخرى؟
 وبما أننا في مكان عام، يسعدني أن أمنحهم الفرصة لطرح الأسئلة.
 لا أرى أي أسئلة للمفوض.
 باري، هل تريد مواصلة سؤالك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5310.006s">[Barry Ingber]</a>: آمل أن يقرأ الآخرون هذا.
 يبدو أن حقيقة أن الوقت قد حان بالنسبة لي للرحيل تثير النقطة التي أثارها روب.
 هل يمكنك تقديم نفسك؟
 اسمي باري إنجبر.
 أعيش في شمال ميدفورد.
 ولكن عندما يتعلق الأمر بمستند Google، أتساءل عما إذا كان هذا الرأي سيتغير إذا تم نشر المستند للعامة حتى يتمكن الجمهور من رؤية المناقشة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5491.072s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: لأن هذا هو المكان الذي نجد أنفسنا فيه الليلة، حتى ونحن نتحدث عما إذا كنا نخطط بالفعل لفعل أي شيء لشهر الفخر في العام المقبل.
 اثنان من أعضاء اللجنة مهتمان بالتحقيق في هذا الأمر.
 إذن ماذا يعني هذا؟
 أولاً، اكتشف ما يحدث في المدينة.
 ثانيا
 ما هي الأفكار التي يمكن أن نتوصل إليها؟
 ثم سنمضي قدمًا ونخبر الفريق بما وجدناه، وليس ما نعرفه على وجه اليقين، ولكن ما وجدناه.
 هل يجب أن نفعل هذا بمفردنا ونعود لاحقًا؟
 هل هذا ما قلته؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5529.61s">[Austin]</a>: نعم، يمكنك القيام بذلك بشكل منفصل ومن خلال الوساطة أو التواصل.
 سوف تتعرف على آخر الأخبار من خلال فرانسيسكو ثم تقوم بإبلاغ جميع السلطات الحكومية بالخطوة التالية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5550.323s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: إنه مثير للاهتمام لأنه لا يخلق مجتمعًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5553.764s">[Austin]</a>: لقد كسر للتو.
 أنا أعرف</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5555.664s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: هذا يزعجني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5559.185s">[Austin]</a>: الأمر هو أننا نعلم أن قانون الاجتماع المفتوح من الناحية الفنية لا يتطلب تعليقًا عامًا، لكننا نعرف ذلك
 وبموجب قواعد الاجتماع المفتوح، حدث هذا ملايين المرات على مدى السنوات الأربع الماضية، وللجمهور الحق في مشاهدة ما يحدث في الوقت الحقيقي.
 لذا فإن هدفنا هو أن نكون قادرين حقًا على تحقيق التوازن بين كل ذلك.
 ولكنني أرغب في نشر هذا الدليل بالتحديد حتى يفهم الناس نطاق ما يمكن تحقيقه.
 وطبعا هذا الأمر لعدم اكتمال النصاب بين الطرفين في الجهة الحكومية، لذلك سيكون لديهم نصيحة محددة لمورين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5607.276s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: أريد فقط أن أعطيك مثالاً آخر.
 إذا كنت تتذكر، فقد تلقينا جميعًا نفس الرسالة التي تلقيناها من أعضاء تحالف ماساتشوستس لحقوق الإنسان الشهر الماضي عندما انضمت ديان.
 إنهم يعملون على برنامج Zoom.
 شاركت ديانا بمفردها.
 لم ترسل ديانا بريدًا إلكترونيًا إلى اللجنة.
 لم تسأل ديانا فرانسيس عما إذا كان بإمكانها الحضور.
 وكانت ديانا حاضرة وحدها، لكنها قالت:
 المستأجر. هل يمكنك أن تضعني على التقويم الخاص بك؟
 أريد أن أشارك تجربتي.
 ويمكن القيام بذلك من قبل أي عضو في اللجنة.
 ليس لديك العديد من الاجتماعات الخارجية أو فرص التدريب مثل لجاني الأخرى لأن MBTA تقوم ببعض الأعمال.
 يجب أن تولي المزيد من الاهتمام لهذا.
 لذا إذا وجدته، سأرسله عبر البريد الإلكتروني ويمكنك إرساله بنفسك.
 إذا شعروا أن الأمر يستحق المشاركة مع أعضاء اللجنة الآخرين، فسوف يتصلون بي ويطلبون مني إدراج هذا البند على جدول الأعمال.
 أو أحيانًا يقولون لي: فرانسيس، هل يمكنك مشاركة هذا؟
 لم أفعل ذلك هذه المرة، ولكن ربما كان أحد مفوضي يستطيع فعل ذلك.
 وهذا هو الوقت الذي يمكنهم فيه المشاركة نيابة عن الآخرين دون الرد.
 بريد إلكتروني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5692.485s">[Austin]</a>: أعتقد أنه إذا كنتم ترغبون جميعًا في المشاركة في التدريب، فيمكنكم القيام بذلك.
 وهذا لا ينتهك قانون عقد الاجتماعات.
 أعتقد أننا جميعًا نهتم بشدة بمدينتنا ومجتمعنا.
 بالتأكيد لديك الحق في القيام بذلك.
 كما تعلمون، لديك الحق في التعديل الأول للقيام بذلك.
 هناك نوعان آخران
 كما تعلمون، القانون لا يحظر الاجتماعات.
 كما تعلم، يمكنك حضور مناسبة اجتماعية أو حدث في المدينة.
 والسؤال هو هل تعلم هل أعضاء الجهات الحكومية ينظرون في أمور عدم الاجتماع؟
 لذا، على مر السنين، رأيت عدد لا يحصى من الشكاوى حول حضور هذين الشخصين المناسبات العامة، كما تعلمون، تخليدًا لذكرى هذا الرجل.
 أوه، لكني أستطيع سماعهم يهمسون في الردهة.
 لذا، أعلم أنهم يتحدثون عن بعض الأشياء التي ينبغي أن يتحدثوا عنها في المؤتمر، أليس كذلك؟
 أو هؤلاء الأشخاص في اجتماع اجتماعي، لكن كما تعلمون، يبدو الأمر وكأنهم يتحدثون وأنا أسمع شيئًا عن X أو Y أو Z ولا ينبغي أن يحدث ذلك.
 اه دي مش فكرة أو فيه مؤتمر كلكم مهتمين فيه بمواضيع على المستوى المهني والشخصي.
 ثم يمكنك أن تفعل ذلك.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 أعني أنه يمكنك الذهاب إلى التدريب.
 السؤال الحقيقي هو: هل أنت عضو خارج نطاق ولايتك القضائية، إذا جاز التعبير، لمناقشة الأمور الواقعة ضمن ولايتك القضائية؟
 لذلك أريد فقط التأكد من أن الأمر واضح.
 تحاول قواعد الاجتماع المفتوح تحقيق التوازن بين الأشخاص، كما تعلمون، تحقيق التوازن بينهم قدر الإمكان.
 سؤال جيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5795.704s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: شكرا لك جانيل.
 هل لدى أي شخص أي أسئلة أخرى؟
 هل يوجد أعضاء في اللجنة؟
 آه، لقد رأيت للتو شخصين معنا.
 كمواطن، هل لديك أسئلة حول قانون تنظيم الاجتماعات العامة؟
 ما هي عناصر المنتدى؟
 متى سيتم إلغاء الإجتماع؟
 حسنًا، لا أرى أحدًا يرفع يده.
 والآن أصبح 709.
 محامي
 أوستن، شكرًا جزيلاً لك على وقتك وشرحك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5836.195s">[Austin]</a>: شكرا لكم، من الجميل أن نلتقي بكم جميعا.
 وسوف أقوم أنا وفريق العمل التابع للجنة الفرعية بمراقبة الوضع.
 سعدت بلقائكم جميعا.
 لدى فرانسيس معلومات الاتصال الخاصة بي إذا كنت بحاجة إلى أي مساعدة.
 ويسعدني دائمًا مناقشة أي أسئلة قد تكون لديكم.
 أنا أقدر وقتك الليلة.
 ليلة سعيدة
 شكرا جزيلا لك.
 اعتني بنفسك
 شكرا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5854.622s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: نفس الشيء يحدث لك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5855.043s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: هناك الكثير مما يجب اكتشافه، ولكن آمل أن نتمكن من الحصول على الأوراق لأنني سأفعل ذلك وسيكون لدي الوقت لقراءتها للتأكد من أنه ليس لدي أي أسئلة إذا كانت لديك أي أسئلة قبل وصول المحامي.
 لكن كما تعلمون، حاولوا استيعاب هذه المعلومات والتفكير فيها لمحاولة أن تكونوا أكثر شفافية مع المجتمع حول كيفية عملنا.
 إذا تعلقنا بفكرة أن لدينا عددًا معينًا من الاجتماعات فقط أو أننا لا نستطيع إنجازها، فإننا نخلق عقبات داخل أنفسنا تمنعنا من فعل أي شيء.
 مرة أخرى، جدول الأعمال مفتوح للجميع، أليس كذلك؟
 لا نحتاج إلى ثلاثة أشخاص لمعرفة من يدير أي حدث.
 إذا كانت فرانسيس مهووسة بشيء ما، يمكنها أن تأتي لرؤيته، وتضعه على جدول الأعمال وتقدم النصيحة.
 وهذا ليس ضروريًا دائمًا في بيئة المجموعة.
 وإذا كنا بحاجة إلى لجنة فرعية وفريق عمل أكبر، فسنحتاج إلى المزيد من الاجتماعات إذا تم الإعلان عنها مسبقًا.
 إنها حقًا مسألة شفافية ووصول عام.
 آمل أن تجد هذا مفيدا.
 هل لديك أي أسئلة أخرى؟
 كنت أنتظر فقط معرفة الوقت لأنه كان علي أن أتوجه بسرعة إلى المكتب في الساعة 7:30 صباحًا.
 وإلا فإن ختمنا سيبقى للغد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5969.114s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: هل أستطيع أن أقول شيئا؟
 مثالي.
 أشكركم جميعا.
 جيد جدا ولا تشوبه شائبة.
 أعتقد ذلك.
 مثالي.
 شكرا لكم جميعا، لقد كان لقاء رائعا هذا المساء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5982.993s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: حسنًا، شكرًا جزيلاً لك، حسنًا، شكرًا لك، لذا الآن سأضغط على زر إيقاف التسجيل لبدء الاجتماع، ولكن قبل ذلك، يجب على شخص ما أن يطلب تأخيرًا لإنهاء الاجتماع. ولذلك، أود إعادة جدولة الاجتماع. إذن من يدعم هذا؟
 شكرا لك ستيفن.
 هل يريد أحد حقًا قضاء الليل؟
 حسنا
 لا أرى أي متطوعين.
 كل شيء على ما يرام.
 شكرا للجميع.
 انتباه</p>
