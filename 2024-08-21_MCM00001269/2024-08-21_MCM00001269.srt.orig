[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a Medford resident for about two years now and on the commission since this fall.

00:00:54,688 --> 00:01:00,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Rob Klein, Medford resident since 2014 and I've been on the commission since 2020.

16
00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:07,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe I'm the last one of the commissioners.

17
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:08,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Sana on the call as well.

18
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

19
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:11,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Rob.

20
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:14,605
[SPEAKER_07]: You are the last one of the commissioners.

21
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:20,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hold Sana's introduction until it's time for presentation.

22
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:25,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a commissioner that wants to read the HRC meeting and touchstones?

23
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:29,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do it.

24
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you, Steph.

25
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

26
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Be present, presume welcome, and extend welcome.

27
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:41,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Order of meeting is the commission meets to discuss the agenda first.

28
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:47,629
[SPEAKER_05]: At conclusion of meeting agenda, members of the public are invited to share comments.

29
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Raise your hand before speaking and avoid interrupting others.

30
00:01:53,126 --> 00:02:16,001
[SPEAKER_05]: speak for yourself and speak your truth in ways that respect others' truths, acknowledge others' lived experience to promote human dignity, listen deeply, believe that it's possible to emerge refreshed, surprised, and less burdened, expect and accept a lack of closure when things get difficult, turn to wonder.

31
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:19,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

32
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:22,345
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Chief Buckley,

33
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:24,526
[SPEAKER_07]: You're up next.

34
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:28,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Francis and thanks for letting me get on the agenda early.

35
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:29,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize tonight.

36
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:36,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I have at least 1 police issue I'm dealing with and then I have to attend another public meeting.

37
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I will not be able to stay, but I.

38
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:47,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it was important to at least attend in the beginning of this meeting tonight because I have a request.

39
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:48,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a need.

40
00:02:48,504 --> 00:03:04,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm requesting to move a motion to amend last month's endorsement on the Memphis City Council's resolution in support of a ceasefire related to Israel and Gaza.

41
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:16,927
[SPEAKER_00]: If this commission so votes and allows me to amend my vote, I will be looking to strike my yes vote and insert my vote to abstain.

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:25,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had much reflection on this issue since the last month, a little bit of education on the issues, some clearer understandings.

43
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:29,415
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my opinion that as Chief of Police,

44
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:38,019
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot nor should I vote on such divisive community issues such as a lot of politics are today.

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:52,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it may not always be possible for me as Chief of Police and sitting on a Human Rights Commission to avoid the divisiveness of politics, but I have to work hard to remain neutral.

46
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:59,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is I have to provide policing services, public safety, protection of all members of our community.

47
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:11,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be clear, my motion, my request for a re-vote, or for my to change my vote, it's not a motion to question the right of this Human Rights Commission to endorse, reject, or make a statement on their own.

48
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:21,389
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say we all know each other fairly well, and many of you have known me over the past six years.

49
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:28,852
[SPEAKER_00]: We all oppose hate, especially anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, as was discussed briefly in these issues.

50
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:37,398
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some sense, everyone involved in this commission can have personal feelings and do a personal and political opinions on all of this.

51
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,220
[SPEAKER_00]: But I serve as a different role.

52
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,124
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be called to investigate crimes of antisemitism and Islamophobia.

53
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,868
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel it's very, very important that I continue to remain neutral.

54
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:56,754
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask for consideration to just promotion to vote, allow me to just amend my vote to abstain.

55
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:16,565
[SPEAKER_07]: So Chief Buckley, I just want to be clear, you're putting a motion on the floor to amend your vote to abstain from your previous vote last month regarding the Human Rights Commission's support or endorsement support for the City Council, okay?

56
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:24,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just need somebody else to second that motion, and if nobody seconds it, then you can go on record, Chief.

57
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, second.

58
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:29,851
[SPEAKER_04]: and we respect that, Chief.

59
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:31,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

60
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:36,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need a vote now, I believe, Diane?

61
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:42,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of, it's a bit wordy, but I think you all know what I'm saying.

62
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So Chief Buckley's motion is to

63
00:05:46,766 --> 00:06:07,027
[SPEAKER_07]: change his vote from February, I can't remember the exact date, I think it was February 14th, to amend that vote to an abstainment of the decision that was made for the HRC to support or endorse blah, blah, blah.

64
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get the correct wording.

65
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,501
[SPEAKER_07]: But everybody just needs to go.

66
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to popcorn Maureen.

67
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:15,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay or nay?

68
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

69
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:16,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane?

70
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:17,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

71
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:18,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Steph?

72
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:19,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

73
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:20,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob?

74
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

75
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

76
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:38,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't get to vote as you know in chief there are five of you since it's your motion everybody it's considered unanimous because you've put it forward and you have four yeas.

77
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:50,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I just want to say thank you for the consideration and the respect and understanding at least and as it comes to this and it's not sometimes it gets difficult to separate your personal and your

78
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:54,237
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, I have to go.

79
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:59,960
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of been dramatic, but I have to go.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,421
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those days, Chief, we get it.

81
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:06,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my next one is in person, too, which makes it jump off and on.

82
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:07,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

83
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:08,665
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always one of those days.

84
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:09,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.

85
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:10,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good night.

86
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:12,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

87
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:13,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

88
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:20,387
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Sanna, thank you so much for bearing with us.

89
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:28,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, are you all right if I bring Sanna up now and then we do meeting minutes and some of the other things after?

90
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:29,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

91
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sanna, over to you.

92
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:38,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, introduce yourself and share your presentation with us.

93
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, members of the Human Rights Commission.

94
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,233
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Sana Fadel.

95
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the deputy director at Citizens for Juvenile Justice.

96
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:55,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a statewide organization, a statewide policy organization that advocates for young people who are at risk of or with legal system involvement.

97
00:07:55,859 --> 00:08:02,743
[SPEAKER_02]: We do our work statewide, and I appreciate being able to meet with you all on this.

98
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:14,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually here asking for your support or endorsement of legislation that deals with youth justice reforms called Raise the Age.

99
00:08:16,794 --> 00:08:24,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a legal system reform, but I do want to talk about it because it's both an economic and racial justice issue.

100
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the bill.

101
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bill that was filed by Rep.

102
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:36,414
[SPEAKER_02]: O'Day from West Boylston, Rep.

103
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Cruz from Salem, and Senator Friendly from Lynn.

104
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:53,664
[SPEAKER_02]: This bill is currently pending in the Judiciary Committee, and what it does, it ends the automatic prosecution of a teenager, older teens, as adults, and moves them into the juvenile justice system.

105
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:58,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just gonna give you a little bit of background on why we even have this campaign.

106
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:13,669
[SPEAKER_02]: This campaign started several years ago, because when we looked at issues of recidivism in Massachusetts, what we saw was that young people have the highest recidivism rate of any age group.

107
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:19,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about recidivism, there's different decision points that young people come back to the system on.

108
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at two specific ones.

109
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:31,638
[SPEAKER_02]: One is rearrangement, which means you come in, you've been convicted of another crime, you've served your time, and now you're back in court again and you have a totally new crime.

110
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:33,359
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the rearrangement.

111
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:34,980
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one is reconviction.

112
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:45,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you've come out of the incarceration, you've come out and you have a totally new crime and you've been found guilty of it.

113
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:51,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we looked at this, we say, what is our legal system doing with young people?

114
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have two systems.

115
00:09:54,311 --> 00:10:07,058
[SPEAKER_02]: One is our juvenile system, which if a young person between the ages of 12 up to 17, right before their 18th birthday, if they're in conflict with the law, they would be part of the juvenile justice system.

116
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:11,460
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're 18 and over, they wouldn't be in adult criminal justice system.

117
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,621
[SPEAKER_02]: This data looks at,

118
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:18,840
[SPEAKER_02]: kids who have, young people who have been incarcerated, because that's the deepest end of the system.

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Every point of the legal system says, are you someone that we want to keep out of society because of a crime you've been alleged to commit?

120
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:31,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, from the point of arrest all the way to sentencing, that's the question it asks.

121
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these young people have been incarcerated.

122
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:36,669
[SPEAKER_02]: The legal system says, yes, we found you liable.

123
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:37,830
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to incarcerate you.

124
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are we buying with that legal system, right?

125
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:47,506
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at do young people come out better off, less likely to commit crime.

126
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:55,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to show you here is when we look at teenagers, we're doing two very different systems have two very different outcomes.

127
00:10:56,565 --> 00:11:02,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So our juvenile system does serve the incarceration quite does serve young people up until the 21st birthday.

128
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:03,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some overlap.

129
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:08,127
[SPEAKER_02]: The data isn't perfect because we're looking at 18 to 24 versus 21 and under.

130
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:23,010
[SPEAKER_02]: However, overall, when we look at recidivism, young people coming out of the adult system are almost like a one and a half times more likely to be rearranged and more than double the likelihood to be reconvicted.

131
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hyper on this because

132
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,679
[SPEAKER_02]: those are all the same young people.

133
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:33,684
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all adolescents, especially when they're talking about anybody under the age of 21, by pediatric standards, they're all adolescents.

134
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not up to that age.

135
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:43,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have two very, so their development is the same, their offense, what they get arrested for is the same.

136
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:49,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything about them is the same, except how do we interact with them as a society?

137
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this campaign is about.

138
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at young people,

139
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:58,375
[SPEAKER_02]: that age group, like the 18 to 20 year olds is really the heart of this campaign.

140
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:03,318
[SPEAKER_02]: These are young people who would be in high school or they'd be just starting in college.

141
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Their brains, everything in their life is designed to learn.

142
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:12,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So wherever you put them, they're gonna learn that environment they're in.

143
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:22,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you put them in environments that are more toxic, that prevent them from meeting developmental milestones, you're actually increasing the likelihood of them re-offending.

144
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:23,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like, you know,

145
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: is our intervention likely to help them or derail them from getting a job, having a family, getting a home, or having stable housing, finishing education, all of those things, if we put barriers to those, we're more likely to have them come back for totally new crime.

146
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:46,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is supported by research.

147
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So this pathway to desistance study came out of,

148
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:55,106
[SPEAKER_02]: It was housed in the University of Pittsburgh, but several universities were involved across the country.

149
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,728
[SPEAKER_02]: They tracked 1,300 young people.

150
00:12:58,369 --> 00:12:59,870
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them were adolescents.

151
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one of them committed a serious or violent offense.

152
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:08,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did monthly check-ins with them for a seven-year period.

153
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:14,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And they asked the question, why do some of these young people with these offenses desist from crime?

154
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:16,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do some of them persist in crime?

155
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:32,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the nature of the study, the offense itself is not, the severity of this offense itself is not an indicator of future offending, which is one of the things, you know, our laws are like the more serious offense, the higher the risk that you're presented to society.

156
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,479
[SPEAKER_02]: This, just the premise of the study says, it's actually not the case.

157
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what they look for.

158
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:46,162
[SPEAKER_02]: They look for serious offense, how often they offended, socioeconomic status, education, housing, income, substance use, mental health,

159
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: race, geography, family status, like everything you can possibly think of.

160
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:57,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found not a single one of them had an impact on future funding.

161
00:13:58,176 --> 00:13:59,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Only two things did.

162
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:03,682
[SPEAKER_02]: The first was the belief in the legitimacy of authority.

163
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:07,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second is meeting developmental milestones on time.

164
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:09,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I will translate those into English.

165
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:18,837
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is, do you believe that whenever you do something, that you have some kind of control of what happens to you?

166
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:24,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That the person in authority is going to treat you in what you perceive as fair?

167
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:30,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That means, every time I go to the store, will I always be followed?

168
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:31,125
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

169
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

170
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been labeled as a criminal regardless of my behavior.

171
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,949
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a risk factor of having someone re-effect.

172
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:54,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say, and I've seen this play out in the young people I work with, they do not, it's not, it's less likely of how harsh the punishment was or the consequence was.

173
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the was, did I get it, was it fair?

174
00:14:57,408 --> 00:15:01,630
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it was, if I perceived it as fair, even if it was harsh,

175
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:10,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say those young people are much more likely to start reoffending because, you know what, I knew I took that risk and I got what I deserved.

176
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:11,312
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this means.

177
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:24,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we do all this work around racial justice and the criminal justice system, it is not just because it's ethical and moral and the right thing to do, it is also a public safety measure in our legal system.

178
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:31,699
[SPEAKER_02]: The second piece which is relevant for this bill is meeting developmental milestones on time.

179
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:35,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have any children or adolescents in your lifetime?

180
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It means as a baby, can you feed yourself?

181
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk?

182
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:39,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you walk?

183
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:41,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do full paragraphs?

184
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:45,823
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to adolescents, can you have judgment?

185
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you think before you act and think about the consequences?

186
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:53,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all things that young people develop gradually over time.

187
00:15:54,135 --> 00:16:05,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the researchers found was if the intervention itself blocks a young person's ability to meet those developmental milestones, they're much more likely to persist in crime.

188
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The likelier they are to meet those developmental milestones on time, the much sooner they will desist from re-offending.

189
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:19,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And those things that young people need to meet developmental milestones are education, employment or skills,

190
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:27,500
[SPEAKER_02]: family connection, physical or mental health, and civic and social engagement.

191
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at these systems, this is what we're looking at.

192
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:35,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Those systems, when you're in the adult system, you have a quarry.

193
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,428
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge barrier to education and employment.

194
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:49,837
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no impact, there is, unlike the juvenile system that looks at education as a priority, education in the adult system is pretty rare when it comes to this age population.

195
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Family connections, sorry, you're 18, you're on your own, there's no role for family, where even if you're under 21 in the juvenile system, family always has a role.

196
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Civic engagement, part of the education, our K through 12 frameworks include civic engagement.

197
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:14,094
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the kind of, if you're in DYS, that framework is in the education in DYS.

198
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're talking about this, that's what we're talking about intervention.

199
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, it's also a racial justice issue.

200
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is looking at incarceration.

201
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:26,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the data, we have pretty decent data in the juvenile system.

202
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Our adult system data is pretty lacking.

203
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to do the best we can.

204
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:40,407
[SPEAKER_02]: This is looking at rates of incarceration between white men and boys compared to black men and boys.

205
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:45,979
[SPEAKER_02]: We have data on Latino kids.

206
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,460
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal data does not exist in a usable way.

207
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,040
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only reason I only look at that.

208
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:58,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we look at this, we see that racial disparities for our 18 and 19-year-olds is the highest of any age group.

209
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:03,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that's consistent across the country, not just in Massachusetts.

210
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at this one, we know that our legal system, and we're not saying our juvenile justice system is great, right?

211
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:11,864
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference is,

212
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:18,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Our juvenile justice system has both federal and state requirements to reduce racial disparities.

213
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:19,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So we measure it.

214
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still not fixed, right?

215
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:27,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Not gonna say it's there, but the requirement does not exist anywhere in the adult system.

216
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:37,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at these disparities, we have disparities where it's not just the over-representation and the sheer number, it's the collateral consequences

217
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:43,000
[SPEAKER_02]: that the class is falling disproportionately falling on young men of color.

218
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:48,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So it means you have a system that is less developmentally appropriate.

219
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:52,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get what you need to mature and get reintegrate back fully into society.

220
00:18:54,608 --> 00:19:00,953
[SPEAKER_02]: The focus on punishment and rather than development means you don't get those skills as you mature.

221
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the collateral consequences that are pretty severe.

222
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:10,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are collateral consequences to juvenile adjudications as well as adult convictions.

223
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:16,296
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the adult conviction collateral consequences are much more significant and many of them are mandatory.

224
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter what, you have those collateral consequences stick no matter what.

225
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:29,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I talk about this as an economic justice issue, I'm assuming many of you know about, every sector I talk about,

226
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:32,149
[SPEAKER_02]: That we have a labor crisis, we have a labor crisis.

227
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:33,210
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always been the case.

228
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:43,818
[SPEAKER_02]: The labor crisis has actually been, and I was following what economists have been saying, they've been raising that flag at least 2016, 2017, so before COVID.

229
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:55,166
[SPEAKER_02]: What they said in Massachusetts, we have a rate of baby boomers retiring at a higher rate than young people entering into our workforce.

230
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,028
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID just made it worse.

231
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:09,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And the recovery from COVID, we just have not been able, there's been some recovery, but we haven't been able to get back to where we were before, where that crisis has been a long time in the coming.

232
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:14,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So the arguments are, first, let's talk about the young person themselves.

233
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:16,626
[SPEAKER_02]: If a young person is involved in an adult system,

234
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:23,284
[SPEAKER_02]: where it does not look at their education and having a quarry limits your ability to get a job.

235
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:29,207
[SPEAKER_02]: That limits that young person's own lifetime earnings potential.

236
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:42,175
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at it from the labor market, when we say all of these young people are less likely to contribute to our labor market, that means our businesses are not able to hire.

237
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:45,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a labor shortage that we say, we need more young people.

238
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:48,230
[SPEAKER_02]: except those young people, right?

239
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not, we think those are, and this is, they're just not going to be part of the equation.

240
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not part of the denominator.

241
00:20:54,953 --> 00:21:01,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we do that, we're basically saying that group

242
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:12,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So every generation, we have a cohort of young people that just have a lifetime exclusion from fully integrating into our society.

243
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:18,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means us as a commonwealth don't benefit from their economic participation in our economy.

244
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:28,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately, our legal system is not an equal opportunity employer.

245
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:35,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the fact that the legal system targets low-income communities and communities of color disproportionately.

246
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:54,283
[SPEAKER_02]: That means when you look at where young people are excluded from our economy, excluded from our education and employment opportunities, they tend to be concentrated in those same communities that they come from, which means those communities, the economic potential of those communities is also diminished.

247
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:55,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally,

248
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:04,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to my first slide, we have a potential of reducing crime if we deal with young people in a developmentally appropriate way.

249
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Reducing crime also means we're also benefiting our taxpayers as a whole.

250
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:14,754
[SPEAKER_02]: We have less people who are victimized and require some kind of repair.

251
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:24,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Our legal system is not going to be as, you know, having all the workings of the legal system, we just won't have as much if we have,

252
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:37,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's not a criminal justice panacea, I'm not solving everything, but for those young people, shrinking that potential has an economic impact.

253
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And just conclude with just the thought that this is not new.

254
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:48,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually wanna say that our legal system is far behind the rest of our society in looking at young people under the age of 21 as adolescents.

255
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:50,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I started off by talking about pediatrics.

256
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:53,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Pediatricians work with young people

257
00:22:54,718 --> 00:23:02,684
[SPEAKER_02]: under 21 and up to 21 and maybe sometimes older, depending on their medical needs, that's been going on for a long, long time.

258
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:16,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't drink, you can't smoke pot or smoke tobacco or gamble or own a gun or be a police officer until you're 21.

259
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,098
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also all sorts of other milestones because

260
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:28,960
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start a job at 14, you can get your driver's license at 16, but with lots of limitations until you're 18.

261
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,602
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can pre-register to vote because we want you to vote by 18.

262
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:33,923
[SPEAKER_02]: But then all these other things we want to delay.

263
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:36,385
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't rent a car until you're 25.

264
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:38,346
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be on your parents' health insurance until 26.

265
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:42,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Because our society does not have a hard line of adults.

266
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:54,253
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a transition to adulthood, which means things that we want young people to grow up and make up into a habit into your adulthood, we want to encourage you to do more of that younger.

267
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,554
[SPEAKER_02]: The younger you are, the more likely you're going to stick.

268
00:23:57,214 --> 00:24:08,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that are a risk to yourself or to others, which we believe legal system involvement is one of those, we want to delay so that when you are more mature, you can make those decisions and it's less likely to stick.

269
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:18,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm just going to end with just what I would love for this commission to consider ways of supporting.

270
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:19,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like this is legislation that's out there.

271
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:25,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I shared ahead of time fact sheets about this legislation, but there's many things that you could do to support.

272
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:35,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so you know, I've been trying to meet with all the human rights commissions across the state, and some of them are able to endorse, and some of them are like, oh, we're part of the state government, we can, but there's other ways to support.

273
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:40,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all just ideas of things you can do if this is something you want to support.

274
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:48,522
[SPEAKER_02]: They could go from formal endorsement to we'll just make some connections or we'll publicize it to let our constituents know or our residents know about it.

275
00:24:49,062 --> 00:24:52,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But without us, depending on, or we can say yes, we'll support it.

276
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:54,925
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send our legislators a letter in support.

277
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:56,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really up to you all.

278
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:59,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to thank you for this opportunity.

279
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:03,608
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my contact information and I would love to open up to any questions.

280
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:10,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for this presentation.

281
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like one of our commissioners has dropped off.

282
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:16,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

283
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:20,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check in in a minute to see if they're trying to reconnect.

284
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:25,693
[SPEAKER_07]: But do our other three commissioners have any questions about this?

285
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions for Sana?

286
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:33,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Sona, it's Steph.

287
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:36,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your presentation.

288
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:36,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Sona.

289
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:40,049
[SPEAKER_07]: This is... Hi, Rob.

290
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Steph was just talking.

291
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:46,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll pop on to you when Steph's done.

292
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:51,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your presentation.

293
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:59,585
[SPEAKER_05]: When you were talking about kind of the developmental milestones, is that something that the juvenile system currently

294
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:15,599
[SPEAKER_05]: has in place or is there additional funding and or resources that would need to be added to the juvenile system in order to help support the people in under that age group in those developmental milestones?

295
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So our juvenile system has that already in place.

296
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've

297
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So Massachusetts has actually led juvenile justice reforms in the country since the 1970s.

298
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:37,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had five decades of reforms, where we shut down all of our youth prisons back in the 70s.

299
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:38,672
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s were bad.

300
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:41,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just bad for the country, bad here as well.

301
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:54,195
[SPEAKER_02]: But since 2003, DYS specifically has shifted towards this positive youth development, trying to reduce incarceration, recognizing that incarceration has a harm,

302
00:26:55,025 --> 00:27:02,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been building up since that, like first it was like not minimizing the use of incarceration.

303
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:07,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's like, oh, we need to, education has always been there, but we need to streamline our education.

304
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:09,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're working on health care.

305
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we want to have our next strategic, our current strategic plan is around ensuring housing.

306
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:19,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of those things have been in there and every year it just builds up on it.

307
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:23,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But sort of the concept of positive youth development has been part of our juvenile justice system.

308
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:31,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just saying not just D.Y.S., probation, the courts, the public defenders and the district attorneys.

309
00:27:32,143 --> 00:27:36,084
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone looks at teenagers and says, our job is to help you mature.

310
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:45,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then a lot of organizations like us exist because we need to do the advocacy to make sure that these agencies, we hold them accountable to meeting those goals.

311
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:48,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least those are the goals in there.

312
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:51,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the expertise, we have the capacity.

313
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:56,650
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a question right now in terms of numbers.

314
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,331
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill itself does not have all the 18 to 20 year olds coming in all at once.

315
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,934
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at having 18-year-olds first.

316
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:04,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a smaller number.

317
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:16,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Building up the system, recognizing where there probably will need to be some funding shifting from the adult system into the juvenile system to meet the 19 and eventually 20-year-olds.

318
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:18,445
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the model that Vermont did.

319
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:21,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Vermont's the only state so far that has raised the age past the 18th birthday.

320
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:27,652
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had their 18-year-olds since 2020, and they're on track to include their 19-year-olds this summer.

321
00:28:30,314 --> 00:28:30,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

322
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:35,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Sanaa.

323
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:38,760
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Rob, if you can hear me.

324
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I've got you.

325
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:41,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

326
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:46,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And apologies about the funky audio before on my end.

327
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,748
[SPEAKER_08]: You already answered one of my questions.

328
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:54,552
[SPEAKER_08]: It was around other states or commonwealths that have successfully implemented these types of policies.

329
00:28:55,032 --> 00:29:02,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Great to hear that one of our near neighbors is doing something like this because it truly is a very important issue and change.

330
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:09,082
[SPEAKER_08]: To that end, you mentioned a few different ways that we can help you advocate and express our support.

331
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:14,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you said a formal endorsement or letters to folks in the legislature.

332
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:22,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a resource you have available that indicates what those different options are for expressing support and advocating?

333
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:26,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And do we have them or have access to them if they do exist?

334
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:33,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So Frances, you have that one pager, right, that has the economic impact statement?

335
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have the one pager.

336
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:52,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually going to ask if the presentation would be available, because that would be nice to go with our minutes, because we do have people that could be listening in through various means that might have an interest in this.

337
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:54,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy.

338
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:57,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to send you the PDF version of that PowerPoint after this.

339
00:29:57,288 --> 00:29:58,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that would be fabulous.

340
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

341
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:02,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll get the PDF.

342
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:08,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get the version out to all commissioners and I think commissioners already have the 1 page up.

343
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:10,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I can send it out again if you didn't.

344
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone have any other questions.

345
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:21,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm used to.

346
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:25,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Sanna.

347
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you.

348
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll be in touch.

349
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:32,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all so much.

350
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:33,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate you.

351
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:34,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

352
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:34,426
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

353
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:34,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

354
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:41,771
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

355
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:45,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to pivot back to what did we miss?

356
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:54,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody will need to make a motion to approve the meeting minutes from February 2024.

357
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:00,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone will need to second.

358
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:05,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve last month's minutes.

359
00:31:05,717 --> 00:31:06,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will second.

360
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Maureen second?

361
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:13,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.

362
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,539
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fabulous.

363
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So now just a quick vote around.

364
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:28,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane, yay, nay, or abstain?

365
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick roll call for the approval.

366
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a roll call, yay.

367
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, okay.

368
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Steph?

369
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:38,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

370
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is so interesting, Maureen.

371
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:45,141
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two of you and one of you was delayed.

372
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:52,523
[SPEAKER_07]: One of you was walking and the other of you was already at your chair.

373
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's okay, yay or nay to whichever Maureen is.

374
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:06,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Immacula and Rob, yay or nay to accepting the February meeting minutes?

375
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:07,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

376
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:09,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks Rob.

377
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:12,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Immacula?

378
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:17,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, okay, thank you.

379
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:18,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

380
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:23,660
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

381
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:33,826
[SPEAKER_07]: The next agenda, Diane, you requested a scribe to assist with minutes for March and April.

382
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:39,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already started jotting down some notes for March, so I'll just see it through.

383
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:48,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Any commissioner available to help support taking notes for April?

384
00:32:52,214 --> 00:32:57,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I may not be able to make the April meeting, which I was going to talk to you about.

385
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:02,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't volunteer to do it, since I probably won't be here.

386
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,863
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

387
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:07,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a try.

388
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:08,404
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

389
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:09,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Steph.

390
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:11,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Steph.

391
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:12,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Steph.

392
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:14,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

393
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:20,628
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and Sian, over to you for calendar review.

394
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:27,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry, I did not bring the calendar up from the folder.

395
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have it?

396
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:29,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's fine.

397
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have it open, so I'll just click share screen and then just pop over to my Word file.

398
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:38,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So give me one second.

399
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:42,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see this, everyone?

400
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:44,517
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

401
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:47,040
[SPEAKER_07]: No, do you have the ability to share?

402
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:48,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

403
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought I clicked the button.

404
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:53,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, it says host disabled screen sharing, sorry.

405
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:57,549
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, try now.

406
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:02,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

407
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:06,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now can you see it?

408
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:07,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

409
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:24,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were originally pivoting to do the commemorating Belinda event with Royal House and Slave Quarters at the end of this month for Women's History Month.

410
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,317
[SPEAKER_04]: However, honestly, I've been a bit underwater.

411
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,238
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my busiest time at work.

412
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:34,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also met with Kiera Singleton, and she has a lot going on.

413
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:45,685
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've been paying attention to the news, she was recruited to the City of Boston's task force on reparations.

414
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:47,266
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's been incredibly busy.

415
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:53,991
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about a pivot to Juneteenth, which is a holiday in June.

416
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: On June 19th, it falls on a Wednesday.

417
00:34:57,954 --> 00:35:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you all be open to hosting the event then?

418
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:10,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It really sits well with the emancipation and also our history of slavery here in the North.

419
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:18,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a clarification, Diane, we're not hosting, the Royal House is hosting, right?

420
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would be- So we would be, right.

421
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:38,282
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the same way that we did the event last year in February for Black History Month, I don't know if I'm using the right words, Frances, so feel free to correct me because sometimes, I think last year, is it a partnership or a sponsor?

422
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:45,289
[SPEAKER_07]: The HRC would essentially be partnering with the Royal House to bring this event together.

423
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:54,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you right now that as great as the date sounds, that is the date that the West Medford Community Center is holding its observance of Juneteenth.

424
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,962
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would strongly encourage

425
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:16,258
[SPEAKER_07]: to either save the event until next year or look for another date because the city's raising the Juneteenth flag the day before because Juneteenth is a holiday.

426
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:34,058
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pity that the West Medford Community Center and the Royal House went across the street from each other, where we could have this three-way partnership and do one beautiful day.

427
00:36:41,163 --> 00:36:42,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on June 18th.

428
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:48,269
[SPEAKER_04]: If we hosted this on the 19th on the actual holiday, is that a possibility?

429
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:54,377
[SPEAKER_07]: The actual holiday is the day that the West Medford Community Center is hosting.

430
00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:55,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

431
00:36:56,337 --> 00:37:01,359
[SPEAKER_07]: The day before is the day that the city's raising the Juneteenth flag.

432
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

433
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: We raise the flag the day before because the day of, the city is closed.

434
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:11,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, got it.

435
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:17,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what the hours are for the West Medford Community Center's event?

436
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:21,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know at this time, but it is going to be a big event.

437
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:26,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I strongly urge you not to put it on the same day.

438
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:35,345
[SPEAKER_07]: They have been, yeah, they're planning on doing... I don't want to reveal too much because it's not set in stone.

439
00:37:35,425 --> 00:37:43,707
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just all part of like, you know, conversations that we're having to make sure that our events complement each other versus become...

440
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be like, I think it would be like a long day.

441
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:55,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be an afternoon, like maybe a 12 to four, which is when they usually, yeah.

442
00:37:55,996 --> 00:37:56,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

443
00:37:57,577 --> 00:38:05,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll talk to Kiara and maybe there's another pivot or maybe we put a pin in it until next year.

444
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:07,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound good, everyone?

445
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:07,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

446
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,630
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound, Francis?

447
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:15,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think it's I think it's really up to you guys.

448
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:28,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I would support putting you know, I would support moving it on to next year or maybe there is another observance that's happened, you know, later on in the year with this, you know, where this fits.

449
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:30,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

450
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,972
[SPEAKER_07]: There could be some days of significance where this fits.

451
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:43,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to look at the national today calendar to be able to provide some suggestions.

452
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we'll sort it all out.

453
00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:50,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I'll have an update at the next meeting.

454
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, everyone.

455
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,168
[SPEAKER_04]: because people actually really loved that.

456
00:38:57,489 --> 00:38:59,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, exactly.

457
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,629
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, great.

458
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:19,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So then the other items on this calendar are pretty straightforward with April, there's Earth Day, and then Frances, I added in all of the upcoming Black Health series to this calendar that are being hosted at the Medford Public Library.

459
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:22,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.

460
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:31,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, fantastic, thank you so much for that, Diane.

461
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:46,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I wanted to make sure all the commissioners gave some sort of signal as to being okay with moving this off the table for right now for the month of June, the Belinda Sutton event.

462
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:48,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that okay with all of you?

463
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:52,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, yeah.

464
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:53,785
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so

465
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So Diane and Francis, we'll look at other dates.

466
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:07,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll share some suggestions and then I'll just send it out to the team so that you're prepared for the April meeting.

467
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:15,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember, you go on holiday after the June meeting and you don't come back again till September.

468
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:34,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Maureen, I think I have three minutes before Attorney Austin is scheduled to join us.

469
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:40,396
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to bring you up to talk about PRIDE.

470
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:43,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this was actually a very small item.

471
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:50,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just there was a mention at the last meeting that we had been involved in sponsoring a pride event in the past.

472
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:52,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just curious as to what that was.

473
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:59,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't find anything on the city calendar or so I was just trying to seek information about it.

474
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:03,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't know if anybody knew that was my only admission at that point.

475
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,617
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like a logical thing to be involved with.

476
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:08,717
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm not proposing anything.

477
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:11,178
[SPEAKER_10]: It may even be too late to try to do something this year.

478
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:13,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anybody have any background on that?

479
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:19,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So the HRC did not sponsor a pride event.

480
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:36,344
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2022, when the city hosted its first annual board-based events, the HRC selected two members to write a statement to read during the pride flag raising.

481
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:43,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was after some negotiation, so I think those, you know, you can go back.

482
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:47,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say April, April, April, 2022.

483
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:48,750
[SPEAKER_07]: And may 2022 meeting footage.

484
00:41:55,594 --> 00:42:04,081
[SPEAKER_07]: You will see, but it was really just being part of the speakers series during the flag raising.

485
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:07,625
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that is something that the HRC can think through.

486
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:13,170
[SPEAKER_07]: If the HRC wants a far greater part, if the HRC wants a minimal part.

487
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:19,334
[SPEAKER_07]: But bear in mind when you say sponsorship, it means that you are actually doing something.

488
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:20,155
[SPEAKER_07]: So i.e.

489
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:22,297
[SPEAKER_07]: you are buying the food.

490
00:42:22,317 --> 00:42:28,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So like the lunch is sponsored by the HRC or you are actually hosting the event.

491
00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:30,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's separate.

492
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:47,887
[SPEAKER_07]: but if the HRC is interested in having a part during the flag raising, that by all means is something that you can discuss and let me know how you envision your involvement.

493
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:57,389
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things I was trying to look for and I couldn't find it on the city calendar this year was any mention of even any city

494
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:58,996
[SPEAKER_10]: activity going on.

495
00:42:59,337 --> 00:43:00,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Where might I find that?

496
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:12,642
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't find it on the calendar because I work with the mayor's schedule and this year Pride is actually on a Saturday, which makes things more difficult.

497
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:15,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Pride month kicks off on a Saturday.

498
00:43:16,484 --> 00:43:26,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the mayor is not available, well City Hall is closed on Saturday and you know having a flag raising on a Saturday is much more difficult.

499
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I also like to be very intentional.

500
00:43:31,105 --> 00:43:32,106
[SPEAKER_07]: with these events.

501
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:34,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just about people getting together.

502
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:36,910
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there has to be purpose and meaning.

503
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:41,754
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are different people that I connect with behind the scenes.

504
00:43:42,134 --> 00:43:58,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I get from a date from the mayor that, yeah, mayor will be available that day, that time, certain timeframe, then I now have to connect all the other dots behind the scenes and move things around and tweak things around before we can say, okay, this is a firm yes.

505
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:12,562
[SPEAKER_07]: But the city would, I can definitely say that the city would be looking to not, I would just say, save the day pride flag raising slash event and leave it at that for March 31st.

506
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:19,760
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, which it sounds, you know, it sounds silly, but there are other people beyond these groups.

507
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,662
[SPEAKER_07]: There's my DPW crew.

508
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:32,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to make sure that they're ready, that the signs, the paint has not chipped and they're repainted and we got new paint and somebody's putting those signs up first thing in the morning.

509
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:37,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are lots of things that go on behind the scenes before that date is on the email.

510
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's on the calendar.

511
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know as far as what the city did before.

512
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:43,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

513
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:46,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's how it's worked in the past 2 years.

514
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess what I would just like to.

515
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:54,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Suggest is that perhaps not for this year.

516
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:55,010
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems very.

517
00:44:56,541 --> 00:45:10,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know up in the air I can't quite wrap my head around it perhaps I would say that it would be good if this body did something next year then if we can if it's too late for this year or unsure what's going sounds all very unsure.

518
00:45:10,857 --> 00:45:11,457
[SPEAKER_10]: We could.

519
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,500
[SPEAKER_10]: do something ourselves, I'm assuming.

520
00:45:15,941 --> 00:45:20,283
[SPEAKER_10]: We wouldn't have to do it around what the city parameters are.

521
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:32,191
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm just suggesting to my colleagues that in fact, it's something we think about that we could do next year, either finding other nonprofit groups, or I don't know if there's any interest.

522
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:36,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of looking to everybody to see if there's any interest at all in trying to pull something together.

523
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:40,097
[SPEAKER_10]: This all seems, you know, right now it seems like I'm not sure.

524
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:48,239
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of like when we try to schedule something, it's the coordination of all these other groups kind of, you know, provides more of a challenge.

525
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:54,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Is any- Yes, Maureen, I'm actually unsure of what the actual ask is.

526
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you, because you're saying things seem up in the air.

527
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:08,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to be clear that the flag raising that the city has hosted for the last two years is not up in the air.

528
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:10,184
[SPEAKER_07]: That is actually happening.

529
00:46:10,924 --> 00:46:19,628
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we have people that are listening and people that could be listening through other means, I want to make sure that that is very, very clear.

530
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:26,491
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason that you don't see a date yet is because this year it falls on a weekend.

531
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to shift tactics.

532
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:36,796
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Human Rights Commission is more than welcome to A, do something on its own,

533
00:46:38,957 --> 00:46:47,344
[SPEAKER_07]: be a part of the city event as it has in the past, or support other needs?

534
00:46:48,045 --> 00:46:56,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm just asking my colleagues whether or not they would be interested in doing something perhaps next year on our own.

535
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:01,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know whether any, or maybe, you know, I'm just,

536
00:47:02,128 --> 00:47:28,394
[SPEAKER_05]: throwing it I can I can yeah so I think either for participating in what the flag raising this year as a individual and then for next year yeah looking at something another partnership opportunity we can certainly see if that can evolve next year I'm I'm open and with you on that Maureen yeah

537
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:39,170
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it would be great if we can participate any way we can this year once it's clear, like kind of when it's gonna be or the hours or whatever.

538
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

539
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to just work on what we might be able to do.

540
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:51,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I'm in full support of helping out at this year's event and helping out at next year's.

541
00:47:52,774 --> 00:47:56,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I recall correctly, Frances, I think last year,

542
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:06,807
[SPEAKER_04]: You choreographed a lot of events throughout June across the city to lift up Pride, right?

543
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:07,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

544
00:48:07,547 --> 00:48:10,668
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2022 and 2023, Pride is a month-long celebration.

545
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:20,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Pride is celebrated in June, but really Pride is actually an October thing, which is why certain states actually celebrate Pride in October.

546
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:26,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a lot deeper than just raising a flag.

547
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:28,560
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a civil rights component to that.

548
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:35,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm being true to my role and the body of my professional work, great.

549
00:48:35,587 --> 00:48:38,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize the civil rights movement.

550
00:48:39,471 --> 00:48:43,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And behind that, pride, the disability rights,

551
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,496
[SPEAKER_07]: you're all linked in one way, shape, or form.

552
00:48:47,516 --> 00:48:56,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we have a month-long event, for me, it is important to have something that is happening throughout that month.

553
00:48:56,538 --> 00:49:13,243
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't necessarily mean that I have to do all the activities, but even if we're compiling a calendar that, you know, showcases and gives people options of different things that are happening in the 02155, I think that it is also healthy

554
00:49:14,123 --> 00:49:29,441
[SPEAKER_07]: helpful for those that are healing through traumas that have been caused by being a member of the LGBTQ community, or people who think they might want to come and live in Mexico, right?

555
00:49:32,278 --> 00:49:41,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I've been here, those two years, it has happened every, you know, something has happened every, at least every week, if not twice a week.

556
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:46,169
[SPEAKER_07]: But I haven't done, I haven't been responsible for every single one.

557
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:52,693
[SPEAKER_10]: The first year, yes, but the second... I think that's what I was trying to get at, something more than a flag raising.

558
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:58,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that the flag raising isn't great, but I was just wondering if this group would be interested in, you know,

559
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,092
[SPEAKER_10]: taking a look at perhaps something else that we might be able to do through June next year.

560
00:50:04,112 --> 00:50:09,675
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think at least one person has a couple of people have suggested that they're interested.

561
00:50:10,976 --> 00:50:11,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be great.

562
00:50:13,797 --> 00:50:14,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that on the agenda.

563
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:21,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say, and I'm going to leave it to you to put it like on the calendar.

564
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:27,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put it on the in the parking lot so that we have it continuously rotate.

565
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:34,944
[SPEAKER_07]: But attorney Austin is with us now, and I'd like to turn it over to attorney Austin of KP law.

566
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:49,174
[SPEAKER_07]: For a review on open meeting laws and a discussion on the same topic as you all should have already received the 48 page document of the updated open meeting law.

567
00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:55,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope you have your questions ready and yeah.

568
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for having me here this evening.

569
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:00,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Francis, as well.

570
00:51:01,012 --> 00:51:02,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see all of you.

571
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:05,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought it was a good opportunity.

572
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:12,477
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, there's a new attorney general in office and the attorney general's office has recently updated its open meeting law guide.

573
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:24,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think it's a good idea to do a little refresher, both to members that have served for a while, but also to any new members and really just provide sort of the basics of open meeting law.

574
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: We are seeing across the state just an increase in open meeting law questions and complaints.

575
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:40,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that just so everyone's really cognizant of the landscape that we live in, particularly in an environment that thrives on the use of technology.

576
00:51:40,974 --> 00:51:49,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I handle a lot of open meeting law matters with cities and towns throughout the entire Commonwealth, and I've done that work really since 2006.

577
00:51:51,605 --> 00:51:57,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I want this to be a really informal session, you know, be able to answer anyone's questions.

578
00:51:58,273 --> 00:52:03,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly I can provide an overview and I know Francis has distributed some materials as well.

579
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I always start and I think about open meeting training or an overview very chronologically from.

580
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:14,859
[SPEAKER_03]: the meeting notice being posted to the approval of the meeting minutes.

581
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:19,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's really how I think about it in terms of a continuum.

582
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:37,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the notice, we know that anything discussed by a quorum of a public body such as yourself needs to be done generally in what we call open session, not executive session, which means open to members of the public to be able to see your work

583
00:52:38,728 --> 00:52:39,509
[SPEAKER_03]: in real time.

584
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:43,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be done on Zoom as we're on tonight.

585
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:45,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be done in person.

586
00:52:46,254 --> 00:52:56,923
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have an extension of the remote order that started in 2020, now four years ago, until March 31st, 2025.

587
00:52:56,963 --> 00:53:04,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a lot of pending legislation that we think will kind of go from there to extend it.

588
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,350
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of negotiations.

589
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:12,140
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of what processes should be in place to continue that.

590
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're closely monitoring that and we'll keep you all updated.

591
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:17,341
[SPEAKER_03]: But for right now, we can meet on Zoom.

592
00:53:17,522 --> 00:53:19,482
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we start with the agenda.

593
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:24,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything has to be put on the agenda with reasonable specificity in terms of what should be discussed.

594
00:53:24,944 --> 00:53:25,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does that mean?

595
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:33,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it means that a member of the public sitting at home would pick up or look at the meeting notice on their screen and really analyze

596
00:53:34,387 --> 00:53:35,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want to go to this meeting?

597
00:53:35,827 --> 00:53:38,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a topic that I would like that I'm interested in?

598
00:53:38,768 --> 00:53:44,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want to see the open and transparent discussion of this particular topic?

599
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:55,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I always say we do work when you work, or you volunteer for a community, you understand the language that's used or an acronym for instance, that's used, but we want to really be, you know.

600
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:02,894
[SPEAKER_03]: present information to members of the public so that they can, you know, decide on their own whether they want to participate.

601
00:54:02,934 --> 00:54:05,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of the fundamentals of the meeting notice.

602
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:21,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that it, unless there's an emergency, it has to be posted 48 business hours in advance and really ensure that there's, you know, not discussion that isn't otherwise posted in terms of the public body's business.

603
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:25,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of the overview on meeting notices.

604
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:30,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we get to deliberation and what is discussed at a meeting.

605
00:54:31,052 --> 00:54:37,036
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that absent reasons to go into executive session, and I'm happy to answer any questions on that.

606
00:54:37,596 --> 00:54:41,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that the public body's business has to be conducted in open session.

607
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:53,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means that any quorum of the public body can't discuss matters either in a group or serially one member to another to another member.

608
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:55,946
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of a properly posted meeting.

609
00:54:55,966 --> 00:55:11,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we step back, you know, the public records law and the open meeting law are both the purpose of that is to, you know, we call them sunshine laws to increase transparency and ensure members of the public know what's happening in their communities.

610
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:17,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to that goal, we are seeing an increase given the use of technology.

611
00:55:17,176 --> 00:55:18,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I always caution

612
00:55:19,092 --> 00:55:23,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just an overview, so we're not going to get into any specifics tonight.

613
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:31,178
[SPEAKER_03]: But I always caution about not using email or cell phone or text to communicate with fellow members.

614
00:55:32,118 --> 00:55:37,341
[SPEAKER_03]: There are legal implications for that, both under the open meeting law and the public records law.

615
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to be cognizant of that.

616
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:45,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have a lot of guidance from the Attorney General's Division of Open Government on that particular point.

617
00:55:46,733 --> 00:56:02,925
[SPEAKER_03]: including many determinations for many years now that say one member emailing or texting another member and then responding to that either serially or again in a group format outside of a properly posted meeting could constitute a deliberation.

618
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:05,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to be something to be aware of.

619
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:15,212
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of votes and discussions, we know that the public body's business is conducted by a quorum of the public body.

620
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:21,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And without a quorum, certainly the business can't be conducted in its full nature.

621
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:41,406
[SPEAKER_03]: The Attorney General's Office does recommend that if there isn't a quorum, that the meeting not be conducted and be postponed to another time in which a quorum of the public body can meet and gather, either in person or remotely, whatever the preferences of the Commission.

622
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:47,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, we know that meeting minutes have to be drafted and timely approved.

623
00:56:48,017 --> 00:56:55,000
[SPEAKER_03]: We usually say that's about within the next 30 days or three meetings, whichever is earlier based on your schedule of meetings.

624
00:56:56,101 --> 00:57:06,845
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly, again, similar to with the meeting notice or the agenda, care should be taken that someone sitting at home would pick up a copy of the meeting minutes and really understand what took place.

625
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:08,426
[SPEAKER_03]: We know it has to have

626
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:14,492
[SPEAKER_03]: some basic facts, you know, the date and the time of the meeting, the members present or absent.

627
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:19,356
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're meeting remotely, it has to be done by roll call vote, any votes taken.

628
00:57:19,376 --> 00:57:34,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, someone, I call it the four corners rule, someone picking up those meeting minutes and really understanding what votes were taken, what was conducted, you know, would someone have a sense of really what transpired at that meeting?

629
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:41,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, those meeting minutes are subject to the open meeting law and the public records law.

630
00:57:41,865 --> 00:57:44,847
[SPEAKER_03]: They can certainly be requested by members of the community.

631
00:57:45,967 --> 00:57:49,989
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is an executive session, there's a separate process for those meeting minutes.

632
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:55,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, they should be both accurate and detailed in the manner in which they're put together.

633
00:57:55,991 --> 00:57:58,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I am happy to

634
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,961
[SPEAKER_03]: answer any specifics.

635
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:01,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is a public meeting.

636
00:58:01,442 --> 00:58:05,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always say where we're this is for general informational purposes.

637
00:58:06,485 --> 00:58:23,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there are specific questions you have where we serve as legal counsel to the city, I would just ask that you correspond either directly with me or through Francis, relative to those specific questions, given the privileged nature, but happy to answer or provide an overview of any topic.

638
00:58:25,093 --> 00:58:26,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Janelle, thank you so much for that.

639
00:58:27,456 --> 00:58:37,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You've mentioned executive session a couple of times, and since I've been in this space, I've not had to take the meetings to executive sessions.

640
00:58:38,272 --> 00:58:40,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you share a little differently for

641
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:58,842
[SPEAKER_07]: people who may be joining us or who may not be familiar with what an executive session is and why an executive session would be called and some of the parameters that would take place if we were to go into executive session using virtual technology, which we didn't have.

642
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

643
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:04,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.

644
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:08,245
[SPEAKER_03]: We start from the proposition, so to speak, that

645
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,592
[SPEAKER_03]: the public body needs an open session.

646
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, transparent sunshine laws.

647
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:25,649
[SPEAKER_03]: There are enumerated reasons, and I can provide a summary to all the members through Francis, of the specific reasons in which a public body may enter into executive session.

648
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:29,774
[SPEAKER_03]: An executive session is really a secret or confidential session

649
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:44,463
[SPEAKER_03]: where basically the legislature has decided that there are confidentiality or privacy considerations at stake, and we'll talk about what that means, warranting a non-public discussion of a specific topic.

650
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:49,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that that is, they're very narrowly construed in my opinion.

651
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:58,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So for instance, is there pending litigation that may impact, if publicly discussed, the commission's litigation position?

652
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:04,967
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a determination that a public discussion of that would impact the case or a potential case.

653
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:13,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a specific complaint at issue that would trigger someone's privacy rights?

654
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,550
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be purpose one.

655
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:18,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's the case, you do need to provide notice to that individual.

656
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:23,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually we see that more in the employment context.

657
01:00:24,194 --> 01:00:27,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a specific law that requires

658
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:30,088
[SPEAKER_03]: you to meet an executive session.

659
01:00:30,108 --> 01:00:34,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those reasons is review of your executive session meeting minutes.

660
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:36,951
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that you can meet an executive session to review those.

661
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:40,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are very, very narrowly tailored.

662
01:00:40,693 --> 01:00:51,579
[SPEAKER_03]: An executive session does need to be posted just in the same way that an open session is posted, 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance, unless there's an emergency.

663
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:57,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, you need to meet and post an open session and an executive session.

664
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:10,632
[SPEAKER_03]: You start your meeting in open session, you go through your open session and members of the public can then see you voting to adjourn to go into executive session.

665
01:01:11,073 --> 01:01:25,540
[SPEAKER_03]: How it's done using an electronic or virtual platform like Zoom, like we're on tonight, is usually there's a public open session through the chair, you know, the board, the commission votes and says, we're going to enter into executive session.

666
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,781
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a roll call vote done.

667
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:34,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's either a breakout room that's conducted or a separate Zoom link that's provided.

668
01:01:34,518 --> 01:01:43,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And then assurances are on the tech side, so to speak, made that there's no members of the public given the confidentiality at stake.

669
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:55,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those meeting minutes for an executive session remain confidential or not subject to public disclosure under the open meeting law until that purpose of the executive session expires.

670
01:01:56,707 --> 01:02:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on the nature of the discussion, it could be fairly quick if you have litigation that resolves, for instance, for some public bodies, or it could be much longer, depending on what the privacy interests are that are implicated.

671
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:13,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Frances.

672
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Janelle.

673
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:17,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

674
01:02:17,962 --> 01:02:21,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions or topics, for instance?

675
01:02:22,326 --> 01:02:25,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's usually a lot of questions about electronics

676
01:02:27,174 --> 01:02:30,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Discuss our electronic, the use of electronics.

677
01:02:30,937 --> 01:02:36,761
[SPEAKER_03]: So happy to go over that or if there's any other topic that anyone would like guidance on.

678
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:42,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a, I know you've been provided with a copy of the guide, but there's a lot to digest.

679
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:51,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Just very generally speaking, one of the challenges we sometimes run into is that... Hold on one second.

680
01:02:52,109 --> 01:02:53,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry, Rob.

681
01:02:53,709 --> 01:02:56,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Maureen had unmuted and raised.

682
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:01,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, is anybody else sensing a delay of some sort?

683
01:03:03,152 --> 01:03:03,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you're good.

684
01:03:03,972 --> 01:03:06,212
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Rob, go ahead.

685
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:08,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, go ahead, Rob, and then Maureen.

686
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:10,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Maureen.

687
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:11,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be quick.

688
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:18,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Just thinking about email information that may come out, and then if there's something that we want to respond to the group as a whole.

689
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:32,012
[SPEAKER_08]: To this point, we've refrained from doing that for fear of running afoul of the open meeting rules, given that it's such a narrow and contained communication, not typically a deliberation.

690
01:03:32,633 --> 01:03:34,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Curious to get your input.

691
01:03:36,643 --> 01:03:40,224
[SPEAKER_08]: on if that's appropriate or something we should continue to refrain from doing.

692
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:46,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, the example would be, you know, some piece of information is sent out, we want to reply to the whole group.

693
01:03:47,527 --> 01:03:53,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And at this point, we're replying to Frances, and then she's communicating back to the group, is that the process we need to be following?

694
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:55,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.

695
01:03:55,810 --> 01:04:04,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the Attorney General's Office would say is under the open meeting law, the only appropriate use of email by or among

696
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:09,686
[SPEAKER_03]: a forum of the public body should be limited to scheduling purposes.

697
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you available on March 13th for a meeting at six o'clock?

698
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:16,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you available at this particular time?

699
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:31,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Any expression of the opinion, even if it's sharing materials, and someone replies, I think this is a good idea, has the potential to constitute an open meeting law violation.

700
01:04:32,261 --> 01:04:34,102
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's discussion of

701
01:04:34,689 --> 01:04:38,872
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, should we meet on this particular, you know, can we put this on the meeting agenda?

702
01:04:38,972 --> 01:04:41,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps that email goes to Francis and the chair.

703
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:58,847
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of communicating about documents, I have seen determinations where that can, depending on how substantive, but I think any expression of opinion or belief can give rise to an open meeting law violation.

704
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,027
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty strict.

705
01:05:01,348 --> 01:05:03,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thought process behind that is,

706
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:24,036
[SPEAKER_03]: and usually we're all busy and we all use email and communications for a lot of things, is it can somehow devolve into a substantive conversation or members can form opinions based on other members' positions over email that the public doesn't have the opportunity to see.

707
01:05:24,196 --> 01:05:26,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always talk about best practices.

708
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:31,240
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, the best practice in that case would be to only communicate

709
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:42,086
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, directly to Francis or to maybe Francis and one other member, but that there can't be forwarding back and forth on any sort of opinion based email.

710
01:05:42,446 --> 01:05:43,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand it's hard.

711
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:59,076
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the question comes in all the time, like, can we, you know, can people use Google document sharing or can we, you know, everyone is so used to using technology and the open meeting are really wants business to be conducted like this.

712
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:00,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So members of the public can see.

713
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:03,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that answer your question, Rob?

714
01:06:04,814 --> 01:06:05,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It does, thank you.

715
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:06,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

716
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, just very quickly.

717
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:23,689
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of information that comes through like a commissioner, whether it's this commissioner or another commission could be somewhere and see an upcoming training or see something that they feel the group would be interested in.

718
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:28,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually that information is sent to me or it's in my inbox somehow.

719
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:30,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I send it out.

720
01:06:31,675 --> 01:06:41,239
[SPEAKER_07]: to all and I CC the sender and I say sharing on behalf of so and so, no response needed, feel free to register if you're interested.

721
01:06:41,859 --> 01:06:51,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know sometimes people feel like I'm shutting them down because I say no response needed, but it's just, I don't even need a received to a reply all.

722
01:06:52,043 --> 01:06:59,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is so that we can avoid just even the most innocent, oh my gosh, I went to that event, it was great.

723
01:07:01,163 --> 01:07:03,705
[SPEAKER_07]: because that is where the opinion comes in.

724
01:07:04,346 --> 01:07:14,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something as innocent as, I think this event was great and I really think it would be beneficial to the city and we should think about implementing it.

725
01:07:14,553 --> 01:07:17,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Then someone else replies all saying, I agree with that.

726
01:07:17,736 --> 01:07:21,158
[SPEAKER_03]: That in and of itself is expression of opinion.

727
01:07:21,178 --> 01:07:27,083
[SPEAKER_03]: In that case, I think the best practice would be to have Francis send it out

728
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:37,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some public bodies that I work with have language at the bottom, which is due to open meeting law considerations, please do not reply all.

729
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can serve as a reminder, sort of a gentle reminder to people that it's not that people don't want to respond or provide feedback to constituents or residents in the community, but really that it would be something to be discussed at an upcoming meeting.

730
01:07:56,288 --> 01:08:02,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's something on an agenda that says training opportunities or commissioners updates.

731
01:08:03,352 --> 01:08:10,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there'll be a section for that where this can, you know, these types of matters can be discussed and members of the public can see that discussion.

732
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:19,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Some public bodies also will list, you know, correspondence between meetings and then they'll list different correspondence that comes in.

733
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:21,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, there can be discussion

734
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,190
[SPEAKER_03]: amongst the members in terms of that particular correspondent.

735
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another option as well.

736
01:08:27,512 --> 01:08:47,450
[SPEAKER_03]: But many, many public bodies I work with have that cautionary language at the bottom of their meeting or any email to say, please, you know, please refrain from responding exactly like that, because it can, it can be very inadvertent, but it can, if someone does a public records request, and then

737
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:51,300
[SPEAKER_03]: They see several people responding to it.

738
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it an open meeting law violation?

739
01:08:53,225 --> 01:08:55,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So all things to be acutely aware of.

740
01:08:58,007 --> 01:08:59,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Maureen, did you have a question?

741
01:08:59,648 --> 01:09:00,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

742
01:09:00,228 --> 01:09:04,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually have a couple, but I'll take what I want to get in the way of anyone else.

743
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:10,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did read through, you know, the open meeting law that Francis connected us to.

744
01:09:10,395 --> 01:09:15,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't see any mention of what I will call a committee.

745
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:25,865
[SPEAKER_10]: So take, for example, that we decide that there is a particular event we want to plan or something that is going to be sponsored.

746
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:27,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And two people,

747
01:09:28,822 --> 01:09:33,533
[SPEAKER_10]: less than the majority decide that they are going to work on this.

748
01:09:34,797 --> 01:09:37,920
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't get a lot done in an hour and a half once a month.

749
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:41,103
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of frustrating that we don't have a lot of time.

750
01:09:42,144 --> 01:10:00,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that subject to open meeting law if in fact the intent, there are less people than majority and the intent is to provide information to the greater body at the next meeting so that deliberation can take place?

751
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:10,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the attorney general's office would analyze that question through is whether or not a subcommittee has been created by a public body.

752
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:27,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And so usually it doesn't matter if it's a quorum of the main public body, if there's members that form, and it can be, you know, it doesn't have to be a subcommittee formally, it can be a working group, a task force, any type of,

753
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:43,531
[SPEAKER_03]: subset of the committee, if there's a vote to say, we're going to have Rob and Maureen work on this particular event, you're now making a subcommittee or a working group, which is then likely subject to the public records law, right?

754
01:10:44,852 --> 01:10:50,096
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, certainly people need to understand and be able to get work done.

755
01:10:50,697 --> 01:11:04,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Some communities I work with will designate one particular, there'll be a public meeting and they'll say, Maureen is gonna work on this particular point, Rob is gonna work on this particular point, and then we'll come back together at our next meeting and regroup.

756
01:11:05,305 --> 01:11:18,853
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's a particular decision by a public body to then delegate that work to a subset of that public body, then the open meeting law would likely apply in my opinion.

757
01:11:19,631 --> 01:11:30,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're saying that, let me just clarify, you're saying that if this body said we vote for Maureen and Rob to work on this, that would be subject to open meeting.

758
01:11:30,974 --> 01:11:34,495
[SPEAKER_10]: If they didn't take a vote, but they said, yeah, Maureen, why don't you look into it?

759
01:11:34,535 --> 01:11:36,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Can they say Maureen and Rob can take it?

760
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:39,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we need to look at it.

761
01:11:40,436 --> 01:11:42,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to look at it pretty liberally.

762
01:11:42,477 --> 01:11:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the only exception would be if the mayor, right, who is not

763
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:57,112
[SPEAKER_03]: subject to the open meeting law, said I'm going to have, you know, Francis and Maureen and Rob work on something on my behalf, right?

764
01:11:57,852 --> 01:12:09,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes down to, and I'm happy to research this and provide some written guidance, but it essentially comes down to what work, what is the purpose?

765
01:12:09,581 --> 01:12:14,405
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose in that case would be to advise the entire public body, right?

766
01:12:14,505 --> 01:12:16,967
[SPEAKER_03]: In your sort of hypothetical example,

767
01:12:17,537 --> 01:12:27,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in light of that, the attorney general's office would say that a working group or a subcommittee has been created invoking the provisions of the open meeting law.

768
01:12:27,605 --> 01:12:36,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to research if it's one member or two members, but it's pretty broad in terms of its application and it flows.

769
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:40,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think about it like a flow chart, like who is creating this working group?

770
01:12:40,714 --> 01:12:46,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of how public body is creating it, if you have yourself or maybe Francis is working with you,

771
01:12:47,837 --> 01:12:52,001
[SPEAKER_03]: it is likely subject to the requirements of the open meeting law.

772
01:12:52,721 --> 01:13:02,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking though that the group was not necessarily the purpose was to advise, but to bring back research, which is not, I don't think the same as advising.

773
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:08,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying that they would take a stand and say, okay, we've done the research and we think you should do this.

774
01:13:09,494 --> 01:13:10,415
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more like,

775
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:14,285
[SPEAKER_10]: They've, it's like what committees do a lot.

776
01:13:14,325 --> 01:13:33,121
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't necessarily, but you're saying even that would imply that they're advising and therefore, but so if we did that, we could say to people, give 48 hour notice, invite them to this gathering of two people to talk about,

777
01:13:34,074 --> 01:13:36,837
[SPEAKER_10]: an event and then we would be okay.

778
01:13:36,857 --> 01:13:44,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we would go forward and then bring any information that we may have pulled together to the overall body.

779
01:13:45,617 --> 01:13:55,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so I would essentially I would draw your attention to page seven of the Attorney General's guide that goes through what constitutes a public body.

780
01:13:56,226 --> 01:14:07,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Attorney General, she has specifically said that while there's no comprehensive list of public bodies, any multi-member board, commission, committee, or subcommittee within

781
01:14:09,373 --> 01:14:11,235
[SPEAKER_03]: executive or legislative branches.

782
01:14:11,455 --> 01:14:17,601
[SPEAKER_03]: This includes any multi-member body created to revise or make recommendations to a public body.

783
01:14:18,282 --> 01:14:20,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty broad.

784
01:14:20,243 --> 01:14:28,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is what I was saying in terms of who is that group reporting back to.

785
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there's only exceptions usually for

786
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:39,863
[SPEAKER_03]: like a working group, a school superintendent would establish or the mayor because they themselves are not subject to the provisions of the open meeting law.

787
01:14:41,063 --> 01:14:48,405
[SPEAKER_10]: But the critical thing is that the body, whatever you call it, is in fact making a recommendation.

788
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:50,645
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I keep hearing you say.

789
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:58,948
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're just, if it's not a recommendation, if it's research, you're saying that that in itself is a recommendation?

790
01:15:01,395 --> 01:15:15,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'd have to research where the line is drawn, but I can tell you in my experience in dealing with open meeting law complaints for our task groups and working groups, it's pretty broad in terms of what that applies to.

791
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:24,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have specific determinations on that point, so I'm happy to share them with Francis so that you all can get some real clarity on the direction for that.

792
01:15:24,972 --> 01:15:27,494
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's something that's of interest, Maureen, I'm happy to do that.

793
01:15:29,797 --> 01:15:41,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I had one other question and that is what I read was it said that minutes were to be made available to public within 10 days, whether they have been approved or in draft form.

794
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:44,164
[SPEAKER_10]: And so my question is.

795
01:15:44,886 --> 01:15:47,408
[SPEAKER_10]: How are those made available?

796
01:15:48,489 --> 01:15:52,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm wondering whether the opening law determines that.

797
01:15:52,193 --> 01:15:59,019
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, our meeting moments are not on the website of the city.

798
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:08,649
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, as a new member, if I wanted to know what went on in June, or if I was a member of the public and say, gee, what did they talk about?

799
01:16:09,249 --> 01:16:37,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not quite sure where the acceptable place is with where they would be and whether or not yeah I mean that's the main thing and and the other thing is if they're made be whether or not they've been approved or in draft form then we would then they then would be replaced with the finally approved uh minutes once they are approved yes so the minutes are drafted I don't know how you all

800
01:16:39,139 --> 01:16:46,446
[SPEAKER_03]: designate who's going to draft them, if people take turns or there's one person that drafts them, but the minutes would be drafted.

801
01:16:46,706 --> 01:17:04,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they're drafted, even if they're not approved, which we know is a requirement under the open meeting law, if they're in draft form and a member of the public sent a public records request or request under the open meeting law for those minutes, even if they're not approved, sometimes you meet once a month,

802
01:17:05,978 --> 01:17:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: those minutes would need to be provided in draft form.

803
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:22,470
[SPEAKER_03]: They are public records, so any record, let me step back, any record created or received by a city employee, official, volunteer, board member, commission member, committee member, is subject to the public records law.

804
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes documents created on your personal computer, it includes text messages, it includes emails, as long as it relates to city business.

805
01:17:33,118 --> 01:17:42,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And so someone from the public says, usually they'll send it to the law department and say, you know, Janice, who's a records access officer, I would like a copy of these meeting minutes.

806
01:17:43,102 --> 01:17:49,245
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're in draft form, Janice would reach out to you and say, do you have a copy of these meeting minutes?

807
01:17:49,825 --> 01:17:51,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we do, they're only in draft form.

808
01:17:51,986 --> 01:17:53,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here they are, right?

809
01:17:53,707 --> 01:17:56,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming they're open session and not executive session minutes.

810
01:17:57,565 --> 01:18:05,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they're approved, if the same request comes in and the meeting minutes are approved, then the member of the public would get those approved meeting minutes.

811
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:10,650
[SPEAKER_03]: There is not a requirement to put those meeting minutes on the city's website.

812
01:18:10,951 --> 01:18:12,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Some communities do.

813
01:18:12,211 --> 01:18:14,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Some put not all of their minutes online.

814
01:18:14,712 --> 01:18:18,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually an exercise in municipal resources.

815
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:24,216
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, they are still subject to the public records law and the open meeting law.

816
01:18:25,229 --> 01:18:28,350
[SPEAKER_10]: So that means that if somebody wants something, they have to request it.

817
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:31,671
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the short answer of it.

818
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:32,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

819
01:18:32,531 --> 01:18:34,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's two pieces here.

820
01:18:34,572 --> 01:18:40,393
[SPEAKER_03]: One, there's the requirement under the open meeting law to draft, approve, and approve those meeting minutes.

821
01:18:40,613 --> 01:18:43,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's under the open meeting law.

822
01:18:43,654 --> 01:18:46,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the other piece is, yes, a member of the public can

823
01:18:47,113 --> 01:18:54,477
[SPEAKER_03]: request them, and it would be subject to the requirements of the public records law and the open meeting law.

824
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:59,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so there's no requirement about where that might be.

825
01:18:59,899 --> 01:19:05,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It just requires people to go to the city and say, I would like these minutes, please.

826
01:19:05,682 --> 01:19:08,683
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I would have to do if I want to look at minutes from last year.

827
01:19:08,703 --> 01:19:11,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have to formally request them.

828
01:19:12,186 --> 01:19:38,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, or I don't know who has, I don't know who has the meeting minutes, but you would be able to, yeah, I mean, usually you wouldn't have to do a formal public records request for those, but, you know, I think that can be handled internally as a, you know, a member of the public body, Maureen, but I think we want to, there usually is kind of consistency because the minutes must be maintained permanently.

829
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:41,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might want to just check in terms of,

830
01:19:41,697 --> 01:19:46,660
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, their filing and whether they're filed or what the practice has been with regard to that.

831
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually thinking more of the general public and not so much of myself.

832
01:19:51,082 --> 01:19:55,024
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, somebody said, gee, I'd like to see what what they're doing.

833
01:19:55,784 --> 01:19:58,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just trying to figure out how people find them.

834
01:19:58,146 --> 01:19:58,526
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.

835
01:19:58,686 --> 01:20:13,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think there's usually I see it come in either through a specific public records request to the records access officer or alternatively to the chair of the public body under the open law for a request for those meeting minutes that usually has.

836
01:20:14,154 --> 01:20:15,175
[SPEAKER_03]: how I see those come in.

837
01:20:15,635 --> 01:20:16,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks.

838
01:20:16,415 --> 01:20:21,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to clarify and state that the minutes are stored in three different places.

839
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:29,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have the electronic version, which takes a little bit longer because that goes to Medford Community Media.

840
01:20:29,683 --> 01:20:31,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got that, that's our video footage.

841
01:20:32,265 --> 01:20:36,608
[SPEAKER_07]: But the city clerk, what happens is at the end of this meeting,

842
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:51,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I, you know, if the minutes have been approved, I mean if the notes have been approved and there are no changes, I go down to the hall, I stamp the pages with the date stamp, I make seven copies.

843
01:20:53,077 --> 01:20:55,739
[SPEAKER_07]: eight copies now and I take one.

844
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:03,065
[SPEAKER_07]: One remains here with me and the original and the rest of the copies are with the city clerk.

845
01:21:03,926 --> 01:21:07,009
[SPEAKER_07]: One is always at the city clerk's office.

846
01:21:07,149 --> 01:21:11,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody can show up and request to review meeting minutes.

847
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only speak from April of 2022 to this point.

848
01:21:17,617 --> 01:21:20,619
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I haven't been very good at are the notes.

849
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:26,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually send your drafts out as notes and then they convert to meetings.

850
01:21:26,404 --> 01:21:30,567
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that we'll all have to like um start tying in.

851
01:21:33,869 --> 01:21:36,651
[SPEAKER_07]: That clarify for you Maureen?

852
01:21:39,393 --> 01:21:41,555
[SPEAKER_07]: All right Rob and then Diane.

853
01:21:42,737 --> 01:21:43,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

854
01:21:43,837 --> 01:21:50,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll be quite quick, I guess to the root of the conversation around subcommittees and recommendations and information sharing.

855
01:21:51,040 --> 01:22:02,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Curious to know what the guidance would be from the Attorney General's office on how to make any progress with aspects that.

856
01:22:03,831 --> 01:22:09,374
[SPEAKER_08]: fall within the remit of the commission outside of the 90 minutes that we meet once a month?

857
01:22:09,934 --> 01:22:14,916
[SPEAKER_08]: What would be the office's recommendation for making any progress on those items between sessions?

858
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:30,884
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think if there are a group of members that want to individually or in a group work on things in the interim, that would be done in consultation with

859
01:22:31,294 --> 01:22:40,881
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, non public body members so city staff and certainly there's always the option of 2 or 3 members want to get together to have these working group sessions.

860
01:22:41,361 --> 01:22:44,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just note that they would be public right?

861
01:22:44,343 --> 01:22:45,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And subject to the open meeting law.

862
01:22:46,524 --> 01:22:48,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Alternatively, I think.

863
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:53,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be the recommendation or best practice to just schedule additional meetings.

864
01:22:54,631 --> 01:23:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but obviously that's a policy decision that members would need to, um, to vet in terms of moving things based on their schedules, et cetera.

865
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:10,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there are some public bodies that will meet, you know, particularly busy times of the year will meet more regularly.

866
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll change the meeting schedule based on if there's, you know, significant work that needs to be done, but those are some different options.

867
01:23:20,356 --> 01:23:32,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is always, like I said, the option to have people do work kind of on their own or with a non-public body member, and then report back to the full public body as necessary.

868
01:23:34,173 --> 01:23:34,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

869
01:23:34,694 --> 01:23:41,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of the challenges we run into there is that the meeting schedules articulated pretty specifically in our founding bylaws.

870
01:23:45,084 --> 01:23:51,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Would it be fair to interpret that as a minimum rather than specific guidance?

871
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:52,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

872
01:23:52,491 --> 01:23:56,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that I can certainly look at the bylaw establishing

873
01:23:57,325 --> 01:24:10,934
[SPEAKER_03]: establishing the public body to see what the flexibility is but in terms of open meeting while compliance all it would require is in is posting right and notice to the public to schedule additional meetings.

874
01:24:12,402 --> 01:24:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, we can, we can look at the bylaw language.

875
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:19,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to do that and report back to Francis on that particular point.

876
01:24:19,647 --> 01:24:32,254
[SPEAKER_03]: But from an open meeting law perspective, as long as it's posted in a timely manner, and there are some public bodies that will post and then cancel, right, if they don't have a quorum, or they'll post and say, we really don't need this meeting.

877
01:24:32,274 --> 01:24:33,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to cancel it.

878
01:24:33,255 --> 01:24:36,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least it's kind of on the book, so to speak, Rob.

879
01:24:37,693 --> 01:24:44,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, sometimes there's ebbs and flows in terms of how busy a public body is at any particular point of the year.

880
01:24:46,017 --> 01:24:46,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

881
01:24:46,437 --> 01:24:46,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

882
01:24:47,278 --> 01:24:48,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you could take a look at that, that'd be great.

883
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:50,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm happy to do that.

884
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:52,920
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Diane.

885
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:53,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

886
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:55,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

887
01:24:57,162 --> 01:25:05,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So I noticed you flagged Google sharing when you were giving your presentation, and I just wanted

888
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:22,630
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, crystal clear clarity on that, because I have noticed in my research of other human rights commissions in the state that they appear, you know, they post their minutes, you know, nicely organized in folders by years and months.

889
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:30,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard that some will collaborate, you know, they'll post the meeting in advance, and then they'll use a Google Doc to collaborate.

890
01:25:31,313 --> 01:25:33,916
[SPEAKER_04]: on making a special statement or something.

891
01:25:33,956 --> 01:25:40,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to get really clear on what the rules are on sharing via Google.

892
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:53,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps if the Google Drive was disclosed on the Human Rights Commission webpage, would that solve having sunlight?

893
01:25:54,093 --> 01:25:55,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to understand that.

894
01:25:57,557 --> 01:26:02,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is obviously a newer evolving technology that we've seen in the past several years.

895
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:20,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in my opinion, and in light of the open meeting laws, enforcement, and also the guidance that we've reviewed to date, any collaboration in terms of a Google Doc could constitute an improper deliberation if it's either done

896
01:26:21,256 --> 01:26:29,624
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time, but more likely using Google Docs or any sort of collaboration tool, it would be in a serial fashion.

897
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:38,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So the example I always use is, there's a particular set of meeting minutes, for instance, and Rob goes in first and makes his changes.

898
01:26:39,548 --> 01:26:47,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Diane goes in and makes her changes, but you can see Rob's changes and then all of this is done, not at a public meeting.

899
01:26:47,492 --> 01:26:56,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then, by the time you get to the meeting, you've seen other or other public body members opinions on those particular.

900
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:58,035
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting minutes.

901
01:26:58,215 --> 01:27:18,161
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what the open meeting law requires is that really someone can draft the meeting minutes or draft a document, but the discussion and the deliberation about a particular document should really be done, again, in open session so that members of the public can see the deliberative process of the public body itself.

902
01:27:23,062 --> 01:27:25,543
[SPEAKER_03]: The technology is tricky, Diane.

903
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:32,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Technology is tricky and I know I came from a, we don't use Google anything.

904
01:27:33,093 --> 01:27:37,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've just really, really stuck to that.

905
01:27:38,116 --> 01:27:48,502
[SPEAKER_07]: There are concerns with Google and now as we have AI, so my ADA side is like, yes, we have improved accessibility, we have this.

906
01:27:49,082 --> 01:27:51,724
[SPEAKER_07]: My DEI side is like, oh no.

907
01:27:51,844 --> 01:27:55,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a battle right now and there are,

908
01:27:57,113 --> 01:28:05,860
[SPEAKER_07]: There are so many great things, and there are so many not so great things, and I just want somebody to help make a decision so that I'm like, okay, this is what we're doing.

909
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Do any of the commissioners have further questions?

910
01:28:09,623 --> 01:28:19,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we do have members of the public present, and I would love to open up the opportunity for them to ask their questions.

911
01:28:22,903 --> 01:28:25,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I see no questions from the commissioners.

912
01:28:26,585 --> 01:28:29,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Barry, would you like to go ahead and ask your question?

913
01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:35,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping that somebody else would just read it.

914
01:28:35,169 --> 01:28:40,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have to go and it seemed to just highlight the sort of questions that Rob was bringing up.

915
01:28:41,612 --> 01:28:42,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just introduce yourself, please?

916
01:28:48,135 --> 01:28:48,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Barry Ingber.

917
01:28:49,536 --> 01:28:50,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in North Medford.

918
01:28:52,199 --> 01:29:05,771
[SPEAKER_01]: But regarding the Google documents, I wonder if that view would change if that document was publicly accessible so that the public could view the deliberations as they took place.

919
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think my opinion would change on that.

920
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:23,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why is because even though the public may be able to view the comments in real time, it wouldn't be something that was posted in accordance with the open meeting law.

921
01:29:23,714 --> 01:29:34,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And so members of the public would essentially have to go on the Google Drive or go online, you know, just repeatedly to see if anyone has updated a particular document.

922
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:39,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I go back to the chronological view of the open meeting law that starts

923
01:29:40,142 --> 01:29:48,685
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, first and foremost with that meeting notice and agenda to alert members of the public, this is the public body's business, this is what will be conducted.

924
01:29:48,705 --> 01:30:03,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And so absent that to kind of, you know, essentially analyze whether or not a member of the public would wanna do it, you would essentially shift the onus to members of the public to say, here's the website, this may or may not happen at any given time.

925
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:09,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that would be problematic in my opinion, under the open meeting laws requirements.

926
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:10,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.

927
01:30:11,725 --> 01:30:14,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do have the other question in here, and I'm happy to read it.

928
01:30:16,169 --> 01:30:17,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis, if that works for you.

929
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:21,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Hypothetically, a location needs to be found for an event.

930
01:30:22,914 --> 01:30:26,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob and Steph volunteer to look into options but not make a decision.

931
01:30:26,496 --> 01:30:30,179
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to coordinate their outreach so they don't call the same venues.

932
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:31,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that subject to the open meeting law?

933
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:34,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's play this out, best practice.

934
01:30:34,422 --> 01:30:38,125
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a meeting like tonight, and Rob and Steph each volunteer.

935
01:30:38,856 --> 01:30:47,363
[SPEAKER_03]: They, it's not a quorum of the public body in terms of communicating it, but the public can see that they have both volunteered for that.

936
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:50,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they would each do their own independent work, right?

937
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:54,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And then report back to the full public body in terms of next steps.

938
01:30:55,749 --> 01:31:05,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to provide, of the top five questions I get, the biggest, I would say number two is probably working groups, subcommittees.

939
01:31:06,057 --> 01:31:08,018
[SPEAKER_03]: and task forces.

940
01:31:08,098 --> 01:31:13,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand it's very difficult for people to navigate.

941
01:31:13,341 --> 01:31:21,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy to follow up with some specific determinations to show you the fact patterns that come into play so you can perform your functions, right?

942
01:31:21,866 --> 01:31:23,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it is very complicated.

943
01:31:23,547 --> 01:31:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Attorney General's Office has issued some really good guidance on that to help public bodies be able to do their work.

944
01:31:31,072 --> 01:31:39,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we have that situation tonight even where we talked about should we in fact plan next year to do something for pride month.

945
01:31:39,899 --> 01:31:43,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Two people on this committee are interested in looking in that.

946
01:31:43,482 --> 01:31:44,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So what does that require?

947
01:31:44,923 --> 01:31:46,865
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, find out what's happening in the city.

948
01:31:47,365 --> 01:31:47,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Second of all,

949
01:31:48,866 --> 01:31:51,026
[SPEAKER_10]: What are some of the ideas that we could come up with?

950
01:31:51,587 --> 01:32:01,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And then to, in fact, continue to work and report to this group about what we have found, not what we've determined, but what we have found is.

951
01:32:03,189 --> 01:32:08,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that again, do we have to do it separately and then come back?

952
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:09,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you're saying?

953
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:17,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so you would do it separately and coordinate or communicate

954
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:28,362
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, through Francis really, in terms of providing updates and then report back to the entire public body in terms of next steps.

955
01:32:30,323 --> 01:32:33,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting, because it doesn't really build community at all.

956
01:32:33,764 --> 01:32:35,304
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sort of separates.

957
01:32:35,364 --> 01:32:35,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

958
01:32:35,664 --> 01:32:38,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's really discouraging.

959
01:32:39,185 --> 01:32:47,967
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is really, again, to have, we know that public comment isn't technically required under the open meeting law, but what we know is that

960
01:32:48,582 --> 01:33:02,330
[SPEAKER_03]: the open meeting law, and this has come up, you know, millions of times in the past four years, the public is entitled to be able to observe what transpires, you know, in essentially real time.

961
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:08,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the goal is really to be able to balance all of that.

962
01:33:08,553 --> 01:33:17,538
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me, I'll circulate that particular guidance so everyone's clear in terms of what the line is in work that can be done.

963
01:33:18,649 --> 01:33:25,778
[SPEAKER_03]: amongst a non quorum portion of the public body, of course, and that way you'll have some specific guidance on that Maureen.

964
01:33:27,276 --> 01:33:29,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I just wanted to give another example.

965
01:33:29,617 --> 01:33:39,121
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remember, last month, Diane attended, we all received the same information as part of the Massachusetts Human Rights Coalition.

966
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:42,763
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Zoom thing that they were doing.

967
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:44,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane attended on her own.

968
01:33:44,924 --> 01:33:47,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane didn't email the committee.

969
01:33:47,325 --> 01:33:49,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane didn't ask Frances if she could attend.

970
01:33:49,726 --> 01:33:52,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane attended on her own, but Diane said,

971
01:33:52,987 --> 01:33:54,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Renters, can you put me on the agenda?

972
01:33:55,068 --> 01:33:57,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to share my experience.

973
01:33:58,110 --> 01:34:02,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Any commission member is able to do that.

974
01:34:03,453 --> 01:34:18,082
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have as much of the different types of conference or training opportunities that are external as my other commission because there's stuff that the MBTA is doing and some of them are,

975
01:34:20,423 --> 01:34:21,564
[SPEAKER_07]: more interested in that.

976
01:34:21,664 --> 01:34:26,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I get it, I email it out and people go on their own.

977
01:34:27,186 --> 01:34:36,691
[SPEAKER_07]: They reach out to me to ask to be put on the agenda if they feel like they have something valuable that they want to share with the rest of the other commissioners.

978
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:39,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Or sometimes they'll say to me, Frances, can you share this?

979
01:34:40,313 --> 01:34:43,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't make this time, but maybe one of my commissioners can.

980
01:34:44,134 --> 01:34:49,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when you'll get the sharing on behalf of so-and-so, no need to respond.

981
01:34:50,904 --> 01:34:51,324
[SPEAKER_07]: email.

982
01:34:52,485 --> 01:35:00,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think just to be clear, too, in my opinion, if all of you wanted to go to a training opportunity, you could.

983
01:35:00,767 --> 01:35:02,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't run afoul of the open meeting law.

984
01:35:03,788 --> 01:35:07,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you're all very involved in the city and in community events.

985
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:11,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're certainly allowed to do that.

986
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,972
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you one have First Amendment rights to do that.

987
01:35:15,072 --> 01:35:15,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And two,

988
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,761
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the open meeting law doesn't prohibit that.

989
01:35:18,841 --> 01:35:23,523
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can go to a social gathering or a city event.

990
01:35:24,463 --> 01:35:31,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The line is really, you know, are members of a public body deliberating on topics outside of that meeting?

991
01:35:32,386 --> 01:35:41,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've seen numerous complaints over the years that say, well, these two people were at this community event, you know, honoring this individual.

992
01:35:41,967 --> 01:35:44,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I saw them whispering in the hallway.

993
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:49,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I know they were talking about something that they should have been talking about at a meeting, right.

994
01:35:49,574 --> 01:35:58,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Or these people were at a social gathering, but, you know, it appeared that they were talking where I overheard something about X, Y, or Z, and that shouldn't have happened.

995
01:35:59,443 --> 01:36:06,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so it's really just, or there's a conference and many of you are interested in the topic professionally, personally.

996
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:07,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you may go to that.

997
01:36:08,047 --> 01:36:08,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

998
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:11,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're allowed to go to training opportunities.

999
01:36:11,948 --> 01:36:22,832
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is really, are there, does it kind of cross the line, so to speak, in terms of discussing matters that are pending within your jurisdiction as members at this point?

1000
01:36:23,712 --> 01:36:25,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to make sure that was clear too.

1001
01:36:26,253 --> 01:36:31,935
[SPEAKER_03]: The open meeting law tries to balance people, you know, balance all of this as best as it can.

1002
01:36:34,062 --> 01:36:34,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Good questions.

1003
01:36:35,704 --> 01:36:36,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Janelle.

1004
01:36:36,605 --> 01:36:40,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else have any questions?

1005
01:36:40,869 --> 01:36:41,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Any commissioners?

1006
01:36:42,971 --> 01:36:46,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I only see two members of the public with us.

1007
01:36:46,254 --> 01:36:51,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Do those two members of the public have any questions in regards to the open meeting law?

1008
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,641
[SPEAKER_07]: What constitutes a forum?

1009
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:57,065
[SPEAKER_07]: When meetings get to be canceled?

1010
01:37:03,747 --> 01:37:07,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I don't see any hands raised.

1011
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:10,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this time, it is 709.

1012
01:37:10,511 --> 01:37:11,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Atty.

1013
01:37:13,153 --> 01:37:16,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Austin, thank you so much for your time and your explanation.

1014
01:37:16,195 --> 01:37:17,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, it was nice seeing you all.

1015
01:37:17,856 --> 01:37:22,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I will follow up on the bylaw question and the subcommittee working group question as well.

1016
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:23,399
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice seeing you all.

1017
01:37:23,419 --> 01:37:26,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you need anything, Frances has my contact information.

1018
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:29,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always happy to discuss any questions you have.

1019
01:37:29,383 --> 01:37:30,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you for your time this evening.

1020
01:37:30,964 --> 01:37:31,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night.

1021
01:37:32,118 --> 01:37:33,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

1022
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:33,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

1023
01:37:34,001 --> 01:37:34,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1024
01:37:34,622 --> 01:37:35,023
[SPEAKER_08]: You as well.

1025
01:37:35,043 --> 01:37:45,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it's a lot to digest, but I hope that we can

1026
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:59,901
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the document was a lot because I had to, I was under a deadline in which to read it to make sure that I didn't have any questions in case you had questions before the attorney could get here.

1027
01:38:01,102 --> 01:38:13,390
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, try to digest the information and think about it from a perspective of trying to be more transparent with the community in terms of how we do our work.

1028
01:38:13,992 --> 01:38:26,786
[SPEAKER_07]: If we get caught in the mindset of, oh, we only have X number of meetings or we can't do this, then we'll actually create the barriers ourselves that will prevent us from doing stuff.

1029
01:38:27,347 --> 01:38:30,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the agenda is open for all, right?

1030
01:38:30,731 --> 01:38:31,411
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need

1031
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:37,073
[SPEAKER_07]: three people to find out who is doing what event.

1032
01:38:37,213 --> 01:38:46,955
[SPEAKER_07]: If Frances is passionate about something, Frances can go and check that thing out and then ask to be put on the agenda and give feedback.

1033
01:38:48,135 --> 01:38:50,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't always have to be done in groups.

1034
01:38:50,176 --> 01:38:55,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we get to a place where we need bigger subcommittees, working groups,

1035
01:38:56,078 --> 01:39:03,028
[SPEAKER_07]: and we need additional meetings as long as those meetings are posted with ample notice.

1036
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:10,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really more about the transparency and the accessibility that the public has.

1037
01:39:12,771 --> 01:39:14,872
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope you found that helpful.

1038
01:39:15,472 --> 01:39:18,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone have any other questions?

1039
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:23,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just keeping an eye on the time because I got to run down to the clerk's office before 7.30.

1040
01:39:23,733 --> 01:39:26,374
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, our stamp will be for tomorrow's date.

1041
01:39:29,114 --> 01:39:29,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I say something?

1042
01:39:30,475 --> 01:39:30,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1043
01:39:31,015 --> 01:39:32,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you all.

1044
01:39:32,415 --> 01:39:33,495
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Immacula.

1045
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:34,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, yeah.

1046
01:39:35,676 --> 01:39:36,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1047
01:39:36,396 --> 01:39:40,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I say thank you all and the meeting tonight is very, very good.

1048
01:39:42,993 --> 01:40:10,950
[SPEAKER_07]: okay thank you so much all right thank you all right so at this um at this point i'm going to hit the stop record meet uh button uh but prior to doing that somebody needs to call the adjournment motion to adjourn the meeting i so called for adjournment of the meeting okay who's seconding i second

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Steph.

1050
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:16,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody really want to stay on all night?

1051
01:40:16,185 --> 01:40:17,206
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1052
01:40:17,526 --> 01:40:18,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see any volunteers.

1053
01:40:19,047 --> 01:40:19,348
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1054
01:40:19,428 --> 01:40:20,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone.

1055
01:40:20,509 --> 01:40:20,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.
