    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=459.591s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Thank you, members of the Human Rights Commission.
 My name is Sana Fadel.
 I'm the deputy director at Citizens for Juvenile Justice.
 We are a statewide organization, a statewide policy organization that advocates for young people who are at risk of or with legal system involvement.
 We do our work statewide, and I appreciate being able to meet with you all on this.
 So I'm actually here asking for your support or endorsement of legislation that deals with youth justice reforms called Raise the Age.
 It is a legal system reform, but I do want to talk about it because it's both an economic and racial justice issue.
 So this is the bill.
 It's a bill that was filed by Rep.
 O'Day from West Boylston, Rep.
 Cruz from Salem, and Senator Friendly from Lynn.
 This bill is currently pending in the Judiciary Committee, and what it does, it ends the automatic prosecution of a teenager, older teens, as adults, and moves them into the juvenile justice system.
 So I'm just gonna give you a little bit of background on why we even have this campaign.
 This campaign started several years ago, because when we looked at issues of recidivism in Massachusetts, what we saw was that young people have the highest recidivism rate of any age group.
 So when we talk about recidivism, there's different decision points that young people come back to the system on.
 So we look at two specific ones.
 One is rearrangement, which means you come in, you've been convicted of another crime, you've served your time, and now you're back in court again and you have a totally new crime.
 That's the rearrangement.
 The second one is reconviction.
 That means you've come out of the incarceration, you've come out and you have a totally new crime and you've been found guilty of it.
 So when we looked at this, we say, what is our legal system doing with young people?
 So we have two systems.
 One is our juvenile system, which if a young person between the ages of 12 up to 17, right before their 18th birthday, if they're in conflict with the law, they would be part of the juvenile justice system.
 If they're 18 and over, they wouldn't be in adult criminal justice system.
 This data looks at,
 kids who have, young people who have been incarcerated, because that's the deepest end of the system.
 Every point of the legal system says, are you someone that we want to keep out of society because of a crime you've been alleged to commit?
 And, you know, from the point of arrest all the way to sentencing, that's the question it asks.
 So all of these young people have been incarcerated.
 The legal system says, yes, we found you liable.
 We're going to incarcerate you.
 So what are we buying with that legal system, right?
 We're looking at do young people come out better off, less likely to commit crime.
 And what I want to show you here is when we look at teenagers, we're doing two very different systems have two very different outcomes.
 So our juvenile system does serve the incarceration quite does serve young people up until the 21st birthday.
 So there is some overlap.
 The data isn't perfect because we're looking at 18 to 24 versus 21 and under.
 However, overall, when we look at recidivism, young people coming out of the adult system are almost like a one and a half times more likely to be rearranged and more than double the likelihood to be reconvicted.
 I'm hyper on this because
 those are all the same young people.
 They're all adolescents, especially when they're talking about anybody under the age of 21, by pediatric standards, they're all adolescents.
 Well, not up to that age.
 But we have two very, so their development is the same, their offense, what they get arrested for is the same.
 Everything about them is the same, except how do we interact with them as a society?
 And that's what this campaign is about.
 So when we look at young people,
 that age group, like the 18 to 20 year olds is really the heart of this campaign.
 These are young people who would be in high school or they'd be just starting in college.
 Their brains, everything in their life is designed to learn.
 So wherever you put them, they're gonna learn that environment they're in.
 So if you put them in environments that are more toxic, that prevent them from meeting developmental milestones, you're actually increasing the likelihood of them re-offending.
 So things like, you know,
 is our intervention likely to help them or derail them from getting a job, having a family, getting a home, or having stable housing, finishing education, all of those things, if we put barriers to those, we're more likely to have them come back for totally new crime.
 And this is supported by research.
 So this pathway to desistance study came out of,
 It was housed in the University of Pittsburgh, but several universities were involved across the country.
 They tracked 1,300 young people.
 All of them were adolescents.
 Every single one of them committed a serious or violent offense.
 And they did monthly check-ins with them for a seven-year period.
 And they asked the question, why do some of these young people with these offenses desist from crime?
 And why do some of them persist in crime?
 And by the nature of the study, the offense itself is not, the severity of this offense itself is not an indicator of future offending, which is one of the things, you know, our laws are like the more serious offense, the higher the risk that you're presented to society.
 This, just the premise of the study says, it's actually not the case.
 And this is what they look for.
 They look for serious offense, how often they offended, socioeconomic status, education, housing, income, substance use, mental health,
 race, geography, family status, like everything you can possibly think of.
 And they found not a single one of them had an impact on future funding.
 Only two things did.
 The first was the belief in the legitimacy of authority.
 And the second is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 I will translate those into English.
 The first one is, do you believe that whenever you do something, that you have some kind of control of what happens to you?
 That the person in authority is going to treat you in what you perceive as fair?
 That means, every time I go to the store, will I always be followed?
 You know what?
 It doesn't matter.
 I've been labeled as a criminal regardless of my behavior.
 That is a risk factor of having someone re-effect.
 So when you say, and I've seen this play out in the young people I work with, they do not, it's not, it's less likely of how harsh the punishment was or the consequence was.
 It's the was, did I get it, was it fair?
 So if it was, if I perceived it as fair, even if it was harsh,
 I will say those young people are much more likely to start reoffending because, you know what, I knew I took that risk and I got what I deserved.
 That's what this means.
 So when we do all this work around racial justice and the criminal justice system, it is not just because it's ethical and moral and the right thing to do, it is also a public safety measure in our legal system.
 The second piece which is relevant for this bill is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 So do you have any children or adolescents in your lifetime?
 It means as a baby, can you feed yourself?
 Can you talk?
 Can you walk?
 Can you do full paragraphs?
 When it comes to adolescents, can you have judgment?
 Can you think before you act and think about the consequences?
 Those are all things that young people develop gradually over time.
 And what the researchers found was if the intervention itself blocks a young person's ability to meet those developmental milestones, they're much more likely to persist in crime.
 The likelier they are to meet those developmental milestones on time, the much sooner they will desist from re-offending.
 And those things that young people need to meet developmental milestones are education, employment or skills,
 family connection, physical or mental health, and civic and social engagement.
 So when we look at these systems, this is what we're looking at.
 Those systems, when you're in the adult system, you have a quarry.
 That's a huge barrier to education and employment.
 There's no impact, there is, unlike the juvenile system that looks at education as a priority, education in the adult system is pretty rare when it comes to this age population.
 Family connections, sorry, you're 18, you're on your own, there's no role for family, where even if you're under 21 in the juvenile system, family always has a role.
 Civic engagement, part of the education, our K through 12 frameworks include civic engagement.
 That is the kind of, if you're in DYS, that framework is in the education in DYS.
 So when we're talking about this, that's what we're talking about intervention.
 And in addition, it's also a racial justice issue.
 So this is looking at incarceration.
 Again, the data, we have pretty decent data in the juvenile system.
 Our adult system data is pretty lacking.
 So I try to do the best we can.
 This is looking at rates of incarceration between white men and boys compared to black men and boys.
 We have data on Latino kids.
 The federal data does not exist in a usable way.
 That's the only reason I only look at that.
 But when we look at this, we see that racial disparities for our 18 and 19-year-olds is the highest of any age group.
 And that's something that's consistent across the country, not just in Massachusetts.
 When we look at this one, we know that our legal system, and we're not saying our juvenile justice system is great, right?
 The difference is,
 Our juvenile justice system has both federal and state requirements to reduce racial disparities.
 So we measure it.
 It's still not fixed, right?
 Not gonna say it's there, but the requirement does not exist anywhere in the adult system.
 So when we look at these disparities, we have disparities where it's not just the over-representation and the sheer number, it's the collateral consequences
 that the class is falling disproportionately falling on young men of color.
 So it means you have a system that is less developmentally appropriate.
 So you don't get what you need to mature and get reintegrate back fully into society.
 The focus on punishment and rather than development means you don't get those skills as you mature.
 And then you have the collateral consequences that are pretty severe.
 So there are collateral consequences to juvenile adjudications as well as adult convictions.
 However, the adult conviction collateral consequences are much more significant and many of them are mandatory.
 So no matter what, you have those collateral consequences stick no matter what.
 And then when I talk about this as an economic justice issue, I'm assuming many of you know about, every sector I talk about,
 That we have a labor crisis, we have a labor crisis.
 That's always been the case.
 The labor crisis has actually been, and I was following what economists have been saying, they've been raising that flag at least 2016, 2017, so before COVID.
 What they said in Massachusetts, we have a rate of baby boomers retiring at a higher rate than young people entering into our workforce.
 COVID just made it worse.
 And the recovery from COVID, we just have not been able, there's been some recovery, but we haven't been able to get back to where we were before, where that crisis has been a long time in the coming.
 So the arguments are, first, let's talk about the young person themselves.
 If a young person is involved in an adult system,
 where it does not look at their education and having a quarry limits your ability to get a job.
 That limits that young person's own lifetime earnings potential.
 If you look at it from the labor market, when we say all of these young people are less likely to contribute to our labor market, that means our businesses are not able to hire.
 We have a labor shortage that we say, we need more young people.
 except those young people, right?
 You're not, we think those are, and this is, they're just not going to be part of the equation.
 They're not part of the denominator.
 And then when we do that, we're basically saying that group
 So every generation, we have a cohort of young people that just have a lifetime exclusion from fully integrating into our society.
 And that means us as a commonwealth don't benefit from their economic participation in our economy.
 And ultimately, our legal system is not an equal opportunity employer.
 We talked about the fact that the legal system targets low-income communities and communities of color disproportionately.
 That means when you look at where young people are excluded from our economy, excluded from our education and employment opportunities, they tend to be concentrated in those same communities that they come from, which means those communities, the economic potential of those communities is also diminished.
 And then finally,
 Going back to my first slide, we have a potential of reducing crime if we deal with young people in a developmentally appropriate way.
 Reducing crime also means we're also benefiting our taxpayers as a whole.
 We have less people who are victimized and require some kind of repair.
 Our legal system is not going to be as, you know, having all the workings of the legal system, we just won't have as much if we have,
 Again, it's not a criminal justice panacea, I'm not solving everything, but for those young people, shrinking that potential has an economic impact.
 And just conclude with just the thought that this is not new.
 I actually wanna say that our legal system is far behind the rest of our society in looking at young people under the age of 21 as adolescents.
 I started off by talking about pediatrics.
 Pediatricians work with young people
 under 21 and up to 21 and maybe sometimes older, depending on their medical needs, that's been going on for a long, long time.
 You can't drink, you can't smoke pot or smoke tobacco or gamble or own a gun or be a police officer until you're 21.
 There's also all sorts of other milestones because
 You can start a job at 14, you can get your driver's license at 16, but with lots of limitations until you're 18.
 But you can pre-register to vote because we want you to vote by 18.
 But then all these other things we want to delay.
 You can't rent a car until you're 25.
 You can be on your parents' health insurance until 26.
 Because our society does not have a hard line of adults.
 we have a transition to adulthood, which means things that we want young people to grow up and make up into a habit into your adulthood, we want to encourage you to do more of that younger.
 The younger you are, the more likely you're going to stick.
 Things that are a risk to yourself or to others, which we believe legal system involvement is one of those, we want to delay so that when you are more mature, you can make those decisions and it's less likely to stick.
 So, I'm just going to end with just what I would love for this commission to consider ways of supporting.
 So, like this is legislation that's out there.
 I shared ahead of time fact sheets about this legislation, but there's many things that you could do to support.
 And just so you know, I've been trying to meet with all the human rights commissions across the state, and some of them are able to endorse, and some of them are like, oh, we're part of the state government, we can, but there's other ways to support.
 So these are all just ideas of things you can do if this is something you want to support.
 They could go from formal endorsement to we'll just make some connections or we'll publicize it to let our constituents know or our residents know about it.
 But without us, depending on, or we can say yes, we'll support it.
 We'll send our legislators a letter in support.
 It's really up to you all.
 So I just want to thank you for this opportunity.
 This is my contact information and I would love to open up to any questions.

 특정 발전 단계를 이야기할 때, 이것이 현재 청년 시스템이 직면하고 있는 상황인가요?
 이러한 발달 단계에 있는 청소년을 지원하기 위해 추가 도구나 자원을 청소년 시스템에 추가해야 합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1576.58s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: ដូច្នេះប្រព័ន្ធបណ្តុះបណ្តាលយុវជនរបស់យើងបានត្រៀមរួចរាល់ហើយ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងមាន
 ជាលទ្ធផល រដ្ឋ Massachusetts បានដឹកនាំប្រទេសជាតិក្នុងកំណែទម្រង់យុត្តិធម៌អនីតិជនចាប់តាំងពីទសវត្សរ៍ឆ្នាំ 1970 ។
 យើងបានអនុវត្តកំណែទម្រង់រយៈពេលប្រាំឆ្នាំ ហើយបានបិទពន្ធនាគារយុវជនទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងទសវត្សរ៍ឆ្នាំ 1970 ។
 ទសវត្សរ៍ទី 90 គឺគួរឱ្យភ័យខ្លាច។
 យើង​ជា​អ្នក​ធ្វើ​បាប​ប្រទេស​នេះ និង​កន្លែង​នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែចាប់តាំងពីឆ្នាំ 2003 មក DYS បានផ្តោតជាពិសេសលើការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍យុវជនជាវិជ្ជមាន ដោយធ្វើការកាត់បន្ថយការជាប់ឃុំ ដោយទទួលស្គាល់ពីផលប៉ះពាល់ដ៏គ្រោះថ្នាក់នៃការជាប់ឃុំឃាំង។
 វាបានវិវត្តន៍តាំងពីពេលនោះមក ដូចជាប្រសិនបើការប្រើប្រាស់ការឃុំឃាំងមិនដែលត្រូវបានបង្រួមអប្បបរមាពីដំបូងឡើយ។
 ដូច្នេះ វាដូចជា អូ យើងត្រូវធ្វើបែបនេះ ការអប់រំតែងតែមាន ប៉ុន្តែយើងត្រូវបង្កើនប្រសិទ្ធភាពវា។
 បច្ចុប្បន្ន​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​ការ​ក្នុង​ផ្នែក​វេជ្ជសាស្ត្រ។
 ឥឡូវនេះ យើងចង់អភិវឌ្ឍយុទ្ធសាស្ត្របន្ទាប់របស់យើង ហើយផែនការយុទ្ធសាស្រ្តបច្ចុប្បន្នរបស់យើងគឺជុំវិញសុវត្ថិភាពលំនៅដ្ឋាន។
 ដូច្នេះ​វត្ថុ​ទាំង​អស់​នេះ​គឺ​នៅ​ទី​នោះ ហើយ​វា​ត្រូវ​បាន​សាង​សង់​ជា​រៀង​រាល់​ឆ្នាំ។
 ប៉ុន្តែទស្សនៈនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍យុវជនជាវិជ្ជមានបានក្លាយជាផ្នែកមួយនៃប្រព័ន្ធយុត្តិធម៌យុវជនរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំមិនមែនគ្រាន់តែនិយាយអំពី DYS ការសាកល្បង តុលាការ អ្នកការពារសាធារណៈ និងមេធាវីស្រុកនោះទេ។
 មនុស្សមើលក្មេងជំទង់ហើយនិយាយថា: ការងាររបស់យើងគឺជួយពួកគេឱ្យធំឡើង។
 មានអង្គការដូចយើងដែរ ពីព្រោះយើងត្រូវការពារ ដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា យើងទទួលខុសត្រូវចំពោះអង្គការទាំងនេះ ដើម្បីសម្រេចបាននូវគោលដៅទាំងនេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ទាំងនេះគឺជាគោលដៅ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​មាន​បទពិសោធន៍ ហើយ​យើង​មាន​សមត្ថភាព។
 ឥឡូវនេះមានសំណួរអំពីលេខ។
 វិក័យប័ត្រខ្លួនវាមិនគ្របដណ្តប់លើមនុស្សគ្រប់រូបដែលមានអាយុពី 18 ទៅ 20 ឆ្នាំក្នុងពេលតែមួយនោះទេ។
 ទីមួយ គោលដៅរបស់យើងគឺ 18 ឆ្នាំ។
 នេះគឺជាលេខតូចជាង។
 ប្រព័ន្ធនេះត្រូវបានបង្កើតឡើងជាមួយនឹងការទទួលស្គាល់ថាមូលនិធិមួយចំនួនអាចនឹងត្រូវផ្ទេរពីប្រព័ន្ធមនុស្សពេញវ័យទៅប្រព័ន្ធយុវជន ដើម្បីបម្រើដល់ក្មេងអាយុ 19 ឆ្នាំ និងនៅទីបំផុតក្មេងអាយុ 20 ឆ្នាំ។
 ម៉ូដែលនេះត្រូវបានផលិតនៅ Vermont ។
 រហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះរដ្ឋ Vermont គឺជារដ្ឋតែមួយគត់ដែលបង្កើនអាយុលើសពី 18 ឆ្នាំ។
 គិតត្រឹមឆ្នាំ 2020 ពួកគេមានអាយុ 18 ឆ្នាំ ហើយត្រូវបានគេរំពឹងថានឹងត្រូវបានដាក់បញ្ចូលក្នុងក្រុមនៅរដូវក្តៅនេះ។</p>

 이제 오늘이 큰 날처럼 보일지라도 West Medford 커뮤니티 센터는 오늘 Juneteenth를 축하할 것이라고 말씀드릴 수 있습니다.
 그래서 나는 추천한다
 Juneteenth가 공휴일이기 때문에 시에서는 6월 17일 전날에 깃발을 게양할 예정이므로 이 행사를 내년이나 다른 날로 저장해 두세요.
 불행하게도 West Medford와 Royal Community Center가 우리가 삼자 파트너십을 맺고 하루를 보낼 수 있는 곳의 길 건너편에 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2292.471s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 내 생각엔 그게 당신인 것 같아요.
 나는 이것을 내년으로 옮기고 싶거나 아마도 올해 말에 또 다른 축하 행사를 갖고 싶습니다. 그것이 적절하다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 알았어
 이 중요한 날 중 일부는 이미 지나갔을 수도 있습니다.
 오늘은 몇 가지 제안을 위해 국가 달력을 살펴보겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2324.62s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 글쎄, 알아 보자.
 그래서 아마도 다음 회의에서 업데이트할 것 같습니다.
 모두 감사합니다.

 네, 네, 맞습니다.
 아주 좋아, 좋아.
 그래서 이 매우 간단한 달력인 4월의 다른 항목은 지구의 날입니다. 그리고 Fran Awa는 Medford Public Library에서 가져온 이 달력에서 흑인 건강에 관한 전체 시리즈를 추가했습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2441.175s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 예, 그것은 작은 요소입니다.
 방금 지난 회의에서 우리가 자존심을 조심하곤 했다고 언급했어요.
 그게 뭔지 궁금해요?
 도시 달력에서 아무것도 찾을 수 없거나 관련 정보를 찾으려고 노력 중입니다.
 그게 당시 나의 유일한 녹음이었다는 것을 아는 사람이 있을지 모르겠습니다.
 참석하는 것이 합리적일 것 같습니다.
 그러나 나는 아무것도 제안하지 않습니다.
 올해는 아무것도 시도하기에는 너무 늦을 수도 있습니다.
 그녀는 이것에 대한 경험이 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2474.619s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 따라서 HRC는 프라이드 행사를 후원하지 않습니다.

 CDH가 생각할 수 있는 것은 다음과 같습니다.
 CDH가 대량을 원하는 경우. CDH가 더 작은 부분을 원하는 경우.
 하지만 기억하세요. 배려라고 말할 때는 실제로 뭔가를 하고 있다는 뜻입니다.
 이것이 의미하는 바입니다
 당신은 음식을 구입합니다.
 따라서 점심 식사가 HRC의 후원을 받거나 이벤트를 주최하는 것처럼 행동하십시오.
 그래서 이것은 별개입니다.
 그러나 CDH가 깃발 게양식 행사에 참석하는 데 관심이 있다면 이에 대해 논의하고 참여 계획을 알려주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2569.347s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 올해 도시 달력에서 제가 찾아봤지만 찾을 수 없었던 유일한 것은 도시에 대한 언급이었습니다.

 그래서 시장이 없으면 시청은 토요일에 문을 닫고 토요일에 깃발을 게양하기 어려울 거라는 걸 아시죠.
 나는 또한 많은 머리를 좋아합니다.
 이러한 이벤트로.
 사람들만 모이는 게 아니다.
 목적과 의미가 있어야 합니다.
 그래서 저는 무대 뒤에서 다양한 사람들과 이야기를 나눕니다.
 그날 시장과 약속을 합의한 후에는 이제 배후에 있는 다른 모든 점들을 연결하고 움직여야 하고 변화해야 "좋아, 이 회사는 예스 회사야"라고 말할 수 있었습니다.
 하지만 확실히 말씀드릴 수 있는 것은 시에서 프라이드 데이를 3월 31일까지 지키고 싶지 않다는 것뿐입니다.
 아시다시피, 이것은 어리석게 들릴 수도 있지만, 이 그룹에는 다른 사람들도 있습니다.
 저는 DPW 팀입니다.
 자국이 지워지지 않도록 준비가 되었는지 확인해야 하고, 아침에 가장 먼저 다시 칠하고 채색해야 합니다.
 해당 날짜가 이메일에 표시되기 전에 백그라운드에서 많은 일이 일어나고 있습니다.
 달력에 있다고 하네요.
 이 도시가 이전에 무엇을 했는지는 모르겠습니다.
 모르겠습니다.
 그러나 그것이 바로 지난 2년 동안 일어난 일입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2686.885s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 그래서 내가 하고 싶은 일이 무엇인지 생각한다.
 우리 협의회는 올해에 모이지 않을 수도 있습니다.
 많은 것 같습니다.
 라디오에서는 모르겠고, 이해가 안 되고, 이 회사가 내년에 뭔가를 할 수 있을지도 모르겠다고 할 수도 있고, 만약 우리가 할 수 있다면 올해가 연기되거나 무슨 일이 일어났는지 잘 모르겠다면 매우 불확실해 보인다.
 우리는 할 수 있습니다.
 내 생각엔 우리 스스로 뭔가를 해야 할 것 같아.
 도시 매개변수에서는 이 작업을 수행할 필요가 없습니다.
 그래서 저는 동료들에게 이것이 우리가 보고 있는 것이고 아마도 내년에는 다른 비영리 단체를 살펴볼 것이라고 제안하고 있습니다. 아니면 누군가가 그것에 관심이 있는지는 모르겠습니다.
 사람들이 함께 무언가를 성취하는 데 관심이 있는지 보고 싶습니다.
 지금은 이 모든 것이 모호해 보입니다.
 예를 들어, 다른 모든 팀 간의 조정을 위해 무언가를 구성하려고 할 때 더 어려운 작업입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2748.939s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 누군가... 글쎄요, 모린, 진짜 질문이 뭔지 모르겠어요.
 그렇군요. 일이 잘되고 있다고 말씀하셨으니까요.
 지난 2년간 시에서 진행해 왔던 국기 퍼레이드가 아직 열리지 않았다는 점을 알려드리고 싶습니다.
 이것은 정확합니다.
 그래서 나는 듣고 있는 사람들과 반대 방향으로 듣고 있는 사람들에게 다가가기 전에 모든 것이 명확한지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 날짜가 안보이는 이유는 올해가 주말이라네요.
 그래서 전략을 바꿔야 했어요.
 그러나 인권위원회는 A. 그 자체의 것을 환영합니다.
 예전처럼 마을에서 열리는 행사에 참석하시겠습니까, 아니면 다른 활동을 지원하시겠습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2808.045s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 글쎄요, 저는 단지 동료들에게 내년에 스스로 뭔가를 하고 싶은지 물어보는 것뿐입니다.
 그런 일이 있는지는 모르겠지만, 아니면 그냥 알고 있는 것일 수도 있겠네요</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2822.128s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 나는 경쟁력이 있기 때문에 올해와 내년에 정말로 국기를 날리고 싶고 다른 일을 찾으면 내년에는 그것이 발전하는지 확실히 볼 수 있을 것이라고 생각합니다. Maureen, 저는 이에 대해 개방적이며 귀하의 의견에 동의합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2848.726s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 올해는 어떻게든 참여할 수 있으면 좋겠다고 생각하는데, 이번에는 시간이나 시기 등을 최대한 명확하게 밝혀야 합니다.
 알았어, 좋아.
 우리가 할 수 있는 일을 하게 되어 기쁩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2865.912s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 네, 저는 올해와 내년에 이 행사를 지원한다는 생각을 전적으로 지지합니다.
 내 기억이 맞다면 프란시스는 작년인 것 같아요.
 이를 기념하기 위해 6월에 도시에서 어떤 행사를 계획하고 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2886.887s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 2022년과 2023년에도 프라이드는 한 달간 지속될 예정이다.
 프라이드는 6월에 기념되지만 실제로는 10월에 프라이드를 기념하기 때문에 일부 주에서는 10월에 프라이드를 기념합니다.
 따라서 단순히 깃발을 올리는 것보다 더 깊은 의미가 있습니다.
 여기에는 시민권 요소가 있습니다.
 내가 내 역할과 경력에 충실하다면 정말 좋을 것입니다.
 나는 민권 운동을 인정합니다.
 그 이면에는 장애인의 자부심과 권리가 있습니다.
 당신들은 모두 이런저런 방식으로 연결되어 있습니다.
 그래서 우리가 한 달 동안 행사를 할 때, 그 달에 무슨 일이 일어나는지 나에게는 중요합니다.
 그렇다고 모든 조치를 취해야 한다는 뜻은 아니지만, 비록 우리가 계획을 세우고 보여주고 사람들에게 02155에서 일어날 일에 대한 선택권을 준다고 해도 도움이 된다고 생각합니다.
 LGBTQ 커뮤니티 구성원으로 인한 트라우마를 회복하고 있는 사람들이나 멕시코에서 살고 싶다고 생각하는 사람들에게 이것이 도움이 될까요?
 아시다시피, 제가 2년 전에 이곳에 온 이후로 가끔씩, 일주일에 두 번은 아니더라도 적어도 매주 어떤 일이 일어납니다.
 그러나 그것은 사실이 아닙니다. 나는 모든 것에 대해 책임을 지지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2986.869s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 1년차는 그렇긴 한데 2년차는... 그냥 깃발만 드는 게 아니라 가고 싶은 곳이 여기인 것 같아요.
 깃발을 휘날리는 것이 나쁜 것은 아니지만, 이 팀이 관심을 갖고 있는지 궁금합니다.
 6월에 무엇을 할 수 있는지 봅시다.
 적어도 몇몇 사람들은 관심이 있다고 말한 것 같아요.
 놀라운.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3013.797s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 그것을 의제에 올리세요.
 알려드리고 달력에 올려드리겠습니다.
 계속 회전할 수 있도록 정원에 놓아두겠습니다.
 하지만 이제 오스틴 변호사가 우리와 함께 있는데 KP Law의 오스틴 변호사에게 연락하고 싶습니다.
 공개 회의 규칙과 동일한 주제에 대한 토론을 검토하기 위해 모든 사람은 48페이지 분량의 공개 회의 규칙 문서를 받게 됩니다.
 질문이 준비되어 있기를 바랍니다. 그렇습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3057.75s">[Austin]</a>: 谢谢大家今晚邀请我来这里。
 也谢谢你，弗朗西斯科。
 很高兴见到大家。
 我认为这是一个好机会。
 如您所知，有一位新的代理总检察长，总检察长办公室最近更新了公开会议的法律指南。
 我始终认为，对已经服务了一段时间的会员和新会员进行一点复习是个好主意，只需向他们提供公开会议法的基础知识即可。
 在全州范围内，我们看到对公开会议法的质疑和投诉有所增加。
 我这样说是为了让每个人真正了解我们所生活的环境，尤其是在一个依靠技术的使用而蓬勃发展的环境中。
 我在与英联邦各城镇的公开会议中处理许多法律事务，自 2006 年以来一直从事这项工作。我希望这是一次真正非正式的会议，能够回答任何人的问题。
 我当然可以提供一个概述，而且我知道弗朗西斯科也分发了一些材料。
 我总是按照时间顺序开始并思考公开培训会议或概述。
 会议通知经会议纪要批准后予以公布。
 这就是我对连续体的看法。
 因此，我们收到警告，我们知道，像您这样的公共机构的法定人数所讨论的任何事情通常都必须在我们所谓的公开会议上完成，而不是在执行会议上，这意味着向公众开放，以便能够看到您的工作。
 实时。
 当我们今晚在这里时，这可以在 Zoom 上完成。
 这可以亲自完成。
 我们将四年前于 2020 年开始的远程订单延长至 2025 年 3 月 31 日。
 我们相信还有许多悬而未决的立法，这些立法将从这些立法中得到扩展。
 有很多谈判。
 必须采取哪些流程来继续这一工作。
 这就是为什么我们正在密切监视它，并将随时向您通报最新情况。
 但现在我们可以在 Zoom 上见面。
 我们从议程开始。
 所有事情都必须纳入议程，并在讨论内容方面具有合理的具体性。
 这意味着什么？
 嗯，这意味着坐在家里的公众会拿起或查看屏幕上的会议通知并进行实际分析。
 我想参加这个会议吗？
 这是我想感兴趣的话题吗？
 我想看到关于这个特定主题的公开、透明的讨论吗？
 所以我总是说，当你在社区工作或做志愿者时，你了解所使用的语言或缩写词，例如所使用的语言，但我们真的很想成为这样的人，你知道。
 向公众提供信息，以便他们可以自行决定是否参与。
 这些是会议通知的基础知识。
 我们知道，除非有紧急情况，否则需要提前48个工作小时发布，真正确保在公共机构的业务方面没有不发布的讨论。
 这是会议通知的概述。
 然后我们开始商议并在会议上讨论什么。
 我们知道没有理由参加执行会议，我很乐意回答有关此问题的任何问题。
 我们知道，公共机构的事务必须在公开会议上进行。
 这意味着公共机构的任何法定人数都不能以团体或系列的形式，从一个成员到另一个成员讨论问题。
 在正式公布的会议之外。
 如果我们退一步，公共记录法和公开会议法的目的是，你知道，我们称它们为太阳能法，以提高透明度并确保公众知道他们的社区正在发生什么。
 从这个意义上说，随着技术的使用，我们看到了增长。
 我总是警告这只是一个概述，所以今晚我们不会详细讨论。
 但我始终警告不要使用电子邮件、手机或短信与其他成员交流。
 根据公开会议法和公共记录法，这都具有法律意义。
 所以只是要意识到这一点。
 在这一具体问题上，我们从总检察长的开放政府部门得到了很多指导。
 包括多年前的许多裁决，这些裁决规定，一个成员向另一个成员发送电子邮件或短信，然后对其进行回复，无论是连续还是在正确发布的会议之外以小组形式再次回复，都可能构成审议。
 所以这是需要注意的事情。
 在投票和讨论方面，我们知道公共机构的业务是由公共机构的法定人数进行的。
 如果没有法定人数，这项业务肯定无法完整开展。
 总检察长办公室建议，如果没有达到法定人数，则不应举行会议并推迟到公共机构法定人数可以开会和召开的其他时间，无论是亲自还是远程，无论委员会的偏好如何。
 从那里我们知道会议纪要必须及时编写和批准。
 我们通常说这会在接下来的 30 天或三次会议中发生，根据您的会议安排以先到者为准。
 但当然，就像会议通知或议程一样，您必须小心，确保坐在家里的人得到会议纪要的副本并真正了解发生了什么。
 我们知道你必须有一些基本信息，你知道的，会议的日期和时间，出席或缺席的成员。
 如果会议是远程会议，则必须采用唱名表决方式，并且将进行所有投票。
 再说一次，有人，我称之为四角规则，有人记录会议记录，真正了解投票了哪些票，做了什么，你知道，有人知道会议中实际发生了什么吗？
 从那时起，这些会议记录将受到公开会议法和公共记录法的约束。
 社区成员当然可以提出要求。
 如果有执行会议，则这些会议记录有单独的流程。
 但同样，它们的起草方式必须精确而详细。
 我很高兴回答任何细节。
 我知道这是一次公开会议。
 这就是为什么我总是说我们所处的位置仅供一般信息参考。
 如果您对我们在哪里担任市议员有具体问题，我只是要求您直接或通过弗朗西斯科联系我，就这些具体问题考虑到其特权性质，但我很乐意回答或提供任何主题的概述。</p>

 나는 리더십 회의에 대해 여러 번 언급했는데, 나는 이 분야에 있기 때문에 회의를 리더십 회의로 바꿀 필요가 없습니다.

 우리에게 올 수도 있고 경영진 회의가 무엇인지, 우리가 경영진 회의를 주최하는 이유, 가상 기술(우리가 가지고 있지 않은)을 사용하는 경우 경영진 회의 참석과 관련된 일부 매개 변수를 모르는 사람들.

 모린은 일어서서 목소리를 높였습니다.

 서두르겠습니다.
 저는 단지 들어오는 이메일에 대해서만 생각하고 질문이 있으면 그룹으로 답변하고 싶습니다.
 이것은 토론이 아닌 긴밀하고 폐쇄적인 관계이기 때문에 공개 회의의 규칙을 위반할까봐 아직 그렇게 하지 않았습니다.
 나는 당신의 의견을 듣고 싶습니다.
 이것이 적절한가요, 아니면 우리가 계속해서 피해야 하는 것인가요?
 다시 한 번 말씀드리지만, 이 예에서는 일부 정보를 보내고 있으며 팀 전체가 응답하기를 원합니다.
 그때 우리는 프랑스로 돌아와 팀에 연락했다. 이것이 우리가 따라야 할 과정인가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3834.869s">[Austin]</a>: 좋은 질문입니다.
 따라서 법무장관은 협회법에 따라 이메일을 적절하게 사용하는 유일한 방법은 다음과 같다고 주장합니다.
 정부 포럼은 계획 목적으로만 제한되어야 합니다.
 3월 13일 금요일에 열리는 회의에 참석할 수 있나요?
 이 특별한 시간을 맞이할 준비가 되셨나요?
 모든 연설은 참가자들과 문서를 공유하는 것(좋은 생각이라고 생각합니다)을 포함하더라도 공개 회의 규칙을 위반할 가능성이 높습니다.
 에 관한 정보가 있는 경우
 이 특별한 주제에 관해 우리가 만나야 할지 궁금합니다. 이것을 의제에 올려도 될까요?
 어쩌면 이 메시지가 프란시스코와 대통령에게 전달될 수도 있습니다.
 문서 교환에 관해서는 내용 수준에 따라 가능한 해결책을 보았지만 어떤 표현이나 신념도 회의 규칙 위반으로 이어질 수 있다고 믿습니다.
 매우 엄격합니다.
 그 뒤에는 사고 과정이 있습니다
 우리는 모두 바쁘고 많은 일을 위해 이메일과 메일을 사용하며 이것이 진지한 대화로 이어질 수도 있고, 청중이 볼 수 없는 상태에서 한 참가자가 다른 참가자의 관점을 바탕으로 이메일에 댓글을 남길 수도 있습니다.
 그래서 저는 항상 모범 사례에 대해 이야기합니다.
 제 생각에는 이런 상황에서 당신이 할 수 있는 가장 좋은 일은 단순히 의사소통을 하는 것입니다.
 귀하는 Francis를 직접 알고 있거나 Francis와 다른 회원들을 알고 있지만 어떤 의견을 바탕으로 이메일을 보낼 수는 없습니다.
 나는 그것이 어렵다는 것을 안다.
 이 질문은 항상 나오죠. 사람들이 Google Docs를 공유할 수 있나요? 아니면 우리가 기술 사용에 익숙하고 이런 종류의 비즈니스를 정말로 운영하고 싶은 모임을 갖는 사람들이라는 것을 알고 계셨습니까?
 대중이 볼 수 있도록.
 이것이 귀하의 질문에 대한 답변입니까?
 네, 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3966.135s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 알았어, 좋아.
 미안, 너무 이르다.
 위원은 이 위원이든 다른 위원이든 많은 정보가 필요하며, 어딘가에서 훈련을 보았거나 팀에 관심이 있을 것이라고 생각하는 것을 보았을 수도 있습니다.
 이러한 메시지는 일반적으로 나에게 전송되거나 어떤 형태로든 내 받은편지함으로 전송됩니다.
 내가 보냈다
 귀하가 나에게 보내고 다른 사람을 대신하여 공유하는 모든 사본에는 응답이 필요하지 않습니다. 관심이 있으시면 등록하십시오.
 나는 때때로 사람들이 대답이 필요하지 않다고 말했기 때문에 내가 그들을 끄고 있다고 느끼는 것을 알고 있지만 완전한 대답을 가질 필요도 없습니다.
 가장 무고한 사람들을 피하기 위해 맙소사, 이 행사에 참석했는데 정말 놀랍습니다.
 왜냐하면 거기에서 의견이 나오기 때문입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4024.346s">[Austin]</a>: 아니면 뭔가 잘못되었습니다. 저는 이 행사가 아주 좋다고 생각합니다. 정말 도시에 도움이 될 것이라고 생각하며 우리는 행사를 고려해야 합니다.
 그러면 다른 사람들이 하나씩 대답합니다. 동의합니다.
 그 자체로 하나의 표현입니다.
 그렇다면 프란시스코로 보내는 것이 가장 좋을 것 같습니다.
 제가 근무하는 일부 정부기관에서는 공개회의 규정으로 인해 다음과 같은 서류를 보유하고 있으니 회신하지 마시기 바랍니다.
 이는 지역구 구성원이나 지역사회 구성원에게 응답하거나 조언을 제공하기를 꺼리는 사람들을 위한 온화한 알림으로 보일 수 있지만 실제로는 다음 회의에서 논의될 사항입니다.
 때로는 승무원 교육이나 승무원 승진 기회가 의제에 포함될 수도 있습니다.
 그런 다음 이러한 문제에 대해 토론하고 청중이 토론을 관찰할 수 있는 섹션이 있습니다.
 일부 정부 기관에서는 회의 간 서신 내용을 나열하고 보낸 편지도 나열합니다.
 이로 인해 충돌이 발생할 수 있습니다.
 특별보고관에 관한 회원 중.
 그래서 그것은 또 다른 옵션입니다.
 하지만 제가 함께 일하는 많은 정부 기관은 회의가 끝날 때나 이메일을 통해 다음과 같은 경고를 표시합니다. 의도한 것이 아닐 수 있으므로 정확하게 답변하지 마십시오. 그러나 누군가가 이 공개 기록을 요청하는 경우
 일부 응답자가 보였습니다.
 이는 집회법 위반인가요?
 따라서 모든 것을 고려해야합니다.
 모린 질문이 있으신가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4139.648s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 네, 제가 그랬어요.
 나는 일부를 가지고 있지만 다른 사람들에게 일어나는 일을 받아들일 것입니다.
 그래서 나는 프란시스가 우리에게 준 공개 집회에 관한 법률을 주의 깊게 읽었습니다.
 제가 말하는 위원회에 대한 언급은 전혀 없습니다.
 예를 들어, 우리는 특정 이벤트를 주최할지 후원할지 여부를 결정합니다.
 다른 두 가지 유형이 있습니다
 이러한 약속을 하기로 결정한 사람은 과반수 미만입니다.
 우리는 한 달 반 동안 많은 일을 할 수 있습니다.
 시간이 많지 않아서 좀 아쉽네요.
 실제로 목적이 회의에서 과반수 미만이고 후속 회의에서 고려할 포괄적인 정보를 제공하는 것이 목적인 경우, 이는 공개 회의법의 적용을 받습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4201.547s">[Austin]</a>: 그러면 법무장관실은 정부 기관이 소위원회를 설치할지 여부를 고려할 것입니다.
 일반적으로 정족수는 구성원이 있는 한 대규모 공공 기관을 위한 것인지 여부는 중요하지 않으며, 아시다시피 공식적인 소위원회일 필요는 없으며 어떤 실무 그룹이라도 될 수 있습니다.
 위원회 회원으로서 Rob과 Maureen이 이 특정 사건에 대한 책임을 묻는 투표를 했다면 공공 기록법에 따라 소위원회나 태스크 포스를 구성하시겠습니까?
 사람들은 모든 것을 이해하고 할 수 있어야 합니다.
 제가 함께 일하는 일부 커뮤니티에서는 특정 커뮤니티를 만들고, 타운홀 회의를 열고 Maureen이 이 특별한 문제를 처리할 것이고 Rob이 이 특별한 문제를 처리할 것이며 다음 회의에서 다시 만나 그룹을 재편성할 것이라고 말했습니다.
 하지만 정부 기관이 사업을 정부 기관의 해당 부분으로 이전하기로 구체적인 결정을 내린 경우 공개 회의법이 적용된다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4279.631s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 따라서 귀하가 무엇을 말씀하시든, 이 조직에서 우리가 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 Maureen과 Rob에게 투표했다고 말하면 공개 회의가 필요하다는 점을 강조하고 싶습니다.
 반대로, 그들이 찬성표를 던진다면, 모린, 확인해 보는 게 어때요?
 Maureen과 Rob에게 이 문제를 해결할 것이라고 말해 줄 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4298.376s">[Austin]</a>: 글쎄요, 좀 봐야겠군요.
 이 문제는 느슨하게 살펴봐야 할 것 같습니다.
 내 말은, 유일한 예외는 시장이 그렇게 하지 않는 경우라는 거야
 회의 규칙에 따르면 프랜시스, 모린, 롭에게 나를 위해 뭔가를 해달라고 부탁하겠다고 했죠?
 그것이 무엇이든 나는 그것을 시험해 보고 몇 가지 글쓰기 팁을 제공하고 싶지만 그것은 대부분 내 직업과 목표에 달려 있습니다.
 이 예의 목적은 모든 정부 기관에 조언을 제공하는 것입니다. 그렇죠?
 귀하의 예에서는 가설
 이에 대해 법무장관은 집회법 문제를 제기할 실무그룹이나 소위원회가 만들어졌다고 말할 것 같습니다.
 기여자가 한 명인지 두 명인지 확인해 보겠지만, 구현이나 운영 측면에서 매우 광범위합니다.
 나는 항상 그것을 다이어그램으로 봅니다. 누가 이 팀을 만들었나요?
 귀하 또는 Francisco가 귀하와 협력하는 경우 정부 기관이 이를 생성하는 방법
 회의 규칙을 준수하도록 요청받을 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4372.721s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 나는 팀이 조언을 제공하기 위해 거기에 있어야 한다고 생각하지 않고 오히려 연구를 재개하기 위해 거기에 있어야 한다고 생각합니다. 그러나 그것은 사실이 아니며 그것이 조언이라고 생각하지 않습니다.
 나는 그들이 일어서서 "글쎄요, 우리는 연구를 했고 당신이 이것을 해야 한다고 생각합니다"라고 말할 것이라고 말하는 것이 아닙니다.
 더 비슷해요
 그들은 그렇게 했고, 위원회도 그렇게 했습니다.
 꼭 그렇게 할 필요는 없지만 조언을 한다는 의미라고 말씀하셨습니다. 그렇게 하면 사람들에게 알리고 48시간 전에 통보하고 두 사람이 함께 하는 이 토론에 참여하도록 초대할 수 있습니다.
 사고가 났어도 우리는 괜찮습니다.
 그러면 당사는 수집된 모든 정보를 전체 기관에 제공할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4425.617s">[Austin]</a>: 예, 저는 공공 기관의 구성 요소를 설명하는 법무장관 매뉴얼 7페이지에 여러분의 관심을 끌고 싶습니다.
 법무장관은 특히 두 명 이상의 구성원으로 구성된 정부 기관, 이사회, 위원회, 위원회 또는 소위원회의 전체 목록이 없다고 명시합니다.
 행정 또는 입법 기관.
 여기에는 정부 기관을 검토하거나 권고하기 위해 만들어진 여러 구성원으로 구성된 기관이 포함됩니다.
 그래서 매우 광범위합니다.
 이것이 내가 의미하는 바이며 누가 이 그룹에 책임이 있는지입니다.
 다시 말하지만, 일반적으로 예외만 있습니다.
 작업팀은 학교장이나 시장이 구성해야 하며 회의 개최에 관한 법률 조항의 적용을 받지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4481.063s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 하지만 문제는 뭐라고 부르든 기관에서 추천을 한다는 것입니다.
 그 말을 계속 듣고 있어요.
 그리고 그것이 단순한 제안이 아니라 연구라면 스스로 제안이라고 하던데요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4501.395s">[Austin]</a>: 글쎄, 우리는 어디까지가 경계인지 알아봐야 할 것입니다. 하지만 경험을 통해 말씀드릴 수 있는 것은 우리 팀과 우리 팀의 공개 회의 규칙에 대한 불만 사항의 ​​경우 해당 규칙이 매우 광범위하다는 것입니다.
 지금은 구체적인 해결책이 있으므로 모든 사람이 어디로 가야 할지 명확한 아이디어를 얻을 수 있도록 이를 프란시스코와 공유하게 되어 기쁩니다.
 당신이 관심이 있다면, 모린, 기꺼이 그렇게 할게요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4529.797s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 글쎄요, 또 다른 질문이 있습니다. 회의록은 승인 여부에 관계없이 10일 이내에 게시된다는 내용을 읽었습니다.
 그래서 내 질문은 다음과 같습니다.
 어떻게 사용할 수 있나요?
 이것이 개방의 법칙을 확립하는 것인지 궁금합니다.
 예를 들어, 우리 회의가 시 웹사이트에 없는 경우입니다.
 예를 들어 신입회원으로서 6월에 무슨 일이 있었는지 질문을 받거나 공공장소에 있었다면 “아, 무슨 소리를 하는 거야?”라고 생각하게 될 것입니다.
 나는 그들이 어떤 입장을 취하고 있는지, 아닌지 잘 모르겠습니다. 내 말은, 그게 중요하고 또 다른 점은 그것이 완료되면 승인되거나 초안 형식이면 마지막 순간에 승인된 다른 것으로 대체되고 승인되면 네, 일기가 작성된다는 것입니다. 나는 당신이 어떻게 지내는지 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4599.139s">[Austin]</a>: 대신 작성할 사람을 결정하거나 한 사람만 작성하되 회의록을 유지하세요.
 기록할 때 승인되지 않더라도 초안 형식으로 되어 있고 대중이 해당 회의록을 얻기 위해 공개 기록 또는 공개 회의법 요청을 제출하는 경우 이는 공개 회의법의 요구 사항이라는 것을 알고 있습니다. 승인되지 않더라도 때때로 한 달에 한 번 회의를 합니다.
 이 프로토콜은 초안 형식으로 제출되어야 합니다.
 이는 공공 기록이므로 지방자치단체 직원, 공무원, 자원봉사자, 의회 위원, 위원 및 위원회 위원이 작성하거나 수신한 모든 기록의 백업 사본을 만들 수 있는 모든 기록에는 공공 기록법이 적용됩니다.
 여기에는 도시 사업과 관련된 이메일을 포함한 SMS 문자 메시지를 포함하여 개인용 컴퓨터에서 생성된 파일이 포함됩니다.
 그러다가 한 사람이 보통 법무 부서에 보내면서 '재니스, 그 사람이 기록 접근 담당자였는데 나한테 이 기록의 사본이 필요해'라고 말하더군요.
 이것이 초안인 경우 Janice가 귀하에게 연락하여 이 텍스트의 사본이 있는지 물어볼 것입니다.
 아, 응, 그냥 초안일 뿐이야.
 응, 그렇지?
 이는 임원 회의가 아닌 총회 회의록일 수 있습니다.
 승인된 후 청중이 동일한 요청을 받고 게시물을 승인하면 승인된 게시물을 받게 됩니다.
 회의록은 시 웹사이트에 게시할 필요가 없습니다.
 일부 커뮤니티에서는 이렇게 합니다.
 어떤 사람들은 회의록 전체를 온라인에 게시하지 않습니다.
 이는 도시 자원을 소비하는 활동인 경우가 많습니다.
 그러나 이는 여전히 일반적인 의전 및 회의 규칙의 적용을 받는다는 것을 나타냅니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4705.229s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 이는 누군가가 뭔가를 원하면 요청해야 한다는 뜻입니다.
 이것이 짧은 대답입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4712.071s">[Austin]</a>: 정확히.
 그래서 이것은 두 부분입니다.
 첫째, 회의법은 이 회의록을 작성하고 승인하고 서명하도록 요구합니다.
 이는 공개회의법(Open Meetings Law)에 따라 수행됩니다.
 그래서 다른 모든 것은 청중에 달려 있습니다.
 공공 기록법 및 법적 회의 요구 사항을 요청하고 준수합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4735.277s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 따라서 이런 일이 발생할 수 있는 상황은 없습니다.
 사람들은 마을에 와서 "이 시간을 주세요"라고 말하면 됩니다.
 작년 성적표를 보려면 그렇게 해야 합니다.
 정식 신청서를 제출해야 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4752.186s">[Austin]</a>: 내 말은 예 또는 아니요를 의미합니다. 누가 그랬는지 압니다. 누가 기록을 가지고 있는지는 모르겠지만 할 수 있습니다. 즉, 일반적으로 해당 기록을 공식 공개 기록으로 만들 필요는 없지만 공직 직원 Maureen으로서 내부적으로 처리할 수 있다고 생각합니다. 하지만 전반적으로 우리는 이 시점에서 일관성을 유지하고 싶다고 생각합니다.
 확인할 수 있습니다
 당신은 프리젠테이션이 어떻게 이루어졌는지 또는 접근 방식이 무엇인지 알고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4787.24s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 사실 나보다 관객을 더 생각하는 편이다.
 아시다시피, 어떤 사람들은 "맙소사, 그 사람들이 무엇을 하는지 보고 싶어요."라고 말합니다.
 나는 사람들이 그것을 어떻게 찾는지 이해하려고 노력하고 있습니다.
 그게 다야.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4798.686s">[Austin]</a>: 예, 저는 일반적으로 해당 기록에 접근할 수 있는 직원에게 특정 공개 기록을 요청하거나 정부 기관의 장에게 공개 규칙에 따라 일반적으로 보유하게 될 기록을 생성하도록 요청함으로써 그렇게 할 것이라고 생각합니다.
 그들이 오는 걸 보면</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4815.635s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 그래서 회의록이 세 군데 다른 곳에 보관되어 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 그런 다음 Medford Community Media로 이동하기 때문에 시간이 더 오래 걸리는 온라인 버전이 있습니다.
 네, 이건 우리 영상이에요.
 그런데 회의가 끝나갈 무렵 무슨 일이 일어났는가?
 메모가 승인되면 메모가 승인되고 변경되지 않으면 면회실로 내려가서 7부를 복사한다는 뜻인 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 현재 8권이 있는데 1권을 구매할 예정입니다.
 나는 아직도 사본을 가지고 있고 원본과 나머지는 시장실에 보관되어 있습니다.
 당신은 여전히 ​​도시 신뢰에 있습니다.
 누구나 가입하여 회의록 검토를 요청할 수 있습니다.
 2022년 4월부터 현재까지만 말씀드릴 수 있습니다.
 그런데 저는 메모를 잘 못해요.
 저는 보통 초안을 메모로 보낸 다음 회의에 다시 보냅니다.
 그래서 이것은 우리 모두가 사랑하고 연결을 시작해야 하는 것입니다.
 Maureen이 이 사실을 당신에게 확인해 주었나요?
 음, 롭과 다이앤.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4902.737s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 네, 감사합니다.
 나는 곧 조언 및 정보 교환 소위원회에 합류하게 될 것 같습니다.
 저는 법무장관이 앞장서서 나아가는 모습을 보고 싶습니다.
 매월 90분간의 회의가 끝난 후 그들은 위원회의 관할하에 있습니까?
 회의 중에 이러한 문제에 대한 진전을 이루기 위해 사무실에서는 어떤 제안을 합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4939.699s">[Austin]</a>: 그래서 팀원이 개별적으로 일하거나 팀으로 동시에 일하고 싶어하면 함께 협업할 수 있을 것 같아요.
 아시다시피 회원들은 대리인이나 시 ​​공무원이 아니며 확실히 두세 명의 회원이 함께 모여 이러한 토론을 하고 싶어합니다.
 대중에게 공개된다는 점을 지적하고 싶은 것 뿐이죠?
 그리고 회의 규칙을 따르세요.
 아니면 제 생각엔요.
 추가 회의 일정을 잡는 것은 좋은 제안이나 연습일 뿐입니다.
 알겠습니다. 하지만 분명히 이것은 정치적인 결정이므로 회원들은 자신의 의제 등에 맞게 변경하는 것을 고려해야 합니다.
 아시다시피, 특히 일년 중 가장 바쁜 시기에 더 자주 모임을 갖는 정부 기관이 있습니다.
 그런 다음 수행해야 할 중요한 작업이 있는지 여부에 따라 회의 일정을 다시 조정하지만 여기에는 몇 가지 다른 옵션이 있습니다.
 내가 말했듯이, 항상 혼자 일하거나 특별 위원회의 구성원과 함께 일한 다음 필요에 따라 소규모 공개 그룹에 보고하는 옵션이 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5014.173s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 나는 본다
 우리가 직면한 문제 중 하나는 통합 기사에 명시된 회의 일정이라고 생각합니다.
 다소 모호한 조언으로 해석하는 것이 타당할까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5031.95s">[Austin]</a>: 틀림없이.
 내 말은, 내가 실제로 규칙을 테스트할 수 있을 것 같다는 거죠.
 그들은 얼마나 유연한지 확인하기 위해 정부 기관을 창설했지만 약속은 개방적이고 협력적이므로 추가 약속이 예약될 때 대중에게 적절한 광고와 공지만 하면 됩니다.
 그래서 우리는 법의 언어를 볼 수 있습니다.
 기꺼이 그렇게 하여 Francisco에게 알립니다.
 하지만 공개 회의가 적절하게 게시된다면 합법입니다. 물론 일부 커뮤니티 조직에서는 정족수가 없거나 게시하고 이 회의가 필요하지 않다고 말하지 않는 한 게시하고 거부할 것입니다.
 그러니 포기하세요.
 그러나 적어도 Rob의 책에서는 그렇습니다.
 다시 말하지만, 일년 중 특정 시기에는 정부 기관의 업무량이 기복이 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5086.017s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 나는 본다
 감사합니다
 네, 확인해보시면 좋을 것 같아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5089.159s">[Austin]</a>: 네, 저는 그 일을 하는 것을 좋아합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5092.02s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 잘했어요, 다이애나.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5093.08s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 감사합니다
 좋아요.
 프레젠테이션 중에 Google에서 리소스를 확인하고 계시다는 것을 알고 방금 생각했습니다.
 아시다시피, 분명히 이것은 다른 인권 위원회에 대한 조사에서 그들이 연도와 월별로 잘 정리된 노트를 게시하는 것 같다는 것을 알아차렸기 때문입니다.
 회의 전에 게시하거나 Google Docs를 사용하여 공동작업하는 등 일부 사람들이 공동작업을 한다는 소식을 들었습니다.
 개인 데이터 또는 기타 콘텐츠에 대해.
 저는 Google을 통해 공유하는 규칙을 배우려고 노력하고 있습니다.
 만약 구글 드라이브가 인권위원회 홈페이지에 발표되었다면 썬이 이 문제를 해결할 수 있었을지 누가 ​​알겠습니까?
 나는 이것을 이해하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5157.557s">[Austin]</a>: 이것은 분명히 우리가 최근 몇 년 동안 보아온 새로운 기술입니다.
 제 생각에는 Google 문서 도구를 통한 모든 공동 작업이 공개 회의법과 그 구현 및 지금까지 살펴본 원칙에 따라 적절한 것으로 간주될 가능성이 높습니다.
 글쎄요, Google Docs나 다른 공동 작업 도구를 사용하면 이런 일이 지속적으로 발생할 가능성이 높습니다.
 그래서 나는 종종 분 세트의 예를 사용하고 Rob이 먼저 와서 변경합니다.
 그러다가 Diana가 와서 변경을 했는데 Rob의 변경 사항을 보면 총회가 아닌 모든 것이 결정되었습니다.
 그런 다음 회의에 참석하면 해당 특정 문제에 대한 정부 기관의 다른 구성원의 의견을 볼 수 있습니다.
 회의록.
 따라서 개인이 회의록을 작성하거나 문서를 작성할 수 있도록 법에 규정하고 있지만, 특정 문서에 대한 논의와 심의는 정부기관 자체의 심의를 국민이 볼 수 있도록 공개회의에서 이루어져야 한다.
 다이애나의 복잡한 기술.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5247.43s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 기술은 복잡합니다. 저는 기술 분야에서 일하고 있으며 Google을 사용하지 않습니다.
 그래서 나는 정말로 그것을 고수하고 있습니다.
 그리고 이제 우리는 ADA AI를 갖게 되었고, 경험을 향상시켰습니다. 문제의 Google은 말했습니다.
 DEI의 내 편은, 아뇨.
 그럼 이제 전쟁이다
 좋은 일도 있고 나쁜 일도 많습니다. 누군가가 제가 결정하는 데 도움을 주어 "그래, 이게 우리가 하는 일이야"라고 말할 수 있기를 바랍니다.
 위원님, 더 궁금한 점이 있으신가요?
 우리는 공개적인 자리에 있기 때문에 그들에게 질문할 기회를 제공하게 되어 기쁩니다.
 위원님께 질문드릴 내용은 없습니다.
 배리 씨, 질문을 계속하시겠습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5310.006s">[Barry Ingber]</a>: 다른 사람들도 이 글을 읽었으면 좋겠습니다.
 이제 내가 떠날 시간이라는 사실이 Rob의 주장을 더욱 돋보이게 하는 것 같았습니다.
 자신을 소개할 수 있나요?
 제 이름은 배리 잉버입니다.
 저는 노스 메드포드에 살고 있습니다.
 그런데 구글 문서의 경우, 토론 내용을 대중이 볼 수 있도록 문서를 공개한다면 이 의견이 바뀔지 궁금합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5491.072s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 왜냐하면 우리가 내년 프라이드 먼스(Pride Month)를 위해 실제로 어떤 일을 할 계획인지에 대해 이야기하면서도 오늘 밤 우리 자신을 발견하기 때문입니다.
 위원회의 두 위원이 이 문제를 조사하는 데 관심이 있습니다.
 그렇다면 이것은 무엇을 의미합니까?
 먼저, 도시에서 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 알아보세요.
 둘째
 우리는 어떤 아이디어를 생각해낼 수 있나요?
 그런 다음 우리가 확실히 알고 있는 것이 아니라 발견한 것을 팀에 알려줄 것입니다.
 이거 혼자 하고 나중에 다시 올까?
 그게 당신이 말한 거예요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5529.61s">[Austin]</a>: 네, 중재나 의사소통을 통해 별도로 할 수 있습니다.
 귀하는 프란시스코를 통해 최신 뉴스를 배우고 모든 정부 당국에 다음 단계를 알릴 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5550.323s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 커뮤니티를 만들지 않기 때문에 흥미롭습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5553.764s">[Austin]</a>: 방금 고장났습니다.
 알아요</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5555.664s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 이것이 나를 괴롭힌다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5559.185s">[Austin]</a>: 문제는 공개 회의법이 기술적으로 공개 의견을 요구하지 않는다는 것을 알고 있지만 우리는 그렇게 한다는 것입니다.
 공개 회의 규칙에 따르면 이러한 일은 지난 4년 동안 수백만 번 발생했으며 대중은 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 실시간으로 볼 권리가 있습니다.
 그래서 우리의 목표는 이 모든 것의 균형을 실제로 맞추는 것입니다.
 하지만 저는 사람들이 달성할 수 있는 범위를 이해할 수 있도록 이 특정 가이드를 게시하고 싶습니다.
 물론 이는 정부 기관 내에서 양측 간 정족수가 부족하기 때문인 만큼 모린에게 구체적인 조언을 해줄 예정이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5607.276s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 나는 단지 또 다른 예를 들어보고 싶습니다.
 기억하신다면 지난 달 Diane이 합류했을 때 매사추세츠 인권 연합 회원들로부터 우리 모두는 동일한 메시지를 받았습니다.
 그들은 Zoom 작업을 하고 있습니다.
 다이애나가 혼자 참가했습니다.
 Diana는 위원회에 이메일을 보내지 않았습니다.
 Diana는 Frances에게 참석할 수 있는지 묻지 않았습니다.
 다이애나는 혼자 참석했지만 이렇게 말했습니다.
 임차인. 저를 달력에 올려주실 수 있나요?
 내 경험을 공유하고 싶습니다.
 이는 위원회의 모든 구성원이 수행할 수 있습니다.
 MBTA가 일부 작업을 수행하기 때문에 다른 위원회만큼 외부 회의나 교육 기회가 많지 않습니다.
 이에 더 많은 관심을 기울여야 합니다.
 그래서 제가 찾으면 이메일로 보내드릴 테니 직접 보내셔도 됩니다.
 다른 위원회 구성원과 공유할 가치가 있다고 생각하면 저에게 연락하여 이 항목을 의제에 올려달라고 요청할 것입니다.
 아니면 때때로 그들은 나에게 이렇게 말합니다: 프란시스, 이것을 공유할 수 있나요?
 이번에는 그렇게 하지 않았지만 아마도 내 위원 중 한 명이 그렇게 할 수도 있을 것입니다.
 응답하지 않고 다른 사람을 대신하여 참여할 수 있는 시대입니다.
 이메일.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5692.485s">[Austin]</a>: 여러분 모두가 훈련에 참여하고 싶다면 그렇게 할 수 있다고 생각합니다.
 이는 회의 개최에 관한 법률을 위반하지 않습니다.
 저는 우리 모두가 우리 도시와 지역 사회에 깊은 관심을 갖고 있다고 생각합니다.
 당신에게는 분명히 그렇게 할 권리가 있습니다.
 당신은 그렇게 할 수 있는 수정헌법 제1조의 권리를 가지고 있습니다.
 다른 두 가지 유형이 있습니다
 아시다시피 법은 집회를 금지하지 않습니다.
 아시다시피, 사교 행사나 시내 행사에 참석할 수 있습니다.
 문제는 정부기관 구성원들이 회의 불참 문제를 고려하고 있는지 아시나요?
 그래서 수년에 걸쳐 저는 이 두 사람이 이 사람을 추모하기 위해 공개 행사에 참석하는 것에 대해 셀 수 없이 많은 불평을 보아왔습니다.
 아, 그런데 복도에서 그들이 속삭이는 소리가 들립니다.
 그래서 나는 그들이 회의에서 논의해야 할 몇 가지 사항에 대해 이야기하고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 맞습니까?
 또는 이 사람들이 사교 모임에 참석하고 있는데 마치 그들이 이야기하고 있고 내가 X, Y, Z에 대해 듣고 있는 것 같은데 그런 일이 일어나서는 안 됩니다.
 아, 이것은 아이디어가 아니며 여러분 모두가 직업적, 개인적 수준의 주제에 관심이 있는 회의가 있습니다.
 그러면 할 수 있습니다.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 훈련을 받을 수 있다고 합니다.
 실제 질문은 다음과 같습니다. 귀하는 관할권 밖의 문제를 논의하기 위해 관할권 밖의 회원입니까?
 그래서 나는 그것이 분명한지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 공개 회의 규칙은 사람들의 균형을 최대한 맞추려고 노력합니다.
 좋은 질문입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5795.704s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 고마워요 자넬.
 다른 질문 있으신 분 계신가요?
 위원회에 구성원이 있나요?
 아, 방금 두 사람이 우리와 함께 있는 걸 봤어요.
 시민으로서 공개 집회를 규제하는 법률에 대해 질문이 있습니까?
 포럼 요소는 무엇입니까?
 회의는 언제 취소되나요?
 글쎄요, 손을 드는 사람은 보이지 않네요.
 지금은 709입니다.
 변호사
 오스틴님, 시간을 내어 설명해 주셔서 정말 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5836.195s">[Austin]</a>: 고마워요, 만나서 반가워요.
 소위원회 실무그룹과 저는 상황을 모니터링하겠습니다.
 모두 만나서 반가워요.
 도움이 필요하시면 Frances에게 제 연락처 정보를 남겨주세요.
 궁금한 점이 있으면 언제든지 기꺼이 논의해 드리겠습니다.
 오늘 밤 시간을 내주셔서 감사합니다.
 잘자요
 정말 감사합니다.
 조심하세요
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5854.622s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 당신에게도 같은 일이 일어납니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5855.043s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 알아내야 할 것이 많지만 서류를 얻을 수 있기를 바랍니다. 변호사가 도착하기 전에 서류를 읽어보고 질문이 없는지 확인하는 시간을 가질 것이기 때문입니다.
 하지만 아시다시피, 이 정보를 소화하고 반영하여 우리가 운영하는 방식에 대해 커뮤니티에 더욱 투명하게 공개하도록 노력하십시오.
 우리가 정해진 횟수의 회의만 갖는다거나 그 회의를 끝낼 수 없다는 생각에 사로잡히면, 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없게 만드는 장애물을 우리 내부에 만들어냅니다.
 다시 한번 말씀드리지만, 의제는 모두에게 열려있습니다. 그렇죠?
 누가 어떤 이벤트를 진행하는지 아는 데 세 사람이 필요하지 않습니다.
 프랜시스가 어떤 것에 사로잡혀 있으면 와서 그것을 보고, 그것을 의제에 올리고 조언을 제공할 수 있었습니다.
 그룹 환경에서는 이것이 항상 필요한 것은 아닙니다.
 소위원회와 더 큰 규모의 실무그룹이 필요하다면 사전에 발표하면 더 많은 회의가 필요할 것입니다.
 이는 투명성과 대중 접근성의 문제입니다.
 이 내용이 도움이 되길 바랍니다.
 다른 질문이 있나요?
 아침 7시 30분에 사무실로 달려가야 했기 때문에 시간이 언제인지 알고 싶어서 기다리고 있었습니다.
 그렇지 않으면 우리 봉인은 내일까지 남아 있을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5969.114s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 제가 한마디 해도 될까요?
 이상적인.
 모두 감사합니다.
 아주 좋고 완벽합니다.
 그렇게 생각해요.
 이상적인.
 모두 감사합니다. 오늘 저녁 정말 좋은 모임이었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5982.993s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: 알겠습니다 정말 감사합니다 알겠습니다 감사합니다 이제 녹화 중지 버튼을 눌러 회의를 시작하려고 하는데 그 전에 누군가가 회의를 종료하려면 지연을 요청해야 합니다. 그래서 회의 일정을 다시 잡고 싶습니다. 그럼 누가 이것을 지지하는가?
 고마워요 스티븐.
 정말로 밤을 보내고 싶은 사람이 있나요?
 알았어
 자원봉사자가 보이지 않네요.
 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 모두 감사합니다.
 주목</p>
