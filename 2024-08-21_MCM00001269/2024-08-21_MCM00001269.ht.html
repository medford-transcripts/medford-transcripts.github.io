 Mwen eskize aswè a.
 Mon pe fer fas avek omwen en problenm lapolis e apre mon pou asiste en lot meeting piblik.
 Se konsa, mwen pa ka rete eksepte pou tèt mwen.
 Mwen panse li enpòtan pou omwen asiste nan kòmansman reyinyon aswè a paske mwen gen yon demann.
 Sa a se yon nesesite.
 Mwen te mande yon mosyon pou amande rezolisyon Konsèy Vil Medford yo te apwouve mwa pase a pou sipòte yon sispann tire ki gen rapò ak Izrayèl ak Gaza.
 Si komite sa a vote konsa e pèmèt mwen amande vòt mwen an, mwen pral chèche anile vòt wi mwen epi mete abstansyon mwen an.
 Mwen te panse sou sijè sa a depi mwa pase a, jwenn yon ti kras edike sou sijè a, ak jwenn kèk konpreyansyon klè.
 Dapre mwen, kòm chèf lapolis,
 Mwen pa kapab e mwen pa ta dwe vote sou pwoblèm kominote divizyon tankou anpil politisyen fè jodi a.
 Mon konnen koman sef konstable e manm Komisyon Dwa Imen mon pa toultan kapab evite divizyon politik, me mon devret fer zefor pour reste net.
 Rezon an se ke mwen dwe bay sèvis lapolis, sekirite piblik ak pwoteksyon pou tout manm nan kominote nou an.
 Mon oule kler: mon mosyon, mon mosyon pou demann en lot vot ouswa pou chanje vot, i pa en mosyon ki defye drwa sa Komisyon Dwa Imen pou andose, rezet ouswa fer deklarasyon li menm.
 Men, mwen ka di ke nou tout konnen youn lòt trè byen, anpil nan nou konnen mwen depi sizan.
 Jan nou te diskite yon ti tan nan kesyon sa yo, nou tout kanpe kont rayisman, espesyalman anti-semit ak islamofobi.
 Nan kèk fason, tout moun ki enplike nan komite sa a pwobableman gen santiman pèsonèl ak opinyon pèsonèl ak politik sou tout bagay sa yo.
 Men, mwen jwe yon wòl diferan.
 Yo ka mande m pou mennen ankèt sou krim antisemit ak islamofobi.
 Mwen panse ke li trè, trè enpòtan yo rete net.
 Mon demande ki vòt i ganny konsidere koman en promosyon ekitab e mon senpleman amande mon vòt pou abstenn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=298.692s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Chèf Buckley, mwen jis vle fè li klè ke w ap fè yon mosyon pou chanje vòt ou epi pou w pa vote sou vòt mwa pase a sou sipò Komisyon Dwa Moun oswa andòsman Konsèy Vil la, ok?
 So nou bezwen en lot dimoun pou siport sa mosyon, e si napa okenn sipor, alors ou kapab met li an rikord, Sef.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=324.991s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi, dezyèm.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=336.059s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Wi, li se yon ti jan long van, men mwen panse ke ou tout konnen de sa m ap pale.
 Se konsa, mosyon an chèf Buckley se
 Chanje vòt la nan mwa fevriye, mwen pa sonje dat egzak la, mwen panse se te 14 fevriye, pou chanje vòt la pou abstène sou yon desizyon sou sipò oswa andòsman CDH oswa kèlkeswa sa.
 Mwen pral jwenn tèks la byen.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=459.591s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Thank you, members of the Human Rights Commission.
 My name is Sana Fadel.
 I'm the deputy director at Citizens for Juvenile Justice.
 We are a statewide organization, a statewide policy organization that advocates for young people who are at risk of or with legal system involvement.
 We do our work statewide, and I appreciate being able to meet with you all on this.
 So I'm actually here asking for your support or endorsement of legislation that deals with youth justice reforms called Raise the Age.
 It is a legal system reform, but I do want to talk about it because it's both an economic and racial justice issue.
 So this is the bill.
 It's a bill that was filed by Rep.
 O'Day from West Boylston, Rep.
 Cruz from Salem, and Senator Friendly from Lynn.
 This bill is currently pending in the Judiciary Committee, and what it does, it ends the automatic prosecution of a teenager, older teens, as adults, and moves them into the juvenile justice system.
 So I'm just gonna give you a little bit of background on why we even have this campaign.
 This campaign started several years ago, because when we looked at issues of recidivism in Massachusetts, what we saw was that young people have the highest recidivism rate of any age group.
 So when we talk about recidivism, there's different decision points that young people come back to the system on.
 So we look at two specific ones.
 One is rearrangement, which means you come in, you've been convicted of another crime, you've served your time, and now you're back in court again and you have a totally new crime.
 That's the rearrangement.
 The second one is reconviction.
 That means you've come out of the incarceration, you've come out and you have a totally new crime and you've been found guilty of it.
 So when we looked at this, we say, what is our legal system doing with young people?
 So we have two systems.
 One is our juvenile system, which if a young person between the ages of 12 up to 17, right before their 18th birthday, if they're in conflict with the law, they would be part of the juvenile justice system.
 If they're 18 and over, they wouldn't be in adult criminal justice system.
 This data looks at,
 kids who have, young people who have been incarcerated, because that's the deepest end of the system.
 Every point of the legal system says, are you someone that we want to keep out of society because of a crime you've been alleged to commit?
 And, you know, from the point of arrest all the way to sentencing, that's the question it asks.
 So all of these young people have been incarcerated.
 The legal system says, yes, we found you liable.
 We're going to incarcerate you.
 So what are we buying with that legal system, right?
 We're looking at do young people come out better off, less likely to commit crime.
 And what I want to show you here is when we look at teenagers, we're doing two very different systems have two very different outcomes.
 So our juvenile system does serve the incarceration quite does serve young people up until the 21st birthday.
 So there is some overlap.
 The data isn't perfect because we're looking at 18 to 24 versus 21 and under.
 However, overall, when we look at recidivism, young people coming out of the adult system are almost like a one and a half times more likely to be rearranged and more than double the likelihood to be reconvicted.
 I'm hyper on this because
 those are all the same young people.
 They're all adolescents, especially when they're talking about anybody under the age of 21, by pediatric standards, they're all adolescents.
 Well, not up to that age.
 But we have two very, so their development is the same, their offense, what they get arrested for is the same.
 Everything about them is the same, except how do we interact with them as a society?
 And that's what this campaign is about.
 So when we look at young people,
 that age group, like the 18 to 20 year olds is really the heart of this campaign.
 These are young people who would be in high school or they'd be just starting in college.
 Their brains, everything in their life is designed to learn.
 So wherever you put them, they're gonna learn that environment they're in.
 So if you put them in environments that are more toxic, that prevent them from meeting developmental milestones, you're actually increasing the likelihood of them re-offending.
 So things like, you know,
 is our intervention likely to help them or derail them from getting a job, having a family, getting a home, or having stable housing, finishing education, all of those things, if we put barriers to those, we're more likely to have them come back for totally new crime.
 And this is supported by research.
 So this pathway to desistance study came out of,
 It was housed in the University of Pittsburgh, but several universities were involved across the country.
 They tracked 1,300 young people.
 All of them were adolescents.
 Every single one of them committed a serious or violent offense.
 And they did monthly check-ins with them for a seven-year period.
 And they asked the question, why do some of these young people with these offenses desist from crime?
 And why do some of them persist in crime?
 And by the nature of the study, the offense itself is not, the severity of this offense itself is not an indicator of future offending, which is one of the things, you know, our laws are like the more serious offense, the higher the risk that you're presented to society.
 This, just the premise of the study says, it's actually not the case.
 And this is what they look for.
 They look for serious offense, how often they offended, socioeconomic status, education, housing, income, substance use, mental health,
 race, geography, family status, like everything you can possibly think of.
 And they found not a single one of them had an impact on future funding.
 Only two things did.
 The first was the belief in the legitimacy of authority.
 And the second is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 I will translate those into English.
 The first one is, do you believe that whenever you do something, that you have some kind of control of what happens to you?
 That the person in authority is going to treat you in what you perceive as fair?
 That means, every time I go to the store, will I always be followed?
 You know what?
 It doesn't matter.
 I've been labeled as a criminal regardless of my behavior.
 That is a risk factor of having someone re-effect.
 So when you say, and I've seen this play out in the young people I work with, they do not, it's not, it's less likely of how harsh the punishment was or the consequence was.
 It's the was, did I get it, was it fair?
 So if it was, if I perceived it as fair, even if it was harsh,
 I will say those young people are much more likely to start reoffending because, you know what, I knew I took that risk and I got what I deserved.
 That's what this means.
 So when we do all this work around racial justice and the criminal justice system, it is not just because it's ethical and moral and the right thing to do, it is also a public safety measure in our legal system.
 The second piece which is relevant for this bill is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 So do you have any children or adolescents in your lifetime?
 It means as a baby, can you feed yourself?
 Can you talk?
 Can you walk?
 Can you do full paragraphs?
 When it comes to adolescents, can you have judgment?
 Can you think before you act and think about the consequences?
 Those are all things that young people develop gradually over time.
 And what the researchers found was if the intervention itself blocks a young person's ability to meet those developmental milestones, they're much more likely to persist in crime.
 The likelier they are to meet those developmental milestones on time, the much sooner they will desist from re-offending.
 And those things that young people need to meet developmental milestones are education, employment or skills,
 family connection, physical or mental health, and civic and social engagement.
 So when we look at these systems, this is what we're looking at.
 Those systems, when you're in the adult system, you have a quarry.
 That's a huge barrier to education and employment.
 There's no impact, there is, unlike the juvenile system that looks at education as a priority, education in the adult system is pretty rare when it comes to this age population.
 Family connections, sorry, you're 18, you're on your own, there's no role for family, where even if you're under 21 in the juvenile system, family always has a role.
 Civic engagement, part of the education, our K through 12 frameworks include civic engagement.
 That is the kind of, if you're in DYS, that framework is in the education in DYS.
 So when we're talking about this, that's what we're talking about intervention.
 And in addition, it's also a racial justice issue.
 So this is looking at incarceration.
 Again, the data, we have pretty decent data in the juvenile system.
 Our adult system data is pretty lacking.
 So I try to do the best we can.
 This is looking at rates of incarceration between white men and boys compared to black men and boys.
 We have data on Latino kids.
 The federal data does not exist in a usable way.
 That's the only reason I only look at that.
 But when we look at this, we see that racial disparities for our 18 and 19-year-olds is the highest of any age group.
 And that's something that's consistent across the country, not just in Massachusetts.
 When we look at this one, we know that our legal system, and we're not saying our juvenile justice system is great, right?
 The difference is,
 Our juvenile justice system has both federal and state requirements to reduce racial disparities.
 So we measure it.
 It's still not fixed, right?
 Not gonna say it's there, but the requirement does not exist anywhere in the adult system.
 So when we look at these disparities, we have disparities where it's not just the over-representation and the sheer number, it's the collateral consequences
 that the class is falling disproportionately falling on young men of color.
 So it means you have a system that is less developmentally appropriate.
 So you don't get what you need to mature and get reintegrate back fully into society.
 The focus on punishment and rather than development means you don't get those skills as you mature.
 And then you have the collateral consequences that are pretty severe.
 So there are collateral consequences to juvenile adjudications as well as adult convictions.
 However, the adult conviction collateral consequences are much more significant and many of them are mandatory.
 So no matter what, you have those collateral consequences stick no matter what.
 And then when I talk about this as an economic justice issue, I'm assuming many of you know about, every sector I talk about,
 That we have a labor crisis, we have a labor crisis.
 That's always been the case.
 The labor crisis has actually been, and I was following what economists have been saying, they've been raising that flag at least 2016, 2017, so before COVID.
 What they said in Massachusetts, we have a rate of baby boomers retiring at a higher rate than young people entering into our workforce.
 COVID just made it worse.
 And the recovery from COVID, we just have not been able, there's been some recovery, but we haven't been able to get back to where we were before, where that crisis has been a long time in the coming.
 So the arguments are, first, let's talk about the young person themselves.
 If a young person is involved in an adult system,
 where it does not look at their education and having a quarry limits your ability to get a job.
 That limits that young person's own lifetime earnings potential.
 If you look at it from the labor market, when we say all of these young people are less likely to contribute to our labor market, that means our businesses are not able to hire.
 We have a labor shortage that we say, we need more young people.
 except those young people, right?
 You're not, we think those are, and this is, they're just not going to be part of the equation.
 They're not part of the denominator.
 And then when we do that, we're basically saying that group
 So every generation, we have a cohort of young people that just have a lifetime exclusion from fully integrating into our society.
 And that means us as a commonwealth don't benefit from their economic participation in our economy.
 And ultimately, our legal system is not an equal opportunity employer.
 We talked about the fact that the legal system targets low-income communities and communities of color disproportionately.
 That means when you look at where young people are excluded from our economy, excluded from our education and employment opportunities, they tend to be concentrated in those same communities that they come from, which means those communities, the economic potential of those communities is also diminished.
 And then finally,
 Going back to my first slide, we have a potential of reducing crime if we deal with young people in a developmentally appropriate way.
 Reducing crime also means we're also benefiting our taxpayers as a whole.
 We have less people who are victimized and require some kind of repair.
 Our legal system is not going to be as, you know, having all the workings of the legal system, we just won't have as much if we have,
 Again, it's not a criminal justice panacea, I'm not solving everything, but for those young people, shrinking that potential has an economic impact.
 And just conclude with just the thought that this is not new.
 I actually wanna say that our legal system is far behind the rest of our society in looking at young people under the age of 21 as adolescents.
 I started off by talking about pediatrics.
 Pediatricians work with young people
 under 21 and up to 21 and maybe sometimes older, depending on their medical needs, that's been going on for a long, long time.
 You can't drink, you can't smoke pot or smoke tobacco or gamble or own a gun or be a police officer until you're 21.
 There's also all sorts of other milestones because
 You can start a job at 14, you can get your driver's license at 16, but with lots of limitations until you're 18.
 But you can pre-register to vote because we want you to vote by 18.
 But then all these other things we want to delay.
 You can't rent a car until you're 25.
 You can be on your parents' health insurance until 26.
 Because our society does not have a hard line of adults.
 we have a transition to adulthood, which means things that we want young people to grow up and make up into a habit into your adulthood, we want to encourage you to do more of that younger.
 The younger you are, the more likely you're going to stick.
 Things that are a risk to yourself or to others, which we believe legal system involvement is one of those, we want to delay so that when you are more mature, you can make those decisions and it's less likely to stick.
 So, I'm just going to end with just what I would love for this commission to consider ways of supporting.
 So, like this is legislation that's out there.
 I shared ahead of time fact sheets about this legislation, but there's many things that you could do to support.
 And just so you know, I've been trying to meet with all the human rights commissions across the state, and some of them are able to endorse, and some of them are like, oh, we're part of the state government, we can, but there's other ways to support.
 So these are all just ideas of things you can do if this is something you want to support.
 They could go from formal endorsement to we'll just make some connections or we'll publicize it to let our constituents know or our residents know about it.
 But without us, depending on, or we can say yes, we'll support it.
 We'll send our legislators a letter in support.
 It's really up to you all.
 So I just want to thank you for this opportunity.
 This is my contact information and I would love to open up to any questions.

 Koulye a, nou vle devlope pwochen estrateji nou an, ak plan estratejik aktyèl nou an se alantou sekirite lojman.
 Se konsa, tout bagay sa yo te toujou la epi li ap bati chak ane.
 Men, yon filozofi pozitif devlopman jèn te vin yon pati nan sistèm jistis jivenil nou an.
 Mwen pa sèlman pale de DYS, pwobasyon, tribinal, defansè piblik, ak avoka distri.
 Tout moun gade adolesan epi yo di: Travay nou se ede yo gen matirite.
 I annan bann lorganizasyon parey nou, akoz nou bezwen defann pou fer sir ki nou rann sa bann lenstitisyon responsab pou atenn sa bann lobzektif.
 Men, omwen sa yo se objektif yo.
 Se konsa, nou gen eksperyans e nou gen kapasite a.
 Koulye a, gen yon kesyon sou nimewo.
 Pwojè lwa a li menm pa kouvri tout moun ki gen laj 18 a 20 an menm tan.
 Premyèman, objektif nou an se 18 an.
 Sa a se yon nimewo ki pi piti.
 Sistèm nan te devlope ak rekonesans ke kèk finansman ka bezwen transfere soti nan sistèm adilt nan sistèm nan jèn yo sèvi jèn 19-ane ak evantyèlman 20-zan.
 Sa a se modèl ki fèt nan Vermont.
 Vermont se sèl eta jiskaprezan pou ogmante laj plis pase 18 an.
 Apati 2020, yo gen 18-ane-fin vye granmoun epi yo espere enkli yo ete sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1710.314s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1714.818s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Mèsi Sana.
 Oke, Rob, si w ka tande m.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1720.262s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mwen genyen ou.
 Mèsi.
 Ak ekskiz pou odyo etranj ki anwo a.
 Ou te reponn youn nan kesyon mwen yo.
 Lòt eta oswa kominote yo te aplike politik sa yo avèk siksè.
 Li bon pou w konnen youn nan vwazen ki pi pre nou yo ap fè yon bagay konsa, paske sa a se vre yon pwoblèm ak chanjman trè enpòtan.
 Pou sa, li te mansyone kèk fason diferan nou ka ede w defann epi montre sipò nou.
 Mwen panse w ap pale de yon andòsman fòmèl oswa yon lèt bay yon moun nan Lejislati a.
 Èske w gen nenpòt resous ki disponib ki montre diferan opsyon sa yo pou eksprime sipò ak defans?
 Si yo egziste, èske nou posede yo oswa nou gen aksè a yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1768.653s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Se konsa, Francis, ou gen pager sa a, dwa, ak deklarasyon enpak ekonomik la sou li?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1773.738s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Wi, mwen gen yon pager.
 An reyalite, mwen te vle mande si prezantasyon sa a ta ka disponib paske li ta bon pou mete l nan pwosedi nou yo kòm nou gen moun ki ta ka koute nan yon fason diferan e ki ka enterese nan li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1793.786s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Mwen kontan anpil.
 Mwen pral kontan voye yon vèsyon PDF nan PowerPoint sa a pita.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1797.288s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Oke, sa ta bon.
 Mèsi anpil.
 Lè sa a, mwen pral jwenn PDF la.
 Map voye yon vèsyon bay tout komisyonè yo e mwen kwè komisyonè yo deja gen premye paj la.
 Mwen ka poste li ankò si ou pa deja.
 Èske w gen nenpòt lòt kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1820.503s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Mwen abitye avèl.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1823.938s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Mèsi anpil Sanna.
 Mwen apresye sa.
 Mwen pral kontakte ou.
 Mèsi anpil tout moun.
 Mwen vrèman apresye ou.
 Mèsi.
 Tout se byen.
 atansyon.
 Tout se byen.
 Kidonk, èske nou pral tounen kote nou te rate?
 Yo dwe fè yon mosyon pou apwouve minit reyinyon fevriye 2024 la.
 Epi yon moun dwe sipòte l.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1862.174s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Mosyon pou aprouve minit rankont mwa pase a.
 Gen yon dezyèm youn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1870.16s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Maureen te vin dezyèm?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1873.082s">[Unidentified]</a>: Wi, sa kòrèk.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1878.977s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Trè bon, fantastik.
 Se konsa, jis yon vòt rapid kounye a.
 Diane, wi, non oswa abstrenn?
 Jis yon apèl rapid pou jwenn apwouve.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1893.07s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Oh, rele, wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1895.852s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Wi, oke.
 Stephen?
 viv.
 Oh, sa enteresan, Maureen.
 Gen de nan nou e youn nan nou an reta.
 Youn nan nou ap mache epi lòt la chita deja.
 Men, li pa enpòtan, wi oswa non, nenpòt moun ki Maureen ye.
 Immacula ak Rob, èske ou aksepte oswa ou pa aksepte minit reyinyon fevriye a?
 viv.
 Oke, mèsi Rob.
 San defo?
 Wi, tout bagay anfòm, mèsi.
 Mèsi.
 Tout se byen.
 Ansuit sou ajanda a, Diane, w ap mande yon notè pou l ede w ranpli minit reyinyon mas ak avril ou.
 Mwen te kòmanse pran kèk nòt pou mwa mas, kidonk mwen pral fini li.
 Èske gen yon espesyalis ki ka ede ak dosye yo pou avril?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1972.214s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Petèt mwen pa kapab asiste reyinyon avril mwen pral pale w la.
 Se konsa, mwen pa t 'kapab volontè fè sa paske mwen pwobableman pa ta dwe isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1983.321s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: OK
 Pou teste.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1987.984s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Tout se byen.
 Mèsi, Stephen.
 Mèsi, Stephen.
 Mèsi, Stephen.
 Wi.
 Dakò, Sian, se lè w tcheke kalandriye w la.
 Padon, mwen pa t retire kalandriye a nan katab la.
 ou genyen li?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2008.932s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Oh byen.
 Mwen deja gen li louvri, kidonk mwen pral klike sou pataje ekran epi ouvri dosye Pawòl mwen an.
 Tanpri tann yon ti moman.
 Èske tout moun ka wè sa?
 Non.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2025.218s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Non, ou gen yon chans pataje li?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2028.241s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Mwen pa gen okenn lide.
 Ah, mwen te panse mwen te pouse bouton an.
 Oh non, li di lame a te enfim pataje ekran, padon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2033.926s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Trè bon, eseye li kounye a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2041.673s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Pafè.
 Oke, ou ka wè li kounye a?
 Wi.
 Kòm yon rezilta, nou te planifye yon selebrasyon nan Belinda ak fanmi wayal la ak Senzara pandan Mwa Istwa Fanm nan pita nan mwa sa a.
 Yo dwe onèt, mwen te yon ti kras anba dlo.
 Sa a se moman ki pi okipe mwen nan travay.
 Mwen te rankontre tou Kiera Singleton, ki te gen anpil bagay pou li.
 Si w te swiv nouvèl la, w ap dekouvri ke yo te rekrite li pou sèvi nan Gwoup Travay Reparasyon Vil Boston.
 Se konsa, li te trè okipe.
 Nou ap diskite sou chanje 19 jen an yon jou fèt piblik nan mwa jen.
 19 jen se Mèkredi.
 Se konsa, ou vle òganize evènman sa a?
 Li vrèman anfòm trè byen ak emansipasyon, men tou ak istwa esklavaj nou an nan Nò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2112.908s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Se konsa, pou klarifye, Diane, nou pa gen tout pouvwa a, fanmi wa a se, dwa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2118.531s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Se sa nou ye... se sa nou ye, pa vre?
 Menm jan ak evènman nou te fè fevriye pase a pou Mwa Istwa Nwa a, Frances, mwen pa konnen si mwen te itilize bon mo a, donk santi yo lib pou korije mwen paske pafwa, mwen te panse ane pase a, se te yon patnè oswa yon sponsor?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2140.324s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Fondamantalman, HRC a pral travay ak fanmi wa a pou òganize evènman an.
 Mwen ka di w kounye a ke byenke dat sa a ka sanble gwo, West Medford Community Center pral selebre Juneteenth nan jou sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen rekòmande
 Sove evènman an pou ane pwochèn oswa yon lòt dat paske vil la pral leve drapo Juneteenth jou anvan an paske Juneteenth se yon jou fèt piblik.
 Se yon wont ke Sant Kominotè West Medford la ak fanmi wayal la bò lari a kote nou ta ka gen patenarya twa-fason sa a epi pase jounen an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2201.163s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Se 18 jen.
 Èske li posib si nou òganize evènman sa a pandan jou fèt 19 la?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2208.995s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Jou ferye aktyèl la se yon jou ki òganize pa West Medford Community Center.
 oh.
 Jou anvan an se jou vil la te leve drapo Juneteenth li.
 Oh byen.
 Nou te leve drapo a jou avan paske vil la te fèmen jou sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2229.481s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Bon, mwen konprann.
 èske w konnen ki lè evènman yo nan West Medford Community Center yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2238.442s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Mwen pa konnen kounye a, men li pral yon gwo bagay.
 Ankò, mwen trè rekòmande pa mete l nan menm jou a.
 Wi, yo ap planifye pou fè sa... Mwen pa vle bay twòp ale paske li poko mete nan wòch.
 Ou konnen, se tout yon pati nan konvèsasyon an ke nou dwe fè asire w ke aktivite nou yo konplete youn ak lòt epi yo pa vin ...
 Tankou, mwen panse ke li pral yon jou long.
 Mwen panse ke li ta yon apremidi, pwobableman 12 a 4pm, ki se tan an yo anjeneral fè, wi.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2277.577s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Kidonk mwen pral pale ak Kiara e petèt pral gen yon lòt pivot oswa nou pral kenbe l 'jouk ane pwochèn.
 Èske tout moun anfòm?
 sètènman.
 Kisa ou panse, Francisco?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2292.471s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Mwen vle di, mwen devine se ou.
 Mwen sipòte pouse li pou ane pwochèn oswa petèt gen yon lòt selebrasyon nan fen ane a, ou konnen, sa ta dwe apwopriye.
 byen.
 Petèt nan kèk jou enpòtan, sa a pral aplike.
 Mwen pral oblije gade nan kalandriye nasyonal jodi a pou fè kèk sijesyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2324.62s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Yeah, donk ann ranje tout bagay.
 Se konsa, petèt mwen pral mete ajou nan pwochen reyinyon an.
 Donk, mèsi nou tout.
 Paske moun vrèman renmen li.
 Wi, wi, egzakteman.
 Trè bon, gwo.
 Se konsa, lòt eleman nan kalandriye sa a trè senp, Avril, gen Jounen Latè, ak Lè sa a, Frances, mwen te ajoute tout seri Black Health k ap vini nan kalandriye sa a soti nan Medford Public Library.
 Se sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2366.195s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Oke, gwo, mèsi anpil, Diane.
 Mwen jis vle asire w ke tout komisyonè yo ap voye yon kalite siyal ke yo dakò anile tanporèman diskisyon an nan evènman an Belinda Sutton nan mwa jen.
 Kòman nou ye tout?
 Natirèlman, wi.
 Lè sa a, bon
 Se konsa, Diana ak Frances, nou pral konsidere lòt dat.
 Mwen pral pataje kèk sijesyon epi voye yo bay ekip la pou yo pare pou reyinyon avril la.
 Paske sonje, ou ale an vakans apre reyinyon jen an epi ou pa tounen jiskaske septanm.
 Oke, Maureen, mwen panse mwen gen twa minit anvan Avoka Austin vin jwenn nou.
 Lè sa a, mwen pral mennen w pou w pale de FYÈTE.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2441.175s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi, se aktyèlman yon ti eleman.
 Nan dènye reyinyon an, yo te jis mansyone ke nou te patisipe nan patwone yon evènman Pride nan tan lontan an.
 Mwen kirye kisa sa ye.
 Mwen pa ka jwenn anyen nan kalandriye vil la oswa mwen jis ap eseye jwenn enfòmasyon sou li.
 Mwen pa konnen si yon moun te konnen se sèl admisyon mwen nan moman an.
 Li te sanble tankou yon bagay ki lojik patisipe.
 Men, mwen pa fè okenn sijesyon.
 Li ka twò ta pou eseye fè anyen ane sa a.
 Èske gen moun ki gen eksperyans ak sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2474.619s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Se poutèt sa, HRC pa patwone evènman Pride.
 An 2022, lè vil la te òganize premye evènman konsèy anyèl li a, Komisyon Dwa Moun te chwazi de manm pou ekri yon deklarasyon pou li nan seremoni leve drapo Pride la.
 Sa te apre kèk negosyasyon, kidonk mwen panse ou ka tounen.
 Mwen vle di Avril, Avril, Avril 2022.
 ak foto nan reyinyon Me 2022 la.
 Gade, men sa a se reyèlman jis yon pati nan yon seri oratè pandan leve drapo a.
 Sa a se yon bagay CDH ka reflechi sou.
 Si CDH vle yon pi gwo pati, si CDH vle yon pati ki pi piti.
 Men, sonje, lè ou di patwone, sa vle di ou aktyèlman ap fè yon bagay.
 kidonk sa vle di
 Ou ap achte manje.
 Se konsa, aji kòm si manje midi a patwone pa HRC oswa ou ap òganize evènman an.
 Se konsa, sa a separe.
 Men, si CDH enterese patisipe nan evènman leve drapo a, ou ka diskite epi fè m konnen ki jan ou anvizaje patisipasyon w la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2569.347s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Youn nan bagay mwen te chèche men pa t 'jwenn nan kalandriye vil ane sa a se yon mansyone nan vil la.
 Aktivite kontinyèl.
 Ki kote mwen ka jwenn sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2581.437s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Ou p ap jwenn li nan kalandriye a paske mwen travay orè majistra a ak Pride se yon samdi ane sa a, sa ki fè li pi difisil toujou.
 Mwa Fyète kòmanse nan Samdi.
 Kidonk, si majistra pa la, Meri a fèmen samdi, epi ou konnen li pi difisil pou leve drapo a samdi.
 Mwen renmen tou anpil objektif.
 Avèk evènman sa yo.
 Se pa sèlman moun ki reyini ansanm.
 Ou konnen, dwe gen yon objektif ak yon siyifikasyon.
 Se konsa, mwen konekte ak diferan moun dèyè sèn nan.
 Yon fwa mwen jwenn yon dat dakò nan men majistra a ki pral disponib nan jou sa a, nan moman sa a, nan yon sèten kantite tan, kounye a mwen dwe konekte tout lòt pwen yo dèyè sèn nan epi deplase yo epi chanje yo anvan nou ka di, oke, sa a se yon fèm "wi."
 Men, mwen ka di pou asire w, epi mwen jis di, vil la pa ap chèche prezève evènman Pride Flag Day la epi kenbe l jiska 31 mas.
 Ou konnen, sa a son, ou konnen, sa a son sòt, men gen lòt moun deyò nan gwoup sa yo.
 Sa a se ekip DPW mwen an.
 Mwen dwe asire yo ke yo pare, ke siy yo, penti a pa dekale, ke yo te repentire, ke nou gen nouvo penti, epi ke yon moun mete siy sa yo premye bagay nan maten.
 Se konsa, gen anpil bagay k ap pase dèyè sèn yo anvan dat sa a parèt nan imèl la.
 Mwen vle di, li nan kalandriye a.
 Mwen pa konnen ki jan vil sa a te fè li anvan.
 Mwen pa gen okenn lide.
 Men, se konsa li te travay nan de ane ki sot pase yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2686.885s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Se konsa, mwen devine sa mwen vle fè.
 Konsèy nou an se pwobableman pa ane sa a.
 Li sanble anpil.
 Mwen pa konnen, nan radyo mwen pa t 'kapab konprann, petèt mwen ta di, si ajans sa a ka fè yon bagay ane pwochèn, sa ta dwe gwo, epi Lè sa a, si nou kapab, si li twò ta ane sa a oswa mwen pa sèten sa k ap pase, li sanble trè ensèten.
 Nou kapab.
 Mwen te panse, ann fè yon bagay tèt nou.
 Nou pa oblije fè sa nan paramèt vil la.
 Se konsa, mwen jis sijere kòlèg mwen yo ke sa a se aktyèlman yon bagay ke nou ap gade epi nou ta ka fè ane pwochèn, si nou ap gade nan lòt òganizasyon san bi likratif oswa mwen pa konnen si nenpòt moun ki enterese.
 Map gade poum wè si tout moun enterese reyalize yon bagay ansanm.
 Tout bagay sa yo santi tankou, ou konnen, kounye a li santi mwen pa sèten.
 Yon ti jan tankou lè nou ap eseye pwograme yon bagay, kowòdone tout lòt gwoup yo, ou konnen, li se yon pi gwo defi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2748.939s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Yon moun... Yeah, Maureen, mwen aktyèlman pa sèten ki sa vrè kesyon an ye.
 Ou se, paske ou te di bagay yo sanble ap moute nan lè a.
 Mwen jis vle fè konnen seremoni leve drapo ke vil la ap òganize depi dezan pa fèt.
 Sa rive vre.
 Alor mon oule fer sir ki sa i tre, tre kler avan nou get bann dimoun ki pe ekoute e ki petet pe ekoute dan lezot fason.
 Rezon ki fè ou poko wè dat la se paske li tonbe nan yon wikenn ane sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen te oblije chanje estrateji mwen an.
 Men, Komisyon Dwa Moun akeyi anpil A. Fè yon bagay tèt ou,
 Ale nan evènman vil yo tankou ou te fè nan tan lontan an oswa sipòte lòt bezwen?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2808.045s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Oke, mwen jis mande kòlèg mwen yo si yo ta enterese nan fè yon bagay pwòp yo ane pwochèn.
 Mwen pa konnen si gen, oswa petèt, ou konnen, mwen jis,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2822.128s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: Mwen ka jwe, wi, donk mwen panse si se leve drapo a kòm yon moun ane sa a epi apre ane pwochèn, wi, ap chèche yon bagay, yon lòt opòtinite pou travay ansanm, nou ka sètènman wè si sa devlope ane pwochèn. Maureen, mwen ouvè a sa e mwen dakò avèk ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2848.726s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mwen panse ke li ta bon si nou ta ka patisipe nan nenpòt fason ane sa a, yon fwa sa a klè, tankou yon lè espesifik, lè oswa kèlkeswa sa.
 Oke, gwo.
 Mon ti a kontan travay lo sa ki nou kapab fer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2865.912s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi, mwen konplètman sipòte lide pou ede òganize evènman sa a ane sa a ak ane kap vini an.
 Si mwen sonje byen, Frances, mwen panse ke ane pase a,
 Ou gen plizyè evènman planifye pandan tout mwa jen nan vil la pou selebre Fyète, pa vre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2886.887s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Wi.
 Nan 2022 ak 2023, Pride pral yon selebrasyon ki dire yon mwa.
 Fyète selebre nan mwa jen, men Fyète se aktyèlman yon bagay Oktòb, ki se poukisa kèk eta selebre Fyète nan mwa Oktòb.
 Se konsa, sa a pi pwofon pase jis leve yon drapo.
 Gen yon eleman dwa sivil nan sa a.
 Si mwen rete fidèl ak wòl mwen ak travay pwofesyonèl mwen, sa se gwo.
 Mwen rekonèt mouvman dwa sivil la.
 Dèyè sa a se fyète ak dwa moun ki andikape yo,
 Ou tout konekte nan yon fason, fòm, oswa fòm.
 Kidonk, lè nou fè yon evènman ki dire yon mwa, li enpòtan pou mwen ke yon bagay rive pandan mwa sa a.
 Li pa nesesèman vle di ou dwe fè tout aktivite, men menm si nou fè yon kalandriye ki, ou konnen, montre ak bay moun opsyon pou diferan bagay k ap pase nan 02155, mwen panse ke sa a an sante tou.
 Sa ta itil pou moun k ap rekipere anba chòk manm kominote LGBTQ yo te koze, oswa pou moun ki panse yo vle viv nan Meksik, pa vre?
 Depi mwen la, dezan sa yo, chak fwa, ou konnen, yon bagay rive omwen chak semèn, si se pa de fwa pa semèn.
 Men, mwen pa, mwen pa responsab pou chak youn nan yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2986.869s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Premye ane a wi, men dezyèm ane a...Mwen panse se la mwen vle ye, pa jis leve drapo a.
 Se pa ke vole drapo a pa fre, men mwen mande si gwoup sa a ta enterese nan, ou konnen,
 Ann wè ki lòt bagay nou ta ka fè jen pwochen.
 Mwen panse ke omwen kèk moun te di yo te enterese.
 Lè sa a, sa ta gwo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3013.797s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Mete sa sou ajanda a.
 M ap di l epi w ap mete l sou kalandriye w.
 Mwen pral mete l nan pak la pou li kontinye vire.
 Men, avoka Austin yo avèk nou kounye a, e mwen ta renmen voye apèl la bay avoka Austin yo nan KP Law.
 Pou revize lwa reyinyon ouvè yo ak diskisyon sou menm sijè a, tout moun ta dwe resevwa dokiman 48 paj sou lwa reyinyon ouvè yo.
 Se konsa, mwen espere ou te gen kesyon ou yo pare, wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3057.75s">[Austin]</a>: 谢谢大家今晚邀请我来这里。
 也谢谢你，弗朗西斯科。
 很高兴见到大家。
 我认为这是一个好机会。
 如您所知，有一位新的代理总检察长，总检察长办公室最近更新了公开会议的法律指南。
 我始终认为，对已经服务了一段时间的会员和新会员进行一点复习是个好主意，只需向他们提供公开会议法的基础知识即可。
 在全州范围内，我们看到对公开会议法的质疑和投诉有所增加。
 我这样说是为了让每个人真正了解我们所生活的环境，尤其是在一个依靠技术的使用而蓬勃发展的环境中。
 我在与英联邦各城镇的公开会议中处理许多法律事务，自 2006 年以来一直从事这项工作。我希望这是一次真正非正式的会议，能够回答任何人的问题。
 我当然可以提供一个概述，而且我知道弗朗西斯科也分发了一些材料。
 我总是按照时间顺序开始并思考公开培训会议或概述。
 会议通知经会议纪要批准后予以公布。
 这就是我对连续体的看法。
 因此，我们收到警告，我们知道，像您这样的公共机构的法定人数所讨论的任何事情通常都必须在我们所谓的公开会议上完成，而不是在执行会议上，这意味着向公众开放，以便能够看到您的工作。
 实时。
 当我们今晚在这里时，这可以在 Zoom 上完成。
 这可以亲自完成。
 我们将四年前于 2020 年开始的远程订单延长至 2025 年 3 月 31 日。
 我们相信还有许多悬而未决的立法，这些立法将从这些立法中得到扩展。
 有很多谈判。
 必须采取哪些流程来继续这一工作。
 这就是为什么我们正在密切监视它，并将随时向您通报最新情况。
 但现在我们可以在 Zoom 上见面。
 我们从议程开始。
 所有事情都必须纳入议程，并在讨论内容方面具有合理的具体性。
 这意味着什么？
 嗯，这意味着坐在家里的公众会拿起或查看屏幕上的会议通知并进行实际分析。
 我想参加这个会议吗？
 这是我想感兴趣的话题吗？
 我想看到关于这个特定主题的公开、透明的讨论吗？
 所以我总是说，当你在社区工作或做志愿者时，你了解所使用的语言或缩写词，例如所使用的语言，但我们真的很想成为这样的人，你知道。
 向公众提供信息，以便他们可以自行决定是否参与。
 这些是会议通知的基础知识。
 我们知道，除非有紧急情况，否则需要提前48个工作小时发布，真正确保在公共机构的业务方面没有不发布的讨论。
 这是会议通知的概述。
 然后我们开始商议并在会议上讨论什么。
 我们知道没有理由参加执行会议，我很乐意回答有关此问题的任何问题。
 我们知道，公共机构的事务必须在公开会议上进行。
 这意味着公共机构的任何法定人数都不能以团体或系列的形式，从一个成员到另一个成员讨论问题。
 在正式公布的会议之外。
 如果我们退一步，公共记录法和公开会议法的目的是，你知道，我们称它们为太阳能法，以提高透明度并确保公众知道他们的社区正在发生什么。
 从这个意义上说，随着技术的使用，我们看到了增长。
 我总是警告这只是一个概述，所以今晚我们不会详细讨论。
 但我始终警告不要使用电子邮件、手机或短信与其他成员交流。
 根据公开会议法和公共记录法，这都具有法律意义。
 所以只是要意识到这一点。
 在这一具体问题上，我们从总检察长的开放政府部门得到了很多指导。
 包括多年前的许多裁决，这些裁决规定，一个成员向另一个成员发送电子邮件或短信，然后对其进行回复，无论是连续还是在正确发布的会议之外以小组形式再次回复，都可能构成审议。
 所以这是需要注意的事情。
 在投票和讨论方面，我们知道公共机构的业务是由公共机构的法定人数进行的。
 如果没有法定人数，这项业务肯定无法完整开展。
 总检察长办公室建议，如果没有达到法定人数，则不应举行会议并推迟到公共机构法定人数可以开会和召开的其他时间，无论是亲自还是远程，无论委员会的偏好如何。
 从那里我们知道会议纪要必须及时编写和批准。
 我们通常说这会在接下来的 30 天或三次会议中发生，根据您的会议安排以先到者为准。
 但当然，就像会议通知或议程一样，您必须小心，确保坐在家里的人得到会议纪要的副本并真正了解发生了什么。
 我们知道你必须有一些基本信息，你知道的，会议的日期和时间，出席或缺席的成员。
 如果会议是远程会议，则必须采用唱名表决方式，并且将进行所有投票。
 再说一次，有人，我称之为四角规则，有人记录会议记录，真正了解投票了哪些票，做了什么，你知道，有人知道会议中实际发生了什么吗？
 从那时起，这些会议记录将受到公开会议法和公共记录法的约束。
 社区成员当然可以提出要求。
 如果有执行会议，则这些会议记录有单独的流程。
 但同样，它们的起草方式必须精确而详细。
 我很高兴回答任何细节。
 我知道这是一次公开会议。
 这就是为什么我总是说我们所处的位置仅供一般信息参考。
 如果您对我们在哪里担任市议员有具体问题，我只是要求您直接或通过弗朗西斯科联系我，就这些具体问题考虑到其特权性质，但我很乐意回答或提供任何主题的概述。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3505.093s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Janelle, mèsi anpil.
 Ou te mansyone reyinyon egzekitif plizyè fwa, epi depi mwen te nan domèn sa a, mwen pa te oblije tounen reyinyon yo nan reyinyon egzekitif.
 Èske ou ka pataje yon bagay yon ti kras diferan?
 Moun ki ka vin jwenn nou, oswa ki ka pa abitye ak sa yon reyinyon egzekitif se, poukisa nou gen yon reyinyon egzekitif, ak kèk nan paramèt ki antre nan patisipe nan yon reyinyon egzekitif si nou te itilize teknoloji vityèl (ki nou pa gen teknoloji vityèl).
 sètènman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3541.843s">[Austin]</a>: Bon kesyon.
 Se konsa, pou pale, nou kòmanse ak pwopozisyon an
 Enstitisyon piblik yo oblije fè reyinyon piblik yo.
 Yon fwa ankò, lwa a nan solèy la transparan.
 Rezon yo mete epi mwen ka bay tout manm yo, atravè Francisco, yon rezime sou rezon espesifik ki fè yon enstitisyon piblik ta ka antre nan sesyon egzekitif.
 Reyinyon Egzekitif yo se aktyèlman reyinyon sekrè oswa konfidansyèl.
 Fondamantalman, Lejislati a te deside ke konfidansyalite oswa konsiderasyon konfidansyalite egziste, epi nou pral diskite sou sa sa vle di ak sa ki jistifye diskisyon nan dosye-a sou yon sijè patikilye.
 Sa m ap eseye di se ke, nan opinyon mwen, yo entèprete trè etwat.
 Kidonk, pa egzanp, èske gen diskisyon ki pako rezoud ki, si yo diskite piblikman, ta ka afekte pozisyon litij Komisyon an?
 epi detèmine ke diskisyon piblik sou zafè a ta afekte ka a oswa ka potansyèl la.
 Èske gen plent espesifik ki ta deklanche dwa sou vi prive yon moun?
 Sa a se premye objektif la.
 Si se ka sa a, ou ta dwe fè moun sa a konnen.
 Tipikman nou wè sa plis an tèm de travay.
 Èske gen nenpòt dispozisyon legal espesifik?
 Ou rankontre nan sesyon egzekitif la.
 Youn nan rezon yo se revize minit reyinyon egzekitif la.
 Nou konnen ou ka gen reyinyon egzekitif pou revize yo.
 Se konsa, yo fè li trè, trè estrikteman.
 Sesyon egzekitif yo dwe anonse nan menm fason ak reyinyon piblik yo, 48 èdtan davans ak 48 èdtan ouvrab davans, sof si gen yon ijans.
 Esansyèlman, ou bezwen kenbe epi pibliye reyinyon piblik ak egzekitif.
 Ou kòmanse reyinyon an nan sesyon ouvè, kontinye nan sesyon ouvè, epi piblik la ka gade pandan w ap vote pou fèmen epi ale nan sesyon egzekitif la.
 Kòm nou te wè aswè a, fason yo fè lè l sèvi avèk platfòm elektwonik oswa vityèl tankou Zoom se tipikman prezidan an, konsèy la, komite yo vote epi di, ann antre nan sesyon piblik nan sesyon egzekitif la.
 Yon vòt apèl te fèt.
 Lè sa a, kenbe sesyon levasyon oswa bay lyen endividyèl Zoom.
 Lè sa a, nan yon pèspektiv teknik, li ka di ke, pran an konsiderasyon konfidansyalite, li se garanti ke pa gen okenn manm nan piblik la.
 Lè sa a, minit sa yo nan sesyon egzekitif la pral rete konfidansyèl oswa yo pa ka pibliye piblikman dapre Lwa sou Reyinyon Ouvè jiskaske objektif sesyon egzekitif la ekspire.
 Tou depan de nati diskisyon an, si gen yon diskisyon ki bezwen rezoud, tankou pou kèk kò piblik, li ka rezoud byen vit, oswa li ka pran plis tan depann sou enterè yo vi prive ki enplike.
 Mèsi, Lafrans.
 Mèsi Janelle.
 Mèsi.
 Pa egzanp, èske gen nenpòt lòt kesyon oswa sijè?
 Mwen konnen anjeneral gen anpil kesyon sou elektwonik.
 Diskite sou elektwonik nou yo, itilizasyon elektwonik.
 Mwen ta kontan kouvri sa a, oswa si gen nenpòt lòt sijè ou bezwen konsèy sou.
 Mwen konnen ke se ka a, epi mwen konnen ou te resevwa yon kopi gid la, men gen toujou anpil dijere.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3765.467s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: An jeneral, youn nan defi nou rankontre pafwa se... tann yon minit.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3772.109s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Padon, Rob.
 Maureen te kòmanse leve, li leve vwa li.
 Mwen mande si yon moun te janm rankontre reta?
 Li anfòm, ou anfòm.
 Non, Rob, ale pi devan.
 Oke, ale pi devan, Rob, epi answit Maureen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3790.22s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mèsi, Maureen.
 Mwen pral prese.
 Mwen jis reflechi sou mesaj imel ki ka vini epi si gen nenpòt kesyon, nou vle reponn tout ekip la.
 Jiskaprezan, nou pa t fè sa paske nou pè vyole règ reyinyon ouvè yo, paske sa a se yon kominikasyon trè sere ak fèmen epi li pa tipikman yon deliberasyon.
 Mwen ta renmen tande opinyon w.
 Konsènan si sa a apwopriye oswa yon bagay nou ta dwe kontinye evite fè.
 Ankò, egzanp sa a se, ou konnen, voye kèk enfòmasyon epi nou vle tout gwoup la reponn.
 Se lè sa a nou te retounen nan Frances epi li kontakte gwoup la. Èske sa a pwosesis nou ta dwe swiv?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3834.869s">[Austin]</a>: Bon kesyon.
 Se poutèt sa, Pwokirè Jeneral la ta di, sèlman itilizasyon apwopriye nan imèl dapre Lwa sou Reyinyon Ouvè a se:
 Fowòm ajans piblik yo ta dwe limite sèlman pou rezon planifikasyon.
 Èske w ka vin nan reyinyon sisè 13 mas la?
 Èske w disponib nan moman patikilye sa a?
 Nenpòt ekspresyon opinyon, menm si li enplike pataje materyèl, ak yon moun ki reponn (ki mwen panse se yon bon lide), gen potansyèl pou vyole lwa reyinyon ouvè.
 Si gen nenpòt enfòmasyon sou
 Ou konnen, èske nou ta dwe rankontre sou sijè sa a an patikilye? Èske nou ka mete sa sou ajanda reyinyon an?
 Petèt imel sa a pral rive nan Francisco ak Prezidan an.
 Lè li rive nan kominikasyon dokiman, mwen te wè desizyon kote sa a ta ka rive depann sou nivo sibstans li yo, men mwen panse ke nenpòt ekspresyon opinyon oswa kwayans ka lakòz yon vyolasyon Lwa sou Reyinyon Ouvè yo.
 Sa a se trè strik.
 Pwosesis panse dèyè sa a se,
 Nou tout okipe an jeneral epi sèvi ak imel ak korespondans pou anpil bagay e sa ka yon jan kanmenm tounen yon konvèsasyon solid oswa yon manm ka fòme yon opinyon ki baze sou pozisyon yon lòt manm nan imel san piblik la gen yon chans wè li.
 Se poutèt sa mwen toujou pale de meyè pratik.
 Dapre mwen, pi bon bagay pou w fè nan sitiyasyon sa a se jis kominike
 Ou konnen, dirèkteman bay Francis, oswa petèt bay Francis ak lòt manm, men ou pa ka voye okenn imèl ki baze sou opinyon.
 Mwen konnen sa difisil.
 Ou konnen, kesyon sa a parèt tout tan, tankou, èske nou ka, ou konnen, moun itilize Google Docs Sharing? Oswa èske nou, ou konnen, tout moun tèlman abitye itilize teknoloji ak reyinyon ouvè, reyèlman vle fè biznis nan fason sa a?
 Se konsa, piblik la ka wè li.
 Èske sa reponn kesyon ou a, Rob?
 Wi, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3966.135s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Oke, gwo.
 Padon, li te twò bonè.
 Gen anpil enfòmasyon ki vini kòm komisyonè, kit se komisyonè sa a oswa yon lòt komite, yo te ka wè yon fòmasyon k ap vini yon kote oswa wè yon bagay ke yo panse gwoup la ta enterese nan.
 Anjeneral mesaj sa yo voye ban mwen oswa sou kèk fòm nan bwat resepsyon mwen an.
 mwen voye.
 Tout moun CC moun k ap voye a avè m epi pataje sou non yon moun, pa gen okenn repons obligatwa, tanpri pa ezite abònman si w enterese.
 Mwen konnen pafwa moun santi mwen fèmen yo paske mwen di pa gen okenn bezwen reponn, men mwen pa menm bezwen jwenn repons lan konplè.
 Se pou evite moun ki pi inosan, o bondye mwen te nan evènman sa a, li te awizom.
 Paske se kote opinyon yo soti.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4024.346s">[Austin]</a>: Oswa yon bagay inosan, mwen panse evènman sa a se gwo, mwen reyèlman panse li ta bon pou vil la epi nou ta dwe konsidere aplike li.
 Lè sa a, lòt moun reponn chak moun yo di: Mwen dakò.
 Sa a nan tèt li se yon ekspresyon opinyon.
 Nan ka sa a mwen panse pi bon bagay pou fè se voye l pa Francisco.
 Ak kèk nan ajans piblik mwen travay avèk yo gen tèks anba a, akòz lwa reyinyon ouvè, tanpri pa reponn tout moun.
 Sa a ka sèvi kòm yon rapèl, yon rapèl dou pou moun ke li pa ke yo pa vle reponn oswa bay opinyon yo elektè yo oswa rezidan nan kominote a, men sa a se aktyèlman yon bagay ki pral diskite nan reyinyon k ap vini an.
 Pafwa ajanda a pral mansyone opòtinite fòmasyon oswa mizajou ekipaj kabin.
 Lè sa a, pral gen yon seksyon kote kalite pwoblèm sa yo ka diskite ak diskisyon an ka wè pa piblik la.
 Gen kèk òganis piblik tou lis korespondans ant reyinyon yo ak Lè sa a, lis diferan lèt ki rive.
 Lè sa a, sa ka mennen nan diskisyon
 ant manm yo konsènan yon korespondan an patikilye.
 Se konsa, sa a se yon lòt opsyon tou.
 Men, anpil, anpil ajans piblik ke mwen travay avèk yo gen yon langaj avètisman tankou sa a nan fen reyinyon yo oswa nan nenpòt imel: Tanpri evite reponn egzakteman konsa paske li ta ka, li ta ka trè envolontè, men si yon moun fè yon demann dosye piblik, lè sa a
 Yo te wè plizyè moun k ap reponn.
 Èske sa vyole Open Meetings Act?
 Se konsa, ou dwe konsidere tout bagay.
 Maureen, ou gen nenpòt kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4139.648s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi, mwen te fè li.
 Aktyèlman mwen gen kèk, men mwen pral aksepte nenpòt bagay ki vin nan fason lòt moun.
 Se konsa, mwen li ak anpil atansyon lwa sou reyinyon ouvè a ki Francis te lye nou.
 Mon pa vwar okenn referans avek sa komite ki mon pe koz lo la.
 Pa egzanp, nou deside ke nou vle planifye yon evènman espesifik oswa patwone yon evènman.
 Gen de lòt moun,
 Mwens pase yon majorite deside ke yo pral angaje nan li.
 Nou kapab sèlman fè anpil nan yon èdtan ak yon mwatye chak mwa.
 Li te yon ti kras fwistre ke nou pa t 'gen anpil tan.
 Si objektif la an reyalite se gen mwens pase yon majorite nan reyinyon an epi objektif la se bay enfòmasyon nan yon kò ki pi laj pou konsiderasyon nan pwochen reyinyon an, èske sa a sijè a Open Meetings Act?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4201.547s">[Austin]</a>: Lè sa a, Biwo Pwokirè Jeneral la ap konsidere kesyon si yon ajans piblik te etabli soukomite a.
 Tipikman li pa enpòtan si se yon kowòm nan yon gwo kò piblik, si gen manm, epi li kapab, ou konnen, li pa bezwen yon soukomite fòmèl, li kapab yon gwoup travay, yon gwoup travay, nenpòt kalite,
 Kòm yon pati nan komite a, si yo te vote ke Rob ak Maureen ta responsab pou ensidan an patikilye sa a, ou ta fòme yon soukomite oswa yon gwoup travay, ki ta gen anpil chans sijè a lwa dosye piblik, pa vre?
 Ou konnen, moun sètènman bezwen konprann epi yo dwe kapab fè travay la.
 Kèk nan kominote mwen travay avèk yo pral deziyen yon kominote espesifik, fè yon reyinyon piblik, epi yo di, Maureen pral travay sou pwoblèm espesifik sa a, Rob pral travay sou pwoblèm espesifik sa a, epi Lè sa a, nou pral rankontre ankò nan pwochen reyinyon an ak regroup.
 Men, si yon enstitisyon piblik pran yon desizyon espesifik pou delege travay sa a nan yon pati nan kò piblik sa a, Lè sa a, mwen panse ke lalwa reyinyon ouvè a ta ka aplike.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4279.631s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Donk, sa w ap di, kite m klarifye, w ap di ke si kò sa a di nou te vote pou Maureen ak Rob pou rezoud pwoblèm sa a, sa ta mande yon reyinyon piblik.
 Si olye yo vote yo di wi, Maureen, poukisa ou pa gade nan sa a?
 Èske ou ka di Maureen ak Rob ke yo ka okipe sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4298.376s">[Austin]</a>: Oke, mwen devine nou pral oblije gade nan sa a.
 Mwen panse ke nou ta dwe gade sa a trè liberal.
 Mwen vle di, sèl eksepsyon a se si majistra a, dwa, li pa
 Dapre Open Meetings Act, ou te di mwen pral mande Frances, Maureen, ak Rob fè yon bagay sou non mwen, pa vre?
 Ki sa li tout se, mwen kontan gade nan sa a epi bay kèk konsèy ekri, men esansyèlman li depann de ki travay mwen se ak ki objektif la.
 Objektif la nan egzanp sa a se bay konsèy bay tout yon ajans piblik, pa vre?
 Nan egzanp ipotetik ou a,
 Mwen panse ke an repons a sa, pwosekitè yo pral di ke yon gwoup travay oswa yon soukomite te fòme, site Open Meetings Act la.
 Mwen ta renmen tcheke si se youn oubyen de manm, men li trè laj an tèm de aplikasyon ak pwosesis.
 Mwen toujou gade li kòm yon graphique flux, tankou ki te kreye gwoup travay sa a?
 Fason enstitisyon piblik yo kreye sa a, si ou menm oswa Francisco ap travay avèk ou,
 Ou ka bezwen respekte egzijans Lwa sou Reyinyon Ouvè yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4372.721s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mwen te panse ke gwoup la pa nesesèman la pou bay konsèy men pou pote rechèch tounen, men se pa sa e mwen pa panse se menm bagay ak bay konsèy.
 Mwen pa di yo pral pran pozisyon epi yo di, ok, nou te fè rechèch la epi nou panse ou ta dwe fè sa.
 Li plis tankou,
 Yo te fè, e se sa komite yo souvan fè.
 Yo pa nesesèman fè sa, men ou di menm sa vle di yo ap bay konsèy, donk, men si nou fè sa, nou ka di moun, bay yo 48 èdtan avi, envite yo nan diskisyon sa a reyinyon de moun,
 Yon ensidan e nou byen.
 Apre sa, nou pral prezante tout enfòmasyon yo kolekte bay tout ajans lan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4425.617s">[Austin]</a>: Wi, fondamantalman mon anvi atir zot latansyon lo paj set dan gidans Atorni Zeneral ki eksplik sa ki konstitiye en enstitisyon piblik.
 Pwokirè Jeneral la te deklare espesyalman ke byenke pa gen yon lis konplè ajans piblik yo, nenpòt ki konsèy, komisyon, komite oswa soukomite ki gen plizyè manm nan
 Pouvwa egzekitif oswa lejislatif.
 Sa gen ladann nenpòt kò ki gen plizyè manm ki kreye pou revize oswa fè rekòmandasyon bay kò piblik yo.
 Se konsa, li se byen laj.
 Se sa mwen vle di ak ki moun gwoup sa a rapòte.
 Yon fwa ankò, anjeneral gen sèlman eksepsyon
 Kòm yon gwoup travay, li ta dwe kreye pa sipèentandan lekòl yo oswa majistra a, ki menm yo pa sijè a dispozisyon lwa reyinyon ouvè yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4481.063s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Men, liy anba a se, kèlkeswa sa ou rele li, ajans lan aktyèlman ap fè rekòmandasyon.
 Se sa mwen kontinye tande ou di.
 Men, si se pa sèlman yon sijesyon, si se rechèch, èske w ap di ke se yon sijesyon nan tèt li?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4501.395s">[Austin]</a>: Oke, nou pral oblije gade kote liy lan ye, men mwen ka di ou nan eksperyans mwen jere plent sou lwa reyinyon ouvè pou gwoup travay nou yo ak fòs travay nou yo, li trè laj.
 Mwen gen yon desizyon konkrè nan pwen sa a, kidonk mwen kontan pataje li ak Francisco pou vrèman bay tout moun yon lide klè sou direksyon pou pran.
 Si se yon bagay ou enterese, Maureen, mwen ta renmen fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4529.797s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Bon, mwen gen yon lòt kesyon, sa mwen li se ke minit reyinyon yo ta dwe disponib nan piblik la nan 10 jou, kèlkeswa si yo apwouve oswa yon vèsyon bouyon.
 Se konsa, kesyon mwen an se.
 Ki jan yo disponib?
 Mwen mande si lwa ouvèti a detèmine sa.
 Pa egzanp, lè reyinyon nou yo pa sou sitwèb vil la.
 Kidonk, pa egzanp, kòm yon nouvo manm, si w ap mande sa ki te pase nan mwa jen, oswa si ou nan piblik la, ou ap tankou, wow, de kisa ou te pale?
 Mwen pa sèten ki pozisyon ki akseptab pou yo e si yo pral egziste, mwen vle di, sa a se bagay prensipal la, lòt bagay la se, si yo fin ranpli, si yo ap apwouve oswa nan fòm draft, Lè sa a, yo pral ranplase pa dènye minit apwouve, epi yon fwa sa a apwouve, wi, Lè sa a, minit yo pral ekri. Mwen pa konnen ki jan tout moun ap fè</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4599.139s">[Austin]</a>: Deziyen ki moun ki pral ekri, si li se yon wotasyon oswa jis yon sèl moun, men minit ap bezwen trase moute.
 Lè yo ekri, menm si yo pa apwouve, nou konnen sa se yon egzijans nan Open Meetings Act si yo nan fòm bouyon ak piblik la te soumèt yon demann dosye piblik oswa yon demann Open Meetings Act pou minit reyinyon sa yo, menm si yo pa apwouve, pafwa ou gen reyinyon yon fwa pa mwa,
 Yo dwe soumèt minit sa yo nan fòm bouyon.
 Yo se dosye piblik, kidonk nenpòt dosye, kite m 'back up, nenpòt dosye kreye oswa resevwa pa yon anplwaye vil la, ofisye, volontè, manm konsèy, manm komisyon an, manm komisyon an, se sijè a lwa dosye piblik la.
 Sa a gen ladan dokiman ki te kreye sou òdinatè pèsonèl ou, sa a gen ladan mesaj tèks, sa a gen ladan imèl, osi lontan ke li nan biznis vil la.
 Lè sa a, yon moun nan piblik la te di, anjeneral yo voye li nan depatman legal la epi li di, ou konnen, Janice, li se ofisye aksè nan dosye, mwen vle yon kopi minit sa yo.
 Si se yon bouyon, Janice pral kontakte w epi mande w: Èske w gen kopi minit sa yo?
 Oh wi, yo sèlman nan fòm bouyon.
 Oke, yo la, pa vre?
 Sipoze yo se minit reyinyon piblik yo olye ke sesyon egzekitif yo.
 Yon fwa yo apwouve, piblik la ap resevwa minit yo apwouve si yo resevwa menm demann lan epi yo apwouve minit yo.
 Yo pa bezwen afiche minit reyinyon an sou sitwèb vil la.
 Kèk kominote fè sa.
 Gen kèk moun ki pa mete tout minit reyinyon yo sou entènèt.
 Sa a se anjeneral yon egzèsis nan resous minisipal yo.
 Men, sa yo te di, yo toujou sijè a lwa dosye piblik ak lwa reyinyon ouvè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4705.229s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sa vle di ke si yon moun vle yon bagay, li dwe mande pou li.
 Sa se repons kout.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4712.071s">[Austin]</a>: Kòrèk.
 Se konsa, isit la se de moso.
 Premyèman, Lwa sou Reyinyon Ouvè yo mande pou yo ekri, apwouve epi siyen minit sa yo.
 Sa fèt anba Open Meetings Act.
 Se konsa, lòt pati a se, wi, piblik la kapab
 Mande yo epi konfòme yo ak lwa sou dosye piblik yo ak egzijans lalwa pou reyinyon yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4735.277s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Oke, kidonk pa gen okenn kondisyon sou kote li ta ka ye.
 Moun jis bezwen ale nan vil epi yo di: tanpri ban m 'minit sa yo.
 Si mwen vle wè minit ane pase a, se sa mwen dwe fè.
 Ou dwe fòmèlman mande yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4752.186s">[Austin]</a>: Mwen vle di, yeah, oswa mwen pa konnen ki moun ki gen, mwen pa konnen ki moun ki gen minit, men ou ka, yeah, mwen vle di, tipikman ou pa oblije fè yon demann fòmèl dosye piblik pou yo, men, ou konnen, mwen panse ke yo ka okipe intern, kòm yon manm nan ajans piblik la, Maureen, men mwen panse ke nou vle, jeneralman gen kèk konsistans nan ke minit yo dwe kenbe nan pèmanan.
 Ou ta ka vle tcheke,
 Ou konnen, prezantasyon yo ak si yo parèt oswa ki apwòch la nan sans sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4787.24s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: An reyalite, mwen te panse plis sou piblik la pase tèt mwen.
 Ou konnen, gen kèk moun ki di, o Bondye, mwen vle wè sa yo ap fè.
 Mwen jis ap eseye konnen ki jan moun jwenn yo.
 sa se tout.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4798.686s">[Austin]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ke mwen ta tipikman akonpli sa nan fè yon demann espesifik dosye piblik bay ofisye aksè dosye a, oswa mande minit nan men prezidan ajans piblik la ke yo nòmalman genyen dapre lwa divilgasyon.
 Lè mwen wè yo antre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4815.635s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle klarifye ke nòt yo reyinyon yo estoke nan twa kote diferan.
 Apre sa, gen vèsyon elektwonik la, ki pran plis tan paske li ale nan Medford Community Media.
 Oke, se videyo nou an.
 Men, sa ki te pase nan fen reyinyon sa a, sekretè pati minisipal la
 Mwen menm, ou konnen, si minit yo apwouve, sa vle di, si nòt yo apwouve epi pa gen okenn chanjman, mwen pral ale nan koulwa a, mete dat paj la, epi mwen pral fè sèt kopi.
 Gen uit kopi kounye a epi mwen pral achte youn.
 Yon kopi rete isit la avèk mwen, orijinal la ak rès kopi yo kenbe nan biwo City Hall yo.
 Ou toujou nan Sekretarya Vil la.
 Nenpòt moun ka patisipe epi mande pou wè minit yo.
 Mwen ka sèlman pale depi Avril 2022 jiska kounye a.
 Men, yon bagay mwen pa trè bon nan nòt yo.
 Anjeneral mwen voye bouyon ou yo kòm nòt ak Lè sa a, tounen yo nan reyinyon yo.
 Se konsa, sa a se yon bagay nou tout dwe renmen epi kòmanse konekte.
 Èske Maureen klarifye li pou ou?
 Oke, Rob, epi Diane.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4902.737s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Wi, mèsi.
 Mwen panse mwen pral plonje nan konvèsasyon an sou sou-komite, rekòmandasyon, ak pataje enfòmasyon byento.
 Mon anvi vwar ki gidans Attorney Zeneral i gannyen lo fason pou avanse.
 Èske yo tonbe anba pouvwa komite a pi lwen pase reyinyon nou chak mwa 90 minit?
 Ki sijesyon biwo a gen pou fè kèk pwogrè sou pwoblèm sa yo pandan reyinyon an?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4939.699s">[Austin]</a>: Se konsa, mwen panse ke si gen yon gwoup manm ki vle travay endividyèlman oswa an ekip an menm tan, li posib pou travay avèk yo.
 Ou konnen, manm ki pa ajans piblik yo, ofisyèl vil yo, ak sètènman 2 oswa 3 manm ki vle reyini ansanm pou sesyon diskisyon sa yo.
 Mwen jis vle fè remake ke yo pral piblik, dwa?
 epi respekte lwa reyinyon ouvè yo.
 Oswa konsa, mwen devine.
 Senpleman pwograme reyinyon adisyonèl yo ta yon sijesyon oswa pi bon pratik.
 Oke, men evidamman se yon desizyon politik ak manm yo bezwen reflechi sou chanje bagay yo adapte ajanda yo ak sou sa.
 Oke, ou konnen, gen ajans piblik ki rankontre, sitou pandan peryòd ki pi okipe nan ane a, ak plis regilyèman.
 Lè sa a, nou pral chanje orè reyinyon an selon si gen travay enpòtan yo fè, men sa yo se kèk opsyon diferan.
 Parey mon’n dir, en dimoun i toultan ganny opsyon pou travay endepandans oubyen avek bann manm en komisyon ki pa piblik e answit raport avek en pti gin piblik an antye si i neseser.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5014.173s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen wè.
 Mwen panse ke youn nan defi nou te fè fas a se ke orè reyinyon an te byen klè nan charter fondatè nou an.
 Èske li jis pou entèprete sa a kòm konsèy minim, ki pa espesifik?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5031.95s">[Austin]</a>: sètènman.
 Mwen vle di, mwen panse mwen ta ka sètènman gade nan lwa a
 Yo mete yon òganis piblik pou wè ki fleksibilite a, men an tèm de reyinyon yo louvri epi yo respekte yo ansanm, tout sa ki nesesè se afiche apwopriye ak notifikasyon bay piblik la pou pwograme reyinyon adisyonèl.
 Kidonk, ou konnen, nou ka gade lang nan lwa a.
 Mwen kontan fè sa epi enfòme Francisco sou pwen sa a.
 Men, nan yon pèspektiv lwa reyinyon ouvè, osi lontan ke li afiche nan yon mannyè apwopriye, e gen kèk enstitisyon piblik ki pral poste epi anile, nan kou, si yo pa gen yon kowòm, oswa yo pral poste epi di, nou reyèlman pa bezwen reyinyon sa a.
 Se konsa, anile anile.
 Men, se konsa sa ye nan liv la, pou pi piti, Rob.
 Ankò, pafwa gen ebbs ak koule nan jan ajans piblik okipe yo nan sèten moman nan ane a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5086.017s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Mwen wè.
 Mèsi.
 Wi, li ta bon si ou ta ka tcheke li soti.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5089.159s">[Austin]</a>: Wi, mwen kontan fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5092.02s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Trè byen, Diana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5093.08s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Mèsi.
 Ekselan.
 Mwen remake ou tcheke pataje Google ou a pandan w ap fè prezantasyon an epi mwen jis panse
 Ou konnen, sa a trè klè paske mwen remake nan rechèch mwen an sou lòt komite dwa moun yo ke yo te sanble yo pibliye minit yo, ou konnen, trè byen òganize nan dosye pa ane ak mwa.
 Mwen te tande pale de kèk moun ki kolabore, ou konnen, ki poste reyinyon yo alavans epi yo sèvi ak Google Docs pou kolabore.
 Konsènan fè deklarasyon espesyal oswa lòt kontni.
 Mwen jis ap eseye konnen ki règ yo pou pataje atravè Google.
 Petèt si Google Drive fè piblisite sou sitwèb Komisyon Dwa Moun, solèy t ap rezoud pwoblèm sa a?
 Mwen jis vle konprann sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5157.557s">[Austin]</a>: Klèman sa a se yon nouvo teknoloji en ke nou te wè nan dènye ane yo.
 Epi, ou konnen, nan opinyon mwen, nenpòt kolaborasyon sou Google Docs, si li rive, ta gen anpil chans konstitye konsiderasyon apwopriye anba Open Meetings Act, ranfòsman li yo, ak direktiv yo ke nou te revize jiska dat.
 Epitou, men gen plis chans lè l sèvi avèk Google Docs oswa nenpòt kalite zouti kolaborasyon, li pral seri.
 Se konsa, egzanp mwen souvan itilize se, gen yon seri espesifik nan reyinyon minit ak Rob vini an premye epi fè chanjman.
 Lè sa a, Diane te antre epi li te fè chanjman, men ou te kapab wè chanjman Rob yo, ak Lè sa a, tout bagay te fèt, pa nan yon reyinyon piblik.
 Lè sa a, lè ou asiste reyinyon yo, ou wè opinyon lòt manm nan kò piblik la sou kesyon espesifik sa yo.
 Minit reyinyon yo.
 Kidonk, sa ki Lwa sou Reyinyon Ouvè a mande se ke yon moun ka aktyèlman pran minit nan yon reyinyon oswa ekri yon dokiman, men diskisyon an ak konsiderasyon nan yon dokiman an patikilye dwe ankò pran plas nan yon reyinyon ouvè pou piblik la ka wè deliberasyon yo nan enstitisyon piblik la li menm.
 Teknoloji konplèks, Diane.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5247.43s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Teknoloji konplike e mwen konnen mwen soti nan teknoloji e nou pa sèvi ak Google.
 Se konsa, mwen reyèlman kenbe sou sa.
 Gen enkyetid sou Google ak kounye a ke nou gen entèlijans atifisyèl, bò ADA mwen an di, wi, nou amelyore aksè, nou te fè sa.
 Bò DEI mwen an se tankou, o non.
 Se konsa, kounye a se yon batay,
 Genyen anpil bon bagay ak anpil bagay ki pa tèlman bon, e mwen jis te vle yon moun ede m pran desizyon an pou m te ka di, ok, se sa n ap fè.
 Komisyonè, èske w gen lòt kesyon?
 Akoz nou annan manm piblik prezan, mon ti a kontan donn zot loportinite pou demann kestyon.
 Mwen pa t wè okenn kesyon komisyonè yo te poze.
 Barry, ou vle kontinye ak kesyon ou a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5310.006s">[Barry Ingber]</a>: Mwen espere ke lòt moun pral li li.
 Lefèt ke mwen gen pou ale sanble mete aksan sou pwoblèm nan Rob soulve.
 Èske ou ta ka prezante tèt ou tanpri?
 Non mwen se Barry Ingeber.
 Mwen rete nan North Medford.
 Men, lè li rive Google Doc a, mwen mande si wi ou non wè sa a ta chanje si dokiman an te aksesib piblikman pou piblik la ka wè deliberasyon yo pwogrè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5351.13s">[Austin]</a>: Mwen pa panse opinyon mwen sou sa a pral chanje.
 Rezon ki fè la se ke pandan ke piblik la ka wè kòmantè yo an tan reyèl, li pa pral piblik anba lwa reyinyon ouvè.
 Se konsa, piblik la gen esansyèlman vizite Google Drive oswa konekte pou wè si nenpòt moun te mete ajou yon dokiman espesifik.
 Se konsa, mwen tounen nan opinyon kwonolojik la nan Open Meetings Act la
 Ou konnen, premyerman, raple piblik atraver bann notices e meeting agendas ki sa zafer lazans piblik e se sa ki pou ganny fer.
 San sa, ou konnen, esansyèlman konsidere si piblik la vle fè sa, ou ap fondamantalman deplase responsablite a bay piblik la di, isit la nan sit entènèt la, sa a ka oswa pa ka rive nenpòt ki lè.
 Dapre mwen, sa a ta gen pwoblèm dapre egzijans Open Meetings Act.
 Bon kesyon.
 Mwen gen yon lòt kesyon isit la e mwen te renmen li li.
 Francisco, si sa itil ou.
 Sipoze, ou bezwen jwenn yon kote pou òganize yon evènman.
 Rob ak Stephen te volontè pou konsidere opsyon men yo pa pran yon desizyon.
 Yo bezwen kowòdone efò sansibilizasyon yo pou yo pa rele menm kote.
 Èske sa a sijè a Open Meetings Act?
 Se konsa, ann gade nan pi bon pratik.
 Gen yon reyinyon konsa aswè a epi Rob ak Stephen se volontè.
 Yo pa yon kowòm nan kò piblik lè li rive nan kominikasyon, men piblik la ka wè ke yo tout fè sa volontèman.
 Lè sa a, tout moun fè pwòp travay endepandan yo, dwa?
 Lè sa a, pwochen etap yo kominike bay tout kò piblik la.
 Mwen kontan di w ke nan senk premye kesyon mwen te resevwa yo, pwobableman pi enpòtan an (e mwen ta di dezyèm lan) se gwoup travay ak sou-komite.
 ak gwoup travay.
 Donk mwen konprann li difisil pou moun navige.
 Alor mon ti a kontan al pli devan e pran serten desizyon konkret pour montre ou bann model fact ki’n antre an plas pou ou kapab akonpli ou responsabilite, pa vre?
 Paske li trè konplèks.
 Biwo Pwokirè Jeneral la te bay trè bon konsèy sou kesyon sa a pou ede ajans piblik yo nan travay yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5491.072s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Paske aswè a nou gen sitiyasyon sa a, menm lè nou ap pale sou si nou aktyèlman planifye fè anyen pou Pride Month ane pwochèn.
 Gen de moun nan komite a ki enterese nan envestigasyon sou zafè a.
 Se konsa, sa sa mande?
 Premyèman, chèche konnen sa k ap pase nan vil la.
 Dezyèmman,
 Ki lide nou ka vini ak?
 Apre sa, kontinye travay epi rapòte bay gwoup sa a sa nou jwenn, pa sa nou konnen pou asire w, men sa nou jwenn.
 Èske nou dwe fè sa poukont nou epi retounen pita?
 Se sa ou te di?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5529.61s">[Austin]</a>: Wi, kidonk ou ka fè li endividyèlman epi kowòdone oswa kominike.
 Ou konnen, aktyèlman bay mizajou atravè Francisco ak Lè sa a, enfòme tout ajans piblik la sou pwochen etap yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5550.323s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Li enteresan paske li pa aktyèlman bati yon kominote.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5553.764s">[Austin]</a>: Li jis separe.
 Mwen konnen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5555.664s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Mwen jwenn sa vrèman fwistre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5559.185s">[Austin]</a>: Pwen an se, nou konnen ke lwa reyinyon ouvè pa teknikman mande kòmantè piblik, men sa nou konnen se ke
 Dapre lwa reyinyon ouvè, sa te rive dè milyon de fwa nan kat ane ki sot pase yo, epi piblik la gen dwa esansyèlman obsève sa k ap pase an tan reyèl.
 Se konsa, objektif nou se reyèlman kapab balanse tout sa yo.
 Men, kite m afiche gid espesifik sa a pou tout moun klè sou dimansyon sa ki ka akonpli.
 Natirèlman, sa a se ant pati nan yon kò piblik ki pa gen yon kowòm, kidonk yo pral gen konsèy espesifik pou Maureen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5607.276s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Mwen jis te vle bay yon lòt egzanp.
 Si w sonje, nou tout te resevwa menm mesaj la kòm yon pati nan Massachusetts Human Rights Alliance mwa pase a lè Diane te asiste.
 Yo ap fè kèk bagay Zoom.
 Diana te asiste pou kont li.
 Diane pa t imèl komite a.
 Diane pa t mande Frances si li te kapab asiste.
 Diane te asiste poukont li, men Diane te di:
 Lokatè, èske ou ka mete m 'sou kalandriye ou a?
 Mwen vle pataje eksperyans mwen.
 Nenpòt manm nan komite a ka fè sa.
 Ou pa gen anpil diferan kalite reyinyon oswa opòtinite fòmasyon deyò tankou lòt komite mwen yo paske MBTA a ap fè kèk bagay, kèk ladan yo,
 Ou dwe plis enterese nan li.
 Se konsa, si mwen ka jwenn li, mwen voye li pa imel ak moun yo voye li tèt yo.
 Si yo santi yo gen yon bagay ki gen valè yo vle pataje ak lòt komisyonè yo, yo pral kontakte m pou mande pou mete l sou ajanda a.
 Oswa pafwa yo di m ': Francis, ou ka pataje sa a?
 Mwen pa t 'fè li tan sa a, men petèt youn nan komisyonè mwen yo kapab.
 Se lè sa a yo ka pataje sou non yon moun san yo pa bezwen reponn.
 imel.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5692.485s">[Austin]</a>: Mwen panse, klèman, nan opinyon mwen, si ou tout vle patisipe nan opòtinite fòmasyon, ou ka fè sa.
 Sa pa vyole Open Meetings Act.
 Mwen kwè nou tout trè enplike nan vil la ak nan kominote a.
 Ou sètènman gen dwa fè sa.
 Ou konnen, ou gen dwa Premye Amannman pou fè sa.
 Gen de plis,
 Ou konnen, lwa reyinyon ouvè a pa entèdi sa.
 Ou konnen, ou ta ka ale nan yon rasanbleman sosyal oswa yon evènman nan vil la.
 Kesyon an se, ou konnen, èske manm nan kò piblik yo konsidere pwoblèm deyò reyinyon yo?
 Se konsa, mwen te wè plent inonbrabl pandan ane yo ke de moun sa yo te asiste evènman kominote a, ou konnen, komemore mesye sa a.
 Oke, men mwen te wè yo chichote nan koulwa a.
 Se konsa, mwen konnen yo ap pale de kèk bagay ke yo ta dwe pale sou nan konferans lan, dwa?
 Oswa moun sa yo nan yon rasanbleman sosyal, men, ou konnen, li son tankou yo ap pale epi mwen tande yon bagay sou X, Y, oswa Z, epi sa pa ta dwe rive.
 Um, kidonk sa a se yon pa gen okenn brainer, oswa gen yon konferans ke anpil nan ou enterese nan sijè sou yon nivo pwofesyonèl ak pèsonèl.
 Lè sa a, ou ka fè li.
 Tout se byen.
 Mwen vle di, ou ka ale nan opòtinite fòmasyon.
 Vrè kesyon an se: èske ou, antanke manm, janbe liy ou, pou di konsa, nan diskite sou zafè ki annatant kounye a nan jiridiksyon ou a?
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle asire w ke sa a klè tou.
 Lwa reyinyon ouvè a eseye balanse moun, ou konnen, balanse tout sa otank posib.
 Bon kesyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5795.704s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Mèsi Janelle.
 Èske nenpòt lòt moun gen kesyon?
 Èske gen nenpòt manm komite?
 Bon, mwen te wè sèlman de manm piblik la avèk nou.
 Èske ou de manm piblik gen nenpòt kesyon sou lwa sou reyinyon piblik yo?
 Ki konpozisyon fowòm nan?
 Kilè reyinyon an pral anile?
 Ebyen, mwen pa wè pèsonn leve men yo.
 Se konsa, kounye a li nan 709.
 avoka.
 Austin, mèsi anpil pou tan ou ak eksplikasyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5836.195s">[Austin]</a>: Mèsi, sa se bèl pou rankontre nou tout.
 Mwen pral swiv sou pwoblèm estati osi byen ke pwoblèm gwoup travay sou-komite yo.
 Mwen kontan rankontre nou tout.
 Frances gen enfòmasyon kontak mwen si w bezwen èd.
 Mwen toujou kontan diskite sou nenpòt kesyon ou ka genyen.
 Mwen apresye tan ou aswè a.
 pase yon bon nwit.
 Mèsi anpil.
 atansyon.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5854.622s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Menm bagay la tou pou ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5855.043s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Bon, i annan bokou pou dijere, me mon swete ki nou kapab, ou konnen, i annan bann dokimantasyon akoz mon pou fer sa e mon annan en deadline pour lir li pou asire ki mon napa okenn kestyon si ou annan okenn kestyon avan avoka i arive.
 Men, ou konnen, eseye dijere enfòmasyon sa yo epi reflechi sou li an tèm de eseye vin pi transparan ak kominote a an tèm de fason nou travay.
 Si nou bloke nan mantalite ke nou gen sèlman X kantite reyinyon oswa nou pa ka fè sa, Lè sa a, nou kreye baryè nan tèt nou ki anpeche nou fè travay la.
 Ankò, ajanda a louvri pou tout moun, pa vre?
 Nou pa bezwen twa moun konnen ki moun ki ap fè ki evènman.
 Si Frances pasyone sou yon bagay, li ka ale wè li epi answit mande pou l mete l sou ajanda a epi bay opinyon li.
 Sa a pa toujou nesesè nan yon anviwònman gwoup.
 Si nou bezwen pi gwo sou-komite ak gwoup travay, nou pral bezwen plis reyinyon, toutotan reyinyon sa yo anonse davans.
 Sa a se reyèlman plis nan yon pwoblèm transparans ak aksè nan piblik la.
 Mwen espere ou jwenn li itil.
 Gen lòt kesyon?
 Mwen jis kenbe yon je sou tan an paske mwen oblije kouri nan biwo a nan 7:30am.
 Sinon, sele nou ap rete pou dat demen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5969.114s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Èske mwen ka di yon bagay?
 Briyan.
 Mwen remèsye nou tout.
 Trè bon ak andomaje.
 Mwen panse sa.
 Briyan.
 Mwen remèsye nou tout, se te yon trè, trè bon reyinyon aswè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5982.993s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Um, mèsi anpil, ok, mèsi, Lè sa a, nan moman sa a, mwen pral peze bouton an sispann anrejistreman pou kòmanse reyinyon an, uh, men anvan sa, yon moun bezwen fè yon mosyon adjournment pou fini reyinyon an. Kidonk, mwen te mande pou ranvwaye reyinyon an. Oke, ki moun ki sipòte li?
 Mèsi, Stephen.
 Èske gen moun ki reyèlman vle pase nwit la?
 OK
 Mwen pa t wè okenn volontè.
 Tout se byen.
 Mèsi tout moun.
 atansyon.</p>
