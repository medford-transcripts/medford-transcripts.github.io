    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=459.591s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  Thank you, members of the Human Rights Commission.
 My name is Sana Fadel.
 I'm the deputy director at Citizens for Juvenile Justice.
 We are a statewide organization, a statewide policy organization that advocates for young people who are at risk of or with legal system involvement.
 We do our work statewide, and I appreciate being able to meet with you all on this.
 So I'm actually here asking for your support or endorsement of legislation that deals with youth justice reforms called Raise the Age.
 It is a legal system reform, but I do want to talk about it because it's both an economic and racial justice issue.
 So this is the bill.
 It's a bill that was filed by Rep.
 O'Day from West Boylston, Rep.
 Cruz from Salem, and Senator Friendly from Lynn.
 This bill is currently pending in the Judiciary Committee, and what it does, it ends the automatic prosecution of a teenager, older teens, as adults, and moves them into the juvenile justice system.
 So I'm just gonna give you a little bit of background on why we even have this campaign.
 This campaign started several years ago, because when we looked at issues of recidivism in Massachusetts, what we saw was that young people have the highest recidivism rate of any age group.
 So when we talk about recidivism, there's different decision points that young people come back to the system on.
 So we look at two specific ones.
 One is rearrangement, which means you come in, you've been convicted of another crime, you've served your time, and now you're back in court again and you have a totally new crime.
 That's the rearrangement.
 The second one is reconviction.
 That means you've come out of the incarceration, you've come out and you have a totally new crime and you've been found guilty of it.
 So when we looked at this, we say, what is our legal system doing with young people?
 So we have two systems.
 One is our juvenile system, which if a young person between the ages of 12 up to 17, right before their 18th birthday, if they're in conflict with the law, they would be part of the juvenile justice system.
 If they're 18 and over, they wouldn't be in adult criminal justice system.
 This data looks at,
 kids who have, young people who have been incarcerated, because that's the deepest end of the system.
 Every point of the legal system says, are you someone that we want to keep out of society because of a crime you've been alleged to commit?
 And, you know, from the point of arrest all the way to sentencing, that's the question it asks.
 So all of these young people have been incarcerated.
 The legal system says, yes, we found you liable.
 We're going to incarcerate you.
 So what are we buying with that legal system, right?
 We're looking at do young people come out better off, less likely to commit crime.
 And what I want to show you here is when we look at teenagers, we're doing two very different systems have two very different outcomes.
 So our juvenile system does serve the incarceration quite does serve young people up until the 21st birthday.
 So there is some overlap.
 The data isn't perfect because we're looking at 18 to 24 versus 21 and under.
 However, overall, when we look at recidivism, young people coming out of the adult system are almost like a one and a half times more likely to be rearranged and more than double the likelihood to be reconvicted.
 I'm hyper on this because
 those are all the same young people.
 They're all adolescents, especially when they're talking about anybody under the age of 21, by pediatric standards, they're all adolescents.
 Well, not up to that age.
 But we have two very, so their development is the same, their offense, what they get arrested for is the same.
 Everything about them is the same, except how do we interact with them as a society?
 And that's what this campaign is about.
 So when we look at young people,
 that age group, like the 18 to 20 year olds is really the heart of this campaign.
 These are young people who would be in high school or they'd be just starting in college.
 Their brains, everything in their life is designed to learn.
 So wherever you put them, they're gonna learn that environment they're in.
 So if you put them in environments that are more toxic, that prevent them from meeting developmental milestones, you're actually increasing the likelihood of them re-offending.
 So things like, you know,
 is our intervention likely to help them or derail them from getting a job, having a family, getting a home, or having stable housing, finishing education, all of those things, if we put barriers to those, we're more likely to have them come back for totally new crime.
 And this is supported by research.
 So this pathway to desistance study came out of,
 It was housed in the University of Pittsburgh, but several universities were involved across the country.
 They tracked 1,300 young people.
 All of them were adolescents.
 Every single one of them committed a serious or violent offense.
 And they did monthly check-ins with them for a seven-year period.
 And they asked the question, why do some of these young people with these offenses desist from crime?
 And why do some of them persist in crime?
 And by the nature of the study, the offense itself is not, the severity of this offense itself is not an indicator of future offending, which is one of the things, you know, our laws are like the more serious offense, the higher the risk that you're presented to society.
 This, just the premise of the study says, it's actually not the case.
 And this is what they look for.
 They look for serious offense, how often they offended, socioeconomic status, education, housing, income, substance use, mental health,
 race, geography, family status, like everything you can possibly think of.
 And they found not a single one of them had an impact on future funding.
 Only two things did.
 The first was the belief in the legitimacy of authority.
 And the second is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 I will translate those into English.
 The first one is, do you believe that whenever you do something, that you have some kind of control of what happens to you?
 That the person in authority is going to treat you in what you perceive as fair?
 That means, every time I go to the store, will I always be followed?
 You know what?
 It doesn't matter.
 I've been labeled as a criminal regardless of my behavior.
 That is a risk factor of having someone re-effect.
 So when you say, and I've seen this play out in the young people I work with, they do not, it's not, it's less likely of how harsh the punishment was or the consequence was.
 It's the was, did I get it, was it fair?
 So if it was, if I perceived it as fair, even if it was harsh,
 I will say those young people are much more likely to start reoffending because, you know what, I knew I took that risk and I got what I deserved.
 That's what this means.
 So when we do all this work around racial justice and the criminal justice system, it is not just because it's ethical and moral and the right thing to do, it is also a public safety measure in our legal system.
 The second piece which is relevant for this bill is meeting developmental milestones on time.
 So do you have any children or adolescents in your lifetime?
 It means as a baby, can you feed yourself?
 Can you talk?
 Can you walk?
 Can you do full paragraphs?
 When it comes to adolescents, can you have judgment?
 Can you think before you act and think about the consequences?
 Those are all things that young people develop gradually over time.
 And what the researchers found was if the intervention itself blocks a young person's ability to meet those developmental milestones, they're much more likely to persist in crime.
 The likelier they are to meet those developmental milestones on time, the much sooner they will desist from re-offending.
 And those things that young people need to meet developmental milestones are education, employment or skills,
 family connection, physical or mental health, and civic and social engagement.
 So when we look at these systems, this is what we're looking at.
 Those systems, when you're in the adult system, you have a quarry.
 That's a huge barrier to education and employment.
 There's no impact, there is, unlike the juvenile system that looks at education as a priority, education in the adult system is pretty rare when it comes to this age population.
 Family connections, sorry, you're 18, you're on your own, there's no role for family, where even if you're under 21 in the juvenile system, family always has a role.
 Civic engagement, part of the education, our K through 12 frameworks include civic engagement.
 That is the kind of, if you're in DYS, that framework is in the education in DYS.
 So when we're talking about this, that's what we're talking about intervention.
 And in addition, it's also a racial justice issue.
 So this is looking at incarceration.
 Again, the data, we have pretty decent data in the juvenile system.
 Our adult system data is pretty lacking.
 So I try to do the best we can.
 This is looking at rates of incarceration between white men and boys compared to black men and boys.
 We have data on Latino kids.
 The federal data does not exist in a usable way.
 That's the only reason I only look at that.
 But when we look at this, we see that racial disparities for our 18 and 19-year-olds is the highest of any age group.
 And that's something that's consistent across the country, not just in Massachusetts.
 When we look at this one, we know that our legal system, and we're not saying our juvenile justice system is great, right?
 The difference is,
 Our juvenile justice system has both federal and state requirements to reduce racial disparities.
 So we measure it.
 It's still not fixed, right?
 Not gonna say it's there, but the requirement does not exist anywhere in the adult system.
 So when we look at these disparities, we have disparities where it's not just the over-representation and the sheer number, it's the collateral consequences
 that the class is falling disproportionately falling on young men of color.
 So it means you have a system that is less developmentally appropriate.
 So you don't get what you need to mature and get reintegrate back fully into society.
 The focus on punishment and rather than development means you don't get those skills as you mature.
 And then you have the collateral consequences that are pretty severe.
 So there are collateral consequences to juvenile adjudications as well as adult convictions.
 However, the adult conviction collateral consequences are much more significant and many of them are mandatory.
 So no matter what, you have those collateral consequences stick no matter what.
 And then when I talk about this as an economic justice issue, I'm assuming many of you know about, every sector I talk about,
 That we have a labor crisis, we have a labor crisis.
 That's always been the case.
 The labor crisis has actually been, and I was following what economists have been saying, they've been raising that flag at least 2016, 2017, so before COVID.
 What they said in Massachusetts, we have a rate of baby boomers retiring at a higher rate than young people entering into our workforce.
 COVID just made it worse.
 And the recovery from COVID, we just have not been able, there's been some recovery, but we haven't been able to get back to where we were before, where that crisis has been a long time in the coming.
 So the arguments are, first, let's talk about the young person themselves.
 If a young person is involved in an adult system,
 where it does not look at their education and having a quarry limits your ability to get a job.
 That limits that young person's own lifetime earnings potential.
 If you look at it from the labor market, when we say all of these young people are less likely to contribute to our labor market, that means our businesses are not able to hire.
 We have a labor shortage that we say, we need more young people.
 except those young people, right?
 You're not, we think those are, and this is, they're just not going to be part of the equation.
 They're not part of the denominator.
 And then when we do that, we're basically saying that group
 So every generation, we have a cohort of young people that just have a lifetime exclusion from fully integrating into our society.
 And that means us as a commonwealth don't benefit from their economic participation in our economy.
 And ultimately, our legal system is not an equal opportunity employer.
 We talked about the fact that the legal system targets low-income communities and communities of color disproportionately.
 That means when you look at where young people are excluded from our economy, excluded from our education and employment opportunities, they tend to be concentrated in those same communities that they come from, which means those communities, the economic potential of those communities is also diminished.
 And then finally,
 Going back to my first slide, we have a potential of reducing crime if we deal with young people in a developmentally appropriate way.
 Reducing crime also means we're also benefiting our taxpayers as a whole.
 We have less people who are victimized and require some kind of repair.
 Our legal system is not going to be as, you know, having all the workings of the legal system, we just won't have as much if we have,
 Again, it's not a criminal justice panacea, I'm not solving everything, but for those young people, shrinking that potential has an economic impact.
 And just conclude with just the thought that this is not new.
 I actually wanna say that our legal system is far behind the rest of our society in looking at young people under the age of 21 as adolescents.
 I started off by talking about pediatrics.
 Pediatricians work with young people
 under 21 and up to 21 and maybe sometimes older, depending on their medical needs, that's been going on for a long, long time.
 You can't drink, you can't smoke pot or smoke tobacco or gamble or own a gun or be a police officer until you're 21.
 There's also all sorts of other milestones because
 You can start a job at 14, you can get your driver's license at 16, but with lots of limitations until you're 18.
 But you can pre-register to vote because we want you to vote by 18.
 But then all these other things we want to delay.
 You can't rent a car until you're 25.
 You can be on your parents' health insurance until 26.
 Because our society does not have a hard line of adults.
 we have a transition to adulthood, which means things that we want young people to grow up and make up into a habit into your adulthood, we want to encourage you to do more of that younger.
 The younger you are, the more likely you're going to stick.
 Things that are a risk to yourself or to others, which we believe legal system involvement is one of those, we want to delay so that when you are more mature, you can make those decisions and it's less likely to stick.
 So, I'm just going to end with just what I would love for this commission to consider ways of supporting.
 So, like this is legislation that's out there.
 I shared ahead of time fact sheets about this legislation, but there's many things that you could do to support.
 And just so you know, I've been trying to meet with all the human rights commissions across the state, and some of them are able to endorse, and some of them are like, oh, we're part of the state government, we can, but there's other ways to support.
 So these are all just ideas of things you can do if this is something you want to support.
 They could go from formal endorsement to we'll just make some connections or we'll publicize it to let our constituents know or our residents know about it.
 But without us, depending on, or we can say yes, we'll support it.
 We'll send our legislators a letter in support.
 It's really up to you all.
 So I just want to thank you for this opportunity.
 This is my contact information and I would love to open up to any questions.

 Похоже, один из наших комиссаров ушел.
 Я не знаю.
 Позже я проверю, пытаются ли они восстановить соединение.
 Но есть ли у наших трех оставшихся комиссаров проблемы?

 Когда вы говорите о каком-то этапе развития, с этим ли сейчас сталкивается молодежная система?
 Стоит ли добавлять дополнительные средства или ресурсы в молодежную систему, чтобы помочь молодым людям на этих этапах развития?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1576.58s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: ដូច្នេះប្រព័ន្ធបណ្តុះបណ្តាលយុវជនរបស់យើងបានត្រៀមរួចរាល់ហើយ។
 ដូច្នេះយើងមាន
 ជាលទ្ធផល រដ្ឋ Massachusetts បានដឹកនាំប្រទេសជាតិក្នុងកំណែទម្រង់យុត្តិធម៌អនីតិជនចាប់តាំងពីទសវត្សរ៍ឆ្នាំ 1970 ។
 យើងបានអនុវត្តកំណែទម្រង់រយៈពេលប្រាំឆ្នាំ ហើយបានបិទពន្ធនាគារយុវជនទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងទសវត្សរ៍ឆ្នាំ 1970 ។
 ទសវត្សរ៍ទី 90 គឺគួរឱ្យភ័យខ្លាច។
 យើង​ជា​អ្នក​ធ្វើ​បាប​ប្រទេស​នេះ និង​កន្លែង​នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែចាប់តាំងពីឆ្នាំ 2003 មក DYS បានផ្តោតជាពិសេសលើការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍យុវជនជាវិជ្ជមាន ដោយធ្វើការកាត់បន្ថយការជាប់ឃុំ ដោយទទួលស្គាល់ពីផលប៉ះពាល់ដ៏គ្រោះថ្នាក់នៃការជាប់ឃុំឃាំង។
 វាបានវិវត្តន៍តាំងពីពេលនោះមក ដូចជាប្រសិនបើការប្រើប្រាស់ការឃុំឃាំងមិនដែលត្រូវបានបង្រួមអប្បបរមាពីដំបូងឡើយ។
 ដូច្នេះ វាដូចជា អូ យើងត្រូវធ្វើបែបនេះ ការអប់រំតែងតែមាន ប៉ុន្តែយើងត្រូវបង្កើនប្រសិទ្ធភាពវា។
 បច្ចុប្បន្ន​យើង​កំពុង​ធ្វើ​ការ​ក្នុង​ផ្នែក​វេជ្ជសាស្ត្រ។

 ដូច្នេះ​វត្ថុ​ទាំង​អស់​នេះ​គឺ​នៅ​ទី​នោះ ហើយ​វា​ត្រូវ​បាន​សាង​សង់​ជា​រៀង​រាល់​ឆ្នាំ។
 ប៉ុន្តែទស្សនៈនៃការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍យុវជនជាវិជ្ជមានបានក្លាយជាផ្នែកមួយនៃប្រព័ន្ធយុត្តិធម៌យុវជនរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំមិនមែនគ្រាន់តែនិយាយអំពី DYS ការសាកល្បង តុលាការ អ្នកការពារសាធារណៈ និងមេធាវីស្រុកនោះទេ។
 មនុស្សមើលក្មេងជំទង់ហើយនិយាយថា: ការងាររបស់យើងគឺជួយពួកគេឱ្យធំឡើង។

 ឥឡូវនេះមានសំណួរអំពីលេខ។
 វិក័យប័ត្រខ្លួនវាមិនគ្របដណ្តប់លើមនុស្សគ្រប់រូបដែលមានអាយុពី 18 ទៅ 20 ឆ្នាំក្នុងពេលតែមួយនោះទេ។
 ទីមួយ គោលដៅរបស់យើងគឺ 18 ឆ្នាំ។
 នេះគឺជាលេខតូចជាង។
 ប្រព័ន្ធនេះត្រូវបានបង្កើតឡើងជាមួយនឹងការទទួលស្គាល់ថាមូលនិធិមួយចំនួនអាចនឹងត្រូវផ្ទេរពីប្រព័ន្ធមនុស្សពេញវ័យទៅប្រព័ន្ធយុវជន ដើម្បីបម្រើដល់ក្មេងអាយុ 19 ឆ្នាំ និងនៅទីបំផុតក្មេងអាយុ 20 ឆ្នាំ។

 រហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះរដ្ឋ Vermont គឺជារដ្ឋតែមួយគត់ដែលបង្កើនអាយុលើសពី 18 ឆ្នាំ។
 គិតត្រឹមឆ្នាំ 2020 ពួកគេមានអាយុ 18 ឆ្នាំ ហើយត្រូវបានគេរំពឹងថានឹងត្រូវបានដាក់បញ្ចូលក្នុងក្រុមនៅរដូវក្តៅនេះ។</p>

 Спасибо
 И извините за странный звук выше.
 Вы ответили на один из моих вопросов.
 Другие штаты или сообщества успешно реализовали такую ​​политику.
 Приятно осознавать, что наши ближайшие соседи делают что-то подобное, потому что это реальная проблема и перемены важны.
 Наконец, он упомянул несколько способов, которыми мы можем помочь вам и выразить нашу поддержку.
 Я думаю, вы говорите об официальном одобрении или письме кому-то в парламенте.
 Есть ли у вас ресурсы, которые могут представить эти варианты проявления поддержки и защиты?
 Если да, то владеем ли мы ими или имеем к ним доступ?</p>

 Так вернемся ли мы к тому, на чем остановились?
 Будет предложение утвердить протокол заседания в феврале 2024 года.
 И кто-то должен его поддержать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1862.174s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Внести утверждение протокола собрания за прошлый месяц.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1873.082s">[Unidentified]</a>: Да, это так.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1878.977s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Очень хорошо, здорово.
 Так что теперь просто голосуйте быстро.

 Просто быстрый звонок для одобрения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1893.07s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Ох плохо, это правда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1895.852s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Да, окей.
 Стивен?
 Живи
 О, интересная Морин.
 Нас было двое, и один из нас опоздал.
 Один из нас идет, а другой сидит.
 Но не имеет значения, да или нет, кто такая Морин.

 Все хорошо.
 Следующим пунктом повестки дня Дианы будет нотариус, который поможет вам составить протоколы мартовских и апрельских собраний.
 Я начал запись в марте, так что закончу.
 Есть ли специалисты, которые могут помочь с оформлением документов на апрель?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1972.214s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Возможно, я не смогу присутствовать на апрельской встрече, о которой буду говорить с вами.
 Поэтому я не могу добровольно сделать это, потому что меня здесь не должно быть.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1983.321s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: ок
 Чтобы проверить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=1987.984s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Спасибо, Стивен.
 Спасибо, Стивен.
 Спасибо, Стивен.
 Это верно.
 Хорошо, Сиан, пришло время проверить свой календарь.
 Извините, я еще не удалил календарь из папки.
 Оно у вас есть?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2008.932s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: О, так хорошо
 Я уже открыл его, поэтому нажму на экран общего доступа и открою документ Word.
 Пожалуйста, подождите немного.
 Вы все это видите?
 Нисколько.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2025.218s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Нет, а у вас была возможность поделиться этим?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2028.241s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Я не знаю.
 Ах, кажется, я нажал кнопку.
 О нет, там написано, что сервер отключил совместное использование экрана, извините.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2033.926s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Ну, попробуй сейчас.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2041.673s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Идеальный.
 Ну, теперь ты это видишь?
 Это верно.
 В результате мы планируем почтить память Белинды, королевской семьи и Сензары во время женского исторического мероприятия позднее в этом месяце.
 Честно говоря, я был немного под водой.
 Это мое самое загруженное время на работе.
 Я также встретил Киру Синглтон, которая мне очень помогла.
 Если вы следили за этой информацией, то знаете, что его завербовали для службы в исправительной команде Бостона.
 Так что это было очень занято.
 Мы обсуждаем переход 19 июня на государственный праздник июня.
 19 июня – среда.
 Итак, вы хотите организовать это мероприятие?
 Это очень важно для нашего освобождения, а также для нашей истории рабства на Севере.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2112.908s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Итак, чтобы доказать, что Диана, у нас всех нет власти, у династии есть власть, верно?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2118.531s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Это мы... Это мы, да?
 Как и в случае с мероприятием, которое мы провели в феврале прошлого года в рамках Месяца черной истории, Фрэнсис, я не знаю, правильно ли я использую слово, поэтому, пожалуйста, поправьте меня, потому что иногда я думаю, что в прошлом году это был партнер или спонсор?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2140.324s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: HRC, как правило, будет работать с королевской семьей над организацией мероприятия.
 Теперь я могу вам сказать, что, хотя сегодняшний день может показаться большим, Общественный центр Западного Медфорда сегодня будет праздновать 16 июня.
 Поэтому я рекомендую
 Сохраните это мероприятие на следующий год или другой день, поскольку накануне город поднимет флаг 17 июня, поскольку 17 июня — государственный праздник.
 Жаль, что Вест-Медфорд и Королевские общественные центры переходят улицу, откуда мы можем иметь это трехстороннее партнерство и провести целый день.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2201.163s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Это 18 июня.
 Может ли это мероприятие состояться в 19-й праздник?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2208.995s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Нынешний праздник организован Общественным центром Вест-Медфорда.
 Ох
 Накануне город поднял свой 16-й флаг.
 О, так хорошо
 Мы подняли флаг накануне, потому что город в тот день был закрыт.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2229.481s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Хорошо, я понимаю.
 Знаете ли вы, когда состоится мероприятие общественного центра Вест-Медфорд?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2238.442s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Я не знаю сейчас, но это будет иметь большое значение.
 Опять же, я настоятельно рекомендую не бронировать его в тот же день.
 Да, они планируют это сделать... Я не хочу жертвовать слишком многим, потому что это еще не стабильно.
 Знаете, в этой части разговора мы должны убедиться, что наши действия дополняют друг друга, а не становятся...
 Я думаю, сегодня длинный день.
 Я думаю, это будет во второй половине дня, где-то между 12 и 16 часами дня, и они обычно так и делают.
 Это верно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2277.577s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Так что я поговорю с Киарой, и, возможно, будут еще изменения, или мы сохраним их до следующего года.
 С тобой все в порядке?
 Конечно.
 Что вы думаете, ребята, Франциско?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2292.471s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Я имею в виду, я думаю, что это ты.
 Я бы хотел перенести это на следующий год или, может быть, устроить еще одно празднование позже в этом году, вы знаете, это уместно.
 Хм
 Возможно, некоторые из этих важных дней уже пройдут.
 Сегодня мне придется взглянуть на национальный календарь, чтобы получить некоторые предложения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2324.62s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Хорошо, давайте выясним это.
 Так что, возможно, я обновлю информацию на следующей встрече.
 Так что спасибо всем.
 Потому что людям это очень нравится.
 Да-да, именно.
 Очень хорошо, здорово.
 Итак, другой элемент этого очень простого календаря, апрель, — это День Земли, а затем, Фран Оуа, я добавил всю серию о здоровье чернокожих, взятую из этого календаря из Медфордской публичной библиотеки.
 Вот и все.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2366.195s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Хорошо, очень хорошо, большое спасибо, Диана.
 Я просто хочу убедиться, что члены комиссии посылают своего рода сигнал о том, что они согласились временно отменить переговоры на мероприятии Белинды Саттон в июне.
 Как ваши дела?
 Конечно, есть.
 Тогда хорошо.
 Итак, о Диане и Фрэнсис мы поговорим в другой день.
 Я поделюсь некоторыми предложениями и отправлю их команде для подготовки к апрельской встрече.
 Помните, что после июньской встречи вы будете в отпуске и вернетесь только в сентябре.
 Ладно, Морин, думаю, у меня было три минуты, прежде чем к нам присоединился адвокат Остин.
 Потом я поведу вас поговорить о ПРАЙДЕ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2441.175s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Да, это небольшой фактор.
 На последней встрече только что было упомянуто, что раньше мы спонсировали прайд.
 Интересно, что это такое?
 Не могу найти ничего в календаре города или просто пытаюсь найти информацию о нем.
 Я не знаю, знал ли кто-нибудь, что это был мой единственный зачисление на тот момент.
 Кажется разумным присутствовать.
 Но я ничего не предлагаю.
 В этом году может быть уже слишком поздно что-либо пробовать.
 Есть ли у кого-нибудь опыт в этом?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2474.619s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Поэтому HRC не спонсирует прайды.
 В 2022 году, когда в городе проводилось первое ежегодное мероприятие совета, Комитет по правам человека избрал двух членов для написания прокламации на церемонии флага гордости.
 Это после некоторых переговоров, так что я думаю, вы можете вернуться.
 Я имею в виду апрель апрель апрель 2022 года.
 И фотографии со встречи в мае 2022 года.
 Посмотрите, но это лишь часть серии выступлений на церемонии поднятия флага.
 Вот о чем может подумать CDH.
 Если CDH хочет большую часть. Если CDH хочет меньшую часть.
 Но помните: когда вы говорите «спонсорство», это означает, что вы действительно что-то делаете.
 Так это значит
 Вы покупаете еду.
 Так что ведите себя так, будто обед спонсирует HRC, или вы организуете мероприятие.
 Так это отдельно.
 Но если CDH заинтересован в посещении мероприятия по поднятию флага, вы можете обсудить и рассказать мне, как вы представляете свое участие.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2569.347s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Единственное, что я искал, но не нашел в городском календаре этого года, — это упоминание города.
 Работайте непрерывно.
 Где я могу его найти?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2581.437s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Вы не найдете его в календаре, потому что я работаю по графику мэра, а Прайд в этом году выпадает на субботу, что еще больше усложняет задачу.
 Месяц гордости начинается в субботу.
 Так что, если мэра не будет, ратуша будет закрыта в субботу, и вы знаете, что в субботу будет труднее поднять флаг.
 Еще мне нравится много голов.
 С этими событиями.
 Не просто люди собираются вместе.
 Знаете, должна быть цель и смысл.
 Поэтому я общаюсь с разными людьми за кулисами.
 Когда я получил согласованную с мэром дату, которая должна была состояться в этот день, то в определенное время теперь мне пришлось соединить все остальные точки за кулисами, переместить их и изменить, прежде чем мы сможем сказать: «Хорошо, это компания «да».
 Но могу сказать точно, могу лишь сказать, что город не хочет сохранять День флага Прайда и отмечать его до 31 марта.
 Знаете, это может звучать глупо, но в этих группах есть и другие.
 Это моя команда DPW.
 Я должен убедиться, что они готовы, маркеры не выцветают, их нужно перекрашивать и сначала красят утром.
 Так много всего происходит в фоновом режиме, прежде чем эта дата появится в электронном письме.
 Я имею в виду, это в календаре.
 Я не знаю, что этот город делал раньше.
 Я не знаю.
 Но именно так оно и работало последние два года.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2686.885s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Итак, я думаю, что я хочу сделать.
 Наш совет может не состояться в этом году.
 Это выглядит очень много.
 Я не знаю по радио, я не понимаю, может быть, я говорю, что если это агентство сможет что-то сделать в следующем году, отлично, а если мы сможем это сделать, если в этом году будет поздно или я не уверен, что произошло, это кажется очень неопределенным.
 Мы можем это сделать.
 Я думаю, давайте сделаем что-нибудь сами.
 Нам не нужно делать это в параметрах города.
 Поэтому я просто предлагаю своим коллегам, что это именно то, что мы рассматриваем, и, возможно, в следующем году мы посмотрим на другие некоммерческие организации, или я не знаю, интересно ли это кому-то.
 Я смотрю, заинтересованы ли люди в совместном достижении чего-то.
 Знаете, мне сейчас все это кажется туманным.
 Например, когда мы пытаемся что-то организовать для координации всех других команд, вы знаете, это более сложная задача.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2748.939s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Кто-то... Ну, Морин, я не уверен, в чем состоит настоящий вопрос.
 Верно, потому что вы сказали, что дела идут хорошо.
 Я просто хочу сообщить вам, что парад флага, который город проводит последние два года, еще не состоялся.
 Это правильно.
 Поэтому я хочу убедиться, что все ясно, прежде чем мы дойдем до тех, кто слушает, и тех, кто, возможно, слушает в другую сторону.
 Причина, по которой вы не видите дату, заключается в том, что в этом году выпадают выходные.
 Поэтому мне пришлось изменить свою стратегию.
 Но Комиссия по правам человека приветствует А., чтобы он сделал что-то самостоятельно,
 Посетить городское мероприятие, как раньше, или поддержать другие нужды?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2808.045s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Ну, я просто спрашиваю своих коллег, хотят ли они сделать что-то самостоятельно в следующем году?
 Я не знаю, есть ли такое или, может быть, ты знаешь, что я просто</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2822.128s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: Я могу соревноваться, поэтому думаю, что если я действительно захочу поднять национальный флаг в этом и следующем году и найти что-то еще, над чем можно поработать, мы обязательно посмотрим, будет ли это развиваться в следующем году. Морин, я открыт для этого и согласен с тобой.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2848.726s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Я думаю, было бы неплохо, если бы мы могли каким-то образом принять участие в этом году, на этот раз с такой же ясностью, как время, сроки или что-то еще.
 Хорошо, отлично.
 Я рад работать над тем, что мы можем сделать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2865.912s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Да, я полностью поддерживаю идею поддержать это мероприятие в этом году и в следующем.
 Если я правильно помню, Фрэнсис, кажется, в прошлом году
 Планируете ли вы в июне организовать в городе какие-нибудь мероприятия, чтобы отпраздновать это событие?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2886.887s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Это верно.
 В 2022 и 2023 годах Прайд будет длиться месяц.
 Прайд отмечается в июне, но на самом деле прайд проводится в октябре, поэтому в некоторых штатах прайд отмечается в октябре.
 Так что это глубже, чем поднятие флага.
 В этом есть элемент гражданских прав.
 Если я останусь честен в отношении своей роли и своей профессиональной карьеры, это будет здорово.
 Я признаю движение за гражданские права.
 За этим стоит гордость и права людей с ограниченными возможностями.
 Вы все связаны каким-то образом, формой или формой.
 Поэтому, когда мы проводим мероприятие продолжительностью в месяц, для меня важно, чтобы что-то произошло в течение этого месяца.
 Это не означает, что вы должны предпринимать все действия, но даже несмотря на то, что мы планируем это, показываем и даем людям варианты того, что произойдет в 02155, я думаю, что это полезно.
 Будет ли это полезно для тех, кто восстанавливается после травм, нанесенных членами ЛГБТК-сообщества, или для тех, кто думает, что хочет жить в Мексике?
 Знаете, с тех пор, как я приехал сюда два года назад, время от времени что-то случается, по крайней мере, каждую неделю, если не два раза в неделю.
 Но это не так, я не несу ответственности за все.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=2986.869s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Год 1 Да, но год 2... Думаю, именно туда я хочу пойти, а не просто поднимать флаг.
 Не то чтобы развеваться флагом плохо, но мне интересно, волнует ли эту команду, понимаете?
 Посмотрим, что еще мы можем сделать в июне.
 Я думаю, по крайней мере, некоторые люди сказали, что им было интересно.
 Замечательно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3013.797s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Внесите это в повестку дня.
 Я расскажу вам и помещу это в ваш календарь.
 Я поставлю его в парке, чтобы он продолжал вращаться.
 Но теперь с нами Остин Юрист, и я хочу позвонить Остину Юристу из KP Law.
 Для ознакомления с Правилами открытого собрания и обсуждениями на ту же тему каждый получит 48-страничный документ с Правилами открытого собрания.
 Итак, я надеюсь, что у вас готов вопрос, и да.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3057.75s">[Austin]</a>: 谢谢大家今晚邀请我来这里。
 也谢谢你，弗朗西斯科。
 很高兴见到大家。
 我认为这是一个好机会。
 如您所知，有一位新的代理总检察长，总检察长办公室最近更新了公开会议的法律指南。
 我始终认为，对已经服务了一段时间的会员和新会员进行一点复习是个好主意，只需向他们提供公开会议法的基础知识即可。
 在全州范围内，我们看到对公开会议法的质疑和投诉有所增加。
 我这样说是为了让每个人真正了解我们所生活的环境，尤其是在一个依靠技术的使用而蓬勃发展的环境中。
 我在与英联邦各城镇的公开会议中处理许多法律事务，自 2006 年以来一直从事这项工作。我希望这是一次真正非正式的会议，能够回答任何人的问题。
 我当然可以提供一个概述，而且我知道弗朗西斯科也分发了一些材料。
 我总是按照时间顺序开始并思考公开培训会议或概述。
 会议通知经会议纪要批准后予以公布。
 这就是我对连续体的看法。
 因此，我们收到警告，我们知道，像您这样的公共机构的法定人数所讨论的任何事情通常都必须在我们所谓的公开会议上完成，而不是在执行会议上，这意味着向公众开放，以便能够看到您的工作。
 实时。
 当我们今晚在这里时，这可以在 Zoom 上完成。
 这可以亲自完成。
 我们将四年前于 2020 年开始的远程订单延长至 2025 年 3 月 31 日。
 我们相信还有许多悬而未决的立法，这些立法将从这些立法中得到扩展。
 有很多谈判。
 必须采取哪些流程来继续这一工作。
 这就是为什么我们正在密切监视它，并将随时向您通报最新情况。
 但现在我们可以在 Zoom 上见面。
 我们从议程开始。
 所有事情都必须纳入议程，并在讨论内容方面具有合理的具体性。
 这意味着什么？
 嗯，这意味着坐在家里的公众会拿起或查看屏幕上的会议通知并进行实际分析。
 我想参加这个会议吗？
 这是我想感兴趣的话题吗？
 我想看到关于这个特定主题的公开、透明的讨论吗？
 所以我总是说，当你在社区工作或做志愿者时，你了解所使用的语言或缩写词，例如所使用的语言，但我们真的很想成为这样的人，你知道。
 向公众提供信息，以便他们可以自行决定是否参与。
 这些是会议通知的基础知识。
 我们知道，除非有紧急情况，否则需要提前48个工作小时发布，真正确保在公共机构的业务方面没有不发布的讨论。
 这是会议通知的概述。
 然后我们开始商议并在会议上讨论什么。
 我们知道没有理由参加执行会议，我很乐意回答有关此问题的任何问题。
 我们知道，公共机构的事务必须在公开会议上进行。
 这意味着公共机构的任何法定人数都不能以团体或系列的形式，从一个成员到另一个成员讨论问题。
 在正式公布的会议之外。
 如果我们退一步，公共记录法和公开会议法的目的是，你知道，我们称它们为太阳能法，以提高透明度并确保公众知道他们的社区正在发生什么。
 从这个意义上说，随着技术的使用，我们看到了增长。
 我总是警告这只是一个概述，所以今晚我们不会详细讨论。
 但我始终警告不要使用电子邮件、手机或短信与其他成员交流。
 根据公开会议法和公共记录法，这都具有法律意义。
 所以只是要意识到这一点。
 在这一具体问题上，我们从总检察长的开放政府部门得到了很多指导。
 包括多年前的许多裁决，这些裁决规定，一个成员向另一个成员发送电子邮件或短信，然后对其进行回复，无论是连续还是在正确发布的会议之外以小组形式再次回复，都可能构成审议。
 所以这是需要注意的事情。
 在投票和讨论方面，我们知道公共机构的业务是由公共机构的法定人数进行的。
 如果没有法定人数，这项业务肯定无法完整开展。
 总检察长办公室建议，如果没有达到法定人数，则不应举行会议并推迟到公共机构法定人数可以开会和召开的其他时间，无论是亲自还是远程，无论委员会的偏好如何。
 从那里我们知道会议纪要必须及时编写和批准。
 我们通常说这会在接下来的 30 天或三次会议中发生，根据您的会议安排以先到者为准。
 但当然，就像会议通知或议程一样，您必须小心，确保坐在家里的人得到会议纪要的副本并真正了解发生了什么。
 我们知道你必须有一些基本信息，你知道的，会议的日期和时间，出席或缺席的成员。
 如果会议是远程会议，则必须采用唱名表决方式，并且将进行所有投票。
 再说一次，有人，我称之为四角规则，有人记录会议记录，真正了解投票了哪些票，做了什么，你知道，有人知道会议中实际发生了什么吗？
 从那时起，这些会议记录将受到公开会议法和公共记录法的约束。
 社区成员当然可以提出要求。
 如果有执行会议，则这些会议记录有单独的流程。
 但同样，它们的起草方式必须精确而详细。
 我很高兴回答任何细节。
 我知道这是一次公开会议。
 这就是为什么我总是说我们所处的位置仅供一般信息参考。
 如果您对我们在哪里担任市议员有具体问题，我只是要求您直接或通过弗朗西斯科联系我，就这些具体问题考虑到其特权性质，但我很乐意回答或提供任何主题的概述。</p>

 Вы много раз упоминали собрания руководителей, и поскольку я вошел в эту сферу, мне не нужно превращать собрания в собрания руководителей.
 Можете ли вы поделиться чем-то немного другим?
 Люди, которые могут прийти к нам или которые не знают, что такое собрание руководителей, почему мы организуем собрание руководителей и некоторые параметры, связанные с посещением собрания руководителей, если мы используем виртуальную технологию (которой у нас нет виртуальной технологии).

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3765.467s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Обычно одна из проблем, с которыми мы сталкиваемся, — это… немного подождать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3772.109s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Прости, Роб.
 Морин встала и повысила голос.
 Интересно, сталкивался ли кто-нибудь с задержкой?
 Хорошо, ты в порядке.
 Нет, продолжил Роб.
 Хорошо, переходим к Робу, а затем к Морин.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3790.22s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Спасибо, Морин.
 Я потороплюсь.
 Я просто думаю о входящих электронных письмах, и если есть какие-либо вопросы, мы хотим ответить на них всей группой.
 Пока мы этого не сделали, опасаясь нарушить правила открытых встреч, поскольку это близкие и закрытые отношения, а не дискуссия.
 Я хочу услышать ваше мнение.
 Что касается того, уместно ли это или чего-то, чего нам следует продолжать избегать.
 Опять же, этот пример: вы знаете, отправляете некоторую информацию, и мы хотим, чтобы вся команда ответила.
 Именно тогда мы вернулись во Францию ​​и связались с командой. Это процесс, которому мы должны следовать?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3834.869s">[Austin]</a>: Хороший вопрос.
 Таким образом, генеральный прокурор сказал бы, что единственным уместным использованием электронной почты в соответствии с законом о собраниях является:
 Форумы государственных учреждений должны ограничиваться только целями планирования.
 Сможете ли вы прийти на встречу в пятницу, 13 марта?
 Готовы ли вы к этому особенному времени?
 Любое высказывание, даже если оно предполагает обмен документами с респондентами (что я считаю хорошей идеей), скорее всего, нарушит правила открытого собрания.
 Если есть информация о
 Не знаете, стоит ли нам встретиться по этой специальной теме? Можем ли мы поставить это на повестку дня?
 Возможно, это письмо дойдет до Франциско и президента.
 Когда дело доходит до обмена документами, я видел возможные решения в зависимости от уровня его содержания, но считаю, что любое выражение или убеждение может привести к нарушению правил встречи.
 Это очень строго.
 За этим стоит мыслительный процесс
 Мы все заняты и используем электронную почту и почту для многих вещей, и это может перерасти в серьезный разговор, или один участник может оставить комментарий, основанный на точке зрения другого участника, в электронном письме, при этом публика не сможет его увидеть.
 Вот почему я всегда говорю о лучших практиках.
 На мой взгляд, лучшее, что можно сделать в этой ситуации – это просто общение.
 Вы знаете непосредственно Фрэнсиса или, может быть, Фрэнсиса и других участников, но вы не можете отправлять электронные письма на основе каких-либо комментариев.
 Я знаю, это тяжело.
 Знаете, всегда возникает этот вопрос, знаете, могут ли люди использовать общий доступ к Google Docs? Или вы знаете, что мы — люди, которые раньше использовали технологии и проводили встречи, на которых нам действительно хочется вести такой бизнес?
 Чтобы общественность могла видеть.
 Это ответ на ваш вопрос?
 Да, спасибо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=3966.135s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Хорошо, отлично.
 Извините, еще слишком рано.
 Комиссару необходимо иметь много информации, будь то этот комиссар или другой комиссар, возможно, они видели где-то обучение или видели что-то, что, по их мнению, заинтересует команду.
 Эти сообщения обычно отправляются мне или в той или иной форме на мой почтовый ящик.
 я отправил
 Всем CC, которые отправляют его мне и делятся от имени других, не нужно отвечать, если интересно, пожалуйста, зарегистрируйтесь.
 Я знаю, что иногда людям кажется, что я их отключаю, потому что говорю, что им не нужно отвечать, но мне также не нужно получать полный ответ.
 Чтобы избежать самых невинных людей, о Боже, я посетил это мероприятие, это было чудесно.
 Потому что отсюда и мнения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4024.346s">[Austin]</a>: Или что-то не так, я думаю, что это мероприятие очень хорошее, я действительно думаю, что оно пойдет на пользу городу, и нам следует подумать о его проведении.
 Затем остальные один за другим отвечают: Согласен.
 Само по себе является выражением.
 В этом случае, я думаю, лучше всего отправить его Франциско.
 А в некоторых государственных органах, в которых я работаю, есть следующие документы в соответствии с правилами открытых собраний, поэтому, пожалуйста, не отвечайте.
 Это можно рассматривать как мягкое напоминание для тех, кто не хочет отвечать или давать советы избирателям или членам сообщества, но на самом деле это то, что будет обсуждаться на следующем собрании.
 Иногда на повестке дня будут обсуждаться возможности обучения или обновления экипажа.
 Потом будет раздел, где можно будет обсудить эти вопросы и общественность сможет наблюдать за обсуждением.
 Некоторые государственные учреждения также перечисляют переписку между встречами, а затем перечисляют отправленные сообщения.
 Это может привести к спорам.
 Среди членов о Специальном докладчике.
 Так что это еще один вариант.
 Но во многих государственных учреждениях, с которыми я работаю, в конце встречи или в любом электронном письме есть такое предупреждение: Пожалуйста, избегайте точного ответа, поскольку это может быть непреднамеренно, но если кто-то запросит эту публичную запись
 Некоторых респондентов видели.
 Является ли это нарушением закона о собраниях?
 Поэтому вам придется учитывать все.
 Морин У вас есть вопросы?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4139.648s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Да, я сделал это.
 Некоторые у меня есть, но я приму то, что случается с другими.
 Поэтому я внимательно прочитал закон об открытых собраниях, который приложил к нам Франциск.
 Я не вижу никакого упоминания о комитете, о котором говорю.
 Например, мы решаем, хотим ли мы провести конкретное мероприятие или спонсора.
 Есть еще два
 Меньше, чем большинство, решили, что они возьмут на себя это обязательство.
 Мы можем многое сделать за полтора часа в месяц.
 Это немного грустно, потому что у нас мало времени.
 Если на самом деле цель меньше, чем у большинства на собрании, и цель состоит в том, чтобы предоставить исчерпывающую информацию для рассмотрения на последующих собраниях, является ли это предметом Закона об открытых собраниях?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4201.547s">[Austin]</a>: Затем Генеральная прокуратура рассмотрит вопрос о том, создаст ли государственное учреждение подкомитет.
 Обычно не имеет значения, есть ли это кворум крупного общественного органа, если есть члены, и вы знаете, это не обязательно может быть формальный подкомитет, это может быть любая рабочая группа.
 Как член комитета, если бы они проголосовали за то, чтобы Роб и Морин были ответственны за этот конкретный инцидент, вы бы сформировали подкомитет или рабочую группу, возможно, в соответствии с Законом о государственных архивах?
 Знаете, люди должны понимать и уметь все.
 Некоторые из сообществ, с которыми я работаю, создают конкретное сообщество, проводят общественные собрания и говорят, что Морин позаботится об этом специальном вопросе, Роб позаботится об этом специальном вопросе, а затем мы снова встретимся на следующем собрании и реорганизуем группу.
 Но если госорган примет конкретное решение о передаче работы в эту часть госоргана, то я считаю, что закон об открытых собраниях применим.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4279.631s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Итак, что бы вы ни говорили, я хотел бы подчеркнуть, что вы говорите, что если эта организация скажет, что мы проголосовали за Морин и Роба для решения этого вопроса, потребуется общественное собрание.
 И наоборот, если они проголосуют «за», Морин, почему бы не проверить это?
 Можете ли вы сказать Морин и Робу, что они справятся с этим?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4298.376s">[Austin]</a>: Что ж, я думаю, нам придется это посмотреть.
 Я думаю, нам следует посмотреть на это свободно.
 Я имею в виду, единственное исключение - это если мэр не
 Согласно правилам встречи, вы сказали, что я попрошу Фрэнсис, Морин и Роба сделать что-нибудь для меня, верно?
 Что бы это ни было, мне нравится проверять это и давать несколько советов по написанию, но в основном это зависит от того, в чем заключается моя работа и каковы мои цели.
 Цель этого примера – дать совет всей государственной власти, верно?
 В вашем примере гипотезы
 Думаю, в ответ на это прокурор скажет, что создана рабочая группа или подкомиссия, которая будет поднимать вопрос о законе о собраниях.
 Я проверю, будет ли это один или два участника, но он очень обширен с точки зрения реализации и работы.
 Я всегда рассматриваю это как диаграмму: кто создал эту команду?
 Как это создают государственные учреждения, если вы или Франциско работаете с вами
 От вас могут потребовать соблюдения требований правил собрания.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4372.721s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Я не думаю, что команде нужно быть там, чтобы давать советы, а чтобы возобновить исследование, но это не тот случай, и я не думаю, что это совет.
 Я не говорю, что они встанут и скажут: «Хорошо, мы провели исследование и думаем, что вам следует это сделать».
 Это больше похоже на
 Они это сделали, и именно это сделал комитет.
 Им не обязательно это делать, но вы говорите, что это означает, что они дают советы, поэтому, если мы это сделаем, мы сможем рассказать людям, уведомить их за 48 часов, пригласить их присоединиться к этой дискуссии, встрече двух людей.
 Инцидент, и мы в порядке.
 Затем мы представим всю собранную информацию всему агентству.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4425.617s">[Austin]</a>: Да, я очень хочу обратить ваше внимание на седьмую страницу Руководства Генерального прокурора, где объясняется, что представляет собой публичное образование.
 Генеральный прокурор особо заявляет, что полного списка государственных учреждений, советов, комитетов, комитетов или подкомитетов, состоящих более чем из одного члена, не существует.
 Исполнительная или законодательная власть.
 Сюда входит любой многочленный орган, созданный для проверки или вынесения рекомендаций государственным учреждениям.
 Так что это очень широко.
 Вот что я имею в виду и кому подотчетна эта группа.
 Опять же, обычно бывают только исключения.
 Рабочая группа должна быть сформирована директором школы или мэром, на которого не распространяются положения закона о созыве собраний.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4481.063s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Но дело в том, что, как бы вы это ни называли, на самом деле агентство дает рекомендации.
 Это то, что я продолжаю слушать, как ты говоришь.
 И если это не просто предложение, если это исследование, вы сами говорите, что это предложение, верно?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4501.395s">[Austin]</a>: Что ж, нам придется посмотреть, где пройдет грань, но по своему опыту я могу сказать вам, что касается жалоб на правила открытых собраний для нашей команды и нашей команды, эти правила очень широки.
 На данный момент у меня есть конкретное решение, поэтому я рад поделиться им с Франциско, чтобы помочь всем иметь четкое представление о том, куда идти.
 Если тебя это интересует, Морин, я буду рад это сделать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4529.797s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Ну, у меня еще вопрос, я прочитал, что протокол заседания будет обнародован через 10 дней, вне зависимости от того, утвержден он или составлен.
 Итак, мой вопрос.
 Как их можно использовать?
 Интересно, устанавливает ли это закон открытости?
 Например, когда наших встреч нет на сайте города.
 Так, например, если бы вы, как новый участник, спросили, что произошло в июне, или если бы вы были на публике, вы бы подумали: «О, о чем вы говорите?»
 Я не уверен, какие позиции они принимают и являются ли они или нет. Я имею в виду, что это важно, и другое дело, если они будут завершены, если они будут одобрены или в черновой форме, они будут заменены утвержденными в последнюю минуту, и когда они будут одобрены, да, дневник будет написан. Я не знаю, как у вас все.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4599.139s">[Austin]</a>: Определите, кто будет писать вместо него, или только один человек, но ведите протокол.
 Когда они записаны, даже если они не одобрены, мы знаем, что это требование закона об открытых собраниях, если они находятся в форме проекта, и общественность представляет публичный отчет или запрос закона об открытых собраниях для получения протоколов этих собраний, даже если они не одобрены, иногда вы встречаетесь раз в месяц.
 Данный протокол должен быть представлен в виде проекта.
 Это общедоступная запись, поэтому любая запись, которая позволяет мне создавать резервные копии любых записей, созданных или полученных муниципальными служащими, должностными лицами, волонтерами, членами совета, членами комитетов, членами комитетов, подпадает под действие Закона о публичных записях.
 Сюда входят файлы, созданные на вашем персональном компьютере, в том числе SMS, включая электронные письма, если они относятся к городскому бизнесу.
 Затем кто-то из общественности сказал, что обычно они отправляют его в юридический отдел и говорят: знаете, Дженис, она была сотрудником по доступу к записям, и мне нужна копия этих протоколов.
 Если это черновик, Дженис свяжется с вами и спросит, есть ли у вас копия этого протокола.
 Ах да, это всего лишь черновик.
 Да, верно?
 Возможно, это протоколы общественных собраний, а не исполнительных заседаний.
 После одобрения публика получит одобренную запись, если она получит тот же запрос и одобрит запись.
 Протокол собрания не обязательно размещать на сайте города.
 Некоторые сообщества так делают.
 Некоторые люди не публикуют все протоколы своих встреч в Интернете.
 Часто это деятельность, которая потребляет городские ресурсы.
 Но это говорит о том, что они все еще находятся под публичным протоколом и правилами проведения собраний.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4705.229s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Это означает, что если кто-то чего-то хочет, он должен об этом попросить.
 Это краткий ответ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4712.071s">[Austin]</a>: Точно.
 Итак, это две части.
 Во-первых, закон о собраниях требует, чтобы эти протоколы были написаны, утверждены и подписаны.
 Это делается в соответствии с законом об открытых собраниях.
 Так что все остальное зависит от общественности.
 Запрашивайте и соблюдайте закон о публичных отчетах и ​​требования юридического собрания.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4735.277s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Итак, нет никаких условий, при которых это может быть.
 Людям просто нужно прийти в город и сказать: «Дайте мне эти минуты».
 Если вы хотите увидеть протокол прошлого года, вам придется это сделать.
 Вам необходимо сделать официальный запрос.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4752.186s">[Austin]</a>: Я имею в виду да или я не знаю, у кого он есть. Я не знаю, у кого есть протокол, но вы можете, э-э, я имею в виду, что обычно вам не нужно создавать для них официальную публичную запись, но вы знаете, я думаю, что они могут справиться с этим внутри себя как сотрудник государственной службы, Морин, но я думаю, что в целом мы хотим поддерживать последовательность в эту минуту.
 Вы можете проверить,
 Вы знаете презентации и то, как они получились или какой был подход.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4787.24s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: На самом деле я больше думаю о публике, чем о себе.
 Знаете, некоторые люди говорят: «Боже, я хочу посмотреть, что они делают».
 Я просто пытаюсь понять, как люди их находят.
 Вот и все.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4798.686s">[Austin]</a>: Да, я думаю, что обычно я бы сделал это, запросив конкретную публичную запись у сотрудника, имеющего доступ к этой записи, или попросив главу государственного учреждения сделать запись, которую он обычно имеет в соответствии с правилами раскрытия информации.
 Когда я вижу, что они идут.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4815.635s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Поэтому я просто хочу подтвердить, что протокол заседания хранится в трех разных местах.
 А еще есть электронная версия, которая занимает больше времени, потому что она отправляется в Medford Community Media.
 Да, это наше видео.
 Но что произошло в конце встречи
 Я знаю, что если запись будет одобрена, то это означает, что если записка будет одобрена и не изменена, я спущусь в комнату для свиданий и сделаю семь копий.
 Сейчас есть восемь экземпляров и я куплю один.
 Копия до сих пор у меня, оригинал и остальные хранятся в мэрии.
 Вы все еще в городском секретариате.
 Любой может присоединиться и попросить просмотреть протокол.
 Могу сказать только с апреля 2022 года по настоящее время.
 Но я не очень хорошо умею записывать.
 Обычно я отправляю ваш черновик в виде заметки, а затем отправляю его обратно на собрание.
 Так что это то, что нам всем нужно полюбить и начать с этим общаться.
 Морин подтвердила вам это?
 Хорошо, Роб и Дайан.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4902.737s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Да, спасибо.
 Я думаю, что скоро вступлю в обсуждение Подкомитета по рекомендациям и обмену информацией.
 Я хотел бы увидеть, как генеральный прокурор будет руководить дальнейшим движением.
 Находятся ли они в юрисдикции комитета после нашего 90-минутного ежемесячного собрания?
 Какие предложения есть у офиса для достижения определенного прогресса по этим вопросам в ходе встречи?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=4939.699s">[Austin]</a>: Поэтому я думаю, что если член группы хочет работать индивидуально или в команде одновременно, я могу с ним сотрудничать.
 Вы знаете, члены - это не агенты, городские чиновники и, конечно, двое или трое членов, которые хотят собраться вместе для этих обсуждений.
 Я лишь хочу отметить, что они будут показаны публике, верно?
 И соблюдайте правила встречи.
 Или так, я думаю.
 Запланировать дополнительные встречи просто было бы хорошим предложением или практикой.
 Что ж, но очевидно, что это политическое решение, и члены должны подумать об изменении вещей в соответствии со своей повесткой дня и так далее.
 Вы знаете, есть государственные учреждения, которые встречаются, особенно в самое загруженное время года и чаще.
 Затем мы изменим график встреч в зависимости от того, предстоит ли проделать значительную работу или нет, но вот несколько разных вариантов.
 Как я уже сказал, всегда есть возможность работать самостоятельно или с членом частного комитета, а затем при необходимости отчитываться перед небольшой общественной группой.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5014.173s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: я вижу
 Я думаю, что одна из проблем, с которой мы сталкиваемся, — это график встреч, который написан в нашей статье об интеграции.
 Справедливо ли интерпретировать это как немного расплывчатый совет?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5031.95s">[Austin]</a>: Конечно.
 Я имею в виду, я думаю, что действительно могу проверить правила.
 Они создали государственное агентство, чтобы посмотреть, что такое гибкость, но поскольку встречи являются открытыми и совместными, все, что нужно, — это надлежащая реклама и уведомление общественности о назначении дополнительных встреч.
 Итак, вы знаете, мы можем посмотреть на язык закона.
 Я рад это сделать и сообщить об этом Франциско.
 Но с юридической точки зрения открытого собрания, если оно опубликовано должным образом, и некоторые общественные организации опубликуют и откажутся, конечно, если у них нет кворума, или они опубликуют сообщение и заявят, что нам не нужно это собрание.
 Так что сдавайтесь.
 Но, по крайней мере, в книге Роба именно так.
 Опять же, в определенное время года бывают взлеты и падения в загруженности государственных учреждений.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5086.017s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: я вижу
 Спасибо
 Да, было бы здорово, если бы вы это проверили.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5089.159s">[Austin]</a>: Да, мне нравится это делать.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5092.02s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Молодец, Диана.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5093.08s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо
 Вау.
 Я заметил, что во время показа вы проверяли свой ресурс в Google, и просто подумал
 Вы знаете, это, очевидно, потому, что я заметил в своем исследовании других комиссий по правам человека, что они, кажется, публикуют свои дневники, вы знаете, хорошо организованные по годам и месяцам.
 Я слышал о некоторых людях, которые сотрудничают, например, публикуют сообщения перед встречей и используют Google Docs для совместной работы.
 О специальных заявлениях или другом контенте.
 Я просто пытаюсь изучить правила обмена через Google.
 Кто знает, если бы Google Drive рекламировался на сайте Комиссии по правам человека, смогла бы Sun решить эту проблему?
 Я просто хочу это понять.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5157.557s">[Austin]</a>: Очевидно, что это новая технология, которую мы наблюдаем в последние годы.
 И вы знаете, по моему мнению, любое сотрудничество в Google Docs, если оно произойдет, скорее всего, будет считаться целесообразным в соответствии с Законом об открытых собраниях, его реализацией и принципами, которые мы видели до сих пор.
 Что ж, есть вероятность, что при использовании Google Docs или любого другого инструмента для совместной работы это произойдет последовательно.
 Итак, я часто использую пример определенного набора минут, и Роб приходит первым и вносит изменения.
 Потом пришла Дайана и внесла изменения, но вы можете видеть изменения Роба, и тогда все было решено, а не на публичном собрании.
 Тогда, придя на встречу, вы увидите мнения других членов государственного учреждения по этим конкретным вопросам.
 Протокол собрания.
 Поэтому закон требует, чтобы физическое лицо могло вести протокол собрания или писать документ, но обсуждение и рассмотрение конкретных документов должно проводиться на открытом заседании, чтобы общественность могла видеть обсуждения самого государственного органа.
 Комплексная технология Диана.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5247.43s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Технологии сложны, и я знаю, что я работаю в сфере технологий, и мы не используем Google.
 Так что я действительно придерживаюсь этого.
 Обеспокоенный Google, и теперь, когда у нас есть мой искусственный интеллект ADA, сказал: да, мы улучшили удобство, мы это сделали.
 Моя сторона DEI такая: о нет.
 Итак, теперь это война
 Есть так много хороших и так много плохих вещей, и я просто хочу, чтобы кто-то помог мне принять решение, чтобы я мог сказать: «ОК, это то, что мы делаем».
 Комиссар, у вас есть еще вопросы?
 Поскольку мы присутствуем на публике, я рад предоставить им возможность задавать вопросы.
 Я не вижу никаких вопросов к комиссару.
 Барри, ты хочешь продолжить свой вопрос?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5310.006s">[Barry Ingber]</a>: Я надеюсь, что другие это прочитают.
 Тот факт, что мне пора идти, кажется, поднимает вопрос, который поднял Роб.
 Можешь представиться?
 Меня зовут Барри Ингебер.
 Я живу в Норт-Медфорде.
 Но когда дело доходит до Google Doc, мне интересно, изменится ли это мнение, если документ будет обнародован, чтобы общественность могла видеть ход обсуждения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5491.072s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Потому что сегодня вечером мы находимся в такой ситуации, даже когда говорим о том, действительно ли мы планируем что-то сделать для Месяца гордости в следующем году.
 Два члена комитета заинтересованы в расследовании этого дела.
 Так что же это значит?
 Сначала узнайте, что происходит в городе.
 Второй
 Какие идеи мы можем придумать?
 Затем продолжим и сообщим команде о том, что мы нашли, не о том, что мы знали наверняка, а о том, что мы нашли.
 Должны ли мы сделать это в одиночку и вернуться позже?
 Это то, что ты сказал?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5529.61s">[Austin]</a>: Да, так что вы можете сделать это отдельно и при посредничестве или общении.
 Вы узнаете последние новости через Франциско, а затем проинформируете все государственные органы о следующем шаге.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5550.323s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Это интересно, потому что не создает сообщества.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5553.764s">[Austin]</a>: Оно просто сломалось.
 Я знаю</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5555.664s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Меня это раздражает.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5559.185s">[Austin]</a>: Дело в том, что мы знаем, что технически закон об открытых собраниях не требует общественного обсуждения, но мы знаем, что
 По правилам открытых собраний за последние четыре года такое происходило миллионы раз, и общественность имеет право наблюдать за происходящим в режиме реального времени.
 Итак, наша цель — действительно суметь сбалансировать все это.
 Но я хотел бы опубликовать это конкретное руководство, чтобы люди поняли масштабы того, чего можно достичь.
 Конечно, это вопрос отсутствия кворума между сторонами в государственном органе, поэтому у них будут конкретные советы для Морин.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5607.276s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Я просто хочу привести еще один пример.
 Если вы помните, мы все получили то же сообщение, что и члены Массачусетского Альянса по правам человека в прошлом месяце, когда к нему присоединилась Дайана.
 Они работают над Zoom.
 Диана участвовала одна.
 Диана не отправила электронное письмо в комитет.
 Диана не спросила Фрэнсис, сможет ли она присутствовать.
 Диана присутствовала одна, но сказала:
 Арендатор. Можете ли вы включить меня в свой календарь?
 Я хочу поделиться своим опытом.
 Это может сделать любой член комиссии.
 У вас не так много внешних встреч или возможностей обучения, как у других моих комитетов, потому что MBTA выполняет определенную работу.
 Вам следует уделять этому больше внимания.
 Поэтому, если я его найду, я отправлю его по электронной почте, а вы отправите его сами.
 Если они почувствуют, что ими стоит поделиться с другими членами комиссии, они свяжутся со мной и попросят включить этот вопрос в повестку дня.
 Или иногда мне говорят: Франциск, ты можешь этим поделиться?
 На этот раз я этого не сделал, но, возможно, один из моих комиссаров смог бы.
 Именно тогда они могут делиться от имени других, не отвечая.
 Электронная почта.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5692.485s">[Austin]</a>: Я думаю, что если вы все захотите принять участие в тренинге, вы сможете это сделать.
 Это не нарушает закон о проведении собраний.
 Я считаю, что мы все глубоко заботимся о нашем городе и нашем сообществе.
 Вы, безусловно, имеете на это право.
 Вы знаете, вы имеете право внести первую поправку, чтобы сделать это.
 Есть еще два
 Вы знаете, закон не запрещает собрания.
 Знаете, вы можете посетить общественное мероприятие или мероприятие в городе.
 Вопрос в том, знаете ли вы, рассматривают ли члены государственных учреждений внезаседательные вопросы?
 Итак, за прошедшие годы я видел бесчисленное количество жалоб на то, что эти два человека посещали общественные мероприятия, ну, знаете, в память об этом человеке.
 О, но я слышу, как они шепчутся в коридоре.
 Итак, я знаю, что они говорят о некоторых вещах, о которых им следует говорить на конференции, верно?
 Или эти люди на общественном собрании, но вы знаете, это звучит так, будто они разговаривают, и я слышу что-то о X, Y или Z, и этого не должно произойти.
 Ой, это не идея или есть конференция, где вам всем интересны темы на профессиональном и личном уровне.
 Тогда вы сможете это сделать.
 Все хорошо.
 Я имею в виду, вы можете пойти на обучение.
 Реальный вопрос заключается в следующем: являетесь ли вы членом, так сказать, за пределами ваших полномочий, чтобы обсуждать вопросы, находящиеся в пределах вашей юрисдикции?
 Поэтому я просто хочу убедиться, что это ясно.
 Правила открытых собраний пытаются сбалансировать людей, знаете ли, сбалансировать их настолько, насколько это возможно.
 Хороший вопрос.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5795.704s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Спасибо, Джанель.
 Есть ли у кого-нибудь еще вопросы?
 Есть ли члены комиссии?
 Ах, я только что видел с нами двух человек.
 У Вас как у гражданина есть вопросы по закону об организации общественных собраний?
 Каковы элементы форума?
 Когда встречу отменят?
 Ну, я не вижу, чтобы кто-нибудь поднял руку.
 Итак, сейчас это 709.
 Юрист
 Остин, большое спасибо за ваше время и объяснения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5836.195s">[Austin]</a>: Спасибо, приятно со всеми вами познакомиться.
 Контролировать ситуацию буду как я, так и рабочая группа подкомитета.
 Приятно познакомиться со всеми вами.
 У Фрэнсис есть моя контактная информация, если вам понадобится помощь.
 Я всегда рад обсудить любые ваши вопросы.
 Я ценю ваше время сегодня вечером.
 Спокойной ночи
 Большое спасибо.
 Берегите себя
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5854.622s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: То же самое происходит и с вами.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5855.043s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Предстоит многое решить, но я надеюсь, что мы сможем получить документы, потому что я сделаю это и у меня будет время прочитать их, чтобы убедиться, что у меня не осталось вопросов, если у вас возникнут вопросы до прибытия адвоката.
 Но вы знаете, постарайтесь усвоить эту информацию и подумать о ней, чтобы попытаться быть более прозрачными для сообщества в отношении того, как мы работаем.
 Если мы зацикливаемся на мысли, что у нас только X встреч или что мы не можем их провести, то мы создаем в себе препятствия, которые мешают нам что-то делать.
 Опять же, повестка дня открыта для всех, верно?
 Нам не нужны три человека, чтобы знать, кто какое мероприятие проводит.
 Если Фрэнсис чем-то одержима, она может прийти, посмотреть, включить это в повестку дня и дать совет.
 Это не всегда необходимо в групповой среде.
 Если нам понадобится более крупный подкомитет и рабочая группа, нам понадобится больше встреч, если о них будет объявлено заранее.
 Это действительно вопрос прозрачности и публичного доступа.
 Надеюсь, вы найдете это полезным.
 У вас есть еще вопросы?
 Я просто ждал, чтобы узнать время, потому что мне нужно было спешить в офис в 7:30 утра.
 В противном случае наша печать останется на завтра.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5969.114s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Могу я что-нибудь сказать?
 Идеальный.
 Я благодарю вас всех.
 Очень хорошо и безупречно.
 Я так думаю.
 Идеальный.
 Благодарю вас всех, сегодня вечером была замечательная встреча.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001269&t=5982.993s">[Frances Nwajei]</a>: Эм, большое спасибо, хорошо, спасибо, так что теперь я собираюсь нажать кнопку остановки записи, чтобы начать встречу, гм, но перед этим кто-то должен запросить отсрочку, чтобы завершить встречу. Поэтому я хотел бы перенести встречу. Так кто это поддерживает?
 Спасибо, Стивен.
 Кто-нибудь действительно хочет переночевать?
 ок
 Я не вижу добровольцев.
 Все хорошо.
 Спасибо всем.
 Внимание</p>
