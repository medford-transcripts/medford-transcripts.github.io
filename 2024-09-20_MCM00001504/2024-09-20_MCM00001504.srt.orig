1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:01,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:05,497
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, Chris Shandor from the Davis Companies here, and it's about five after six.

3
00:00:06,657 --> 00:00:10,839
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm guessing most people who are going to check in tonight are already here.

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,320
[SPEAKER_16]: So welcome, and thank you for taking time out of your evening.

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,782
[SPEAKER_16]: A little bit of housekeeping before we get started.

6
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:21,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, Chris Shandor with Davis Companies.

7
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:25,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm joined by a couple of members of my project team.

8
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Most importantly, John Harding from Cube3.

9
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:34,464
[SPEAKER_16]: But we also have representatives from civil traffic as well.

10
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:41,046
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go through an early community engagement meeting tonight.

11
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:46,428
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to start by just walking through a little bit of the project.

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,669
[SPEAKER_16]: How did we get here?

13
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:48,709
[SPEAKER_16]: What the goals are?

14
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,630
[SPEAKER_16]: John Harding from Q3 will present.

15
00:00:52,648 --> 00:01:00,193
[SPEAKER_16]: some details on the project and after that, we will have plenty of opportunity for questions or feedback of any kind.

16
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:04,495
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to give feedback, there's two ways to do that.

17
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:14,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Down at the bottom of the screen, you can either go to the chat bar and click on chat down at the bottom.

18
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:21,645
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll see that menu bar down the bottom and type your question in the chat or

19
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:37,162
[SPEAKER_16]: If you go to raise hand under participants, you can do the raise hand.

20
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm having a little delay on my screen here.

21
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:50,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Under reactions, down at the bottom right, reactions, click on the raise hand, and you'll see this yellow hand come up on your screen.

22
00:01:52,116 --> 00:02:00,043
[SPEAKER_16]: and you will be recognized and have the opportunity to unmute and ask a question and we'll go from there.

23
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:08,289
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could, in the meantime, please keep your microphones muted and your cameras off so that people aren't distracted.

24
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,370
[SPEAKER_16]: I would appreciate it.

25
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,154
[SPEAKER_16]: The last thing I will say is this is not an official meeting.

26
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,036
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no vote coming out of this.

27
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,498
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no decisions being made at the city level.

28
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:27,142
[SPEAKER_16]: that would result in any project happening or not happening or changing in any way.

29
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:29,604
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just an early community engagement meeting.

30
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:36,849
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something that we've been working on with representatives from the city that they have asked us to do.

31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,812
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a project that's been in the works for a little while.

32
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:48,158
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been on hold for a while, and we wanted to have an opportunity to kind of remind the community of what's up.

33
00:02:49,532 --> 00:03:01,340
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that, I'm going to ask John to put the presentation up on the screen and we will walk through the presentation and then open it up to questions after that.

34
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:10,266
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, Chris Shandor, I'm Senior Vice President of the Davis Companies and I'm joined by representatives from our project team.

35
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:12,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please.

36
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:19,890
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

37
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,431
[SPEAKER_16]: So a little bit about the Davis Companies.

38
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:26,912
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been around for about 45 or 50 years, headquartered in Boston.

39
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:32,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, if we could just mute any background.

40
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:33,414
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

41
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,875
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been around for about 45 years.

42
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:43,997
[SPEAKER_16]: We are a real estate development company, owner, developer, operator of real estate.

43
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,698
[SPEAKER_16]: For those of you who are not familiar with us,

44
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:54,449
[SPEAKER_16]: We do a lot of office, residential, some industrial.

45
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:55,510
[SPEAKER_16]: We do some hotels.

46
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,473
[SPEAKER_16]: We just recently opened the new Omni at the convention center in Boston.

47
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:09,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Very diverse real estate development company with operations primarily in the Northeast, but we do have investments across the country.

48
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Included in that, we've done about 7,000 residential units, ground up development.

49
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:21,246
[SPEAKER_16]: And a total of about 12,000 units in our portfolio over that time period.

50
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:24,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please.

51
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:30,294
[SPEAKER_16]: These are just a couple of representative images.

52
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:31,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of these are local.

53
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:32,336
[SPEAKER_16]: You might know them.

54
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of them are out of market.

55
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,225
[SPEAKER_16]: But they give you an example of the kind of the diverse range of residential work that we've done.

56
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:51,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Reserve at Burlington was a friendly 40B with the town of Burlington that was completed in 2020.

57
00:04:52,007 --> 00:05:00,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of these projects are out of market, but you can see Telford 180 was a condo project in Austin-Brighton.

58
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:06,190
[SPEAKER_16]: The Mark in the East Boston, Long Island City you can see is more high rise.

59
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,311
[SPEAKER_16]: 1515 Comm Ave is one we've got in the works in Brighton.

60
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:23,856
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I just draw to your attention, one more down the bottom, lower right, One Cabot Road, that's an office building that we do own in Medford right now that we've owned for several years.

61
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:28,958
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is currently among other tenants, Amazon's in there.

62
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:30,918
[SPEAKER_16]: So next slide, please.

63
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,980
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an area context plan.

64
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,441
[SPEAKER_16]: The inner red ring is the site that we own, that's 970 Felsway.

65
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,491
[SPEAKER_16]: You may know it as where extra space storage is located.

66
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:47,912
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a large site.

67
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,192
[SPEAKER_16]: It's almost eight acres.

68
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:59,035
[SPEAKER_16]: And the building that's on there is a mix of one and two story warehouse and industrial space, totaling a little over 300,000 square feet.

69
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:00,056
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a big building.

70
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:06,018
[SPEAKER_16]: We acquired it in early 2019 from a long time owner family that had owned it since the 1960s.

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,783
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a mix of old structures that have been built over many, many years.

72
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:13,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of them are a hundred years old.

73
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:14,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of them are newer.

74
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,366
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a real hodgepodge of buildings.

75
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:21,149
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see by the different roof lines that you see on there.

76
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:35,758
[SPEAKER_16]: The outer ring, which is the 400 foot distance from our property line in every direction, if you were invited to this meeting, at least if you received a mailing,

77
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,384
[SPEAKER_16]: you are probably inside that ring.

78
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:45,365
[SPEAKER_16]: So folks who are on this call are folks who are in the immediate vicinity of this site.

79
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:51,186
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you can see surrounding the site, Felsway obviously going through the middle, running north-south.

80
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:57,347
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of residential to the immediate west and north and northeast.

81
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:04,008
[SPEAKER_16]: And then to the south, you can see some of the more industrial areas, the Anheuser-Busch

82
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:08,752
[SPEAKER_16]: plant down there, there's a BJ's in the lower right hand corner.

83
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:14,795
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you were to go a little further off this plan, you'd find a stop and shop and ultimately the Wellington T stop.

84
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide, please.

85
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:25,859
[SPEAKER_16]: So as we started working on this, what was interesting to us is the zoning map in this area.

86
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you can see, we just spoke about the different residential neighborhoods.

87
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,282
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got a single family and general residents to the west and to the north.

88
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:41,008
[SPEAKER_16]: You actually have some apartment zoning to the immediate north before reverting back to more of a residential area.

89
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:48,893
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the zoning to the south with a little pocket of residential right there in the industrial zone.

90
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:59,620
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually, if you look in some of the even in the light blue area, you can see that there is housing that exists in the industrial zone to the left of our site.

91
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:06,053
[SPEAKER_16]: The immediate left is Amaranth Place, which is condominiums that were developed about 15 or 20 years ago.

92
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:09,915
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some residential immediately south and west of that.

93
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:20,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Even coming across to the east side where it says zone one industrial, there's a new condominium project being developed over there.

94
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,580
[SPEAKER_16]: So definitely a transition zone.

95
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,622
[SPEAKER_16]: When we first acquired this site,

96
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:33,690
[SPEAKER_16]: We knew that we wanted to maintain the extra space storage operation in there.

97
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,571
[SPEAKER_16]: That's definitely a benefit for the community.

98
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:41,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's hold on to the previous slide just for a second there.

99
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, John.

100
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:42,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

101
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:50,196
[SPEAKER_16]: But the buildings to the west, the older buildings, actually, you can go ahead to that slide.

102
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,736
[SPEAKER_16]: You can go ahead to that slide.

103
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:52,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

104
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:54,457
[SPEAKER_16]: The older buildings that are in the yellow area,

105
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Those buildings are old wood buildings.

106
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:04,361
[SPEAKER_16]: They are not new state-of-the-art buildings by any extent.

107
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:08,904
[SPEAKER_16]: And we started looking for possible adaptive reuses for those buildings.

108
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:20,070
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, back in that, before we acquired the site in 2015, there'd even been some roof issues with the snow loads on the roofs in there.

109
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:25,784
[SPEAKER_16]: We knew that the highest and best use for this site was probably gonna end up being a redevelopment.

110
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:39,789
[SPEAKER_16]: And as we approached the city, it became really clear that there are two conflicting goals, not just in Medford, we see this everywhere, and those are the desire to create more housing, but at the same time, preserve a commercial base.

111
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:50,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Because of the zoning in the immediate vicinity, we did think that this site was probably better suited to residential development,

112
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,342
[SPEAKER_16]: But because it was zoned industrial, there wasn't a clear path to making that happen.

113
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:04,584
[SPEAKER_16]: In the past, Medfors has granted use variances for residential.

114
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:10,947
[SPEAKER_16]: But in 2019, that practice was stopped.

115
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't necessarily think that's a bad idea.

116
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:15,768
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want residential, you should zone residential.

117
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,349
[SPEAKER_16]: But in any event,

118
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:26,981
[SPEAKER_16]: there were still some avenues for proceeding with residential development, but it would have to be done through the 40B process.

119
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:35,104
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a process where if additional affordable housing is delivered, you can still pursue that change of use.

120
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:40,227
[SPEAKER_16]: We did submit a comp permit in early 2020, April of 2020.

121
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:44,809
[SPEAKER_16]: You may have seen some notices from back then and forgotten all about them, and I don't blame you.

122
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:50,514
[SPEAKER_16]: At the time, the city asserted safe harbor, which was completely within their rights to do so.

123
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,234
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a procedural protection.

124
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:58,737
[SPEAKER_16]: And the project essentially from any public process came to a stop at that point.

125
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:03,038
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been having on and off meetings with the city since then.

126
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:11,381
[SPEAKER_16]: But with the passage of time, we have been encouraged by the city to reengage with the community

127
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:17,210
[SPEAKER_16]: really to see what everyone believes the community needs are here.

128
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,312
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a couple of city officials on the call tonight, I believe.

129
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:22,473
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just monitoring.

130
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,356
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, this is not an official public meeting.

131
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:30,899
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just a chance for folks to listen to our presentation and give feedback.

132
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:36,903
[SPEAKER_16]: So just moving forward from there.

133
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:39,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Reminder, State Harbor doesn't last forever.

134
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:52,166
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't know what's gonna come out of this, but obviously we're very optimistic about the discussions we've had with the city in the past and are anxious to represent this project to the neighborhood.

135
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:58,130
[SPEAKER_16]: So existing conditions that we're looking at here, again, our site is outlined in red.

136
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,853
[SPEAKER_16]: The extra space storage operation is shown on the right side of the site.

137
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,515
[SPEAKER_16]: That use is going to remain in its current form.

138
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:09,077
[SPEAKER_16]: And in fact, it's actually expanding a little bit in there.

139
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:16,470
[SPEAKER_16]: There's been some vacancy come available in the very rear of the site that is conducive for them to expand into.

140
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,013
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to be putting another couple hundred unit storage units in there this year.

141
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,374
[SPEAKER_16]: So look for that to come if you need some storage space.

142
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,457
[SPEAKER_16]: The yellow area is really the older portion of the site.

143
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:29,158
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what we're here to talk about tonight.

144
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,220
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we're proposing to be redeveloped.

145
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,564
[SPEAKER_16]: The program that we are presenting is approximately 289 rental units.

146
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:45,931
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, 25% of those, or approximately 73 of those units, would be deemed affordable.

147
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:51,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody always wants to know what that means, so I'm just gonna address that right now.

148
00:12:52,572 --> 00:13:08,136
[SPEAKER_16]: If you were to go to any one of the other similar residential projects near us on Cabot, Rivers Edge 1 or 2, or some of the stuff over by the Whole Foods, and check and see how much units are renting for in there,

149
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,265
[SPEAKER_16]: They're expensive.

150
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:12,206
[SPEAKER_16]: They're about $3 a square foot and up.

151
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:24,871
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you were renting a 800 square foot apartment, 1,000 square foot apartment, you might be expected to pay $3,000, $4,000 a month or more, depending on the size, the number of bedrooms, et cetera.

152
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:32,635
[SPEAKER_16]: The affordable units are targeted at people who are making 80% of area median income, AMI.

153
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:34,719
[SPEAKER_16]: What's AMI?

154
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:40,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Area median income, again, it's average household income or median income, not average, sorry.

155
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:43,203
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a government stat.

156
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:48,265
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is about today, approximately $100,000 a year for a family.

157
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:55,829
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you're making 80% of area median income, you're making household income of approximately $80,000 a year.

158
00:13:55,989 --> 00:14:01,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So certainly not super low income, but not,

159
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,863
[SPEAKER_16]: not high income either.

160
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:21,316
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really what we call workforce housing targeted to teachers, police, firefighters, folks who work at retail, maybe somebody who's working at a restaurant at Assembly Square, good working class folks who wanna live and work in Medford.

161
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:28,042
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also targeted to folks who are perhaps just starting out, not ready to buy a house.

162
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:34,834
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also targeted to folks who perhaps are elderly, but still very mobile.

163
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:45,697
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not ready for assisted living yet, but maybe they don't want to maintain a single family residence where they have to shovel their walk and weed their gardens and do all the household maintenance.

164
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:53,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Those affordable rents, again, the market rents today in this area are probably $3,000, $4,000 and up a month.

165
00:14:57,453 --> 00:15:04,000
[SPEAKER_16]: The same product would be approximately $1,500 to $2,000 a month.

166
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,086
[SPEAKER_16]: So a fairly significant discount from what would be market rents.

167
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:14,770
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a qualification process that you have to go through to be eligible for those units.

168
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:21,357
[SPEAKER_16]: And if when we get to the point where we have a project here, that's certainly something that would be made available.

169
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:25,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, we have a long way to go before we're ready to talk about that.

170
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:33,601
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, these are targeted for working class folks making $65,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year on the affordable side.

171
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:38,683
[SPEAKER_16]: One last key note on the units that would be constructed here.

172
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:43,085
[SPEAKER_16]: There is no difference inside the units between the market units and the affordable units.

173
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:50,808
[SPEAKER_16]: If you were to open any door in any one of these projects that have this 25% affordability requirement, you can't tell the difference

174
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:54,465
[SPEAKER_16]: of the finishes that they're in there.

175
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:57,547
[SPEAKER_16]: All the finishes will be substantially identical.

176
00:15:58,227 --> 00:16:03,149
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is a little difference from rental versus for sale projects.

177
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:07,411
[SPEAKER_16]: On for sale projects, there can be slight differences on the affordable units.

178
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:09,231
[SPEAKER_16]: On rental, they are all the same.

179
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:19,443
[SPEAKER_16]: So I am going to turn it over now to John Harding from Cube 3, and he's going to walk you through the project.

180
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:27,846
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when John's done presenting the project, we'll come back to me and we will open up the question and answer process.

181
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,126
[SPEAKER_16]: So John, if you're ready, take it away.

182
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chris.

183
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:39,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Chris just mentioned, the area we're going to be focusing on is inside of the yellow dashed line right now.

184
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:46,819
[SPEAKER_00]: and the new development that is being proposed and that was submitted with the comp permit back at the beginning of 2020.

185
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:58,248
[SPEAKER_00]: So the site itself right now, as you can see here in the yellow line, is mostly a very pervious site.

186
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:02,431
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly a paved parking lot and roof surface.

187
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:15,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do here is really kind of bring back a life, a residential scale life to this area and bring back a lot more pervious and landscaped area to the project.

188
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:20,963
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very similar view to what we're just looking at the existing conditions.

189
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,985
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the foreground along Myrtle Street.

190
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:26,346
[SPEAKER_00]: So Myrtle Street is running east-west here.

191
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Amrit is coming through kind of at an angle.

192
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:33,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Along Myrtle Street, we're looking to kind of replicate the

193
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:45,448
[SPEAKER_00]: the vision of what's going on on the other side, take some cues from those houses and just kind of the repetitive kind of stoop nature.

194
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:49,010
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're bringing in some lower scale, three-story townhomes along that edge.

195
00:17:49,971 --> 00:18:02,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the back, further into the site, closer to the industrial uses beyond and to the industrial building that will remain, we're proposing a six-story multifamily building, five stories of multifamily over parking.

196
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:08,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's an access point further down on Amaranth here.

197
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:11,737
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into a little bit more of the site plan view in just a second.

198
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:22,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the site plan itself, you can see here, Felsways to the right, Myrtle Street is to the north, Amaranth Ave coming through along our western edge.

199
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:29,040
[SPEAKER_00]: The townhomes along Myrtle Street that I was just talking about, so there's 11 townhomes along Myrtle Street.

200
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,254
[SPEAKER_00]: a grouping of six and a grouping of five.

201
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:33,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those are two bedrooms.

202
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,658
[SPEAKER_00]: The townhouse one here at the end is a three bedroom townhouse.

203
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:41,100
[SPEAKER_00]: The main access from this for this area is coming through from the Felsway.

204
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:47,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd enter here, right in from Felsway going south, across the front of extra space storage.

205
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:51,947
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a roundabout here in the middle of the site for for drop offs.

206
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:55,950
[SPEAKER_00]: The main entrance to the building is here in this, this kind of nub that projects in the

207
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast corner of the site.

208
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:00,542
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little patio space next to that.

209
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a leasing and amenity space right inside there.

210
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:10,606
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little kind of outside amenity space at grade activating kind of what's going on in this back courtyard space down at the ground level.

211
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:18,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Further down past the townhouses, we'll have a little public pocket park and a top lot or a little playground for the neighbors.

212
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:24,892
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two features here will be open to the public.

213
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:33,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to that, there'll be a kind of a landscaped buffer to a fenced-in dog run that's for the residents of this project only.

214
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Sidewalks rebuilt on both Myrtle Street and Amaranth.

215
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there's not really a sidewalk along Amaranth on this side.

216
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:45,332
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have that sidewalk come all the way down and wrap the corner of the project.

217
00:19:46,192 --> 00:20:00,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here in the southwest corner, at least back when we were talking about the project in 2019, there was some talks about a potential future rail trail coming through along the old Boston and Maine rail line that's along the back of the site.

218
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:03,483
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, we're currently planning on

219
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:13,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if that comes, uh, how we might address that and be able to create a public connection, uh, from there and also create a kind of a. Amenity connection from the building.

220
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:21,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you have some activity coming out of this corner of the building here on this block, um, with a crossing here, um, and then an access point to that trail.

221
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:26,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, the idea of that trail is that it would connect all the way to Wellington station.

222
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:32,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as you can see it, just looking at the building, uh, it's kind of a kind of capital a shape building.

223
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:41,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Internal courtyard in the middle, an open courtyard to the south facing kind of a landscape buffer over towards where Anheuser-Busch is.

224
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:44,932
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a road that wraps all the way around.

225
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:52,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's mainly for fire department access and just to get some good continuity for the parking that is to our east.

226
00:20:53,272 --> 00:21:01,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of parking, talking about just what we have in the project, there's 377 total proposed parking spaces.

227
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:07,879
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is is about 259 spaces that will be inside the garage, the ground floor of the multifamily building.

228
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,082
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a 50 spaces on grade next to the building so that's here shown in red.

229
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:18,714
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 23 spaces in the townhouses, about half of those spaces are in garages.

230
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:23,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be 11 garage spaces and then 12 surface spaces outside of that.

231
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:28,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the extra space storage, we'll have 45 shared spaces.

232
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:31,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you see here in the orange highlighted area.

233
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the day, those spaces will be able to use by extra space storage for its tenants coming and going.

234
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:43,483
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't expect that they'll have 45 people coming and going on a daily basis, but we wanna make sure that we have ample,

235
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,649
[SPEAKER_00]: availability for them.

236
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:50,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the nighttime, as people are coming home from work, they'll be able to use those spaces.

237
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:56,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a nice shared arrangement between the industrial and the residential uses.

238
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:05,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going down to the floor plans here, I'm gonna try to go quick and we can, when there's questions and answers, I can flip back to any of these sheets if people have some more questions.

239
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:10,270
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, so I kind of rotated everything to the side.

240
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So Myrtle Street is now to the right.

241
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Amherst is at the top of the page.

242
00:22:14,737 --> 00:22:18,179
[SPEAKER_00]: You're coming in, you see that drop-off space here in the bottom right corner.

243
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:24,022
[SPEAKER_00]: The townhouse is along the right-hand side, along Myrtle Street here in the blue.

244
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:30,185
[SPEAKER_00]: The red area identifies the resident amenity and leasing office, so where the main entrance to the building is.

245
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:32,106
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the full-time leasing office is.

246
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:37,609
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a little bit of mail and coffee station and some stuff like that.

247
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,938
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bike storage component right behind that.

248
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:46,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of this floor plate is mostly for parking and kind of some service related uses as well.

249
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving up to the second floor, this is where your main amenity is here in the bottom right corner.

250
00:22:52,961 --> 00:23:00,402
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of double height space as soon as you walk in and get that grand gesture, looking up into what that would be that active zone beyond.

251
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:03,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that connects over to the internal courtyard.

252
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:20,196
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I meant to say earlier, with this project, we're going to actually be increasing the usable open space from 0% now to about 22% between these courtyards and the landscaping down at grade, especially around the townhouses, the pocket park and the top lot.

253
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:28,142
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these two courtyards, what you're going to end up with is kind of a more internal, quieter focus.

254
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:32,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have some fire pits and grilling stations, a nice place to kind of come hang out on

255
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:40,402
[SPEAKER_00]: some lounge chairs and hang out, read a book, maybe some quiet amenity space here in this internal courtyard.

256
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:44,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe a little bit more active space with the pool facing south.

257
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:47,146
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this image, south is to the left.

258
00:23:48,046 --> 00:24:01,173
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've oriented the building in this courtyard in this direction, primarily for the sun coming into this courtyard, but also as a nice buffer from the neighborhood that is up into the right from this image.

259
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:02,294
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building will create

260
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:06,771
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a screened buffer for any of that active use for the pool.

261
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:11,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving your way up, so this is a typical floor plan.

262
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:15,667
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see mostly just the units on the upper floors, levels three through six.

263
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talking about the ratio really quick.

264
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:23,909
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 28 studios, which is about 10%, 142 one beds, about 50%, 89 two beds, about 30%.

265
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:25,149
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 10% three beds.

266
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Chris mentioned, 25% of that will be affordable.

267
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:44,510
[SPEAKER_00]: just walking you through into what this building could look like.

268
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:53,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're here to present a conceptual plan of the work that we were doing up until the

269
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:59,108
[SPEAKER_00]: comp permit submission.

270
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,850
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're here to propose tonight is just kind of a conceptual image of what this project could look like.

271
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:11,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing in here is finalized as, as Chris mentioned earlier, what we're really here to do is get your feedback about what we're seeing.

272
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:17,416
[SPEAKER_00]: So this image here is from the inside of the courtyard.

273
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:26,380
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're driving in extra space storage is to your left, you see the rear of the townhouses here to your right, you see those garage entrances to those garage spaces.

274
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:32,574
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some bolt-on balconies here, so kind of Juliet-style.

275
00:25:33,175 --> 00:25:40,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back over the main entrance here, the main entrance to the garage itself further here in the distance beyond the main entrance.

276
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:45,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is that little kind of drop-off space right here in front of the main building entrance.

277
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:54,223
[SPEAKER_00]: just talk about some facades, you know, these are pretty boring drawings, just some graphics here to talk about the materials that we're proposing.

278
00:25:55,144 --> 00:26:02,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice high quality masonry base, storefront at the amenity entrance and at those amenity spaces as you get to the second floor.

279
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:06,136
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that kind of here in these foreground images.

280
00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:16,025
[SPEAKER_00]: As you move up the building and further away from kind of the main view lines, moving to a lot more of a fiber cement panel and fiber cement siding approach.

281
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:23,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these next couple slides, we'll show you a couple of buildings that I've worked on personally in Medford.

282
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:29,577
[SPEAKER_00]: where we've done similar sized projects with similar quality of materials that you guys can go.

283
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:35,043
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably actually know some of these and you guys can go around the corner and check them out if you don't.

284
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:42,092
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see the same kind of quality of materials, same types of materials used as what we're going to be proposing here on this project.

285
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:48,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So over on Rivers Edge Drive, the image on the right is Rivers Edge, or the residence at Rivers Edge.

286
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:58,567
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the side facing out on Rivers Edge Drive, you got this kind of courtyard at grade, a little bit of a landscape buffer you see the arbor right there at the edge of the courtyard space, you see

287
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:11,396
[SPEAKER_00]: brick used on the lower levels to create a nice base, some architectural expressions at the top with a hat, and some, you see the fiber cement panel is the white panel that was used on that project.

288
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:19,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Right across, literally across the driveway from that is RE150, kind of its sister project.

289
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:23,583
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of use of fiber cement lap siding, some panel product.

290
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:26,805
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can really do some really cool expressions with like

291
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:32,155
[SPEAKER_00]: creating these frames that wrap corners or even bring in some wood tones down at the main entrance at the ground level.

292
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:36,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is to play with a lot of these different materials.

293
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:41,778
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the Juliet balconies, a little bit of metal panel in this project instead of masonry.

294
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,119
[SPEAKER_00]: So change it up just a little bit.

295
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:53,503
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was a much more commercial approach, whereas the residence at Riverjudge was more of a mixed-use, multifamily approach.

296
00:27:53,523 --> 00:27:57,704
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably a little bit more closely to what we'd be proposing on this project.

297
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:01,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Just down the street, you have Modera Medford.

298
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,686
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at 5 Cabot Road, right

299
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:07,980
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much right behind the project that Davis owns, right over there.

300
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's right at the edge of Route 16.

301
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:15,166
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably seen this from a different view than what you see here in this image.

302
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:22,853
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you get the wood, you get some arbors, some aluminum railings, you see some of that storefront at the main entrance.

303
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:36,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Really kind of the same quality and scale of project is what we're proposing here, and then more recently and just recently opened right across from Wegmans you have Windsor mystic river apartments.

304
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,364
[SPEAKER_00]: with the big overhang at the front entrance.

305
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:40,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys have seen that.

306
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:45,648
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of lap-siding approach here with some panel infills.

307
00:28:46,088 --> 00:29:01,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these projects, you really see a good representative of what it is that we're looking to bring into the multifamily project, and then taking some of those same pallets, scaling them down a little bit, and making kind of a nice neighborhood complement to the townhouses.

308
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:07,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, again, just two quick views, and then we'll open it up for questions.

309
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:16,295
[SPEAKER_00]: On Amaranth Ave, we're standing kind of like right across from 32 Amaranth, which is this greenhouse on the left, looking down towards the project site.

310
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here the multifamily building as it touches the corner.

311
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,816
[SPEAKER_00]: The tot lot is right here in the foreground.

312
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:24,837
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see a little slide going on right there.

313
00:29:24,857 --> 00:29:27,057
[SPEAKER_00]: And that little pocket park is right there.

314
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:30,078
[SPEAKER_00]: The townhouse is just behind these houses to the left.

315
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:33,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking down Myrtle Street, again,

316
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:59,796
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here was really to create a nice transitional design from Myrtle, helping to complement and fulfill kind of what the streetscape should be, take cues from across the street with all the stoops and the stairs up to porches, and kind of bring that in across the street and make a really nice kind of three-story scale approach to the street, incorporate some lighting and some nice high-quality materials.

317
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, we'd like to open it up.

318
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:08,418
[SPEAKER_00]: for some questions and feedback after Chris concludes this.

319
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, John.

320
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:16,282
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe actually, if you could pause the screen for a second.

321
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, just a reminder to everybody.

322
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,905
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go.

323
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we can start to see.

324
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:27,128
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not an official public process yet.

325
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,129
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an early community engagement meeting.

326
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:31,270
[SPEAKER_16]: So there will be plenty more chances

327
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:37,788
[SPEAKER_16]: for engagement further down the line, to the extent a project evolves here.

328
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:45,895
[SPEAKER_16]: We're here to listen, and I appreciate the vast majority of you all being polite during this process.

329
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:58,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, two ways to ask questions, and I can already see five hands have popped up, and I'm going to, we'll start calling on people one by one in a moment here.

330
00:30:59,472 --> 00:31:09,574
[SPEAKER_16]: If you go down to where it says reactions in the lower right hand corner of the screen and click on that, you can see the click to raise hand and a little yellow handle appear on your screen like that.

331
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:18,416
[SPEAKER_16]: If you did that by mistake or your question gets answered, you can see where it just says lower hand and you can put your hand back down and we'll call on you.

332
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:20,036
[SPEAKER_16]: The other way is in the middle.

333
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:21,976
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a chat box there.

334
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:25,277
[SPEAKER_16]: You can type your questions in the chat box and we'll

335
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:28,088
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll try and do a little mix of both.

336
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:32,109
[SPEAKER_16]: I did see some questions pop up in the chat box.

337
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:36,810
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe while people are thinking about their questions, I will answer a couple of those.

338
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:39,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one, this is a rental project.

339
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:42,192
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not a for sale project.

340
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:51,215
[SPEAKER_16]: So all units here will be available on a rental basis, much like some of the other projects that John was referring to.

341
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:59,612
[SPEAKER_16]: And somebody thank you answered my one of the other questions, which is the city typically requires 10 to 15% affordable.

342
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:06,353
[SPEAKER_16]: This project because the nature of the process would be increasing that to 25% affordable.

343
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:18,836
[SPEAKER_16]: The last question that was on there, actually I think there were a couple more but one was the construction timeline we don't have that yet obviously we're not sure when we'll get through the permitting process and finish our design.

344
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:31,619
[SPEAKER_16]: I would not anticipate construction starting here for over a year, depending on how quickly the permitting process and the design process goes.

345
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,740
[SPEAKER_16]: So conceivably, we could be starting in late 2023.

346
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:40,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps a spring of 2024 start might be more realistic at this point.

347
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:42,384
[SPEAKER_16]: But really, honestly, it's too soon to tell.

348
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:46,146
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I know somebody asked about traffic on the Fells Way.

349
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,572
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have, Vanessa is our traffic consultant.

350
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,095
[SPEAKER_16]: They're very familiar with traffic in this neighborhood, in this community.

351
00:32:54,216 --> 00:33:02,903
[SPEAKER_16]: We've actually started the preliminary traffic study and certainly we'll be addressing all of that through the city process at the appropriate time.

352
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:14,813
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, other questions in the chat we'll get to, but I think right now I see about half a dozen hands up already and they're popping up kind of in order on my screen.

353
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:19,297
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to start with Barry Ingber.

354
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:24,439
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you want to go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.

355
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, thank you.

356
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:44,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's going to be a lot of opposition from folks who don't want to ever see anything change and want to freeze time, but I want to express my wholehearted support, both for the concept

357
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:47,454
[SPEAKER_14]: and for the location.

358
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:55,217
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it'll be a great improvement to the neighborhood, that it's close to public transportation and it's a good use of space.

359
00:33:56,557 --> 00:33:59,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have two questions, comments.

360
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:10,203
[SPEAKER_14]: One is that I would like to see at least some of the units at a deeper level of affordability.

361
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that,

362
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:22,072
[SPEAKER_14]: people at the 80% AMI income range are having a really, really hard time right now.

363
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:30,040
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that people below 50 or 60 are having an impossible time right now.

364
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:36,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would like to see at least some of those units be at a greater level of affordability.

365
00:34:37,682 --> 00:34:53,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and, uh, my second, uh, comment or question, uh, or somewhere in between is, um, that I hope that you're planning to be in compliance with the city of Medford solar roof ordinance.

366
00:34:54,074 --> 00:35:02,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I have a, uh, particular interest in that as the person who first formulated it and, um,

367
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:09,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I, and I'd be happy to talk to you all about it offline.

368
00:35:09,945 --> 00:35:13,347
[SPEAKER_14]: If, if you want to do that, you can find me through Alicia.

369
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:16,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

370
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for your comments, Barry.

371
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:18,990
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate them.

372
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, uh, we're, we're gonna, we're gonna take everybody's comments here.

373
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:31,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so I, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, uh, try and answer one at a time, unless it's just a simple clarification.

374
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,751
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure about how to do that.

375
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:40,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure it's something we can negotiate with the city, but I will have to look into the affordability levels.

376
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:44,434
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it's a great question and we will definitely look into that.

377
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:48,335
[SPEAKER_16]: The solar, yeah, that's a requirement.

378
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:49,936
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll have to figure that one out too.

379
00:35:53,457 --> 00:35:53,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Barry.

380
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:58,419
[SPEAKER_16]: I will go to Alison D'Agostino.

381
00:35:59,059 --> 00:35:59,619
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

382
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:01,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, thank you.

383
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Great presentation appreciate it guys.

384
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:14,837
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit of a two part question but am I correct I reviewed the proposal, initially, you do not your property line does not include all of

385
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:23,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Amaranth have sufficient to create an access point for as far as like travel, right?

386
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:31,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Like as far as like basically the only two access points out of this property would be onto the Felsway and Myrtle Street, is that correct?

387
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:37,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now we have access to Amaranth in the back.

388
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:53,102
[SPEAKER_16]: But you're right, a portion of Amaranth is a public street and then a portion of Amaranth as you get further south becomes effectively a private way with the lot line being right down the center of the street.

389
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:56,746
[SPEAKER_16]: But currently we do access Amaranth in the back corner.

390
00:36:57,362 --> 00:37:04,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I, you know my initial, you know, I'll be very brief I know there's a lot of hands so my two major concerns, access.

391
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we're on the fells way route 28, again I appreciate that you've hired

392
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:11,743
[SPEAKER_11]: know, and going to do your due diligence.

393
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:14,423
[SPEAKER_11]: But quite frankly, I can barely get out of my driveway.

394
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:17,745
[SPEAKER_11]: I live on 1024 Felsway as it is now on a morning.

395
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:30,148
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're putting that many units, I'm sorry to say, I really don't think that that's going to be an easy thing for anyone in the neighborhood to be able to drive and access.

396
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:32,109
[SPEAKER_11]: And the secondary is,

397
00:37:32,729 --> 00:38:00,532
[SPEAKER_11]: if I remember correctly your proposal didn't include any infrastructure upgrades right for as far as you know again it's zoned for commercial right so there's no um you know electric plumbing all those sort of things thinking of that many units on top of the parking and I appreciate the number of parking spaces I think someone said I agree still you know essentially you're you're limiting to one maybe one and a half per unit uh

398
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:04,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope most folks will utilize public transportation.

399
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:10,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love the spaces that you've done, you know, down a few streets.

400
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:16,485
[SPEAKER_11]: But as you know, the traffic and parking situation is vastly different.

401
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:17,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we're on route 28.

402
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:20,027
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a four lane highway, essentially.

403
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:22,369
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are just my major concerns.

404
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:25,071
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to comment.

405
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,412
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, appreciate your time.

406
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:26,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, someone

407
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:28,685
[SPEAKER_11]: packed into your presentation.

408
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:31,409
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a little messy, but thank you.

409
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:33,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Allison.

410
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:36,416
[SPEAKER_16]: We know traffic will be a concern of a lot of folks in the neighborhood.

411
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:39,660
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's certainly something we're prepared to work on.

412
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,942
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for your comments.

413
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:48,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Matthew Lemming was next in the queue.

414
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:51,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, thank you for a very good presentation.

415
00:38:51,827 --> 00:38:54,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one of the simpler questions.

416
00:38:54,848 --> 00:39:00,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So you threw around a bunch of numbers near the beginning of the talk, especially around the affordable housing.

417
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:07,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you mind if I just repeated and asked for clarification on some of those just to make sure I got everything right, because I was writing those down.

418
00:39:08,703 --> 00:39:10,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, I'll just go over them again.

419
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:12,366
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you have a simple question, go ahead.

420
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:16,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, 80% are very medium income to qualify for one of the 25% of the 289 residences in the building.

421
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:24,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

422
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:27,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And area median income in Medford is about $100,000.

423
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:34,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you said that the average per square foot rate for something in Medford is $3.

424
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is the average per square foot rate for one of the affordable units?

425
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,871
[SPEAKER_16]: So the average market rents that we're seeing, and again, these are average.

426
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:44,591
[SPEAKER_16]: They can vary.

427
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:49,113
[SPEAKER_16]: But the average market rate for new Class A is probably about $325,000 to $330,000 per square foot.

428
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,783
[SPEAKER_16]: The average affordable unit would probably be around $2 a square foot today.

429
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:07,768
[SPEAKER_16]: And those units would be, you know, for the same exact unit, you would just have to qualify based on income for the affordable units.

430
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:18,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I saw in the news, a news article that the land acquisition for this costed 25 million.

431
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:22,952
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the total costs been thus far for development, if you're allowed to share that?

432
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:28,133
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't need to get into that right now, but it hasn't been much because we're just very early in the process.

433
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:28,573
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

434
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:28,953
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

435
00:40:29,254 --> 00:40:30,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

436
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

437
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:31,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Matt.

438
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:37,575
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to look at a couple of the questions in the chat for a second.

439
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:43,726
[SPEAKER_16]: because I think we said we'd bounce back and forth.

440
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:51,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Rachel Blumenthal says, wondering if she might be able to work with the city to create safer pedestrian crossings around the project.

441
00:40:51,849 --> 00:41:03,653
[SPEAKER_16]: We already have issues with Amaranth-Lawrence-Myrtle intersection, adding this many new people and cars to the neighborhood will only make it more dangerous and probably wishful thinking, but getting a walk sign to cross the Felsway at Myrtle would be incredible.

442
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:05,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually,

443
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:15,734
[SPEAKER_16]: The improving the crossing at the Myrtle Felsway intersection is something that's on our traffic engineers list of potential improvements to the neighborhood.

444
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:20,877
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's not as far fetched as you think, Rachel.

445
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:33,323
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's something that, you know, as we go about working on this project, there will be traffic mitigation and most of those mitigation opportunities are gonna be in improving pedestrian crossings.

446
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:35,524
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a good question, thank you.

447
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:41,616
[SPEAKER_16]: The next hand in my window was Paul Terenzi.

448
00:41:43,696 --> 00:41:44,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, how you doing tonight?

449
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:45,377
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm good.

450
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:45,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Paul.

451
00:41:45,997 --> 00:41:46,557
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?

452
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:47,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, thanks.

453
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:54,658
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of my main concerns is when you start construction, underground water flows to least resistance.

454
00:41:54,678 --> 00:42:00,219
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you start putting walls up, support walls, that water underground needs to go somewhere.

455
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And my concern is that's going to end up in my basement.

456
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,112
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very valid concern, Paul.

457
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:08,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for that question.

458
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:11,335
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not proposing to do any large scale excavation here.

459
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,097
[SPEAKER_16]: The parking will not be below grade.

460
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:21,243
[SPEAKER_16]: We know that digging in this area, like a lot of areas that are close to the water, creates issues just like that.

461
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:25,607
[SPEAKER_16]: This project will be slab on grade.

462
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:32,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So other than excavation for standard spread footings, we will not be doing a lot of digging here.

463
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:33,973
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would hope that there would be no,

464
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,921
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure you must be close.

465
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:38,582
[SPEAKER_16]: I would hope there would not be any impact to your basement because of that.

466
00:42:39,402 --> 00:42:40,063
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there is?

467
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:45,285
[SPEAKER_16]: If there is, we'd have to find out what the cause of that was.

468
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:52,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I would suggest that during the permitting process, that's something we'd have to look at.

469
00:42:52,889 --> 00:43:00,533
[SPEAKER_16]: We would typically go out and survey neighbors before any construction starts to make sure we know what the condition is before we do any work.

470
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:08,372
[SPEAKER_16]: But I you know I honestly because of the nature of the construction being all above grade I can't imagine that there would be any impact on your property.

471
00:43:09,072 --> 00:43:12,232
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the location of your what's your address.

472
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,233
[SPEAKER_16]: 132 Myrtle directly across the street directly across the street.

473
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:15,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

474
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:17,754
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to make a note of that.

475
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:21,675
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's certainly something that we would be very careful about.

476
00:43:23,038 --> 00:43:27,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that, and everybody else already touched on it, the traffic coming down Myrtle Street?

477
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:30,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we can't get through now and there's only four houses.

478
00:43:31,222 --> 00:43:40,347
[SPEAKER_10]: You put all those houses and all that additional traffic, I just don't see that working, unfortunately.

479
00:43:42,068 --> 00:43:42,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Understood.

480
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:44,409
[SPEAKER_16]: We hear you on that.

481
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:46,350
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's definitely something that we will have to get through.

482
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,111
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for those comments.

483
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:50,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

484
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Sue Fitzgerald, you're next with the hand up.

485
00:43:55,996 --> 00:43:56,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

486
00:43:56,896 --> 00:43:59,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to thank you for the presentation.

487
00:43:59,257 --> 00:44:01,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also an extrema butter.

488
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:05,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I am in the corner condo right across from where you're going to put in a park.

489
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:08,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would have no screening.

490
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:21,002
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, because of that exit road on the back of Emirates, I can't even have a six foot fence because it's a corner and cars come out of there and turn onto Myrtle to exit.

491
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:22,768
[SPEAKER_09]: both directions.

492
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:24,729
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a concern for me.

493
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:28,551
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the two separate condo townhouses on the corner.

494
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:43,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the fact that you're putting those three-story townhouses on the Myrtle Street side, but I will be staring at a six-story building, which is challenging because this is a neighborhood that's not like River's Edge.

495
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:49,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an open, unused, barren area of warehouses that were already torn down.

496
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:51,380
[SPEAKER_09]: This is smack in the middle of

497
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,521
[SPEAKER_09]: a mostly residential area.

498
00:44:53,622 --> 00:45:11,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And although I know that Amaranth Place was the old waterworks site, again, having this many houses and, you know, single and two-family houses, and then having a six-story building sort of plopped in the middle with most of your green space and amenities inside a courtyard.

499
00:45:11,735 --> 00:45:14,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So although you have a little pocket park on the corner,

500
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:22,905
[SPEAKER_09]: that doesn't mitigate, you know, the extreme shading out of everybody else, you know, who's backing up on the property.

501
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:27,830
[SPEAKER_09]: And then my last point has to do with, we know these are crummy old warehouses.

502
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:35,036
[SPEAKER_09]: My concern is also demolition that we worry about, you know, rodent mitigation and things like that, because again,

503
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Those critters are out there now.

504
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:43,976
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have wild turkeys and possums and all sorts of other critters running around the area.

505
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:48,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, it's just something that has a bit of concern.

506
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,963
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have one of the few condo townhouses in our development that has a backyard.

507
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:59,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see being able to enjoy that quite the same if there's a six story building.

508
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do think that's an issue for us that, you know, six stories is just too high.

509
00:46:05,373 --> 00:46:07,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that you have your ground level parking.

510
00:46:09,095 --> 00:46:17,220
[SPEAKER_09]: If it was a bit shorter, it would probably be more palatable, but obviously you wouldn't make your, you know, you wouldn't make back your money on the development.

511
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So just wanted to put that up there.

512
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:20,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for the time.

513
00:46:20,162 --> 00:46:22,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'm also sorry for whoever the bozo was before.

514
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:23,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

515
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:25,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Sue.

516
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:25,926
[SPEAKER_16]: All good comments.

517
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:26,707
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate them.

518
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,208
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm happy.

519
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:30,350
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be sure to stay in touch.

520
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:30,771
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure.

521
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

522
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:36,076
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to do Paul.

523
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:38,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Paul, did you go already?

524
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:39,399
[SPEAKER_16]: How about Michael?

525
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:42,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I see Michael there with your camera on.

526
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:43,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

527
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:44,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

528
00:46:44,684 --> 00:46:45,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Michael.

529
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:45,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

530
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:46,145
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?

531
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good.

532
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:50,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having dinner so I didn't get to hear all the presentation.

533
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:58,001
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you say it's not it's still commercially zone and it's not been approved for residential buildings that correct.

534
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:01,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, the sites in an industrial zone that is correct.

535
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:01,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

536
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:08,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And when is there a meeting plan for that scheduled already with the city as to when that might take place and when you're going to argue for that.

537
00:47:12,053 --> 00:47:17,897
[SPEAKER_16]: This public engagement process is really the first step in seeing what the next steps with the city are.

538
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of my comments mirror what the previous caller said on Amaranth Place.

539
00:47:24,362 --> 00:47:28,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this project is way too big for this neighborhood.

540
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:40,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, the proposed structures is not in conformity with whatever, with the existing houses that are above that road, you know, Myrtle and Amaranth now.

541
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be more inclined to be in favor of something that's like a townhouses just like on Amaranth Place throughout that property.

542
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:59,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what I see happening is that once you, if this gets allowed a six story, then what people don't see is right next to you is extra space.

543
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:03,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And extra space owns, I guess, the other part of that parcel, right?

544
00:48:03,995 --> 00:48:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're the owner of extra space storage.

545
00:48:05,676 --> 00:48:17,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I see happening is that they'll want to petition down the road to demolish that and build one of their skyscrapers like they have on the rear beach parkway.

546
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:28,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're going to bring in like close to 300 units with maybe up to 900 people in that type of a complex, then they're going to need some storage space.

547
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:31,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll see more development there.

548
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:38,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there's traffic problems as they're currently now without any development at all.

549
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:40,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where you live.

550
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:57,895
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've lived here for more than 30 years plus, and there's traffic that's backed up all the way to like where that bus stop is on a good day, like in the fall, when everybody's trying to get to Wellington and park their cars and get into work and everything else.

551
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:05,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see how any traffic study that's legitimate will say they can alleviate all those problems.

552
00:49:06,842 --> 00:49:07,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have,

553
00:49:08,023 --> 00:49:20,835
[SPEAKER_02]: like designs for streets within your parcel, then that might mitigate it if there was another access point onto Felsway, which I think there is one now in front of.

554
00:49:20,855 --> 00:49:25,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, there's a curb cut directly in front of Extra Space Storage.

555
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:32,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to answer that one question, the majority of this traffic will be through that intersection.

556
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:35,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, please continue.

557
00:49:35,418 --> 00:49:44,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know other people are going to use the Felsway to then take a left onto Central Ave and take a left down to Kenmare, which is where we reside.

558
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's enough traffic going here through the day that's going to make Kenmare Road look like a freeway.

559
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:57,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And there'll be backups because there's backups now on Central Ave as there is now.

560
00:49:57,183 --> 00:49:57,863
[SPEAKER_02]: There should probably be a

561
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:06,227
[SPEAKER_02]: of traffic study done on Central Ave and maybe a light put on Central Ave so you can get into Kenmare, because sometimes it's blocked.

562
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:07,787
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even get down.

563
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:09,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that happening.

564
00:50:09,828 --> 00:50:10,889
[SPEAKER_02]: People are taking a left.

565
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:12,990
[SPEAKER_02]: They can also take a U-turn right now.

566
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,832
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not illegal right now to take a U-turn and head up to Fells Lane and go down Myrtle.

567
00:50:17,872 --> 00:50:19,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do that or straight into your lots.

568
00:50:20,593 --> 00:50:27,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just going to be a nightmare, because people are counting just the people that are going to be living there.

569
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:49,413
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know take take factor all the deliveries that they're going to get ups and and the post office and everybody else federal express you know time multiply that number if there's 300 cars there by by two with with all the traffic during the day and all the different utility companies with the cable companies that are going to be coming in or the

570
00:50:49,953 --> 00:50:53,696
[SPEAKER_02]: or Verizon and everybody else trying to service these customers.

571
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:56,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd really like to see an owner base.

572
00:50:56,438 --> 00:51:00,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like more people have ownership of their property instead of renting.

573
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:07,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be much better to take care of the property and have a vested interest in the community here at large.

574
00:51:07,885 --> 00:51:10,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd rather, instead of seeing rental, I'd like to see ownership.

575
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:15,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And similar to the townhouses in our Amaranth, I think those would be acceptable uses.

576
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that we would not, that I wouldn't oppose.

577
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:22,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, all good comments.

578
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:24,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Michael, we appreciate that.

579
00:51:24,172 --> 00:51:28,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

580
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:38,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Ron Vining, you're next on my, on my queue.

581
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:40,265
[SPEAKER_05]: We live on Myrtle Street.

582
00:51:43,485 --> 00:51:48,509
[SPEAKER_05]: We live on Meryl Street and one of our concerns is the traffic on Meryl Street.

583
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:56,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Meryl Street is a narrow street and has a decent number of children, especially little children.

584
00:51:56,896 --> 00:52:07,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the houses go back to 1850, which means a lot of movement traffic wise creates a problem structurally.

585
00:52:08,564 --> 00:52:21,476
[SPEAKER_05]: We're concerned with this number of vehicles in the going in and out of Myrtle Street added to what's already there is going to create a serious problem for us.

586
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:24,798
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing to

587
00:52:26,846 --> 00:52:32,590
[SPEAKER_05]: avoid Myrtle Street from becoming a thruway more than it already is.

588
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:52,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, during the construction, are there going to be vehicles, commercial vehicles, coming down Myrtle Street, which means they're going to be heavier vehicles as well, creating, again, additional problem structurally wise, as well as safety.

589
00:52:53,145 --> 00:52:56,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are you doing to help alleviate

590
00:52:56,685 --> 00:53:01,747
[SPEAKER_05]: the traffic downwards to.

591
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:02,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Ron.

592
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,008
[SPEAKER_16]: All good questions.

593
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:07,850
[SPEAKER_16]: And obviously, we're here in the community loud and clear on the traffic.

594
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:18,955
[SPEAKER_16]: We do, and we'll continue to have direct access to the Felsway, even if this project and extra space storage become two separate projects.

595
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:23,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they're in common ownership now, we're going to make sure that the folks who live in this community

596
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:35,878
[SPEAKER_16]: will primarily access this community directly from the Felsway so that they won't need to rely as much on the residential back streets.

597
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:45,741
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we've got some work to do, and I don't have all the answers right this second, but it's something that we definitely hear you loud and clear, and that's what this meeting was for.

598
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:51,803
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll be working on that with our traffic engineers as we go through a permitting process.

599
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:05,813
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm seeing some stuff popping up in the chat that I want to try and get to here.

600
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:14,537
[SPEAKER_16]: This is good back and forth actually.

601
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:21,044
[SPEAKER_16]: pedestrian walking.

602
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:24,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm just I'm sorry, I'm scanning through the chat.

603
00:54:24,087 --> 00:54:25,628
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm trying to do 10 things at once.

604
00:54:25,668 --> 00:54:26,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't why don't we?

605
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:31,634
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to go to to KD for the next question.

606
00:54:33,976 --> 00:54:34,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, hello.

607
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:37,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I live on Myrtle Street.

608
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been here 39 years.

609
00:54:40,442 --> 00:54:43,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And I live down towards the end towards Spring Street.

610
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:49,309
[SPEAKER_08]: This street cannot accept any more traffic than what we have already.

611
00:54:50,209 --> 00:55:00,513
[SPEAKER_08]: This street is a cut through from people on the Felsway going to work, and when it's backed up on the Felsway, they turn down to Myrtle because

612
00:55:01,393 --> 00:55:04,734
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the cut down street to get out of the area.

613
00:55:05,014 --> 00:55:13,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Because once they start coming down the Fellsway, once they get over the little hump there at the bridge, there's no other turnout until you get down to the end.

614
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:16,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So they know that, so they cut off onto Myrtle.

615
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:20,360
[SPEAKER_08]: We are inundated with traffic flow right now.

616
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:23,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's kids here.

617
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:26,722
[SPEAKER_08]: This building is way too big.

618
00:55:26,962 --> 00:55:28,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Six stories is way too big.

619
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:35,425
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, where it's more traffic, I don't know what to say.

620
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:39,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, other than I'm really in opposition of this.

621
00:55:43,432 --> 00:55:44,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

622
00:55:44,913 --> 00:55:45,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

623
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:50,837
[SPEAKER_16]: I totally hear, I totally hear your concern and we've heard a number of residents speak up about that.

624
00:55:50,977 --> 00:56:00,305
[SPEAKER_16]: And obviously our traffic engineers are going to have their work cut out for them on this one to, to make sure that, that, you know, that we're not doing,

625
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:04,429
[SPEAKER_16]: additional harm to the traffic in the neighborhood.

626
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:14,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't see any way that it will alleviate additional harm other than if you have an entrance and an exit on the Felsway.

627
00:56:15,158 --> 00:56:15,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we will have that.

628
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:19,281
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not having them come down Myrtle at all.

629
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:27,467
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have that today, and we're going to be maintaining that so that residents can continue to access the site directly to and from the Felsway.

630
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:28,688
[SPEAKER_16]: So that we will have.

631
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:44,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the gentlemen did say, and I was in agreement with him, the apartment buildings or the townhouses that are there, they look nice in the area, but what you're proposing, I just, I'm not for that.

632
00:56:44,161 --> 00:56:45,582
[SPEAKER_08]: It's way too big for this area.

633
00:56:45,963 --> 00:56:48,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We have all single and two family homes here.

634
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:54,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean,

635
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:58,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's the traffic that I'm concerned with.

636
00:56:58,828 --> 00:57:02,709
[SPEAKER_08]: And another thing I'm concerned with, which was the woman said, is the rodents.

637
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:04,870
[SPEAKER_08]: We're inundated with it now.

638
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:07,371
[SPEAKER_08]: What's gonna happen when this opens up?

639
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:12,952
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly understand that.

640
00:57:12,992 --> 00:57:19,575
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, that's something that, you know, during any demolition project, we have to have rodent control in there.

641
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,576
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll obviously be extra vigilant about that to make sure that

642
00:57:24,856 --> 00:57:27,098
[SPEAKER_16]: That's that's controlled during the construction process.

643
00:57:27,138 --> 00:57:28,780
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a that's a very valid comment.

644
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:30,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

645
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:32,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

646
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:33,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be listening.

647
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:34,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

648
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,433
[SPEAKER_16]: I see Michael and Rachel still have their hands up.

649
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:44,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you have additional questions or

650
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:48,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael, did you have an additional question?

651
00:57:49,477 --> 00:57:57,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw the original plans and were you still proposing a bike path where the tracks are behind the property?

652
00:57:58,122 --> 00:58:04,425
[SPEAKER_16]: That is something that the city of Medford, I understand, has a desire to see happen.

653
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:15,831
[SPEAKER_16]: There is an old rail spur that runs behind this property and it would provide the ability for a walking, biking, multi-use path that could get people

654
00:58:17,268 --> 00:58:20,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Safely to to Wellington.

655
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:25,973
[SPEAKER_16]: That is something that we would see as a as an amenity, not just for our project, but for the whole neighborhood.

656
00:58:26,914 --> 00:58:31,637
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not something we can execute by ourselves because there are other property owners along the way.

657
00:58:32,448 --> 00:58:37,031
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's something that we would definitely like to see happen for the benefit of this immediate area.

658
00:58:37,731 --> 00:58:47,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So aside from the scope of the project being a problem, if you get permits to build, let's say, townhouses or whatnot, then some of the concerns can be alleviated if there's a bike path.

659
00:58:47,938 --> 00:58:50,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if these train tracks still run to Wellington.

660
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:57,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some sort of shuttle that could go from there all the way down for people who can't ride a bike or walk that distance.

661
00:58:58,444 --> 00:59:13,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would, you know, get people on the orange line, and into the trains and also help people live on American Myrtle maybe they can save on gas, and want to walk there and take a shuttle if that's a possibility like a monorail or something like that.

662
00:59:14,029 --> 00:59:16,651
[SPEAKER_02]: or biking as well, or walking.

663
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:21,495
[SPEAKER_02]: But during the cold weather, when it's raining, we all know people bike less and walk less.

664
00:59:22,035 --> 00:59:25,397
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just trying to be creative.

665
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:30,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if other than the bike lane option, but that'd be something that would be appealing.

666
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:36,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you could work with the city to try and make that happen, no matter what goes up there in the future.

667
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:38,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

668
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a good suggestion.

669
00:59:42,085 --> 00:59:43,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I had for now.

670
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

671
00:59:46,386 --> 00:59:48,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do apologize for coming in late.

672
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:51,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some family things I had to take care of.

673
00:59:52,168 --> 01:00:02,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the bus to Wellington that's on the corner of Myrtle and the Felsway, was that addressed as to how the development will affect it?

674
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:04,931
[SPEAKER_16]: It will certainly not have any negative impacts.

675
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:07,632
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to maintain that stop right there where it is.

676
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:20,750
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the questions that came up earlier was potentially improving that Myrtle and Felsway intersection so that it would be safer for people crossing the street when the bus is headed northbound.

677
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:27,618
[SPEAKER_16]: But we absolutely want to preserve that bus stop and would have no intention of seeing it go away.

678
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:38,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So my concern is more during construction that you're going to be building, if I read the plans correctly, you're going to be building a row of townhouses along Myrtle Street, along that side of Myrtle Street.

679
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:50,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And while those are being built, that street is already difficult to walk down because the people who had the property before don't trim that hedge along the fence, things like that.

680
01:00:50,558 --> 01:00:53,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very difficult to walk down that street.

681
01:00:53,839 --> 01:01:00,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also already, I think several people have mentioned, it's very difficult to drive down that two-way part of Myrtle.

682
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:10,645
[SPEAKER_06]: There's enough people living on that block who, you know, because we are in such a transit desert, except for that one bus,

683
01:01:11,157 --> 01:01:14,838
[SPEAKER_06]: people have cars, people park on both sides of the street.

684
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:25,662
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get even worse if people from this, I mean, I don't want to take any of your parking lot away because I certainly don't want more people parking on Myrtle Street.

685
01:01:26,703 --> 01:01:30,144
[SPEAKER_06]: But I live also right behind, I live in Amaranth Place.

686
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:37,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And so your six-story building is going to be making it so there is pretty much no sun, as far as I can tell.

687
01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:43,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at my corner of Amherst place we already have very little sun.

688
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:54,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just, I don't object to there being more housing, especially since you're putting in a lot of affordable housing.

689
01:01:58,483 --> 01:02:21,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I want to make certain that during construction and that we can get to our bus stop, that we can get to the Felsway as so many people have been talking about that, you know, sure we can exit, we can exit Amaranth Place, go up Myrtle Street, go over to Park Pinkert and then the Felsway, but that's going to be very difficult, especially for the people who live on Pinkert.

690
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:28,828
[SPEAKER_16]: I think those are all fair comments.

691
01:02:29,088 --> 01:02:46,759
[SPEAKER_16]: We obviously don't have a detailed construction management plan, but we should be able to build this project without the need to do any work on Myrtle, with the possible exception of making some new utility connections and improving other infrastructure in the area.

692
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:52,103
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not going to have trucks unloading on Myrtle Street at any point in time.

693
01:02:53,434 --> 01:03:03,042
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly understand your need to be able to get safely to and from the MBTA stop, and I don't see any reason why that would be impaired by construction.

694
01:03:04,343 --> 01:03:05,664
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are all good comments.

695
01:03:06,084 --> 01:03:06,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

696
01:03:16,031 --> 01:03:17,933
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just reading some of the stuff in the chat here.

697
01:03:33,311 --> 01:03:33,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

698
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:39,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Question about reducing the amount of parking to discourage so much driving to the site.

699
01:03:39,474 --> 01:03:42,275
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a balancing act, obviously.

700
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:49,257
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to make sure that we provide enough parking on site so that nobody from this project tries to park on the street.

701
01:03:49,457 --> 01:03:50,738
[SPEAKER_16]: That's important to us.

702
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:59,775
[SPEAKER_16]: I think our parking ratios will probably be pretty similar to some of the other apartment projects in the neighborhood.

703
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:04,459
[SPEAKER_16]: There's definitely a school of thought that says if you don't build it, they won't come.

704
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:15,888
[SPEAKER_16]: In order for that to really be effective, work well, you need to be very, very close to subway commuter rail stations.

705
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,052
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would be hesitant to

706
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,701
[SPEAKER_16]: under park this site.

707
01:04:23,982 --> 01:04:25,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Just again scanning through the chat here.

708
01:04:28,724 --> 01:04:36,648
[SPEAKER_16]: As you own the rest of the property, would you consider having a back road behind the building go behind extra space storage to the Felsway?

709
01:04:38,729 --> 01:04:45,593
[SPEAKER_16]: It's difficult because the extra space storage is built into the hillside that is the bridge over the tracks.

710
01:04:46,687 --> 01:05:09,377
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not really possible to get, we do have to have circulation around the building for fire safety and such, but to get directly to the Felsway, because we're bound by that railroad track and the bridge, the Felsway going over the tracks, it would be difficult to get a road back there with the way the building's built right into the hill.

711
01:05:09,457 --> 01:05:10,677
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but that's a good question.

712
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:24,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, there's a couple of questions about the parcel that you don't own on Myrtle Street and the opportunity to develop that.

713
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:32,146
[SPEAKER_16]: If it were to come available, it's something that we would look at.

714
01:05:35,003 --> 01:05:45,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Because of the way we're developing this site, we're really trying to nestle the residential buffer along Myrtle Street right into that so that it kind of restores the fabric of that street.

715
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:50,432
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not a site that we need to have for this project.

716
01:05:51,772 --> 01:05:59,356
[SPEAKER_16]: If it were to come available, we would certainly look at it, but it's not something we're actively pursuing at the moment.

717
01:06:01,117 --> 01:06:02,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, John, I didn't see that question.

718
01:06:07,582 --> 01:06:12,245
[SPEAKER_16]: During construction, how will vehicles get to the site since they are not allowed to go down the Felsway?

719
01:06:14,506 --> 01:06:21,991
[SPEAKER_16]: There are restrictions to vehicles using the Felsway heavy trucks as a thruway.

720
01:06:23,992 --> 01:06:36,299
[SPEAKER_16]: If there are vehicles, and I know that we have 18 wheelers that come to the site today to make deliveries, if there are vehicles that are coming to a specific location on the Felsway,

721
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:38,427
[SPEAKER_16]: they can get that use.

722
01:06:39,468 --> 01:06:43,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, it's something that we need to be aware of in a DCR road.

723
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:55,731
[SPEAKER_16]: But most of the vehicles that will be coming to this, except maybe when we're delivering wood trusses or something like that, that would come on large flatbeds.

724
01:06:56,452 --> 01:07:01,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of the vehicles that would be coming to this site during construction won't be huge.

725
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:06,634
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm sure that's something that we'll be able to work out during the construction process.

726
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:11,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Fire pits not allowed in Medford, that's something that we'll certainly have to check on.

727
01:07:12,776 --> 01:07:14,237
[SPEAKER_16]: If we did do them, they'd be gas.

728
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,698
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure that that makes a difference or not.

729
01:07:16,738 --> 01:07:18,880
[SPEAKER_16]: That's something that we'll absolutely have to look into, John.

730
01:07:27,204 --> 01:07:33,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not seeing any other hands up other than Michael and KD who

731
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,331
[SPEAKER_16]: had already spoken.

732
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:42,732
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know whether you guys had follow on questions or whether you just hadn't lowered your hands.

733
01:07:42,832 --> 01:07:45,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, I'm not seeing any other hands right now.

734
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:51,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Just take another look in the chat here.

735
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:57,435
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question from Andrew Hoffman about the length of the building compared to the existing building.

736
01:07:57,455 --> 01:08:05,637
[SPEAKER_00]: This building does go about, the leg closest to Amaranth is about maybe 20 feet longer than the existing building.

737
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:12,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the courtyard pokes out a little bit further, probably another 20 feet or so.

738
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:13,666
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a good question.

739
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:14,867
[SPEAKER_16]: And thanks, John.

740
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:16,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have asked you to answer that question anyway.

741
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:23,373
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, the footprint hopefully is very similar in scale to the footprint of the existing building that's there.

742
01:08:23,393 --> 01:08:34,802
[SPEAKER_16]: It does become, as John said, a little bit longer and thinner because we'll be tearing down space in between extra space storage and this building to create a drywall.

743
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:36,003
[SPEAKER_16]: So good question.

744
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:36,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

745
01:08:39,752 --> 01:08:45,893
[SPEAKER_16]: I see a question here that says if Myrtle Street becomes one way, what happens to those coming down from Lawrence Street?

746
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:49,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Would they be forced to go down Amherst to get onto the Fellsway?

747
01:08:49,814 --> 01:08:56,555
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not aware that anything we're doing would cause Myrtle Street to become one way.

748
01:08:56,595 --> 01:09:04,077
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we're talking about changing any traffic flows in the neighborhood like that, but that's something that we would certainly have to look into with our traffic engineer.

749
01:09:09,504 --> 01:09:16,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Another question here from Sue says, would there be no commercial space such as a convenience store or things like that for the residents or neighbors?

750
01:09:16,889 --> 01:09:19,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of the other developments have some commercial.

751
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:24,695
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a good question, Sue, and it's something that we can definitely look into.

752
01:09:24,795 --> 01:09:29,238
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not something that we've programmed today.

753
01:09:29,258 --> 01:09:36,383
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that some other projects that are in more developed areas have been able to do that.

754
01:09:37,693 --> 01:09:40,995
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a good question and something that we can look into.

755
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:48,379
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't have an answer to what that might be today and how we could locate that most effectively on the site.

756
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,379
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it's a great question.

757
01:09:57,904 --> 01:09:59,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Allison, did you have another question?

758
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:00,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry.

759
01:10:01,006 --> 01:10:02,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one really quick thing.

760
01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:04,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, just really touching upon

761
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:12,915
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, to be frank, you don't own the access to Amarants to create a rear exit, right?

762
01:10:13,415 --> 01:10:17,598
[SPEAKER_11]: So your only two access points are Myrtle Street and the Fells Way.

763
01:10:18,459 --> 01:10:24,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't care how many access points you make to the Fells Way, it's only going one direction.

764
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:27,384
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a two lane, you know, two lanes south, two lanes north.

765
01:10:28,165 --> 01:10:32,047
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I know it's been said quite a lot,

766
01:10:32,778 --> 01:10:39,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, and I said in the chat, you know, infrastructure, period schools, all these people, I mean, I would assume they're going to have children.

767
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:46,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have the, the, you know, capacity for schools, you know, the, uh, utilities, obviously Davis.

768
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:48,572
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite frankly, I work in finance.

769
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:49,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys very well.

770
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:55,397
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not paying that we as taxpayers are, um, unless you will.

771
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,040
[SPEAKER_11]: And that might be something you're going to take to the table.

772
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, which is fine, but.

773
01:11:01,113 --> 01:11:05,174
[SPEAKER_11]: upgrades would need to be made for the capacity of the six story building.

774
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:11,136
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm not even concerned about the dust and the rodents of construction.

775
01:11:11,176 --> 01:11:18,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm concerned about the actual infrastructure, you know, that this project would strain.

776
01:11:18,898 --> 01:11:30,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I think, I just don't think you have a solution because you don't have ownership of that rear access point and with Amaranth.

777
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's my biggest concern.

778
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to make it vocal.

779
01:11:33,492 --> 01:11:37,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I think you guys should absolutely, I mean, you're free to develop.

780
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:46,721
[SPEAKER_11]: You've made beautiful properties in Medford, certainly, and went out to eat at the restaurant that's over on that river's edge.

781
01:11:46,821 --> 01:11:52,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So I certainly don't begrudge you for making those efforts.

782
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:55,807
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think there's a lot to do, a lot that you need to think about.

783
01:11:56,493 --> 01:12:03,359
[SPEAKER_11]: That just wasn't in your initial proposal, which I was very happy that Medford safe Harvard to protect.

784
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:17,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we're a neighborhood so I think no one's here is trying to say you shouldn't develop the area I think would be great, but I just think this property this proposal is too large to straining and just needs to be reworked.

785
01:12:19,187 --> 01:12:21,089
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, thank you very much for the presentation.

786
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:26,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was really well done and really appreciate your time and obviously going over time, answering all the questions.

787
01:12:26,893 --> 01:12:27,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

788
01:12:28,254 --> 01:12:28,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

789
01:12:28,495 --> 01:12:29,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Allison.

790
01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:34,619
[SPEAKER_16]: And believe me, all good comments that I know we'll have to address over time.

791
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:38,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I will just comment on a couple of them.

792
01:12:38,262 --> 01:12:43,026
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have access to Amaranth at that location.

793
01:12:43,447 --> 01:12:44,688
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a curb cut there today.

794
01:12:44,748 --> 01:12:47,630
[SPEAKER_16]: It's right at the five points intersection.

795
01:12:48,255 --> 01:12:51,517
[SPEAKER_11]: But it funnels back to Myrtle, correct?

796
01:12:51,778 --> 01:12:53,459
[SPEAKER_16]: It does funnel back to Myrtle, that's correct.

797
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:54,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

798
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:56,361
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's my point.

799
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:57,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

800
01:12:57,262 --> 01:12:57,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Fair point.

801
01:12:57,782 --> 01:13:01,765
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do have access to Amaranth along the west side of the property there.

802
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:10,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, the primary access that we want to encourage everyone is to come in directly from and leave on the Fellsway.

803
01:13:11,692 --> 01:13:15,875
[SPEAKER_16]: The one other thing I will say, obviously, we have a lot to figure out with this project.

804
01:13:16,095 --> 01:13:17,096
[SPEAKER_16]: No question about it.

805
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:29,469
[SPEAKER_16]: I will say on the schools, we did some research on the city website, and we know that school enrollment's down about 10% from 2018.

806
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,891
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not unique to Medford, by the way.

807
01:13:31,951 --> 01:13:35,294
[SPEAKER_16]: That's happening in a lot of communities around here.

808
01:13:36,235 --> 01:13:42,681
[SPEAKER_16]: So from that standpoint, a project this size would only add a very small number of schoolchildren

809
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:51,241
[SPEAKER_16]: projected to the school system and certainly nowhere near what capacities dropped in the last four or five years.

810
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:54,342
[SPEAKER_16]: But all of your points are very, very good.

811
01:13:54,402 --> 01:13:56,143
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have to figure out the utilities.

812
01:13:56,943 --> 01:14:01,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Our civil engineer has done some preliminary investigations, and we believe that the capacity is in the area.

813
01:14:02,466 --> 01:14:07,908
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's stuff that needs to be upgraded to support this project, it's us that would be paying for it.

814
01:14:07,928 --> 01:14:10,990
[SPEAKER_16]: It would not be the city and thus the taxpayer that would be paying for it.

815
01:14:12,772 --> 01:14:18,359
[SPEAKER_16]: But all of your questions are very thoughtful, and we certainly appreciate them, and we will absolutely have to address them.

816
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,781
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for those.

817
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:25,008
[SPEAKER_16]: I see a new hand from Alex Leffenhop.

818
01:14:27,798 --> 01:14:51,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry but I had to drop out of the meeting for a little while and so I apologize if anything that I've said is duplicative of what anyone else said but I was looking in the chat and seeing a lot of people sort of saying that this was too many units and too big, and my biggest priority is affordable housing and I'm really excited to see the larger percentage of affordable units, and I just want to remind everyone that every time you

819
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:59,216
[SPEAKER_07]: You lower the number of units in a building like this you get fewer affordable housing units because it's calculated as a percentage.

820
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:13,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just, I would just really urge everyone to remember that when you're thinking about, you know, fewer units and smaller and I think we need every unit of affordable housing, we can get in Medford at 80% 60% 60% would be am I would be awesome.

821
01:15:13,948 --> 01:15:18,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take 80% just really maximize that number of affordable units and that means

822
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:23,017
[SPEAKER_07]: That means more units, but that's something that I think is the most important thing to think about in Medford.

823
01:15:23,037 --> 01:15:23,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all I wanted to say.

824
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:26,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Alex.

825
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:28,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that comment.

826
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,542
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's something that is very important to us to try and deliver more housing.

827
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:38,306
[SPEAKER_16]: I think everyone's seen what's happened to rent this year and inflation in general.

828
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:39,626
[SPEAKER_16]: So I appreciate your comments.

829
01:15:39,686 --> 01:15:41,848
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's something that we're going to continue to try and deliver on.

830
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:42,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

831
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:50,235
[SPEAKER_15]: I see a couple of thank yous there.

832
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:57,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I'm just reading.

833
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:06,889
[SPEAKER_15]: All good comments, all good comments that we've kind of talked about.

834
01:16:17,752 --> 01:16:19,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Rachel, Michael, you guys got your hands up again.

835
01:16:19,712 --> 01:16:22,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just a question for me.

836
01:16:22,073 --> 01:16:22,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

837
01:16:22,413 --> 01:16:31,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just wondering how we could ensure that we got notified about future meetings because I had just heard about this one by chance, but I'm within the little red line that was on that early slide and I didn't get a mailing or anything.

838
01:16:34,355 --> 01:16:35,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, apologies for that.

839
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:40,576
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we do our best to get the mailing list out of the city.

840
01:16:41,016 --> 01:16:42,957
[SPEAKER_16]: It may be if you're a new resident or something.

841
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:44,017
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why that would be.

842
01:16:45,223 --> 01:16:49,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, there's no next meeting planned.

843
01:16:49,785 --> 01:16:55,627
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some work to do with the city to see how to best move this project forward.

844
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,009
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, this is not part of a public process.

845
01:17:00,029 --> 01:17:01,909
[SPEAKER_16]: This is an early community engagement meeting.

846
01:17:01,949 --> 01:17:04,370
[SPEAKER_16]: So nothing is being decided tonight.

847
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:06,651
[SPEAKER_16]: No decisions are being made.

848
01:17:06,731 --> 01:17:08,912
[SPEAKER_16]: No votes are being cast.

849
01:17:09,617 --> 01:17:11,979
[SPEAKER_16]: and there'll be plenty of opportunity for feedback in the future.

850
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:17,985
[SPEAKER_16]: The best suggestion I can give you is to monitor the City of Medford website.

851
01:17:18,005 --> 01:17:21,068
[SPEAKER_16]: They're very good about posting notices and calendar and stuff there.

852
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,232
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your address?

853
01:17:25,732 --> 01:17:27,955
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll check our mailing list.

854
01:17:27,975 --> 01:17:29,136
[SPEAKER_12]: 37A Amaranth Ave.

855
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:45,119
[SPEAKER_16]: I will check on that and make sure, and I know everyone who's joined this had to put their emails in, so I should be able to find you and we'll make sure you're on our mailing list.

856
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:49,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, can I just jump in for a quick second about notification?

857
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:50,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Alicia.

858
01:17:50,477 --> 01:17:51,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thank you.

859
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:52,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, so I'm Alicia Hunt.

860
01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:54,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the director of planning and development for the city.

861
01:17:54,858 --> 01:18:01,079
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am, as Chris had mentioned here earlier, just on this to hear what the comments and stuff are.

862
01:18:02,359 --> 01:18:11,681
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did want to mention, I occasionally run into people who are not aware that the city also has a system to do reverse calls.

863
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:19,663
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not getting approximately weekly phone calls from the mayor, then you probably should go on the city's website

864
01:18:20,203 --> 01:18:26,986
[SPEAKER_01]: and subscribe to our notifications because we have a lot, we regularly provide information about COVID, et cetera.

865
01:18:27,506 --> 01:18:35,269
[SPEAKER_01]: But this meeting, I am fairly confident there was a reverse call about this in the abutters area as well.

866
01:18:35,289 --> 01:18:37,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanna mention that.

867
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:43,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody has trouble subscribing to the city's phone calls or emails,

868
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:45,914
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to email my office.

869
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:47,054
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simple.

870
01:18:47,095 --> 01:18:54,158
[SPEAKER_01]: It's letters OCD for Office of Community Development at Medford-MA.gov.

871
01:18:54,618 --> 01:18:58,921
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to help people get signed up for these kinds of notices.

872
01:19:01,282 --> 01:19:01,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, Alicia.

873
01:19:01,822 --> 01:19:03,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Much better answer than I would have given.

874
01:19:03,143 --> 01:19:04,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

875
01:19:04,884 --> 01:19:09,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe put that email in the chat just in case anyone had trouble writing that down.

876
01:19:09,086 --> 01:19:09,626
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be great.

877
01:19:09,686 --> 01:19:10,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

878
01:19:13,893 --> 01:19:18,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Tom, I see your hand up as a new hand.

879
01:19:26,482 --> 01:19:28,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope, not there.

880
01:19:32,025 --> 01:19:33,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Tom, we'll come back to you in a sec.

881
01:19:33,747 --> 01:19:34,967
[SPEAKER_16]: KD, do you have another question?

882
01:19:42,813 --> 01:19:42,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

883
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:49,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Michael you're the, you've been, you've been chatting with me tonight and I see your hand still up.

884
01:19:49,711 --> 01:19:50,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have another question.

885
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:57,237
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I was listening to Mr. Wilson Hall, talk about affordable housing edit that is important.

886
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:11,462
[SPEAKER_02]: However, just to make everybody aware if they're not there's there's a whole bunch of more affordable housing that's gone up a lot and the Wellington circle area that's going to be going up on route 16 they're going to be some high rises there.

887
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:17,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't need, you know, 300 units in our back door here that we've been living with, you know that.

888
01:20:18,153 --> 01:20:24,284
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to create a traffic nightmare and also pollution wise more people more pollution.

889
01:20:24,304 --> 01:20:28,712
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how's that going to be rectified for years to come when we're all here and.

890
01:20:30,172 --> 01:20:41,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see home ownership, people to own their own private homes instead of renting, because there's going to be a different population moving in that's going to own it versus renting.

891
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:51,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have more care and concern about their neighbors in this immediate area than if they're just moving in for a few months or a year or two, then moving on to some other community.

892
01:20:51,907 --> 01:20:59,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But a vested interest in this community and this neighborhood would be appreciated if you consider more of the townhousing concept

893
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:03,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know if you own the other building like you said extra space.

894
01:21:04,437 --> 01:21:09,862
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to create more general housing there you know, and it's kind of hard that like you said I agree you can't get on.

895
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:14,851
[SPEAKER_02]: getting everybody onto Fells Way is just gonna create another parking lot.

896
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:18,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see that now, even with just what's here today.

897
01:21:19,352 --> 01:21:23,392
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wish you luck and hopefully you'll take everybody's comments to heart.

898
01:21:23,552 --> 01:21:35,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know everybody wants to make a profit as developers, but to consider the community's concerns that they've raised today and reducing the scope of this project as well, should you be allowed to build on this land.

899
01:21:36,295 --> 01:21:36,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

900
01:21:37,395 --> 01:21:38,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your comments, Michael.

901
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:44,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Tom, I'm going to come back to you because you're the one with a hand up.

902
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,706
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see if you got your...

903
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:58,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, my issue was when I look around, all your buildings are really nice and this one looks beautiful, but I can't think of any others that are surrounded by two and three families.

904
01:21:58,829 --> 01:22:06,176
[SPEAKER_13]: You say it's a multifamily, but I think of multifamily as two and three, even four, but this is just, it's an apartment building.

905
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:10,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's multifamily, but it's just so different from where you've built your other ones.

906
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:17,491
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, like on River's Edge and, you know, even the ones on, they're all out in the area where they're not surrounded by housing.

907
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:23,833
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this is completely, on two thirds of it, it's wrapped by, and it's the Felsway, which is considered a pleasure road.

908
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,714
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason there were no trucks on it, it was marked a pleasure road.

909
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:31,135
[SPEAKER_13]: There used to be trees in the middle from, you know, till some storm took them out.

910
01:22:31,295 --> 01:22:31,695
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know,

911
01:22:32,575 --> 01:22:34,996
[SPEAKER_13]: The storage is kind of a buffer.

912
01:22:35,776 --> 01:22:38,277
[SPEAKER_13]: By leaving the storage there, it's kind of a buffer for you guys.

913
01:22:38,297 --> 01:22:43,118
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not putting your building right on the Fellsway, which I think would be a bigger concern.

914
01:22:43,138 --> 01:22:45,779
[SPEAKER_13]: And the bus stop, I used to take the bus.

915
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:51,540
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I was at that stop, I very rarely got a seat because the bus stops way up at the end.

916
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:57,102
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have even 30 people trying to get on the bus, you may want to think about having a shuttle for your own.

917
01:22:57,788 --> 01:23:02,651
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, just take them over to Riverside Avenue, Riverside, they'll be on the shuttle at River's Edge.

918
01:23:03,172 --> 01:23:06,814
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's all that was my only comment that I just don't see it fitting here.

919
01:23:06,854 --> 01:23:10,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think anything over three stories is just too high, because that's what we have.

920
01:23:11,297 --> 01:23:24,186
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, three store, everything's three stories, all of a sudden, it's going to be double, that's double, you know, just, I mean, I know you have the state approval probably already, because it's 40 B, I don't really realize how much input the city has on what they can, what they can do what they can't.

921
01:23:24,787 --> 01:23:24,907
[SPEAKER_13]: But

922
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:25,870
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all.

923
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:26,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

924
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:26,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

925
01:23:26,691 --> 01:23:29,552
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a great presentation and I'm glad to hear from everybody.

926
01:23:30,433 --> 01:23:31,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And I live right next to Mike.

927
01:23:31,754 --> 01:23:33,815
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

928
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,156
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate your comments.

929
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:36,977
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have our approvals yet.

930
01:23:37,237 --> 01:23:42,040
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a process that we're working through with the city right now.

931
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:46,383
[SPEAKER_16]: So there will be more opportunities for feedback and all good comments.

932
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:46,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

933
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:53,959
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's about it.

934
01:23:54,019 --> 01:23:56,360
[SPEAKER_16]: I see a couple of more comments in the chat.

935
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,602
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank everybody for coming out tonight.

936
01:23:59,622 --> 01:24:03,184
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this was actually a really good meeting.

937
01:24:03,284 --> 01:24:04,864
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate the turnout.

938
01:24:07,045 --> 01:24:20,432
[SPEAKER_16]: For one, I can tell you I actually like the opportunity to have these community engagement meetings virtually because I think it gives a lot more people the opportunity to participate rather than having to perhaps leave small kids at home alone

939
01:24:21,002 --> 01:24:26,285
[SPEAKER_16]: get a sitter or whatever to find their way into a city hall type location.

940
01:24:27,266 --> 01:24:30,448
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to, again, thank everybody for coming out.

941
01:24:30,468 --> 01:24:33,930
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank the team for their efforts in putting this presentation together.

942
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:39,513
[SPEAKER_16]: And Alicia, thank you for chiming up there at the end with some helpful information to the community.

943
01:24:39,553 --> 01:24:42,775
[SPEAKER_16]: We will make sure our mailing list is as current as possible.
