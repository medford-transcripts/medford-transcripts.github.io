1
00:00:00,895 --> 00:00:01,215
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're all here.

3
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:03,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pass the baton.

4
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:04,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

5
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:05,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Amanda.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,003

[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome everyone Amanda if you would do us the honors of just mentioning for the members of the public others in attendance tonight, who amongst our city staff are with us.

30
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:06,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so my name is Amanda Centrella.

31
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:13,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm planning staff in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability alongside me, like my colleagues.

32
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:26,666
[SPEAKER_01]: So Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, as well as Senior Planner, Danielle Evans, and Building Commissioner Bill Forty is also joining us tonight.

33
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:29,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome, everyone.

34
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's turn to the first item for discussion tonight, and I'll read the public notice on this one.

35
00:02:37,369 --> 00:03:03,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Our board is to conduct a public hearing tonight, relative to a position by another McLennan and fish representing CPC land acquisition company, LLC, to amend the city's zoning map, as referenced in our zoning ordinance amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the area of the property 99 Revere Beach Parkway in Medford from industrial to mixed use.

36
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,415
[SPEAKER_14]: And the property consists of two parcels.

37
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:16,519
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess that's pretty much it for the public notice.

38
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And at this point, let me introduce and hand the baton over to Attorney Moore.

39
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:30,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, and thank you all for your time this evening.

40
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:38,493
[SPEAKER_10]: With me tonight is Jack Englert, as well as Eric Van Arum and Liam McDonough from the development team.

41
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:45,178
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, I will turn it over to Jack, who will walk you through their vision for the site.

42
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

43
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:47,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

44
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,365
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on mute, Jack.

45
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:58,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

46
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:11,639
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so adept at dealing with the zoom things you think I'd be able to hit a mute button but I'm jack angler with criterion development company we're also CPC land acquisition company.

47
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:27,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're here tonight just to discuss the amending the map that exists now in the general area and we can start to go through the slides and I'd like to ask Liam McDonough actually to pull up the PowerPoint.

48
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:32,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but basically to extend the museum zone from where it is.

49
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:39,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Over to a piece of at at station landing over to a piece of land that butts the river.

50
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:44,925
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I think if Liam were able to open up.

51
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:50,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not having access is, uh, someone able to grant me access so I can share my

52
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:04,936
[SPEAKER_05]: All set.

53
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:18,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

54
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:20,604
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.

55
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:30,449
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, this is a zoning map change to mix use zone from what is now an industrial zone piece of land.

56
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:31,770
[SPEAKER_15]: If you go to the next slide,

57
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:42,661
[SPEAKER_15]: just to give a sense, we're calling this the Mystic and Malden River Basin, but it's really the confluence of both the Mystic and the Malden.

58
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:55,945
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see the MBTA site that is sort of represented on the point here where those two rivers come together and the big white building that exists on the screen.

59
00:05:55,985 --> 00:06:01,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, Liam, if you can use your cursor to kind of point out the area, but yes,

60
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:07,007
[SPEAKER_15]: a little off, but yeah, there you go.

61
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:11,649
[SPEAKER_15]: South of Route 16 at the Wellington T stop.

62
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:13,410
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to the next step.

63
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:14,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Slide.

64
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:26,697
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a little better map, I think, because it kind of explains what's going on with the pathway that's been started and stopped a number of times in this area.

65
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:33,500
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it runs along the recreational open space land to the left of McDonnell Park and comes down

66
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:43,718
[SPEAKER_15]: across 28 and then goes around the point, if you will, and it sort of stops where the arrow is at the MBTA parking lot there.

67
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:58,452
[SPEAKER_15]: If you cross over Route 16 to the north, you can see a lighter yellow that extends all the way up to River's Edge, which is a development to the north on River's Edge Drive.

68
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:09,589
[SPEAKER_15]: And our site is really the KISS 108 site, which we'll see on the next slide in the corner, just south of Route 16 along the Malden River.

69
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,713
[SPEAKER_15]: This sort of zooms in on the area a little bit better, Wellington T stop.

70
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:28,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Parking lot, the site that we're talking about is highlighted in purple, and you can see station landing on the left side running parallel with

71
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,103
[SPEAKER_15]: route 28 on the eastern side of 28.

72
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:46,414
[SPEAKER_15]: And the Wellington T-stop, which has recently been the subject of an RFI, I think, from the city for some of the air rights that exist over that T-stop and then our piece east of that.

73
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:47,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next slide.

74
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:54,380
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is sort of an excerpt of the zoning map

75
00:07:55,952 --> 00:08:03,557
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see the MUZ zone highlighted in red and indicated by MUZ, that is basically station landing.

76
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:06,619
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it picks up Kelly's as well.

77
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:18,006
[SPEAKER_15]: And then our site across the industrial area there is right on the river and highlighted also in red, indicated by the word site.

78
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Just north of our site is the office zoning.

79
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:24,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a residential deal there.

80
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:34,109
[SPEAKER_15]: or two, and then you see the recreational open space zoning in green along the Mystic River to the south.

81
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,930
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to the next slide.

82
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:48,615
[SPEAKER_15]: This sort of zooms in on that section of that MBTA lot and our lot, just south of Route 16.

83
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:55,338
[SPEAKER_15]: And to the north, you can see a multifamily development project that was built

84
00:08:56,015 --> 00:09:14,851
[SPEAKER_15]: probably eight years ago, and then the path along the river that comes underneath Route 16 in that location, and then sort of dies up into a sidewalk that then meanders along Route 16 to the west.

85
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,593
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll go to the next slide.

86
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:31,651
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a view of that pathway, and it's kind of about face that coming under 16, and then going back up to 16, and that apartment development in the background.

87
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:34,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next slide, please.

88
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:48,705
[SPEAKER_15]: So after you come under the Route 16 bridge, you're sort of met with the existing situation out there, which hasn't been manicured or kept up very well over the last, who knows how many years,

89
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:54,449
[SPEAKER_15]: and you're sort of met by this barbed wire fence and some of the cell towers.

90
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:59,610
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think on the next few slides, we'll get a better picture of what happens in that area.

91
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,532
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the back of the KISS 108 building, which is just along the river and continue on.

92
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:12,774
[SPEAKER_15]: It continues quite a ways across the site of the fence and then the cell towers.

93
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:17,576
[SPEAKER_15]: And then along the river, it's been just, you know, kind of,

94
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:19,937
[SPEAKER_15]: not very well maintained at all.

95
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:22,438
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just overgrown invasives.

96
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:29,579
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are a few nice trees actually in there, but most of it is just overgrown invasive species.

97
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next slide.

98
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,680
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it needs to be cleaned up.

99
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,360
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to be fixed up.

100
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:43,662
[SPEAKER_15]: And this kind of unsightliness that exists now is definitely a deterrent from walking along the river.

101
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:45,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next slide.

102
00:10:48,982 --> 00:11:02,247
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an aerial view that kind of zooms in on the site itself, Route 16, on the east side of the picture, the path coming under Route 16, and then sort of turning back up to the sidewalk.

103
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:11,430
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that area that we were just looking at, those various slides, is that which is along the river, outside the green area.

104
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:18,273
[SPEAKER_15]: The fence line actually separates the green from sort of the natural.

105
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:31,586
[SPEAKER_15]: And the site encompasses both the green, the KISS 108 building, the green area that you see in some parking, and then the adjacent lot is a parking lot to the north, screen north.

106
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:39,071
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually west, but that encompasses the entire site.

107
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:40,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next slide, please.

108
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,275
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I know we're here just for, you know,

109
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:54,731
[SPEAKER_15]: zoning amendment and not really to talk about the actual idea, but I thought it'd be helpful to go through some of the things that we've been thinking about.

110
00:11:54,791 --> 00:12:05,233
[SPEAKER_15]: And the proposal that we have that would be pursuant to the mixed use zone, should it be approved, would be a multifamily structure on the site.

111
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:12,355
[SPEAKER_15]: It would have some retail on the first floor, probably community space and those sorts of things.

112
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,156
[SPEAKER_15]: And a number of things that we've looked at to kind of engage

113
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:20,084
[SPEAKER_15]: the community and engage the walkway and the river.

114
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:28,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's preliminary, but we have met with the Mystic River Watershed Association.

115
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:30,868
[SPEAKER_15]: We've met with a couple of bike groups.

116
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:43,512
[SPEAKER_15]: We've met with some environmentalists and meteorologists, actually, just to talk about the site and what it could be and what needs we could kind of

117
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:57,022
[SPEAKER_15]: satisfied by, you know, obviously we're trying to build a project that's a good project, but a good project means not only the project itself, but what we can do to engage the community.

118
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:13,993
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a very preliminary landscaping plan, but it does show you some of the things that we're thinking about, the continuation of the path, the creation of a pavilion, the creation of some outdoor bike storage, outdoor bike washing stations,

119
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:20,270
[SPEAKER_15]: outdoor bike fix it stations and then some kayak potential kayak rental areas.

120
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:22,051
[SPEAKER_15]: And things like that.

121
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,493
[SPEAKER_15]: If you go to the next slide.

122
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,677
[SPEAKER_15]: No, these are just images that we're starting to look at.

123
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Should this be something that we could move forward with?

124
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,023
[SPEAKER_15]: We would love to be able to put some sort of a pavilion.

125
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:38,626
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you are on that walkway and we can complete the pathway.

126
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:47,991
[SPEAKER_15]: across our site and certainly contribute to bringing it across the MBTA site to link it with what is in existence.

127
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:58,397
[SPEAKER_15]: We think that, you know, having a place where people could get out of the rain or sun would be a nice amenity for the community.

128
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,258
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to the next slide.

129
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, this isn't exactly what we're talking about, but we are looking south here.

130
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:25,514
[SPEAKER_15]: We're at River's Edge, and this is some of the work that John Priato has done up at River's Edge, and we were involved with two projects up there as well, and feel like we were a part of it, even though I give full credit to John for doing all this beautiful work in landscaping and J.P.

131
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:26,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Shadley.

132
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:35,178
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's a continuation of this feel is what we're proposing to come across our site and continue to link to the existing path.

133
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:36,398
[SPEAKER_15]: If you go to the next slide.

134
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:39,314
[SPEAKER_15]: And the next.

135
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:42,596
[SPEAKER_15]: And one more.

136
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,639
[SPEAKER_15]: With some signage, you know, potential and go to the next please.

137
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,322
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what is the building look like you know it is a preliminary stage.

138
00:14:56,142 --> 00:15:01,145
[SPEAKER_15]: This building would be the view if you were, you know, up in the air on top of the river.

139
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:11,927
[SPEAKER_15]: and it kind of starts to demonstrate the openness that we're trying to step it down to the river, not be a wall against the river, open up that courtyard to the river.

140
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:26,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, on the preliminary stage, and if we're lucky enough to move forward with this through the zoning and come back to the community board, we would love to be able to get into a detailed discussion of some of the things we're thinking about.

141
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:30,473
[SPEAKER_15]: But as a starting point, we thought this would be a good,

142
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:35,814
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, model to at least attempt to head towards.

143
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:48,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So this does show some covered bike stations where there could be a bike wash and storage and different tools to be used for people using the path with bikes.

144
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:54,960
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, we've contacted the community rowing group.

145
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,601
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually a kayak rental.

146
00:15:56,741 --> 00:16:00,642
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a place over in Newton on the Charles River, and we were thinking,

147
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:09,002
[SPEAKER_15]: that might be a great amenity for both the project and the community to be able to have a launching point.

148
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:20,829
[SPEAKER_15]: We know there are a lot of steps to get to in terms of access to the river, but in our discussions to date, everything has seemed to indicate that there's a lot of demand for it.

149
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:28,753
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of, I think people want to see it happen and we would love to try to make that happen.

150
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,154
[SPEAKER_15]: If you go to the next slide,

151
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,493
[SPEAKER_15]: I love this because of the sailboat.

152
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:35,414
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know the depth of the river.

153
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:41,555
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess you could sail a boat that size in there, but it just gives you a sense of how it would sit on the river.

154
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:45,536
[SPEAKER_15]: This is from the southeast of the site, looking up at it.

155
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,216
[SPEAKER_15]: And go to the next slide, please.

156
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:52,797
[SPEAKER_15]: And this would be from the north, looking back towards the city of Boston.

157
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,718
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see in this picture, I think very well, the MBTA station.

158
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:05,280
[SPEAKER_15]: and the parking associated with the MBTA station and the casino in the in the background there.

159
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:07,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And the next slide.

160
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:27,445
[SPEAKER_15]: So some of the general project benefits and some of the things that would be allowed should this by special permit should this be rezoned to MUZ you know rehousing at a transit hub which we are very fond of we've built them at Forest Hill station and JFK station and in

161
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:35,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Dorchester, and Alewife Station in Cambridge, 15% of housing to be affordable.

162
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:44,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Extension of that path seems to be something that's been in the works for a long time, and we think that we could put it over the line and get it all to happen.

163
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:55,775
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's funding out there right now for some of it, and if we could kind of bridge the gap between the funding and do everything on our side and then bridge the gap on the rest,

164
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,311
[SPEAKER_15]: We think that would be a nice amenity for the community.

165
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:04,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Talked about meeting space with some of the different local nonprofit groups.

166
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:09,573
[SPEAKER_15]: The bike wash and repair station we mentioned as well as the kayak rental.

167
00:18:10,574 --> 00:18:15,135
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the potential public access to the river which we think would be a wonderful thing.

168
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:20,514
[SPEAKER_15]: and we're going to do our best to work through that should we have the opportunity.

169
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:31,123
[SPEAKER_15]: And finally, you know, in terms of the sustainability, we do pride ourselves on a lot of forward thinking on that.

170
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:35,387
[SPEAKER_15]: We are doing a project right on the Charles River right now in Newton.

171
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:40,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of our houses, one of our buildings happens to be a passive house building.

172
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:42,293
[SPEAKER_15]: We know we can achieve

173
00:18:42,770 --> 00:19:00,434
[SPEAKER_15]: full passive house building here, but we know we can put a lot of the sustainability efforts that are going around right now into our buildings with solar on the roof and, you know, stretch code and building envelope and all the things that we've been doing on a number of things.

174
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:05,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Our project at Forest Hills is gold certified,

175
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:09,048
[SPEAKER_15]: lead standard, which was a big win for us.

176
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,429
[SPEAKER_15]: We were excited about that.

177
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:15,073
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done a number that are silver as well, but that's the future.

178
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:20,779
[SPEAKER_15]: We're really just talking about the zoning and I thought it might be good to mention some of this stuff.

179
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:23,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to the next, could be the last.

180
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:24,403
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is.

181
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:30,769
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I can open it up to questions or whatever the board would like.

182
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, sure.

183
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:34,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for the presentation.

184
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:39,962
[SPEAKER_14]: We can open it up to public comment unless there's more from the presenters.

185
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:48,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda do we have some folks who are interested in participating tonight.

186
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:52,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't received any comments ahead of the meeting.

187
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:53,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check now.

188
00:19:53,713 --> 00:20:05,556
[SPEAKER_01]: But while I do that, if there is anyone on the meeting that would like to provide public comment, if you could either use the raise hand feature or put a little note in the chat, we'll call on you.

189
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:08,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give folks a second to do that.

190
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:11,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Just refresh.

191
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:23,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, you've got your email address, which is ocd at medford-ma.gov, if someone felt more comfortable for some reason sending an email.

192
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:24,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

193
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:36,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we haven't received any new or any comments at this time via email, and I'm not seeing any hands or notes in the chat.

194
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:38,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

195
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:49,930
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I guess we'll close that public comment period and open it up to the board.

196
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:52,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Board members, do we have questions or comments?

197
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:00,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Emily.

198
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:04,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited for this development.

199
00:21:04,793 --> 00:21:08,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 5 Cabot, so I'm the development

200
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:12,360
[SPEAKER_07]: is just kind of north over Riviera Beach Parkway to this.

201
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:30,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of the, I know we're not talking about building specifics at this point, we're just talking about zoning, but given the proximity to the T, the area residential, this is really exciting for me and I support it and I don't have any questions.

202
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:34,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

203
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:35,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other comments?

204
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:50,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it would be of interest, I'll throw my question out, which is why the MUZ versus some other technique, a planned development district or something along those lines, just out of curiosity.

205
00:21:50,926 --> 00:22:05,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've looked at a few things and the MUZ just struck us as a natural progression from what is existing at station landing, what might be needed at the air rides over the T,

206
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,827
[SPEAKER_15]: And it sort of fit that whole southern side of 16.

207
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:33,603
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think there was any particular reason we didn't want to do the process although you know timing is everything in real estate and, and we happen to have a fund that was very interested in this project and they've been pushing me pretty hard because, and I've been willing to take that push given the, you know, the nature of what's going on right now and.

208
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:39,508
[SPEAKER_15]: having someone be interested in a project like this in the market where it's not that easy.

209
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:53,998
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying to see what might be the most not only the best path in terms of consistency with the future across the southern part of Route 16 in that area but also expediency I think maybe

210
00:22:55,467 --> 00:23:04,029
[SPEAKER_15]: And whether we're right or wrong we thought it might be a little easier path in terms of timing, not easier, just perhaps a little faster.

211
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:04,590
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

212
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate your answer.

213
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks very much.

214
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:20,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I could see the benefit of having the same district on the east and the west side of of Wellington makes a lot of sense I think from the community's point of view so thanks for your perspective on that.

215
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:25,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Other questions or comments.

216
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:35,413
[SPEAKER_14]: City officials I didn't invite you to ask questions but I bet I may.

217
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:37,936
Hi.

218
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:39,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.

219
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:44,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I provided a memo that should have come in this morning it's very brief.

220
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:51,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to get these out much earlier, they're just kind of like a nice to have right now.

221
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:53,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you didn't read it, don't worry, I know it's late.

222
00:23:55,127 --> 00:24:09,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do I do go into discussion about why the month was chosen, and how we've been working with criterion and the property owner for well over a year, kind of going through different iterations of development proposal at the site.

223
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:16,363
[SPEAKER_03]: and how the industrial zone is very limiting and doesn't align with the comprehensive plan or the housing production plan.

224
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:24,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And this seemed like the easiest lift to just have a simple map change rather than a 40B or a PDD.

225
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:38,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seemed like just a smoother, easier process, even though the Muzz isn't a perfect ordinance, but it's the best that we have right now.

226
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:39,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

227
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for your, your input there.

228
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:45,650
[SPEAKER_14]: I see Commissioner Forte, you have a hand up.

229
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we turn to you please sir.

230
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

231
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:54,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so I guess my questions kind of fall along the same line and I believe that Danielle kind of answered it.

232
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:58,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but I guess the first question I would have is.

233
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:10,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Given the fact that you're not taking the 40B route, I would assume that the future project is not going to entail any additional approvals from Zoning Board of Appeals.

234
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:12,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct for you, Jim?

235
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:22,769
[SPEAKER_10]: At this time, based on the proposal we showed tonight, we're not anticipating requiring relief from the Zoning Board of Appeals.

236
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:26,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Those certainly will be subject to site plan review before this board.

237
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

238
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:33,072
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and I guess the next question is any portion of the property within a flood zone.

239
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:40,555
[SPEAKER_16]: And obviously your first floor elevation would be above that but I didn't see any floodplain elevations on the map.

240
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:44,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, part of the property is and our first floor would be above it.

241
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:55,803
[SPEAKER_15]: We've met briefly with conservation just to get a sense of what we're doing because we are removing some impervious soil that is in that second zone from 100 to 200.

242
00:25:56,183 --> 00:26:01,586
[SPEAKER_15]: We are putting something in that as well, but we're putting in less than we're taking out certainly.

243
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:05,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are trying to stay out of that as much as possible.

244
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:09,810
[SPEAKER_15]: We are gonna keep the first floor above that flood plain

245
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:18,307
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't have the elevations off the top of my head, but I'd be happy to send you an email and kind of lay out where it is at present.

246
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:19,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

247
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:20,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

248
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:23,091
[SPEAKER_16]: And it might be a bit early for that, but it's just a general question.

249
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:34,142
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the other general question I had was, would the reason for the zone change, and I'm just thinking future down the road,

250
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:41,299
[SPEAKER_16]: If for some reason the residential market for some reason no longer calls for these units.

251
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:54,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have an alternative plan like a plan B for this property, other than what you see there and I was residential I mean is a laboratory out of the question or is it, you know, what are your thoughts on that, Mr. Chair, again for you.

252
00:26:55,647 --> 00:27:05,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, so the museum zone I don't do think provides a lot of flexibility on that we are residential developers, but the owner of the site.

253
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:14,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Last parking has a real estate arm that has explored all kinds of uses for the site you know lab was very hot for a while.

254
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:28,436
[SPEAKER_15]: And originally when I was talking to the owner of LAS, he said, well, I like you, you know, I've done a couple of deals on his properties in the past and he likes us, but the labs were a lot better looking.

255
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:31,876
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the time he said, I have no interest in dealing with you.

256
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:36,417
[SPEAKER_15]: He went out to the lab market and wasn't successful in finding anyone.

257
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:40,678
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I think labs may come back at some point, I think

258
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:45,691
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could deliver a lab today, it would be a pretty successful lab.

259
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:52,295
[SPEAKER_15]: But the planning and the time that it takes to build, there really hasn't been a lot of interest in lab.

260
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:57,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think having the MUZ zone, though, would allow for flexibility.

261
00:27:57,137 --> 00:28:09,684
[SPEAKER_15]: If something like our project weren't to go forward, I think having this zone in place might be helpful for that possibility of more flexible uses.

262
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:12,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

263
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:17,539
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, through you, Mr. Chair, it appears as though this is all surface parking.

264
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

265
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:38,481
[SPEAKER_15]: The parking that we have is actually under the building at grade but on the first floor, and hidden by, you know, retail and storefront on the front side of the building, and hidden by just fully enclosed in the back as well, you know screen by bike parking or kayaks and things like that.

266
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:42,022
[SPEAKER_15]: So, in this configuration there is.

267
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:48,964
[SPEAKER_15]: parking at that grade and the grade isn't exactly flat out there kind of pitches towards the river.

268
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:58,826
[SPEAKER_15]: So working through those grades we are determining that we would have one story of parking underneath the building, and then the unit starting on the second floor.

269
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:01,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

270
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,267
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all the questions I have at this time.

271
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:04,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

272
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:07,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Commissioner for your questions, much appreciated.

273
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:11,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other comments or questions.

274
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

275
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:21,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Hearing none, I wonder amongst the board, will we be okay with a motion?

276
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:26,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see if I might be able to craft something over here.

277
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:43,103
[SPEAKER_14]: To recommend to the city council the adoption of the proposed rezoning of 99 Revere Beach Parkway from the current industrial zone to the mixed use MEZ zoning district found at section nine of our zoning ordinance.

278
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:45,611
[SPEAKER_17]: I will make that motion.

279
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:48,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

280
00:29:48,893 --> 00:29:49,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

281
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:51,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

282
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me go to the roll call.

283

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:06,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_14]: Peter Caldas.

292
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:10,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

293
00:30:12,183 --> 00:30:13,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

294
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:20,959
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, have we lost Ari?

295
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see Ari.

296
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:24,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I will vote yes.

297
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:36,568
[SPEAKER_11]: She's there, but she's- They dropped off and were here twice for a second, and then they came back on.

298
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:38,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

299
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,050
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know.

300
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:41,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I see them twice.

301
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:56,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well we have sufficient votes I think for, for the motion so we'll, we'll leave it at that for this moment and try to get that straight now for our next item.

302
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:03,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for the presentation tonight and information and it's like a lot of potential community developments forthcoming so we thank you.

303
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:05,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for all of you for your time.

304
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:06,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate it.

305
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:07,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

306
00:31:12,547 --> 00:31:13,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

307
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:27,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Next item on the agenda is the plan development district at to a mystic have and late breaking news the applicant has asked to withdraw this proposal that was going to be before us tonight.

308
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:35,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're advised that as a result we actually need to take a vote on accepting the withdrawal without prejudice.

309
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:51,089
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone wants to talk about that we could do that or we could just have a motion to accept the withdrawal, without prejudice of the applicants combined properties for the proposal at to any mystic.

310
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we allowed to have a little more information.

311
00:31:57,052 --> 00:31:59,354
[SPEAKER_14]: I can ask city are we in a position or you.

312
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:14,494
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not really sure we, but to share, you saw that we had a, you can see the papers we had with them.

313
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:21,761
[SPEAKER_18]: They gave us a proposed ordinance, right, zoning change.

314
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:27,506
[SPEAKER_18]: We hired a lawyer, Gareth, who sent them back changes.

315
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:37,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had a meeting with them and discuss those changes and we thought we had come to resolution on some of them and that they were going to think about some of the others and get back to us.

316
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:46,233
[SPEAKER_18]: We expected a redlined version today and instead we got a letter basically saying they objected to our changes and they were withdrawing.

317
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:53,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I did speak to them further today saying, are you sure you don't want some more time just to ask for a continuance tonight?

318
00:32:54,617 --> 00:33:04,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and their basic concern that they thought was insurmountable was that, um, sorry, I had it in front of me a minute.

319
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:11,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, the plan development district in section 924 has a section lapse.

320
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:19,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that basically says that the zoning must be commenced by a tent obtaining a special permit.

321
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:23,054
[SPEAKER_18]: as required in section 866 within two years.

322
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:37,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Until such time as that is permitted and recorded by the property owner, or if it's not obtained within two years the development, the property should be governed by the provisions presently in effect in the zoning district so basically it expires if they don't use it in two years.

323
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:45,147
[SPEAKER_18]: And they said that was too short that they anticipate meeting a meet the process that that'll take longer than two years.

324
00:33:47,152 --> 00:34:05,204
[SPEAKER_18]: I conveyed to them that perhaps that they go forward and that at some point when they know that they're not gonna be ready for the special permit in two years, they apply for an extension and they indicated that there wasn't enough certainty in that and that they wanted this changed to be longer than two years.

325
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:12,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Their lawyer had put into their language and you can see it in the version proposed to you that the,

326
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:18,473
[SPEAKER_18]: To that they proposed language sorry I had it open and I closed it that the two years.

327
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:31,145
[SPEAKER_18]: The good faith, instead of special permit that they would do a filing and ENF or er filing for me, but within the two years and that that would be the execution of it.

328
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:37,692
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't think that was defensible because it's very clearly says special permit um.

329
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:47,156
[SPEAKER_18]: I suggested to them that they could go forward with their language, but I didn't know how that would stand up, or if anybody would challenge it.

330
00:34:47,776 --> 00:35:01,148
[SPEAKER_18]: And their suggestion is that we change our zoning so that the lapse time is longer than two years, or that for large projects, projects that trigger MIPA, et cetera, they have more than two years.

331
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:05,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's where it stood.

332
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:05,849
[SPEAKER_18]: That was today.

333
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,234
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't really know what to say other than that.

334
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:11,335
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that clear?

335
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:16,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Alicia, do you know what the paper trigger was for the lie?

336
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,864
[SPEAKER_18]: No, actually, I didn't think to ask that until a few minutes ago when I was explaining it.

337
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:30,088
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was explaining to our lawyer, Gareth, and he said to me, gee, I'm not sure actually what the MIPA trigger is now that we're thinking about it.

338
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:36,352
[SPEAKER_18]: We discussed it yesterday and he kept saying because it's such a big project, it's going to trigger MIPA.

339
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:43,637
[SPEAKER_18]: And I realized that I'm I don't know, except I will say it's on Route 38.

340
00:35:44,037 --> 00:35:45,138
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is on a state road.

341
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:51,310
[SPEAKER_18]: So there may be some state permits related to the fact that it's on a state road transportation.

342
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm almost positive.

343
00:35:53,513 --> 00:35:59,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say that I can't say that I'm positive about knowing but I'm just wondering if it's transportation which we discussed in detail.

344
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:01,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

345
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:02,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

346
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:06,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

347
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:16,943
[SPEAKER_18]: So I did offer them the option to continue tonight rather than withdraw to give us some more time to to work this through and they didn't like that idea.

348
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:23,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Any follow up that's.

349
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:27,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

350
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:47,335
[SPEAKER_18]: I will just for your reference they objected to some other articles stuff that we proposed but I but they seem to all be negotiable like they didn't like we had recommended or the lawyer recommended a plan development and cooperation agreement and they didn't like that they wanted to just do special permits with them.

351
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:48,996
[SPEAKER_18]: regular conditions.

352
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:53,178
[SPEAKER_18]: And I said, OK, it was just an idea that the lawyer had proposed.

353
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:55,199
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't done anything like that before.

354
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,120
[SPEAKER_18]: If you object, we we don't need this.

355
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,361
[SPEAKER_18]: There's nothing in the zoning that requires that.

356
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:04,722
[SPEAKER_18]: So in the letter they sent me, they also objected to that.

357
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:07,383
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm OK with like, OK.

358
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:17,367
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, sounds like from your perspective, we could try to work through these issues or they're resolvable.

359
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,741
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wasn't sure about the two years.

360
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:37,785
[SPEAKER_18]: They seem to be very concerned about going through all the permit process and then having what if they asked for an extension in two years and whoever's on the board then didn't feel like giving an extension.

361
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:38,885
[SPEAKER_18]: They thought that was risky.

362
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:43,926
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

363
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:47,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Other questions or we can go to the

364
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:59,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion again there would be a motion to accept the withdrawal of combined properties for the proposal to a mystic have without prejudice.

365
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:01,790
[SPEAKER_14]: So, allowing them to come back.

366
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:05,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make the motion.

367
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:06,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

368
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:07,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second to the motion.

369
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:11,235
[SPEAKER_07]: This Christie I second.

370
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And for roll call vice chair Jackie McPherson.

371
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:15,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

372
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:17,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

373
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:17,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

374
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:17,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

375
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:17,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

376
00:38:18,386 --> 00:38:18,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

377
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:19,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

378
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:19,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

379
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:19,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

380
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:20,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

381
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:52,882
[SPEAKER_14]: a proposed drive through bank facility of Bank of America at 3085 mystic Valley Parkway.

382
00:38:55,668 --> 00:39:07,555
[SPEAKER_14]: As a summary, the existing site currently houses a surface parking lot is bounded by commercial properties to the north London street to the east locus street to the west and the northern access drive to medical and to the south.

383
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:19,621
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposed project would construct an approximately 5413 square foot bank with one drive through lane and one drive through pass bypass lane, excuse me.

384
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:22,483
[SPEAKER_14]: So to kick things off, let's.

385
00:39:23,616 --> 00:39:29,503
[SPEAKER_14]: ask the proponent to present an evening.

386
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:31,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a minute, excuse me I see Danielle's hand up.

387
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, if I could provide some context to this.

388
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:43,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this special permit.

389
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:48,433
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some confusion about process maybe because of the new ordinance.

390
00:39:49,074 --> 00:40:00,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I do think this is a requirement in the previous ordinance that special permits where city council is a special permit granting authority need to first be referred to the CD board.

391
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:07,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you all have, I think it's 35 days to provide comments.

392
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:13,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow that didn't happen and Alicia and I

393
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:21,002
[SPEAKER_03]: happened to be attending that city council meeting and saw it on the agenda and we're like, huh, we didn't see this.

394
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:36,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's still the city council opened the hearing and voted on it pending a recommendation from the Community Development Board.

395
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:41,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now, so it's kind of a process has gone backwards.

396
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:53,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, while this was happening we are trying to wrap our heads around the previous permitting, looking for the previously approved site plan, because 120,000 square foot redevelopment of that

397
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:58,368
[SPEAKER_03]: previous Meadow Glen mall.

398
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:07,691
[SPEAKER_03]: We just assumed this would have required site plan review, but after doing some research, we found out that somehow that was waived back in 2015.

399
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:16,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was not a previous site plan approval, which would have required an amendment with the construction of a new bank with a drive-thru.

400
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:25,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still a special permit, which is, I'm sorry, I have a sick child, you all said amazing, is subject to a special permit,

401
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:34,670
[SPEAKER_03]: still subject to the performance standard in the zoning ordinance, as well as six criteria for approval of a special permit.

402
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:50,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we requested a traffic memo, and we want this to get before different department heads for their review, so that those findings can be made much we requested the traffic memo and we received it on.

403
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:58,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday or Friday, but Todd Blake, the Director of Traffic and Transportation, is on vacation and has not had a chance to review it or provide comments.

404
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:11,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So, PDS's, our recommendation is that you can open this hearing and have the presentation, but to continue it to a date certain until those comments are back.

405
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:20,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Daniel, thanks for the comments and in the background there's quite a bit that you discovered along the way.

406
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:26,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it Mr. Fitz on behalf of the...

407
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:30,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Andy is not with us tonight.

408
00:42:30,754 --> 00:42:32,054
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Bill Lucas with Bowler.

409
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:36,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the consultant for Mr. Lucas.

410
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:37,917
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, that's great.

411
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I've got a vacuum going next to me here.

412
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody has challenges tonight.

413
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently.

414
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:55,327
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think, just as a procedural matter would be good, as Daniel suggests to kind of open this up, hear the presentation learn about it.

415
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:09,209
[SPEAKER_14]: We do certainly like to hear from this various city departments at their sort of key piece in our evaluation of special permit or site plan review for that matter.

416
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:15,213
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think what she's suggesting makes a lot of sense so if you're prepared to present.

417
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:22,518
[SPEAKER_14]: We can give you our undivided attention and give you feedback and comments and try to do as much as we can short of.

418
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:29,263
[SPEAKER_14]: that additional information that we'll have to address with you at the subsequent meeting.

419
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:30,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that make sense for you?

420
00:43:31,504 --> 00:43:32,025
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine.

421
00:43:32,565 --> 00:43:32,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

422
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:40,931
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's easiest for this group, then I will give a presentation tonight and I'll start by sharing my screen if that works.

423
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:41,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

424
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:43,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Give that a try.

425
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:47,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully everybody can see that on screen now.

426
00:43:47,384 --> 00:43:48,264
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks good.

427
00:43:48,944 --> 00:43:49,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Opening.

428
00:43:49,264 --> 00:43:58,487
[SPEAKER_12]: So Daniel, thanks for jumping in and kind of given the clunky background that we've kind of gone through to get to this point in time.

429
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:14,472
[SPEAKER_12]: I've not been integral with all the permitting procedure, but I am here to represent Bank of America as their civil consultant, mainly with the design of the drawings themselves and coordination with the client.

430
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:21,328
[SPEAKER_12]: To that end, I will jump in and start to move forward.

431
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:25,016
[SPEAKER_12]: What you have on screen now is outlined in purple is

432
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:29,769
[SPEAKER_12]: the property boundary for the Meadow Glen Mall.

433
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:38,332
[SPEAKER_12]: And in red in that lower left-hand corner is what our project site is for this development.

434
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:47,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Just for orientation purposes, as we move through the slides, north will be on the left-hand side of the screen, south on the right-hand side.

435
00:44:53,175 --> 00:44:57,118
[SPEAKER_12]: So a little bit of a zoomed-in view, again, of the project site itself.

436
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:02,281
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an existing parking lot that is part of the Meadow Glen Mall.

437
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:13,949
[SPEAKER_12]: In the upper right-hand corner, which is a little blocked by the North Arrow itself, is the existing marshals, just for your orientation purposes.

438
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:18,532
[SPEAKER_12]: And along the lower end of the screen, that is Locust Street.

439
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:26,079
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an existing survey if we need to get into any of the details of the site.

440
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:34,421
[SPEAKER_12]: But in general, what this shows is it's a relatively flat parking lot bounded by Locust Street along the bottom of the page.

441
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:38,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Then what you'll see on the right-hand side is an access drive to Meadow Glen.

442
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:49,630
[SPEAKER_12]: most of the utilities to the Meadow Glen Mall run along that access drive and in the future we'll talk about all of our proposed connections.

443
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:57,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of them happen along that access point except for electric and telecom which is along Locust Street.

444
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:02,118
[SPEAKER_12]: This gives you an overall view of what we're proposing.

445
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:03,559
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a 5,400 square foot Bank of America

446
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:11,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, it's a little zoomed in, so Locust Street is along the bottom of your screen.

447
00:46:12,508 --> 00:46:19,472
[SPEAKER_12]: The front door or main entrance to the building is at the lower right-hand corner of that gray box in the middle of the screen.

448
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:27,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Your drive-through, it's one lane, is located on the left-hand side of the northern end of the building, and again,

449
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:32,041
[SPEAKER_12]: As David had spoken to earlier, it does have a bypass lane.

450
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:39,427
[SPEAKER_12]: That's that second lane on the left-hand side, one way from the top of your screen to the bottom of your screen with stop and do not enter there.

451
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:44,992
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as traffic around the building itself, it's primarily two-way.

452
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:51,070
[SPEAKER_12]: with 90 degree parking stalls all facing all those drive aisles.

453
00:46:52,051 --> 00:47:06,420
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do provide ADA stalls near the main entrance along with accessibility routes from the main entrance over to the shopping center or out to Locust as made available.

454
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:24,973
[SPEAKER_12]: A quick snapshot of some of the building elevations, your typical Bank of America look, nothing that should surprise anybody here in terms of the type of colors and materials that you've seen in other locations.

455
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:35,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I'm here on a question screen, but I'll just kind of jump in to some other points of interest for the project itself.

456
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:49,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I talked about utilities, water, sewer, drainage, and our gas services will go out to the right-hand side to that access drive to the Meadow Glen Mall.

457
00:47:49,684 --> 00:47:52,105
[SPEAKER_12]: There's all existing services in that area.

458
00:47:53,022 --> 00:47:59,617
[SPEAKER_12]: and our electric and telecom will be run underground out to a utility pole on Locust Street.

459
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:18,960
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as the drainage is concerned, it will be collected from the roof and several catch basins that we're proposing as part of the development to then pipe, to be piped close to the parking field that is nearest to the main entrance of the building.

460
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,583
[SPEAKER_12]: That is an area where we had performed some exploratory soils investigation.

461
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:31,999
[SPEAKER_12]: found the best soils, which is saying a lot for this site because it's primarily urban,

462
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:37,474
[SPEAKER_12]: fill condition underlined by some clay soils on the site.

463
00:48:37,534 --> 00:48:48,098
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've had discussions with engineering at Medford to prepare this type of system to try to promote as much infiltration as we can on the site.

464
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:54,239
[SPEAKER_12]: It is not ideal conditions, but we are moving forward with that type of design on the site.

465
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,880
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of

466
00:48:57,255 --> 00:49:01,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Other permits, we don't need anything from the Conservation Commission.

467
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:03,520
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been in front of them already.

468
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:08,504
[SPEAKER_12]: We received a negative determination of applicability for this site.

469
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:14,049
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no... the closest thing was...

470
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:21,973
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it was the floodplain, but that is on the other portion of the Meadow Glen Mall, not near our site.

471
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:32,259
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, as Michelle spoke to, we had been before the city council and they recommended special permit approval, but pending review by planning staff.

472
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,782
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that said, I can open it up to any questions.

473
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:53,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, we're gonna invite members of the public, if there are folks out there who are interested in posing questions or sharing feedback, go to that now.

474
00:49:55,683 --> 00:50:09,734
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Amanda mentioned in the last public item, you can use the raise hand feature on Zoom, you can put a message in the chat,

475
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:11,548
[SPEAKER_14]: via Zoom.

476
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:16,171
[SPEAKER_14]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

477
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:19,853
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the department's email address.

478
00:50:23,574 --> 00:50:28,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, if you're out there, any visibility on whether we have a member of the public who'd like to speak on this one?

479
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:30,358
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not seeing anyone.

480
00:50:31,138 --> 00:50:39,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Bill, would you mind stopping your share screen just so I can see all the participants just to make sure?

481
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:39,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

482
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:49,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah see no hands raised, no comments in the chat and I've just refreshed our inbox and see no messages at this time.

483
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

484
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions from city staff.

485
00:50:56,436 --> 00:50:57,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we go to the board.

486
00:51:02,245 --> 00:51:03,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, board members.

487
00:51:04,547 --> 00:51:05,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait a minute.

488
00:51:05,768 --> 00:51:07,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Commissioner, you have your hand up.

489
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:08,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

490
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,714
[SPEAKER_16]: The one question I do have is that I know that there was some talk about separating this lot.

491
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:20,599
[SPEAKER_16]: And through you to the petitioner, is there is there going to be a subdivision of this lot?

492
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,142
[SPEAKER_12]: It is not proposed as part of this development at this time.

493
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:31,507
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of in the future, that may be considered but

494
00:51:32,663 --> 00:51:35,748
[SPEAKER_12]: We are not proposing that as part of this application now.

495
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

496
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:36,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

497
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:41,757
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the other question I had was the proposed number of spaces that are on

498
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:44,550
[SPEAKER_16]: the particular leased lot, if you will.

499
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,452
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to just call it a leased area or a leased lot.

500
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:53,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they been deducted from the parking of the main campus?

501
00:51:54,395 --> 00:52:04,221
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be one concern that I have, you know, for obvious reasons that, you know, we don't want to reduce the amount of parking for the other, you know, for the other project.

502
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:11,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Although there was no controlling site plan, if I understand correctly from Danielle and Alicia, that it was somehow issued by right

503
00:52:12,442 --> 00:52:15,905
[SPEAKER_16]: which makes no sense to me, but I guess that's what happened.

504
00:52:17,106 --> 00:52:21,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Was there an analysis done on the existing building and the parking requirements?

505
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:26,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

506
00:52:26,594 --> 00:52:34,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It was counted just in that little screen view of that portion of the lot itself, there's 172 parking spaces existing.

507
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:39,570
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we're proposing now is 117.

508
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:54,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a reduction of, you know, again, quick math, 55 parking spaces in that area, but we had not performed an analysis on the entire shopping center with respect to the parking.

509
00:52:54,638 --> 00:53:02,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's, you know, maybe that needs to be done and back checked versus zoning just to confirm everything is in compliance.

510
00:53:03,995 --> 00:53:20,860
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think, you know, based on what we've seen in the field, and as evidenced by the screenshot that I took and displayed earlier tonight, that is just an underutilized parking lot, and there's relatively no cars parked in that area.

511
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:23,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

512
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:23,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

513
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:24,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

514
00:53:26,882 --> 00:53:29,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Board members, Jackie did I see your hand up.

515
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:35,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I just can't hear you though.

516
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on mute, I apologize.

517
00:53:40,622 --> 00:53:51,828
[SPEAKER_08]: So I live right across the street behind 61 Locust, and one of the things, as the point has said, it can be underutilized, but then there's times it's like, when it's bursting, right?

518
00:53:51,908 --> 00:53:57,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And now that there's the Ford Tavern there, the Ford Tavern, I thought had some kind of a, I'm not sure, the city would know this more.

519
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:15,787
[SPEAKER_08]: a partnership with that least parking that's right directly across the street from it and then when they're still over during the holidays from the metal glen mall that parking lot is used and if i'm not mistaken there's also a dog park there that is sometimes brings more cars so i'm just trying to figure out um

520
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:28,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that the commissioner brought up the parking issue because I'm trying to figure out where all of those cars would go, even though it's not pretty much utilized for, I don't know, 70% of the year, 30% is still a lot when you don't have parking.

521
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:38,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just trying to, in the absence of department head information from the traffic engineer, I guess I'm just,

522
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:43,177
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fair question, Jackie.

523
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:48,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we can go back and do a little more homework in terms of, you know, we're not going to get a vote tonight, right?

524
00:54:48,921 --> 00:55:05,794
[SPEAKER_12]: But we can do a little more homework on our end just to confirm, you know, what the parking counts are, you know, maybe across the entire shopping center or with respect to the other uses that are in the shopping center to confirm, you know, what is existing out there versus what we're proposing and what is required.

525
00:55:05,814 --> 00:55:08,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a that's a takeaway for us.

526
00:55:11,635 --> 00:55:12,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

527
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:14,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, good takeaway.

528
00:55:16,376 --> 00:55:18,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Other questions from board members?

529
00:55:24,198 --> 00:55:25,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I had a couple of questions.

530
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:37,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you walk us through how would a pedestrian coming off of Locust, right?

531
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:38,161
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the main street.

532
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:55,778
[SPEAKER_14]: What's, what's the access or are those, do we have, you know, good quality PVA standard sidewalks that will will lead a pedestrian all the way to the bank from the, from the main road.

533
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:19,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you didn't ask me, but thanks to that development that's on close to 61 Locust, we do.

534
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:22,676
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually came with a previous development.

535
00:56:25,136 --> 00:56:26,917
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so this view may be the best.

536
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:31,518
[SPEAKER_12]: There is an existing sidewalk.

537
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:33,799
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll start at this bottom lower left-hand corner.

538
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:44,469
[SPEAKER_12]: There's existing sidewalk that traverses along the eastern side of Locust Street, across the driveway that exists out there now.

539
00:56:45,209 --> 00:57:02,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Along, it runs up the access aisle, drive aisle, all the way to a point where the sidewalk then jogs across this access drive again, a little bit of a semicircle, and then crosses over to where

540
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:05,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Marshalls is located.

541
00:57:06,195 --> 00:57:16,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the same time, back at this point, we provide another connection from that same sidewalk system to the building itself.

542
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can kind of try to highlight that a little bit better for everybody on this.

543
00:57:27,045 --> 00:57:31,888
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't mind, my quick markups here.

544
00:57:35,293 --> 00:57:48,346
[SPEAKER_12]: That is your sidewalk system that exists out there today relatively flat and to our knowledge ADA compliant from the door to the street and also to the shopping center itself.

545
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:50,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

546
00:57:50,288 --> 00:57:50,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that.

547
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:53,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, your hand is up.

548
00:57:53,492 --> 00:57:54,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I had other questions but

549
00:57:57,506 --> 00:58:08,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Mr. Chair, I had received a comment in from a member of the public I believe through our email and wasn't sure if now would be an appropriate time.

550
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:16,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to yield to the member of the public who has something to share with us and I can my questions can wait until after that.

551
00:58:16,715 --> 00:58:17,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

552
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:26,224
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, if the member of the public that is watching could perhaps identify themselves, because we will need your name and address for the record.

553
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:42,078
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the interim, the question was relating to, so there's currently a small dog area in the vicinity, and they were wondering if that area will be removed as a result of this proposal.

554
00:58:44,286 --> 00:58:45,707
[SPEAKER_12]: the dog area will remain.

555
00:58:46,468 --> 00:58:54,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And just for everybody's reference, it sits up in this area where I just kind of drew a quick circle.

556
00:58:55,196 --> 00:58:57,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I could probably find another slide in this.

557
00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:02,829
[SPEAKER_12]: set that gives you a better reference point to it.

558
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:07,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, maybe this is a little bit better of a view.

559
00:59:08,592 --> 00:59:14,734
[SPEAKER_12]: It sits up in this area, but that is outside of the limit of work that we're proposing.

560
00:59:14,754 --> 00:59:21,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

561
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:22,877
[SPEAKER_14]: More, Amanda, or was that just?

562
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:24,537
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

563
00:59:24,917 --> 00:59:25,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

564
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:25,638
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

565
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:26,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

566
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:26,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Good question.

567
00:59:30,257 --> 00:59:32,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know, Sir Lucas is this.

568
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:41,760
[SPEAKER_14]: So this, this is not just a drive through but this is going to be, I can walk in and do my banking there'll be a staff there'll be employees at the bank they're available during banking hours.

569
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:42,900
[SPEAKER_14]: That is correct.

570
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:43,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

571
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:44,841
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

572
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:52,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And could you get the traffic engineers, I'm sure we'll be together and be able to talk about these sorts of things at the next meeting.

573
00:59:53,443 --> 01:00:00,290
[SPEAKER_14]: But can you just give me a flavor for the point where the two-way becomes a one-way?

574
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:11,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It just strikes me as a bit of a potential conflict there with cars trying to figure out which direction they're allowed to go in that northwest quadrant as we're looking at your screen right now.

575
01:00:12,714 --> 01:00:36,388
[SPEAKER_12]: sure yeah so i just kind of circled that area again and again let's assume traffic's coming in off of the access drive to the metaglen mall you'll you make a left into the site and you'll be able to traverse your way from the southbound side to the northbound side uh pick up parking along the way and continue along the back of the building where you can then enter the drive-through

576
01:00:37,188 --> 01:00:45,536
[SPEAKER_12]: or if you can't find a parking space, you'll be able to bypass and then recirculate around the building in a counterclockwise manner.

577
01:00:45,716 --> 01:01:00,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Likewise, if you're coming in from that same area, if you were to make a left, an immediate left to go in front of the building, you would circulate around looking for a parking space and then, you know, would be blocked by the do not enters that sit at that

578
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:09,900
[SPEAKER_12]: And you would then circulate around counterclockwise again to get back to that drive through if you had mistakenly not found that area.

579
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:20,672
[SPEAKER_12]: But really what you need that two way at the rear of this, so that way cars can kind of back out and then head towards the mall or exit back out onto Locust Street.

580
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:40,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, so I guess it would just be enlightening I think I won't be with you the next meeting but at the next meeting to have some indication like for instance, at the end of those two drive lanes you have wonderful indicators here for a stop, maybe giving the board a sense of what

581
01:01:41,946 --> 01:01:55,613
[SPEAKER_14]: what a driver would encounter or see in that corners are going to be some signage or something on the asphalt or some elevated sign or some indication that we're going from from two way to one way, I think would be helpful to see.

582
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:58,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'll make another one.

583
01:01:58,955 --> 01:02:09,861
[SPEAKER_14]: And I noticed while you had that zoomed that there's a, it looks like a fair amount of landscaping that's being added over there to the left of your drive lanes.

584
01:02:10,712 --> 01:02:19,279
[SPEAKER_12]: That is, that is correct we may have a better slide that gives you a little better indication of some of the landscaping that we're.

585
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, it's primarily a paved parking lot.

586
01:02:23,502 --> 01:02:33,770
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we'll be decreasing the impervious coverage on the site itself and then introducing some more green, we're showing for trees along that left hand or the northern.

587
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:47,916
[SPEAKER_12]: property line, and that as well as for trees in and around the building itself, as well as, you know, numerous shrubs and grasses and mulch beds in and around the parking field.

588
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:50,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

589
01:02:50,777 --> 01:02:51,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

590
01:02:54,058 --> 01:02:55,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Other questions yes class.

591
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

592
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:03,082
[SPEAKER_17]: Given that this is my last meeting.

593
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:06,847
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna bang this drum one more time.

594
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:26,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I would encourage the proponent here and all future proponents to bring exhibits to these meetings which accurately display what you're trying to show.

595
01:03:26,544 --> 01:03:29,527
[SPEAKER_17]: These are a series of technical drawings that

596
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:47,983
[SPEAKER_17]: are, you know, at quick glance, very hard to understand, and they're overweighed with utility information, below grade information, a lot happening on one drawing that's making it very hard for us to really piece together all this information.

597
01:03:48,044 --> 01:03:57,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would encourage you, and like I said, everybody going forward to think about that when you're presenting to a group of

598
01:03:58,742 --> 01:04:01,863
[SPEAKER_17]: people, some of which are lay people.

599
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:14,649
[SPEAKER_17]: So for next time, again, I think it would be important to have a rendered site plan with a better description of the landscaping that you're proposing here.

600
01:04:18,531 --> 01:04:28,355
[SPEAKER_17]: For David's comment, a better understanding of how pedestrian circulation happens through the site, to the site,

601
01:04:30,678 --> 01:04:48,647
[SPEAKER_17]: and how traffic moves around the site, including, and definitely an understanding of the loss of parking and how that factors into the overall development or the, I wanna call it the Wegmans lot here.

602
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:54,430
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's, I don't think, I personally don't have an issue with the loss of parking.

603
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:56,391
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's better to see,

604
01:04:57,858 --> 01:05:00,279
[SPEAKER_17]: this kind of thing and more activity on the site.

605
01:05:00,399 --> 01:05:07,500
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think just quantifying that will make a better argument for approval in the end.

606
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:10,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

607
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:13,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

608
01:05:14,701 --> 01:05:26,764
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can piggyback on Clay's too, and I agree with all the suggestions, if there's a little bit more in terms of the building rendering than what you've presented here, even if it's a photo of a couple of other

609
01:05:27,913 --> 01:05:31,436
[SPEAKER_14]: banks that were have been constructed the last few years that are the model for this one.

610
01:05:32,076 --> 01:05:34,838
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, that's all that those can be super helpful as well.

611
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:47,568
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

612
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:55,735
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure I can see everyone but is everyone satisfied in terms of questions for this evening.

613
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Lucas, thank you for the presentation and answering the questions.

614
01:06:04,553 --> 01:06:06,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, I presume we should try to find a date.

615
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:14,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that would be I think that would be wise.

616
01:06:15,984 --> 01:06:20,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't it's not this is not a public hearing.

617
01:06:20,406 --> 01:06:33,054
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can't come to a date certain I'm assuming Bill, you'll probably want to confer with your colleagues and the rest of your applicant team on a date so we can

618
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:41,839
[SPEAKER_01]: do this offline, but just for reference, the board meets every first and third Wednesday of the month for the most part.

619
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:45,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, next meeting is July 5th.

620
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:55,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Agenda is actually wide open for that meeting, if you felt very confident about wanting to be there for that, or we can discuss offline.

621
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,510
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could tentatively put us down for July 5th, that'd be

622
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:06,075
[SPEAKER_12]: fantastic and then I would in the meantime confer with Andy.

623
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:11,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we go too far, Danielle I see your hand is raised.

624
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:28,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just also want to note that because planning staff did not see this at all before it was submitted, and we're just, we're basically in a hustle to get this on the agenda to not run afoul of

625
01:07:30,023 --> 01:07:30,663
[SPEAKER_03]: the process.

626
01:07:30,984 --> 01:07:34,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the land, the landscaping doesn't comply with our ordinance.

627
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:39,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it doesn't have the requisite amount of interior landscaping.

628
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,591
[SPEAKER_03]: They have more than 20 spaces in a row.

629
01:07:41,631 --> 01:07:44,232
[SPEAKER_03]: They're unbroken, which isn't allowed.

630
01:07:44,392 --> 01:07:45,953
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have the buffer strips.

631
01:07:46,474 --> 01:07:52,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to work on this and, um, get in touch with

632
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:58,206
[SPEAKER_03]: whoever the landscaper or the landscaping designer is.

633
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:03,310
[SPEAKER_03]: The only communication I've had is with the permitting person.

634
01:08:05,311 --> 01:08:10,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we haven't had any pre-submission reviews, so it needs work.

635
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:13,377
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure that they will be ready on the 5th.

636
01:08:14,317 --> 01:08:17,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's unlikely.

637
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:22,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And given that that's the day after holiday, we might not even

638
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:23,634
[SPEAKER_03]: have a quorum.

639
01:08:24,795 --> 01:08:27,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps you'd want to push it out another meeting.

640
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:32,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Next meeting presumably would be on the 19th.

641
01:08:36,385 --> 01:08:37,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, your head.

642
01:08:38,006 --> 01:08:39,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's correct.

643
01:08:40,948 --> 01:08:48,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that an alternative that would be at least a good tentative date for everyone involved.

644
01:08:52,271 --> 01:08:53,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Lucas that possibility for you.

645
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a possibility for us.

646
01:08:58,155 --> 01:09:13,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously it sounds as if the critical path is, you know, getting the reviews completed by all the technical folks at Medford before we can, you know, see those and address them in a timely manner.

647
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:20,952
[SPEAKER_14]: The other input otherwise we can look for a motion to continue.

648
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:30,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to continue to say July.

649
01:09:32,477 --> 01:09:35,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so a second for that.

650
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:38,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second.

651
01:09:39,462 --> 01:09:43,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you and I'll come right back to you on the roll call vice chair Jackie McPherson.

652
01:09:44,105 --> 01:09:44,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

653
01:09:45,526 --> 01:09:45,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

654
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:45,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

655
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:46,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

656
01:09:46,887 --> 01:09:47,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

657
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:55,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you a Gulfman Fishman?

658
01:09:56,529 --> 01:09:56,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

659
01:09:57,491 --> 01:09:58,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm a yes as well.

660
01:09:58,773 --> 01:09:59,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Lucas, thanks very much.

661
01:09:59,976 --> 01:10:00,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

662
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

663
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good evening everyone.

664
01:10:04,665 --> 01:10:04,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

665
01:10:09,937 --> 01:10:24,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, next item on the agenda, and I think it's just to mention by way of update was going to be the site plan review a continuation of the discussion we started our last meeting with each part at 285 to 95 mils like staff.

666
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:31,542
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks like that is continued and will not be on the for us to discuss tonight.

667
01:10:32,222 --> 01:10:33,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Amanda, am I, am I good there.

668
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:34,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that accurate.

669
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:38,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'll just announce that continued to July 5.

670
01:10:39,186 --> 01:10:40,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those interested.

671
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:42,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

672
01:10:43,788 --> 01:10:48,349
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, next time you need to vote to continue it to that date.

673
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we do.

674
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:50,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

675
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,771
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, fair enough.

676
01:10:52,431 --> 01:10:54,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make a motion to continue to July 5.

677
01:10:55,220 --> 01:11:00,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And before we do a motion, we may not have a quorum, but we can just continue it in it.

678
01:11:00,384 --> 01:11:02,266
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no quorum and it's just continuous.

679
01:11:02,286 --> 01:11:03,447
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm concerned with.

680
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:07,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I know we're losing members and I myself will not be here July 5th.

681
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:14,196
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have one person like log on and vote to continue it.

682
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:16,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have to do that in some roles sometimes.

683
01:11:16,879 --> 01:11:21,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So we drive to city hall, be there to say I continue all the matters.

684
01:11:24,873 --> 01:11:25,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I will.

685
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:27,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure I will be here.

686
01:11:27,394 --> 01:11:30,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if we need somebody to log on.

687
01:11:32,035 --> 01:11:33,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be around to Peter.

688
01:11:34,496 --> 01:11:35,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I second your motion.

689
01:11:35,897 --> 01:11:37,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

690
01:11:38,778 --> 01:11:44,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so do we have we have a motion and we have a second, and let me start with a roll call again then.

691
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:47,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I got a second.

692
01:11:47,889 --> 01:11:48,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I motion.

693
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:53,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I second Emily's and Emily you second Peter's for me.

694
01:11:54,754 --> 01:11:56,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I second.

695
01:11:56,915 --> 01:11:57,556
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

696
01:11:57,696 --> 01:12:04,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I came right back to Jackie on the roll call basis to ask her if she was a year and a. Okay.

697
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:07,243
[SPEAKER_14]: And she was a yes okay Clayson Dresen.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:18,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

703
01:12:19,658 --> 01:12:20,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

704
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:21,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

705
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,102
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm a yes on the H mark continuance as well.

706
01:12:25,982 --> 01:12:26,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Excuse me, sidebar here.

710
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Commissioner was that a wave goodbye.

711
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:53,583
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a wave goodbye actually I don't think that you are in need of my services any longer so thank you very much for your time and your courage.

712
01:12:53,823 --> 01:12:55,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for being here we really appreciate it.

713
01:12:55,903 --> 01:12:56,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

714

[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:12:58,284 --> 01:13:00,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, back back two minutes.

[SPEAKER_14]: Any comments.

[SPEAKER_14]: I read them didn't didn't have any suggestions there myself.

[SPEAKER_14]: But if barring any comments or discussion motion for approval of minutes.

01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:25,782
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it.

722
01:13:25,842 --> 01:13:26,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

723
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:28,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second for Jackie's motion.

724
01:13:38,857 --> 01:13:39,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

01:13:41,138 --> 01:13:45,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And roll call to approve minutes from a third vice chair Jackie McPherson.

726
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:47,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, class Andreessen.

01:13:48,582 --> 01:13:49,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Christy down.

728
01:13:50,623 --> 01:13:51,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Emily had.

729
01:13:51,884 --> 01:13:54,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to abstain, I was not in attendance.

730
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:55,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

731
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:56,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point.

732
01:13:56,546 --> 01:13:57,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Peter colors.

733
01:13:58,107 --> 01:13:58,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

734
01:13:59,307 --> 01:14:00,268
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, got my fishermen.

735
01:14:01,588 --> 01:14:01,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

736
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:04,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and I'm good with the meetings I'm a yes as well.

737
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:12,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, miscellaneous items.

738
01:14:13,132 --> 01:14:16,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me go back to Amanda, what do we have to share?

739
01:14:18,135 --> 01:14:23,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so several of you will be kind of terming out soon.

740
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:28,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to, so I guess a couple of things.

741
01:14:29,202 --> 01:14:30,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first and foremost, thank you.

742
01:14:30,863 --> 01:14:31,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

743
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:50,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we haven't talked already, it might be helpful to if each of you could reach out and let me know whether or not there's any availability on your end to participate in like a holdover status if needed.

744
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:57,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mentioned it because we do have two candidates that were putting before the mayor for review.

745
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:06,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I just think, um, in the interest of being safe, it might be great to have an understanding of who might be available for another meeting.

746
01:15:07,214 --> 01:15:19,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, So I lay that out there and I think kind of going off of that, um, I want to say was class had, um, thrown out the idea of having kind of an in person hangout.

747
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:19,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

748
01:15:20,965 --> 01:15:23,827
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, before everyone goes different ways.

749
01:15:24,848 --> 01:15:45,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if folks were still, I haven't done any planning on that, I apologize, but if folks are still interested, I'd love to kind of just reanimate that conversation and we can do it offline, but just kind of wanted to temperature check if in the next couple of weeks that might be something of interest to y'all.

750
01:15:47,822 --> 01:15:51,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me, I'll hit you up, I'll hit you up offline, Amanda, on that one.

751
01:15:51,665 --> 01:15:52,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that sound good?

752
01:15:53,566 --> 01:15:54,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

753
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:55,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, awesome.

754
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:57,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

755
01:15:59,191 --> 01:16:08,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so then other than that, next meeting technically we had, which is the fifth, we had scheduled for elections.

756
01:16:10,059 --> 01:16:11,660
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're worried about quorum,

757
01:16:13,692 --> 01:16:15,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we want to rethink that a little bit.

758
01:16:16,916 --> 01:16:19,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, I don't know, temperature check.

759
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like Jackie, we knew you wouldn't be available.

760
01:16:23,785 --> 01:16:25,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Emily and Peter, you said you would be.

761
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:30,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Ari, do you anticipate that you'll be around that meeting?

762
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:43,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a chance I might be in a car from the Cape, depending on how bad traffic is, but I can tune in by phone if necessary, if running late.

763
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:44,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

764
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:45,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

765
01:16:48,752 --> 01:16:49,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's...

766
01:16:50,298 --> 01:16:59,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we should play that by ear a little bit, especially based on whether we turn around the candidate reviews by the mayor.

767
01:17:01,986 --> 01:17:04,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll be in touch on that as well.

768
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:07,690
[SPEAKER_01]: That could easily be shifted to a subsequent meeting.

769
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:22,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And last, we did get a PDD submission for 243 Mystic Ave, which was Verdant Bio, which if you recall, they've been in front of you guys a couple of times for kind of informal feedback.

770
01:17:23,404 --> 01:17:26,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're aiming for the July 19th meeting.

771
01:17:27,285 --> 01:17:32,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something exciting to look forward to as far as discourse goes.

772
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:38,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's all I had unless Alicia or Danielle had anything else they wanted to add.

773
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:42,660
[SPEAKER_03]: All good.

774
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:44,421
[SPEAKER_14]: All good.

775
01:17:45,562 --> 01:18:03,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, I'll take the last moment of chairpersonship to thank everyone involved, obviously, fellow board members for everything that you do and as hard as you work and you've always been very patient with all of my mistakes and I thank you for that.

776
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:11,414
[SPEAKER_14]: And to our wonderful city staff, Alicia, for all of your hard work and

777
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,891
[SPEAKER_14]: care for the city and Danielle.

778
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:15,851
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been great working with you.

779
01:18:16,612 --> 01:18:25,195
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, superstar Amanda, who has spent so many, so many hours talking to me offline about various things.

780
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:28,996
[SPEAKER_14]: So I always appreciate your patience and, and your input as well.

781
01:18:29,016 --> 01:18:30,697
[SPEAKER_14]: So, thank you.

782
01:18:33,438 --> 01:18:37,159
[SPEAKER_14]: With that, I think we can talk about emotion to adjourn.

783
01:18:41,423 --> 01:18:42,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Would someone like to offer one.

784
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:49,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I will tell you offline, I'll pick up the conversation offline but I want to thank you for meeting us, Mr. Chair.

785
01:18:50,407 --> 01:19:02,212
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for sure, because I know even in preparation within my seat, it's it's a heavy lift and I can only imagine all that you had to do to keep up so I appreciate all done I think I can't speak for the board, but

786
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:08,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives me angst to know that we're going to lose you in leading that.

787
01:19:09,057 --> 01:19:15,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm sure that, like myself, all of us want to see the city pull forward with these planning projects and things like that.

788
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:20,425
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's kind of hard, the capacity of it, the bandwidth of it, right?

789
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are very appreciative.

790
01:19:22,446 --> 01:19:26,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very appreciative of all you've done to keep us straight.

791
01:19:28,689 --> 01:19:29,189
[SPEAKER_14]: You're the best.

792
01:19:29,249 --> 01:19:29,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

793
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:30,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that.

794
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:36,635
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't mention mistakes, I wouldn't know that they existed.

795
01:19:36,955 --> 01:19:38,156
[SPEAKER_17]: I certainly second that.

796
01:19:41,058 --> 01:19:42,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I started it.

797
01:19:42,639 --> 01:19:43,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

798
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

799
01:19:45,722 --> 01:19:46,022
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

800
01:19:48,064 --> 01:19:49,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps now a motion to adjourn.

801
01:19:51,206 --> 01:19:52,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give a motion to adjourn.

802
01:19:52,867 --> 01:19:53,688
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, in a second.

803
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:54,949
[SPEAKER_17]: I will say.

804
01:19:56,908 --> 01:20:00,974
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, last roll call here we go last time I call it out vice chair Jackie McPherson.

805
01:20:01,414 --> 01:20:01,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

806
01:20:02,516 --> 01:20:03,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

807
01:20:03,918 --> 01:20:04,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:09,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

811
01:20:10,207 --> 01:20:10,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

812
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

813
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:13,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

814
01:20:14,453 --> 01:20:15,254
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a yes as well.

815
01:20:15,955 --> 01:20:18,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks again everyone and have a great night.

816
01:20:19,179 --> 01:20:20,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Hope to see all of you very soon.
