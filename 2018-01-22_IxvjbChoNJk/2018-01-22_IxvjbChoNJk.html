    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1.292s">So</a>  today I'm here to ask for support and help for the Roberts PTO's grant application to the Community Preservation Commission for the restoration of our school playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=10.679s">The</a>  Roberts Elementary School is one of the most populous elementary schools in Medford and our playground, as are all the elementary school playgrounds, is in need of replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=19.426s">The</a>  worst item in all our playgrounds seems to be the surfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=22.969s">So</a>  I applied for this grant for a few reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=25.751s">One</a>  was that I saw the mayor's capital improvement plan at a city council meeting and it included line items to replace one school playground per year, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=35.056s">And</a>  I thought if we coupled it with community preservation money, we could replace two playgrounds per year and everyone could have a new playground in two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=44.042s">So</a>  that would be about 2,400 students in our elementary schools that would all have a shiny new playground to play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=50.615s">So</a>  that benefit would radiate out through the neighborhood that each school is in because it will allow their family members of the students to enjoy the playgrounds as well as people that just live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=61.318s">We've</a>  gone through the eligibility phase and we now have to prepare a complete application. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=68.119s">So</a>  we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost and we need help from the district in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=74.981s">figure</a>  out the parameters of what you'll require, companies that we have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=79.404s">This</a>  is outside of my scope of expertise as well as my authority as a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=86.789s">We</a>  were able to apply with a supporting letter from the principal at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=91.793s">But</a>  in order to go forward, we need approval and help from the school committee and the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=98.238s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we're going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=101.1s">The</a>  application needs to be submitted by March 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=104.762s">I'm</a>  hoping that we'll make it through the first round because that will allow for completion to happen in the summer when the students are not in school so that they won't have any interrupted recess time and they'll be able to start September with a shiny new playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=117.927s">If</a>  we do receive community preservation funds, there are other grants that we can apply for to help supplement, but we're not eligible to apply for those grants until we receive funding from the community preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=134.047s">I'm</a>  hoping that you guys can help me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=135.848s">That's</a>  pretty much why I'm here.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=137.49s">Superintendent</a>  and other estimates for the new school year.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=140.852s">Well,</a>  the estimates, you know, vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=142.654s">It</a>  depends on what we decide should be the surface on those playgrounds, because we may not want to go with the same surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=149.499s">You</a>  may want something different, something that maybe is a newer product than what we put in place 15, 16 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=157.845s">And</a>  we need to get a better estimate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=159.806s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=160.747s">While</a>  this may be an interesting opportunity, we're also looking at the community preservation grant for other issues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=166.093s">Going</a>  forward, generally for us in the second round, and I was going to give you some materials on that at a subsequent meeting, because the second round will be coming up as well, and to look at a larger picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=176.824s">But</a>  I think if we, since it's March 2nd, I think we put it on the table tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=181.789s">I'll</a>  come back with more specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=184.271s">and</a>  try to give you an idea of whether this is feasible under the Community Preservation Grant or whether it needs to go through some other process. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=191.913s">I</a>  think that's probably the best way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=193.893s">Obviously,</a>  we're glad to get any funding we can get, appreciate your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=197.894s">But</a>  to do this right, this is not a $5,000 or $10,000 expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=201.815s">This</a>  could be $75,000, $100,000, or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=204.036s">So</a>  this is not something that's going to be easily acquired from any one source.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=209.667s">Motion</a>  on the floor to request an estimate from various entities.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=213.768s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero In addition to that motion, I would like to ask that we We move this issue to do two of our subcommittees The first is the buildings and grounds to see how we can move forward on this issue and also to see if we could do Community relations to see if there are any subcontractors in the town that would be willing to donate</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=234.155s">Generally,</a>  a paper goes to one committee, not to two. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=236.676s">So</a>  if you send it to Building and Grounds, they could do their homework there with Mr. McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=242.079s">But</a>  in addition to the estimate, I'd like to suggest that we send this issue to Building and Grounds for more research.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=247.488s">On</a>  the motion that the paper be seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=249.89s">Mostow,</a>  I'm sent to the Building and Grounds Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=252.411s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto, did you wish to speak on this?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=255.333s">I</a>  remember recently walking the playgrounds and that some of this preliminary work John might have already done and had ideas for different <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=266.52s">different</a>  materials, so it's not a new idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=269.681s">It's</a>  something that we know that we're in great need for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=274.003s">And</a>  some of the research might have been done, but we need to decide what products are best. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=279.905s">But</a>  I believe that we should work with Cheryl to move this forward right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=286.027s">This</a>  was on my wish list when I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=289.408s">This</a>  thank you for taking it and running with it and making it come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=294.274s">So</a>  I would like to move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=296.977s">And</a>  I'm sure Mr. McLaughlin already has some ideas of where to call and what types of materials people are using.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=304.625s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=306.806s">Mustone</a>  to move this paper into subcommittee building and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=309.807s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=311.468s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=311.568s">Speak</a>  on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=311.989s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=312.389s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=312.689s">Van</a>  der Kloot?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=313.449s">I</a>  just wanted to thank Cheryl for coming before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=316.451s">Cheryl,</a>  you're great at searching out opportunities to get money for the students at the Robertson. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=322.153s">I</a>  really appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=324.534s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=325.695s">On</a>  the motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=327.516s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=328.076s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=328.877s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=329.637s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=330.077s">Rodriguez.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=330.938s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=331.398s">Cheryl.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=369.343s">Very</a>  good report of superintendent report on me see participation in superintendent search Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=375.725s">So</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, earlier in the minutes you heard that we approved retaining Massachusetts Association of School Committees to be our agent to advance the search. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=386.787s">This</a>  afternoon, the Mayor and I met with Glenn Kuchar, the Executive Director of MASC, and went over all the different functions and activities that they can assist us with. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=395.109s">And</a>  it's quite substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=396.55s">And</a>  as you know, because we pay dues, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=398.83s">You</a>  know, we're not incurring an additional charge, which we might if we contracted with someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=405.414s">In</a>  the interim, we've put a pretty aggressive schedule together. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=408.617s">As</a>  the mayor indicated, we'll clean it up tonight and get something out to you over the next day or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=413.8s">But</a>  the first schedule was obviously the search committee, and the mayor's put something like that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=418.763s">But</a>  in the interim, just to give you some information with regard to this particular activity, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=426.731s">Glenn</a>  Kuchar indicated to us that he could distribute our brochure, he could distribute our applications, he could take in the applications as they came in, turn them around very quickly, give us a tiering as to who's eligible or not just simply by licensure and a few things like that, get it over to the search committee generally within a day, believe it or not, and create the circumstances in which this would go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=452.452s">He</a>  would also work on creating focus groups <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=454.894s">and</a>  other aspects of this search, site visits, and other things that you may or may not want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=462.839s">But</a>  clearly, this will take us into high gear with the idea being that a decision would be made sometime at the beginning of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=471.624s">And</a>  this is the path we're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=475.066s">The</a>  report I'm giving you right now gives you an idea that he'll get it out to a wide audience to help us screen the applicants to make sure the people are eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=483.632s">The</a>  search committee will get every applicant, whether they consider them eligible or not, in hard copy as well as electronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=492.718s">The</a>  survey developed by the school committee, I want to talk to Mr. Rousseau about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=496.603s">He</a>  will assist in getting that out and pulling those results together along with the focus groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=500.948s">Again,</a>  pulling it together so that it takes the burden off any one member to do that or the administrations to keep it clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=510.319s">He'll</a>  assist in the preparation of interviews, you know, questions for you to help you develop questions and appropriate information so you can group them properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=518.224s">I</a>  went through a process of how they do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=520.805s">And</a>  then, of course, following up with contract negotiations with the successful candidate or the candidate that you select. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=526.969s">So</a>  there's a lot here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=528.89s">Clearly</a>  having an agent on board moves it forward, takes the burden off us to do it, and it keeps us on track to have a decision by April, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=540.096s">Now,</a>  the one thing we've got to understand is that when materials come in, it's confidential at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=547.841s">Just</a>  because you get something doesn't mean you go talking about who applied, because people are entitled to a certain amount of privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=554.426s">Once</a>  it reaches the final stage, privacy's off. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=558.79s">And</a>  then people can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=560.251s">There'll</a>  be public interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=561.391s">There'll</a>  be all the kinds of things that will give the community total transparency as to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=566.434s">It's</a>  very extensive, and I think that, uh, based on the discussions we had today and based on what you will learn in the next few days, that, uh, you'll see this is a very, very wide open search. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=576.638s">It's</a>  intended to bring in candidates around. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=578.679s">Uh,</a>  he's in Lexington tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=580.9s">I</a>  think Lexington's about to make a decision tonight on its selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=584.762s">And</a>  a few other communities that will be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=587.345s">And</a>  I think we'll be excited to see pools of candidates come into our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=591.189s">So</a>  with that, I think that gives you an update on MASC's involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=596.034s">Quickly</a>  came to the table with us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=597.755s">Remember,</a>  we only did it last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=599.577s">And</a>  quickly came to the table today to work out some details.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=603.234s">This</a>  time I really would like to thank the committee that got together to put together the survey led by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=608.06s">Van</a>  der Kloot, Mr. Russo, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=610.363s">Kreatz,</a>  formerly Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=611.665s">Cuno,</a>  also served prior to January, along with Jenny Graham, a parent who stepped up and actually put the brochure together and really <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=619.915s">nice</a>  looking brochure demonstrating the strengths of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=623.898s">So</a>  I just want to thank all of you for your hard work in such a tight little time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=628.202s">And</a>  if you do have any of the documents, including the survey, if you could get it to us so that we can get it to Glenn, so he can start to get them formalized and out the door.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=636.528s">Just</a>  if we will, we have to go over a couple of things because it's on your account and we need to move it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=641.972s">A</a>  couple of technical things that we're going to have to do.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=646.537s">Superintendent</a>  Belson, is it possible that Glenn could put on a presentation for the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=657.888s">Because</a>  he's seen a lot of these superintendent searches. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=660.01s">It</a>  would be really helpful.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=660.831s">He</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=661.231s">He's</a>  going to actually put together focus groups for not only the citizenry at large but also internally for teachers and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=668.918s">We</a>  will not be at the administrative meeting because they like to kind of do things with just him. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=673.722s">But</a>  we certainly, he will be putting something on for the public as well as the school committee and the ultimate search committee as well to say like the do's and the don'ts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=682.768s">If</a>  certain questions are legal you cannot ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=685.25s">So</a>  everyone needs to be apprised of that and stick to that because it's a discriminatory practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=689.594s">So</a>  he will give us all guidance as we move along. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=692.616s">And</a>  tomorrow I'll have a group of dates that shows when we think we're going to hit these milestones. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=698.2s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=698.942s">I</a>  think the multitude of activities that you'll see will indicate this is going to be a very public process.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=705.767s">Mr.</a>  Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=707.128s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=708.549s">I</a>  just wanted to mention, though, and I'm all for the M.A.S.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=712.773s">and</a>  taking over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=714.114s">When</a>  we voted on it last week, I put it forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=717.677s">However,</a>  I do think that there is a cost incurred and it's an appropriate cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=722.36s">I</a>  don't think that all of these services are completely free. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=725.263s">So</a>  since you said free, I just don't want to mislead anybody in that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=728.365s">Well,</a>  there'll be some cost for materials that we have to pass out and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=731.488s">But</a>  I don't we're not talking about search consultants.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=734.37s">So</a>  much based on what I've talked to her under right, but we'll get we'll get right I think he gave us the number Around 9,000 or so.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=741.992s">So</a>  that's no that's for full search done by them totally by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=745.053s">We've</a>  already put some things together Oh, so it's done quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=748.354s">So</a>  it's different We'll get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=751.175s">We'll</a>  get a number but the number is not what okay would have been for a full search if they did it from scratch Okay, I just want to be clear</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=757.786s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=758.167s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept this report and place it on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=761.031s">So</a>  moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=761.772s">So</a>  moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=762.633s">Sergiero?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=763.314s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=763.495s">Kreatz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=764.095s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=764.837s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=765.598s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=767.12s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=767.861s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=770.927s">Recommendation</a>  to begin search for foreign language director, school year 18-19.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=775.909s">So</a>  I'm telling you tonight that Rita DeCarlo, done an outstanding job for us in foreign language, has announced her retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=784.694s">It's</a>  an important area for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=785.954s">She</a>  spent over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=787.995s">And</a>  I'm telling you that I want to begin the search at this point in time for her replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=792.958s">And</a>  we will do it the usual way we do it, where we have some candidates come in, we screen them down, and then we give you a chance through <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=799.721s">to</a>  look at the top three candidates that come to you and you'll give us feedback and then we make an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=806.011s">I'd</a>  like to get going with that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=807.132s">I</a>  spoke with the superintendent and asked that our diversity and inclusion director, Neil Osborne, be a part of the preliminary interviews.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=815.693s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=816.173s">There</a>  are motion to receive in places on file so moved by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Miss Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=821.197s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=822.738s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=823.939s">Motion</a>  carried. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=824.58s">Mayor</a>  Burke, I'm sure we'll have an opportunity later on to congratulate Mrs. DiCarlo and thank her for her work, but it would I can't let the moment pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=834.167s">She's</a>  been an asset to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=836.749s">She's</a>  a great lady, and we will certainly need to celebrate her tenure with us and her retirement.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=844.324s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=846.285s">Item</a>  three, report on DESE, Leading the Nation initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=849.867s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=850.788s">So</a>  the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has launched an initiative which will celebrate Massachusetts and Massachusetts' achievements as leading the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=861.714s">Massachusetts,</a>  you know, leads the nation in typical test scores and other kinds of indicators. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=867.977s">Also,</a>  if you look at the PISA results, the international results, if Massachusetts counts itself as a nation, which we do in the rankings, we're always very close to the top, if not on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=879.181s">So,</a>  Massachusetts has decided through the department to celebrate that, and they've begun a project to provide a statewide platform for public schools in Massachusetts to celebrate their great achievements. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=892.685s">We've</a>  already begun to pull together highlights and other things that are particular to us that go beyond testing, that highlight the kinds of educational programs that we're running, that we believe make Massachusetts not only tops in those categories of testing, but actually makes Massachusetts, in places like Medford, you know, renowned for doing some <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=913.506s">programs,</a>  whether it's Global Scholars, CCSR, or other things that you have heard about over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=920.268s">I</a>  want to make you aware of it because we're going to start to ramp up very soon, and we hope that you'll all participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=928.291s">And</a>  you can see some of the things that are going to go on statewide at the Statehouse and other activities, which will give us an opportunity to highlight our school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=937.054s">We'll</a>  also use our various media. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=939.335s">To</a>  talk about the things that are going well in our community and neighboring communities are the things we collaborate with so that's just an Informational piece for you right now to let you know and welcome any ideas that you may have Thank you</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=954.842s">On</a>  this subject, first of all, I think this is great in any way that we can highlight the work that our children in our community does. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=960.727s">I</a>  think it's marvelous, especially not only through this, but in general, I think we need to publicize more and more about the great opportunities that children of Method have and the great learning experiences they show our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=977.042s">Based</a>  on that, I also wanted to ask you about the new commissioner for DESC, and they finalized the last, down to three.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=987.593s">They've</a>  actually got some interviews going on, I believe, at the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=993.756s">They'll</a>  be interviewing, they've narrowed it down to three finalists, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of New York, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of Texas, and the current superintendent of the Lawrence Public Schools have been designated as the three finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1008.483s">The</a>  board will interview them and potentially even next week will make a decision and make their recommendation to the Secretary of Education, Mr. Pizer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1019.092s">We'll</a>  have an affirmation or a veto at his discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1026.197s">Hopefully</a>  we'll have someone in place very soon in that role when that person will actually take office I don't know probably depends on their current contracts and their current obligations But I assume that in the interim Jeff Wilson will continue to be the acting commissioner until that person can actually assume the role so we expect that to happen fairly soon and I'll get you posted as soon as I know</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1051.468s">So</a>  in addition to that, any idea of what direction any of these new commissioners are going to go and what required like new.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1059.711s">They've</a>  named three finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1061.011s">I</a>  mean, you know, so if I want to speculate, you know, I might have thoughts, but I mean, it'd be inappropriate.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1066.293s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1067.351s">I</a>  just want to keep a close eye on this, and I know that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1071.872s">It's</a>  just, you know, when a new commissioner comes in, new regulations, new mandates, different things, and not only do you have to advocate for that, but our next superintendent also has to have the wherewithal to do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1084.876s">I'll</a>  keep you posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1086.996s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1087.957s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1089.237s">Motion</a>  to accept report and place on file.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1092.198s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1092.858s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1093.578s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1094.358s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1095.619s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1098.782s">Report</a>  on statewide accommodations for culturally responsive religious observances.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1104.104s">So</a>  as our community becomes culturally and religiously diverse, more so than it has been, although, you know, it's quite a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1114.568s">In</a>  1982, 4% of our school population were persons of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1118.79s">Today,</a>  it's close to 38% in an idea of what's taken place over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1125.667s">But</a>  as we become more culturally diverse and religiously diverse, it's incumbent upon us to actively ensure that our students, employees, citizens are treated with respect and dignity and that they celebrate their personal cultures and religious observances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1139.955s">So</a>  adopting appropriate, inclusive holidays, observances, protocols does not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1146.399s">There's</a>  a difference between establishing religion and just allowing people to celebrate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1151.882s">It's</a>  a distinct difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1153.883s">Rather,</a>  it protects it by recognizing the rich diversity of people's experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1160.006s">Massachusetts</a>  laws prohibit discrimination in all its forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1163.567s">The</a>  best way to ensure that discrimination does not occur is to educate our students and community through positive learning and experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1171.071s">We</a>  must always seek to move forward, to go beyond toleration to understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1177.311s">and</a>  enlightened understanding for both our diverse and common human heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1182.495s">The</a>  topic is far too involved to have a broad discussion this evening, but we need to invest more time through focus groups and additional sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1192.202s">In</a>  the interim, I've provided you with some materials in preparation for a more robust discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1197.586s">And</a>  we certainly will include people, and I've listed holidays and other things that deal with inclusive practices that have been put out by various agencies that are known for their expertise in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1210.479s">Obviously,</a>  you know, this is not only a local thing, it's a national thing, it's a statewide thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1216.224s">And</a>  for us to be in the forefront of it is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1219.408s">A</a>  lot of good things happening in our community already. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1222.19s">But</a>  the price of doing the right thing is eternal vigilance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1225.653s">You</a>  have to be diligent with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1226.894s">You</a>  can't let it slip. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1228.496s">And</a>  we have a lot of things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1230.457s">And</a>  different things will occur, and there'll be some people that perhaps don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1234.881s">But</a>  it's our job to make sure that everyone feels protected, feels safe, and that we don't have any situation where a person feels isolated because of the policies and practices of our school system.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1247.173s">Are</a>  you good? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1249.214s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1250.814s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1251.054s">Mustone,</a>  question?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1265.178s">Well,</a>  what we do is, I'll probably recognize the fact that if a person's out for those holidays and documents it, there's an excuse.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1274.562s">Right,</a>  but we don't have a resolution on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1276.744s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1277.064s">So</a>  is this something that we know? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1278.926s">No,</a>  just we've actually had a practice of doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1281.368s">Okay,</a>  so you're just showing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1283.09s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1283.45s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1284.091s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1300.782s">So</a>  every year we go through various stages of why we close school and why we keep open. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1307.126s">And</a>  some people understand it and some people agree and some people don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1311.669s">I</a>  found the last little while the people who are more aggressively emailing me are generally students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1318.153s">High</a>  school students in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1320.074s">High</a>  school students, generally around. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1323.476s">8</a>  o'clock in the morning before a storm, I'm getting things being told that their life is being put in peril and we're endangering them and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1332.961s">And</a>  I write back to them as courteously as I possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1339.46s">For</a>  the most part, people do understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1341.681s">But</a>  I want to take a little bit of opportunity in between storms, if you will, to go over a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1347.185s">So</a>  if people are listening, and we'll put it on our website again, they'll get an idea as to how we make these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1355.693s">We</a>  want to keep open if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1357.134s">There</a>  are many youngsters out there who have no one supervising them if we close the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1361.739s">There</a>  are many youngsters out there who have no one feeding them if we close the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1366.804s">On</a>  the other hand, if conditions warranted, having youngsters out in the cold and driving snow, possibly with vehicles sliding on the road, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1376.773s">Has</a>  to be balanced with our decision to open the schools Parents always have the opportunity to make a decision and if they document that they kept the youngster home Because of you know the weather and we have a reason to believe that the weather was that way we will provide an excused absence <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1397.651s">If,</a>  in fact, a youngster comes to us late on a day when conditions are such, rather than delay the whole day, which could mess up a number of things for a number of people, we won't mark them tardy to the extent that there's a reasonable arrival. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1412.764s">Now,</a>  if they come in two minutes before the closing, we might think that that's not reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1417.648s">But</a>  if they're an hour or so late, that's not a bad problem for us to recognize that as part of travel conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1425.295s">So</a>  we're entering the winter season, we're in the winter season, and from year to year, we may have more or less closings because of weather, or cold, or any other number of reasons, or for some reason that there's a building problem, or a safety problem that's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1442.649s">We</a>  will use our media to inform people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1446.492s">We</a>  use all the television media. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1448.033s">We</a>  use our own media to put things out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1450.375s">We</a>  use robocalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1452.437s">We</a>  do everything we possibly can to let people know as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1457.261s">Now,</a>  this last storm had to wait till almost 6 o'clock in the morning to take a good hard look to see what would come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1463.486s">Now,</a>  I knew in this area we weren't going to get much snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1468.61s">But</a>  a little to the west and a little to the north and the southeast, they got snow and they got bad conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1475.937s">So</a>  that was a tough one because we weren't sure what actually would happen, how it would track. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1481.648s">The</a>  one before, people ask me, why didn't you call off school on that Tuesday when it was cold? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1486.032s">If</a>  I had called off school on that Tuesday when it was cold, we would have been out Thursday and Friday anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1491.838s">We</a>  would have had one day of school that week because Monday was a holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1495.362s">So</a>  sometimes you just have to balance it a little bit and think about what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1500.167s">You</a>  also have to think about the fact that teachers and others come from distance, and if they have <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1505.572s">young</a>  people of their own that have to stay home with, they may not come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1509.977s">Or</a>  if they have the travel arrangements coming from the north or the south, it may not work for them to be in and on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1515.802s">It</a>  may not be a productive day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1518.185s">So</a>  these are all kinds of considerations if you have to pay attention to where the DPW and the contractors can clear out lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1525.405s">whether</a>  we think that the buses can actually make it up and go the various routes, whether the bus stops and the sidewalks have had an opportunity to be cleared to the greatest extent possible, although it's never perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1537.835s">It's</a>  very rarely perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1539.677s">So</a>  there's a lot of considerations that we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1542.359s">I</a>  do talk to area colleagues as we come into this kind of season, and we take a look and see what's happening, and we try to make decisions that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1553.37s">It's</a>  very important for people to understand that schools provide safety, it provides warmth, it provides nutrition to many youngsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1560.895s">And</a>  we don't take school closings lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1564.798s">But</a>  if you think that safety is an issue, if you think that we can't clear the lots, we don't think we're going to have a productive day, we will call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1571.923s">And</a>  I will try to call it as early as possible, often the night before. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1576.946s">But</a>  some days it's not, we don't know until 5 o'clock in the morning, just the way it is.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1586.006s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent recently the D ESC put out some new I don't know they didn't come up with regulations yet, but new discussion about possibilities of having students do work that had been prepared for them so that if we <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1604.867s">Um,</a>  and if the teacher, uh, had a elongated time out, there was an option other than, uh, attacking on school days at the end or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1613.349s">Um</a>  I haven't read it completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1615.989s">I</a>  was thinking that we would be talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1619.51s">I</a>  definitely think that I understand that it's complex because you need to make sure that all students can access <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1630.732s">tricky</a>  in our community where not everyone necessarily will have access to a computer, but many will have access to phones now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1640.021s">You</a>  know, we're in a different age and all the kids that come in to volunteer at the hospital, they're all doing their homework on their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1649.19s">If</a>  you're not prepared to talk about that in depth tonight, I think that we should talk about it in a curriculum subcommittee meeting and plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1656.698s">I</a>  see this not so much for the one or two day absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1659.601s">I</a>  see this in the how to figure out in the event that we have a prolonged week, say a blizzard that keeps us all home, how we're going to be proactive about this.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1671.012s">I</a>  would just tell you that there are people who, not what you're telling me, we should talk about long term, but there are people who rush to do what they call blizzard packs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1680.441s">I</a>  find that unproductive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1681.942s">We</a>  pay our teachers to teach 180 days of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1688.15s">It's</a>  not a trade-off to give kids some homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1690.133s">They're</a>  supposed to do homework anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1692.016s">And</a>  you know, the reality is that we want our teachers in front of students and they don't want to trade days. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1696.943s">Now,</a>  if we get hit like the storm of 1978, we're out a whole week or ten days or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1703.838s">We</a>  could probably have a plan in place to send materials out, especially with today's electronics. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1708.862s">But</a>  I think we should be very careful that we start trading days for short-term days off. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1715.848s">But</a>  I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1716.688s">If</a>  it's long-term, maybe we should consider it through a meeting.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1722.652s">I</a>  had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1724.413s">I</a>  did receive several calls from parents who mentioned that the day that school was open because it was very, very cold, that there was a lot of teachers absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1736.22s">And</a>  most of the kids were sent to lecture halls that were not heated, and they were freezing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1742.262s">The</a>  children were just freezing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1743.983s">This</a>  is at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1745.964s">For</a>  example, one student, one of his teachers was in, in all the other classes he went to freezing cold lecture halls that were not heated. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1754.708s">And</a>  it was just really, really, really, really cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1758.749s">students</a>  were wearing gloves and they had the little, what they're called, the heat warmers, right, they had hand warmers, passing them around, and a lot of kids got sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1771.995s">And</a>  I got a lot of calls about that, and I'm not sure if, I tried to identify what area, and I just don't know, but it was mainly that it was really, really cold in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1786.101s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1788.858s">We</a>  sent you out on that particular day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1794.684s">The</a>  high school was not badly attended that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1797.207s">It</a>  was over 80% of the people that were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1799.489s">That's</a>  pretty good since normal attendance is in the low 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1804.314s">Plus</a>  teachers, there weren't that many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1805.816s">There</a>  were people out, but there weren't that many people out comparatively to what could have been out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1810.18s">As</a>  far as the cold goes, part of the issue was the fact that it came on so suddenly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1814.488s">Certain</a>  areas of the building were still trying to adjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1818.014s">But</a>  we can work on the heating system. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1820.178s">We</a>  can work on different aspects of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1822.892s">A</a>  lot of people were in school, and for the 80% plus of the people that were in school, I think it was good to have them there, as opposed to shut it down and then everyone's out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1832.654s">We'd</a>  end up making it up, and I think it was a day to have, especially that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1837.115s">Because</a>  remember, again, if we called off school that day, we were in school potentially Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1842.176s">That</a>  was a whole week would have been gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1845.217s">So</a>  at least we got a couple days in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1846.557s">I</a>  hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1847.337s">We'll</a>  certainly work on that, and John and I will check.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1851.412s">Or</a>  check the rooms before students are sent to them.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1854.594s">That</a>  was my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1856.655s">If</a>  the lecture halls were not heated, maybe have them go to the cafeteria.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1861.618s">We'll</a>  certainly have the principals review that as a practice so that they understand that check the room out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1868.761s">Put</a>  them in the warmest place as possible.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1872.69s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1874.832s">So</a>  going back to the blizzard bags this year, actually, throughout Western Mass, there are a few schools, districts that are piloting blizzard bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1884.92s">And</a>  with today's technology, there is a lot of online learning happening, especially for, I believe, our high school students who have AP exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1894.468s">And</a>  they take that exam no matter how many blizzard days or how many snow days we take. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1899.312s">They</a>  have to have so much curriculum covered by that date, and that's the date everybody in the nation takes that test. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1905.635s">So</a>  by losing days for snow, we are behind kids like in Georgia and California that aren't losing that learning time and who actually might start school in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1917.24s">They're</a>  at an advantage of some of these exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1921.402s">So</a>  I believe the future in education is more <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1926.904s">electronic</a>  learning, more interactive learning, and I believe our teachers are savvy enough to teach those in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1934.289s">I</a>  know that we don't have a per-child device at this point, and I know that our district would love to move forward with that, but that's a very expensive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1944.735s">But</a>  if other school, other <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1947.457s">school</a>  districts are doing this in learning, and we can see how they're using it effectively for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1954.259s">In</a>  Western Mass, there are children that are in all different socioeconomic things, and they don't all have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1960.48s">We</a>  can learn from them, and maybe, I brought this up a year or two ago, actually, when we did have a bad winter, about two years ago, when we were going late, late into June, and almost into July. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1974.043s">Might</a>  have been three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1977.884s">think</a>  it is is coming towards method and we have to have an open mind with this and and start looking at it and you know seeing what options are out there and planning for our future rather than wait and see what happens so I don't agree I think that you know we should look forward to this if not for this year and the next year's coming</p>

    <p>[Sebastian Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2031.42s">So</a>  just to the AP, most of the teachers already kind of take their own initiative individually as to, you know, what <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2047.433s">what</a>  sort of assignments they can give over that snow day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2051.516s">One</a>  of my teachers just says it will always be three days ahead so that in the case of catastrophic blizzard, we'll still be remotely on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2065.088s">So</a>  mostly the teachers are doing this already. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2070.907s">But</a>  what I do worry about is kids who don't have as much accessibility to technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2088.824s">I</a>  just want to congratulate our representative from the high school, Sebastian</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2166.327s">Mayor</a>  and members of the school committee, we had an extensive discussion in the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2171.012s">And</a>  again, just to briefly summarize it, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2177.796s">The</a>  organizations that exist to support our schools are all good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2181.757s">They're</a>  working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2183.178s">They</a>  give up a lot of their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2184.479s">They</a>  generate a lot of support for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2186.439s">We're</a>  very grateful and thankful. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2189.14s">However,</a>  in order to optimize it, in order to make it more efficient and more effective overall across the city, and in order to tie it together with our own work, it's important for us to adopt some guidelines, adopt some training protocols, so that we can help these organizations do that much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2207.807s">and</a>  to dovetail much better with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2209.608s">So</a>  I've put together for you some recommendations to adopt oversight guidelines for PTOs, PTGs, and other 501c3 internal organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2220.071s">And</a>  I say internal organizations because I'm not talking about if a major corporation's 501c3 gives us money, I'm not going to ask them to audit their books. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2228.974s">But</a>  I'm talking about groups that technically work with us or use our name. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2236.818s">Michael</a>  Bloomberg gives us some money, I'm not going to ask him for his financials this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2241.422s">I</a>  guess you probably wouldn't send it to me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2243.302s">But</a>  I mean, but having said that, you know, our Cummings Foundation, things like that, they give us money and, you know, I'm appreciative that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2251.004s">But</a>  I'm talking about the internal groups that are clearly ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2255.825s">And</a>  so I've listed eight items and I would ask that you approve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2260.846s">I</a>  can read them off or you can accept them as they're written. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2264.967s">Let</a>  me know what you're.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2322.195s">MPS</a>  one, two, three, four, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2324.316s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2324.936s">I'm</a>  just curious what the registration form you imagined.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2328.417s">Which</a>  is a very simple thing, but I want to know they exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2331.397s">Who</a>  they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2332.378s">You'll</a>  see it as it comes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2334.79s">Well,</a>  it'll come down, you'll see it, okay, you'll see the things that you'll be on the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2338.516s">Who</a>  the officers are, you know, you know, and so and so forth, where they're banking, and the likes of this.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2344.384s">Just</a>  let me continue, some of it will flush out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2345.987s">No,</a>  it'll come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2346.608s">And</a>  then there could be questions at the end.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2349.303s">All</a>  registered organizations must submit bylaws, names of officers and board members, annual fundraising and expenditure plans, and a year-end financial statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2358.932s">Obviously,</a>  we want to know that every organization has some rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2362.455s">We</a>  want to know that they have a plan, that it's not just something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2366.338s">Now,</a>  if they want to modify it, they can let us know they want to modify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2368.88s">I'm</a>  not running around trying to second guess every move, but they should have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2374.405s">And</a>  another reason for that is the fact that, you know, if everyone hits the same bank and everyone hits the same business over and over again, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2383.28s">We're</a>  working on our community pretty hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2386.082s">And</a>  also, when the school department goes to them for various things, they might say, well, you already gave. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2390.566s">So</a>  it's important for us to know who is being asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for services, and whether or not it interferes with something that might be a larger project that the school department might be able to do for the greater benefit of all.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2407.06s">If</a>  I could just interject, I just asked you guys not to, but you don't know who you're going to go to at the beginning of your year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2414.511s">That</a>  happens over the course of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2416.795s">No,</a>  you generally. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2418.573s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2420.274s">You</a>  hit everybody, sometimes you focus on one, but it's dependent upon what you're trying to accomplish.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2425.577s">You</a>  can modify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2426.717s">You</a>  can make changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2429.159s">It's</a>  a projection. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2430.379s">It's</a>  like our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2431.48s">We</a>  project certain things and changes happen during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2434.121s">It's</a>  just that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2435.282s">You</a>  can just send in a note and say we did something different or we added something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2439.184s">Maybe</a>  it doesn't have to be that tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2441.627s">Let</a>  me keep going and then we can hit it all, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2443.809s">There's</a>  some of these things that sort of intersect with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2446.772s">Three,</a>  bylaws must clearly identify how a person becomes eligible for membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2452.302s">and</a>  how a person becomes a voting member. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2455.064s">Distinct</a>  difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2456.064s">I</a>  mean, a person comes to a meeting, you know, they may be a member, but if they've been to one meeting in three years, do they have the right to make decisions for a group of people that have been, you know, working on it for an extended period of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2469.111s">That's</a>  a decision people can make. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2474.128s">Bylaws</a>  must identify what is a voting quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2477.129s">Some</a>  of them, three people in the room could be a voting quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2480.73s">Is</a>  that a voting quorum? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2481.75s">Do</a>  you have to have so many members of the executive board to be a voting quorum? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2484.931s">Do</a>  you have to have so many members of the established membership to make a major decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2490.612s">Bylaws</a>  must provide detailed information how, when elections for officers and board members will be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2497.372s">When</a>  is it going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2499.013s">What</a>  is the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2500.394s">What</a>  is the distribution of information so that people know that an election is coming? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2506.325s">Expenditures</a>  or funds must be done in coordination with the principal to ensure that supported programs, activities, and materials are consistent with the school's program and do not distract from the main mission of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2517.549s">Can't</a>  have an organization decide to buy a new curriculum that is counter indicative to the ones the school system has adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2524.371s">We</a>  can't have people planning trips that get in the way of testing or planning trips that come just as the testing season's about to begin or planning trips that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2534.835s">are</a>  not tied to the curriculum in an important way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2539.117s">Maybe</a>  once in a while, but not all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2540.838s">Remember,</a>  we only have 180 days of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2543.259s">We</a>  want to make sure all of them are used properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2549.023s">The</a>  public schools, through the superintendents, will offer training to each entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2552.665s">We</a>  want to make sure they all know what forms they have to fill out, if they're raising funds, if they're a non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2559.107s">We</a>  want them to understand regulations and ordinances, what they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2563.289s">If</a>  you pay somebody money, and you pay them a certain amount of money, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2568.692s">You've</a>  got to give them a form, or technically you're paying them under the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2572.893s">That's</a>  not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2574.699s">If</a>  you're giving people money as reimbursement, reimbursement for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2578.924s">What's</a>  your, what are you requiring? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2580.867s">I</a>  mean, tonight you asked, you know, about slips and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2583.851s">It's</a>  all heavily documented when it comes through the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2587.115s">Are</a>  we documenting these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2589.398s">Give</a>  us an idea of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2594.268s">And</a>  if a person doesn't participate and doesn't become these things, then we maybe decertify them and say, look, we're not going to register you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2602.314s">You're</a>  not going to be an allowable organization because we can't track what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2606.498s">And</a>  then an annual report should be made to the school committee about all the organizations that exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2612.102s">And</a>  the general thing, it may not be every expenditure they have, but it certainly should give you an idea of what started the year, what ended the year, and the main activities and the like that they had, and if they had an election, did they change officers, if there were special circumstances, was it reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2628.937s">And</a>  I think if we do something like that, we'll have helped these organizations be that much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2633.259s">And</a>  we'll help ourselves as we try to coordinate their activities with our initiatives as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2640.403s">So</a>  I guess the floor is open for discussion.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2643.385s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2645.166s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2646.727s">Thank</a>  you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2647.788s">I</a>  think it's a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2652.459s">So</a>  in the title of it, recommendation to adopt oversight guidelines for PTO and PTG, I would like to have friends of as well listed, not as under other, but directly PTO, PTG, and friends of groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2671.896s">Because</a>  I just want them to realize that they are included in part of this and the oversight will <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2680.723s">Also</a>  include them and I would like to add a number nine Register any event that uses our building through community schools So we can track how much our schools are being used in which schools are being used the most so that way we can allocate funding for maintenance and <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2698.25s">and</a>  repairs and custodial services and extra paper towels and toilet paper to those buildings and, you know, extra cleaning if that's necessary, and to track where in the city we're using a lot, like, and maybe we need to move it to another side of town so other people in the community can go that don't drive or have an opportunity to attend different things, especially if it's a big event. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2727.653s">Okay,</a>  so those are the type of things I'd like to see added.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2730.895s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Russo Yes, thank you So the response I got from some PTO members when they saw this was Interesting It was sort of like well, that's that I'm done That was pretty much. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2749.546s">I'm</a>  sorry to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2750.847s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2751.247s">I'm</a>  done. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2751.708s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2752.69s">I'm</a>  not doing the PTO anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2756.755s">And,</a>  you know, most of this seems to be solving a problem that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2760.759s">The</a>  financial aspects about having some kind of a reporting on the finances makes perfect sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2768.047s">But,</a>  you know, the voting stuff, you know, I know of a PTO that, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2774.472s">Nobody</a>  can remember having an election because there has never been enough people to show up to fill all the spots in the six years that they've been participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2784.636s">So</a>  it's fine to say we should have elections, but when you have three people, four people, or five people filling the six spots year after year, adding one more thing where they have to post that there's going to be an election, print it, get it distributed to all of the families, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2802.117s">have</a>  an actual meeting so that the three or four of them can come together with their cookies and say, I guess it's us again, but don't forget to take a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2811.043s">And</a>  that kind of effort doesn't seem like that big a deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2816.166s">But</a>  when you add things like the training, so if it's going to be the same treasurer for seven years in a row, are we going to make them go to training seven years in a row, or we decertify that organization? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2833.398s">We</a>  can certainly do that, but we're going to have a lot of trouble finding any treasurers.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2842.438s">making</a>  it available?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2843.318s">I</a>  think we're looking at people who don't have experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2846.959s">Obviously,</a>  if a person's been doing it and doing it successfully, you don't have to go to things. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2852.16s">We</a>  don't have our teachers take courses that they've already passed and know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2856.521s">Sometimes</a>  there's a refresher. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2858.121s">Sometimes</a>  there's new rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2860.122s">Sometimes</a>  there's new forms, you know, that need to be filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2864.003s">Sometimes</a>  there's changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2865.143s">That</a>  may work. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2867.203s">As</a>  far as the governance structure goes in elections, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2871.918s">If</a>  there's no one running, you just simply certify it through the principal's office that we only have so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2877.0s">But</a>  you've gotta let people know because, I mean, one of the complaints that we heard, rightly or wrongly, I'm not taking sides on this thing, was that people didn't know how you become an officer, how you participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2888.886s">And</a>  theoretically, under the school council, you're supposed to have that election every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2893.248s">It's</a>  required by the statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2896.629s">Now,</a>  I know it doesn't always happen 100%, but it should. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2900.491s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2901.031s">Or</a>  at least there should be some declaration that the only people that applied for these offices or want to do it are a handful of people, but after a reasonable attempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2911.778s">I</a>  think we've got to do that, or else people say, well, I'm not involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2916.381s">I</a>  don't get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2917.401s">They</a>  don't consult me. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2918.982s">I</a>  mean, what's part of the discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2920.362s">Are</a>  people consulted? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2921.363s">Do</a>  they have a chance to participate? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2922.963s">I</a>  mean, one of the issues I think you raised during the campaign was community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2928.544s">Well,</a>  does the PTO engage the community that it represents? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2932.605s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2934.465s">I</a>  think there's a balance there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2935.445s">I</a>  don't think we have to make it into a very rigorous process, but I do think there should be some notification that there are officers available, there are board positions available. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2946.848s">Would</a>  you like to participate? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2949.428s">Just</a>  a thought.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2949.909s">Can</a>  I continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2952.511s">I</a>  do think the sort of slightly off that topic, the issue of other 501c3s, I mean, I think about like the Medford Education Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2962.118s">I</a>  mean, they are about Medford public schools.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2966.761s">There's</a>  like Friends of Baseball, Friends of Rowing, Friends of that do a lot.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2970.944s">But</a>  we don't want the MEF to have to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2974.007s">Or</a>  do we? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2974.667s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2977.293s">We</a>  do okay, so that kind of gets back to my very first kind of question I didn't ask yet was so The PTOs were not consulted for this Correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2991.378s">I</a>  mean, no, we haven't done a wide sweep on that So, I mean, I just feel like that this should at least That they should be part of the conversation on What would work?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3003.4s">make</a>  a motion this be tabled pending or send to a subcommittee if you I'd like to make a motion this be sent to the is it the rules subcommittee I'm on support services so I would certainly be happy to send it there that's okay</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3027.145s">Your</a>  motion, I guess I'd like to make a motion to send this to support services to create forms that are appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3034.568s">Subcommittee,</a>  let's you know, let's let's understand what these subcommittees are supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3038.329s">Support</a>  services deals primarily with services that support the educational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3042.71s">This</a>  is more rules of this is more of the rules of the operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3048.188s">You</a>  know, I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to clarify it for you because I mean, if you want to keep some integrity to your subcommittee assignments, you can do what you want.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3056.454s">I</a>  mean, but I'll I'd like to make a motion to send this to the rules subcommittee on the motion as seconded by Miss Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3063.719s">Did</a>  you also wish to comment prior to calling? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3065.58s">I</a>  did miss Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3067.561s">So</a>  I have first the first thing I wanted to suggest or say that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3073.105s">It</a>  also included all of those booster clubs or Athletic support groups as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3081.032s">I</a>  Think September 1st is a bad day to pick Because it's you know often Labor Day weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3087.157s">I</a>  think it would make more sense to change it to September 15th or September 30th Okay <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3095.121s">I</a>  understand that you're in financial support, saying the relative wealth of where they stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3101.868s">However,</a>  I get really uncomfortable, and you and I have had this discussion many times, when you start wanting to sound like Mr. Superintendent, micromanage who's going to go to what bank and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3113.22s">Can't</a>  do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3114.681s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3115.141s">We</a>  just can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3116.202s">We</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3117.263s">And</a>  if you were seeing all of them and you wanted to draw people together and have a discussion, that's be one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3122.726s">But</a>  I get really uncomfortable with the thought that you're going to tell the Medford Educational Foundation, or of which I, you know, belong, or a McGlynn PTO member or Columbus whatever, that, well, they can't have that fundraiser because somebody else is doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3138.777s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there and say, it makes me real nervous when you went down that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3144.922s">And</a>  I don't think it's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3147.364s">I</a>  think when you get to number six, expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal slash administration or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3155.01s">Because</a>  for instance, the Medford Educational Foundation, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3159.846s">We</a>  have a principal sign-off sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3161.927s">However,</a>  we've been known to work closely with administration to make sure that we are, in fact, not funding a program that would not be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3172.835s">And</a>  when I spoke up before, I do believe that the Educational Foundation would, in fact, benefit from something. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3179.44s">Because</a>  we are a 501c3, and I think everybody who is a 501c this, you are required to have bylaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3186.746s">Now,</a>  how formally you play them out is another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3189.088s">But</a>  somewhere in your organization, at some point, you have had bylaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3192.631s">Because</a>  if you're a 501c3, you needed to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3196.134s">You</a>  needed to specify how the offices worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3201.738s">So</a>  even though, Paul, I understand what you're saying and your concerns, some of that actually is called for by the nonprofit status. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3212.54s">any</a>  way otherwise than that I think that we can send it to send it off but those were some of my initial concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3218.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3218.657s">Mister</a>  zero.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3221.278s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent, for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3223.699s">I'd</a>  like to, seeing that we're sending this to subcommittee, I just want to add another item that we draft material that can be used to help these groups, maybe like a sample bylaws could be set up, not that anyone has to follow, but just like a template. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3236.904s">We</a>  have a recommended set of best practices that we could put to maybe a binder that we could put together for different PTOs just to help them have the best process possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3248.079s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just making we're adding items on the list, right?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3251.001s">We're</a>  at nines If I could just from the chair item two, I think it goes back to your question All registered organizations must submit bylaws names of officers and board members and then it says the annual fundraising Expenditure plans if that could just be an annual budget And at the end <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3272.987s">in</a>  a year-end financial statement, including the Form 990 in state filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3277.732s">You</a>  have to do it to be a 990, to be a 501c3, you have to file with the state, and you also have to file with the IRS. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3284.378s">So</a>  why not make it part of the package at the end of the year, they submit it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3287.742s">And</a>  then we have, everything's copacetic as far as filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3293.126s">So</a>  if we could send this document as amended to the Rules Committee, which Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3297.869s">Kreatz</a>  will chair this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3300.37s">There's</a>  a second on the floor by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3301.811s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3302.612s">Motion</a>  by Mr. Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3304.213s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3305.153s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3306.054s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3307.415s">Motion</a>  has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3308.215s">Do</a>  you want me to list the amendments that were just now? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3312.658s">You're</a>  all good? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3313.178s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3443.536s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3446.597s">I</a>  am an active member of my PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3449.359s">No</a>  one personally approached me, but I can tell you that my PTO sends constant flyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3455.581s">They</a>  have events almost monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3457.822s">Every</a>  PTO does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3459.243s">We</a>  have Facebook pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3461.204s">Some</a>  of us have Twitter accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3463.585s">We</a>  make every effort to have people join. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3466.086s">I'm</a>  not a board member on a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3467.907s">I</a>  went to a PTO meeting and I <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3470.708s">raised</a>  my hand and volunteered, I've added programming to my PTO on a voluntary basis and people do the best that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3479.518s">I've</a>  gone to meetings where there's been three people and I know for a fact that a flyer's gone out, that a flyer's been on the window at the school, that we've posted it on our Facebook page and there's three people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3491.271s">And</a>  that's not because we're not engaging our community, because we have signs up at every event that things are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3497.014s">We</a>  send out emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3498.795s">There's</a>  only so much that you can do, but you have to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3502.176s">When</a>  I had my first child, I worked full time and I did not volunteer at the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3506.218s">I</a>  did not have the time or the bandwidth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3508.279s">I'm</a>  lucky now that I can and I do, and I appreciate that a lot of people are not able to do that, and I don't think that we should be disparaging people on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3517.689s">People</a>  that do have the time to volunteer, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3519.832s">People</a>  that don't, you know, that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3522.535s">We're</a>  here for all of the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3524.136s">We</a>  do fundraising for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3527.079s">all</a>  the schools and we're not singling out and go oh Johnny's mother didn't help so he doesn't get a t-shirt on field day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3532.761s">So</a>  I think we need to remember that and I hope that some of your recommendations will include ways to help some of our PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3539.383s">Especially</a>  those of us that are in high needs districts, high needs areas where our parents do work two jobs or our parents don't speak English. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3548.086s">are</a>  they have special needs children they have to attend to or they have three or four children and packing those kids up and coming to a PTO meeting is impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3556.036s">We</a>  even tried to do our meetings on Facebook live and it didn't it didn't increase our attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3562.243s">So</a>  we're all doing the best that we can and I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3565.787s">The</a>  district is able to help us because from year to year, some PTOs find that it's really hard for them to afford that $8,000 to $10,000 that we need for the buses or that field day event or that in-school enrichment and we do the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3579.513s">Sometimes</a>  you run a fundraiser and you think you're going to make $1,000 and you make $500 and you have to add another fundraiser on the fly because you're not going to cover those bills at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3589.578s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3593.026s">It</a>  would be a shame if this conversation ended with any thought that we're not appreciative of the extraordinarily hard work of our PTOs, PTGs, booster clubs, and any other organization that gives up their time and effort to raise money for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3612.553s">I</a>  know from experience, I know from my time on the school committee and before that how hard people work and how often it is a very small group of people in the end who really bust their butt night after night making sure that all of the money is raised, that the kids get the opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3633.894s">And</a>  so I just think that it's really important <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3636.456s">You</a>  know, many of you won't remember this, and the only two maybe in the room right now might be the superintendent and Diane Caldwell, remember that before I was on the school committee, one of the things that I did was an event called It's Your Night to Shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3652.321s">And</a>  that was a thank you to all the volunteers, all the PTO members who busted their butts, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3658.543s">Because</a>  way back then, as someone who was just beginning in all of this, it was so clear to me that there were a few people who just kept things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3667.707s">And</a>  they were all, blessedly, that it's always somehow worked out that we have a group of parents at each and every school who will take this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3675.471s">And</a>  sometimes it's because the void, they see that no one else is there and they step in and they make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3680.653s">So</a>  within all of this in this discussion, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3684.095s">By</a>  putting in something like this, ultimately the desire is not to just oversee and enforce and say you have to do one more thing, but to be helpful, to be positive, and always to say thank you so much for the work that you do.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3700.823s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3702.564s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3704.106s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3705.747s">So</a>  on our agenda on the back page, there's a listing of reports that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3711.674s">And</a>  if you look under requested reports, the first one was a report on PTOs, including how they're helping the community and what they are working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3719.522s">And</a>  that was requested last April, April of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3723.786s">Now,</a>  it needs to be amended because when we spoke at our committee meeting recently, the superintendent said that he is planning to have all the PTOs come before the school committee between the month of April and May. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3737.216s">So</a>  I would like that amended, that line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3743.12s">And</a>  the goal that I had when I requested that last April was to bring the pre-TOs forward to celebrate the things that they have done for the school district and to bring them forward so the rest of the community knows, like, hey, at the McGlynn, this is some of the things they've run, and they've run it for 10 years, and the kids still love it, or, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3765.623s">you</a>  know, second graders get to go to the science museum and the PTOs throughout the district have paid for the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3772.725s">Let's</a>  celebrate some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3774.225s">And</a>  that was my goal back in April because I just felt like less people have less time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3780.907s">And</a>  they're so involved with trying to get by and things are a little harder for families now or they're busier. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3787.708s">And</a>  it was just a way to bring them in to celebrate the work and the time and the effort they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3794.19s">My</a>  history, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3795.511s">has</a>  been started as a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3800.051s">president,</a>  co-president with Ian Ricucci, who is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3803.372s">And</a>  I had a big mouth then, and I wasn't ready to be quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3806.793s">So</a>  that's why I ran for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3808.994s">And</a>  I'm here in front of you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3810.694s">And</a>  didn't run until my youngest graduated, because I felt like I had a big voice as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3815.676s">And</a>  you all have a big voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3817.036s">Everybody</a>  has a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3818.377s">Show</a>  up at these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3819.917s">Say</a>  what you need to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3821.118s">Ask</a>  us for what you need and what your children need. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3823.658s">That's</a>  what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3825.199s">And</a>  we need to celebrate the people who have volunteered <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3828.72s">done</a>  so much already and before we ask them to do more, we need to show them that we do care and we are here to help support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3837.005s">So</a>  I just want to applaud the people here tonight and encourage more people in the community to come forward and ask the superintendent to amend that piece so that way we do have the PTOs come in April and May of 2018 and we should invite the press. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3855.535s">So</a>  that they get a list of all the wonderful things that have been happening, not only this year, but years past as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3860.802s">I</a>  think I think it's time to celebrate some of the happenings in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3864.868s">So</a>  that's my request, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3866.931s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3867.332s">Thank</a>  you, Miss Wright.</p>

    <p>[HoymGn4EeMU_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3873.927s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson and School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3877.169s">I'm</a>  Jane Wright, treasurer of the McGlynn Elementary PTG. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3880.89s">I</a>  was not planning on speaking tonight after last Tuesday's school committee meeting when Superintendent Belson reported there was no malfeasance found in the finances of the McGlynn Elementary PTG. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3891.856s">However,</a>  Mr. Ruggiero continues to perpetrate lies and misunderstandings on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3897.929s">I</a>  had anticipated after last week's meetings that there would be an effort to move forward with Superintendent Belson's recommendations, as reported out in his findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3906.914s">I</a>  look forward to that effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3908.775s">However,</a>  it seems that Mr. Ruggiero feels compelled to continue waging an assault on my integrity and the PTG, notwithstanding the superintendent's findings and recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3919.712s">Last</a>  Friday night, Mr. Egeri wrote on Facebook how going to the press was, I quote, a hard choice on how to alert the public to lost donation money. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3929.901s">There</a>  was no lost donation money, for if there was, it would have been reported in the investigation into the finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3937.862s">At</a>  last Tuesday's meeting, I refuted Mr. Ruggiero's numerous quotes on how he tried to contact me many times over the course of a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3945.206s">I</a>  produced my cell phone records from October 1st, 2017 until January 13th, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3948.168s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero called me once on December 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3956.39s">Still,</a>  as he posted last Friday night, he is continuing to claim he made numerous calls, now texts, and Facebook messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3964.939s">I</a>  received one call from Mr. Agero on December 14th, and no other attempts were made by Mr. Agero to contact me or anyone else on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3976.671s">On</a>  the phone, Mr. Agero did not speak with me in a strong way, nor did he say that he had financial concerns that he needed to talk with me about regarding the PTG, as he asserted in one of his recent posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3989.897s">As</a>  I said at last week's meeting, if I knew people were questioning the finances, I would have met with them that night, and I would not be here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3998.963s">At</a>  no time prior to December 22nd, when one mother asked me about the financials, was I approached to discuss the PTG finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4008.973s">And</a>  yet, the article came out a few days later, alleging, as Mr. Gero still claims, I was asked multiple times about financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4017.561s">This</a>  is simply not true, and I have made my phone records readily available to substantiate the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4024.903s">I</a>  rescheduled one meeting on December 28th, not a whole host of meetings, as was written by Mr. Agiro. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4033.07s">Even</a>  though I rescheduled that meeting, I sent that information to be shared via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4039.796s">Mr.</a>  Agiro continues to post about the bylaws the parent asked for multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4044.826s">Yes,</a>  they should have been made available sooner and I take full responsibility for that error. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4051.693s">In</a>  fact, I apologized to the parents in our December meeting before the transcript article was published. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4058.366s">Further,</a>  the current executive board had began discussing how the bylaws need to be amended, even before we heard the Superintendent Belson's suggestion in his report. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4068.235s">We</a>  look forward to incorporating Superintendent's recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4071.998s">Bylaws</a>  were not mentioned in my speech when I addressed Mr. Giro's accusations and defamations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4080.058s">Mr.</a>  Jarrell claims that the PTG buried the fine for late taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4084.443s">However,</a>  the executive board at the time did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4087.527s">It</a>  was reported immediately to the principal of the school who is no longer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4092.213s">We</a>  paid the penalties and have been in compliance ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4096.598s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero is now claiming on social media that all of this went down before he was sworn in, and he therefore was acting as an ordinary citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4105.5s">If</a>  that were true, he would not have introduced himself to me on the phone as Mr. Ruggiero, Medford School Committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4112.822s">The</a>  transcript article on December 26, 2017 was titled, New School Committee Member, Parents Raise Questions About McGlynn Elementary PTG. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4125.215s">The</a>  transcript editors wrote on Friday, if newspapers fail to report on statements and actions made by our elected officials, whom we vote for, and whose salaries we pay in taxes, everybody loses. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4137.847s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero was identifying himself and acting as a school committee member despite not being sworn in yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4145.395s">Part</a>  of the role of the school committee for the Medford Public Schools is to vote to set the policy, set the budget, and hire the superintendent and evaluate his or her work for the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4158.7s">Whether</a>  he was acting as a school committee member or member elect is utterly inappropriate for him to publicly berate and single out a member of the PTG, especially when based on unfounded accusations and misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4172.202s">Even</a>  after the investigation's findings of no malfeasance, he continues to perpetuate the lies and misinformation on social media as recently as Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4181.989s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero seems to want it both ways, running for cover as an ordinary citizen when criticized for his handling of the situation and then asserting as a public official he has a duty to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4194.519s">As</a>  a public official, doesn't he have an obligation to set all the community <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4200.52s">Doesn't</a>  he have an obligation to all in the community to set an example and exercise sound judgment and ensure that which he elevates as a public concern is carefully reviewed before making unfounded accusations and personally attacking individuals in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4216.141s">I</a>  would like to also make you aware of a parent among Mr. Ruggiero's group who sent a threatening and harassing email to our president last Friday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4224.884s">I</a>  have copies of that email here for you to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4228.145s">In</a>  this email, despite the discussions and recommendations last week, this father continues to berate the PTG and threatens to call the school department officials and the Medford transcript if his demands are not met and on his timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4243.991s">I</a>  think that we are in agreement there are improvements that can and should be made and I and the rest of the PTG board look forward to making those improvements with the administration in updating the bylaws and reporting procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4257.997s">However,</a>  in the meantime, it is concerning that we continue to be threatened and harassed by parents who are unwilling to accept that there was no malfeasance. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4266.755s">Again,</a>  we are all volunteers doing the best that we can to plan, facilitate, and staff events and fundraisers for all of the students in our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4276.36s">Being</a>  threatened and harassed is unacceptable and it is counterproductive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4281.503s">I</a>  thank you for your time again this evening and hope that this matter can move on to more productive discourse and results and benefits for all stakeholders, most especially our students and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4293.129s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4293.569s">Wright.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4293.79s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4476.282s">Would</a>  you have preferred that I stand mute? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4481.52s">If</a>  I find evidence that our schools have not used money properly, I'm going to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4487.91s">I</a>  serve at your pleasure, but I forever stand as a fierce defender of the values I cherish and the city I love. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4494.876s">The</a>  treasurer and the president of McGlynn PTG seem convinced that they run a tight ship. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4500.721s">God</a>  bless them. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4501.782s">They</a>  have worked very hard, and I appreciate all the time they have invested. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4506.506s">But</a>  here are the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4508.688s">The</a>  laws of their group demand they present financial information when asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4512.872s">They</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4514.333s">The</a>  laws of their group demand they keep their rules and their ledgers handy at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4521.099s">Didn't</a>  happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4522.692s">Their</a>  rules require a budget at the beginning of the year, but it wasn't provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4527.417s">Mothers</a>  felt belittled and humiliated. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4530.3s">How</a>  dare parents ask questions, eh? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4533.374s">I</a>  have no doubt that every single parent at the McGlynn PTG loved the children and want to help our city grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4541.657s">Nonetheless,</a>  you can't play fast and loose with the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4546.378s">You</a>  would think that after stumbling into such a chasm with the IRS, people would be a little more cautious. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4551.98s">Those</a>  are the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4554.681s">But</a>  before you go, I think it's really time we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4558.922s">There's</a>  a great proposal on the table here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4562.243s">Parents</a>  will have financial information now when they're asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4565.064s">Our</a>  school committees will work to help parent groups become as effective as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4570.186s">Training</a>  will be provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4572.146s">Never</a>  again will thousands of dollars be lost into a hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4577.028s">I</a>  think this is an exciting time and I think we have a great proposal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4580.807s">And</a>  I hope everyone on both sides of this issue look forward to moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4586.671s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[RCBmbH4HOvE_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4709.127s">Hi,</a>  my name is Bailey Shindell. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4710.769s">I</a>  live at 46 Washington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4713.011s">I</a>  am a parent of a kindergartener at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4716.994s">At</a>  the beginning of this year, I started going to PTG meetings and was very excited about being part of the McGlynn PTG. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4726.783s">I've</a>  done lots of kind of community building work in the past in lots of different <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4734.19s">forums,</a>  and so I was excited to, you know, share my skills with the PTG. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4740.973s">I</a>  have, I'm just, I felt the need to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4744.434s">I</a>  don't have anything prepared because I feel like this situation has been, I've gathered with other parents <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4754.198s">to</a>  work with McGlynn PFTG and I feel like our position has been misrepresented in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4763.301s">I</a>  feel like we've been looked at as parents who came in and just tried to take over everything without listening or trying to get an idea of what the process was for participating in this organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4777.965s">I've</a>  spent the last couple days, it's not finished yet, but putting together a timeline of how we engaged or attempted to engage with this organization that's well documented through emails and summaries of meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4793.109s">I</a>  mean, I basically have a practice from my experience of writing summaries after every meeting that I attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4802.771s">So</a>  I just want to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4805.412s">You</a>  know, we have documentation to show that each step of the way we approach and continue to approach the leadership of the McGlynn PTG and ask them to work with us and we are still being met with contention even to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4823.26s">Um,</a>  there was, I personally felt, I mean, the most recent thing was these minutes that happened, um, from the last meeting were posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4834.071s">Um,</a>  there wasn't any process or approval of the minutes before they were posted in a public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4838.976s">The</a>  minutes were not representative of the meeting that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4845.402s">specifically</a>  like I had asked for certain information from the McGlynn leadership and that was not recorded in the minutes in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4857.77s">I</a>  then have emailed the McGlynn leadership, again, in each email really trying to say how much I just really, still to this day, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4868.437s">really</a>  want to work with this group and know by whatever process put in front of me to make changes and to provide things for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4884.107s">has</a>  not been responded to or my concerns have not been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4889.029s">Throughout</a>  this entire process, I've received conflicting information on how things are done, which then that information, after finally receiving the bylaws, was conflicted with the bylaws themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4904.215s">These</a>  are very concerning things that were happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4908.217s">I</a>  also want to say that while, I mean, when we started looking at the finances, it was only because we wanted to get an understanding of what the money was being spent on, mostly so we could be like, yes, this is what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4927.924s">told,</a>  you know, we do stuff, but we haven't, we've asked several times, like, what's, get a list of what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4934.866s">And</a>  we do stuff, the finances and the minutes from the meetings that I've requested several times would help me put together a better picture so I could brag about what they do when I try to promote the Glen PTG. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4947.15s">I</a>  don't think it's unreasonable for me to want to have a better understanding of the organization that I want to get involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4954.092s">And</a>  I think right now I'm speaking for myself, but I think the sentiment I'm putting forth is representative of other parents that I've been working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4965.041s">We</a>  want to grow this organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4967.243s">We</a>  want to do great things for the McGlynn students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4970.606s">And</a>  we want to do that by working with these women. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4975.627s">We</a>  need to be broadened. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4978.248s">I</a>  guess that's all I... I also actually want to speak to the $6,000 mistake, and I absolutely believe it was a mistake, but I'm really concerned about the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4991.653s">That</a>  money had to be paid out of McGlynn PTG funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4995.497s">And</a>  McGlynn PTG funds are raised from the parents of our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=4999.961s">The</a>  parents that we've already talked about not necessarily have a lot of finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5004.845s">So</a>  I do think it's important that if we as a group are asking parents for money, that we're telling them where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5013.552s">And</a>  I don't think any of the parents that bought pies in 2014, 15, whenever that fund was actually paid, like were aware that $6,000 of their money was going to pay for this mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5026.837s">And</a>  I think that's a fair thing for them to have knowledge of. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5032.059s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5033.219s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5155.238s">And</a>  we were told, you don't have voting rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5159.46s">You</a>  have the right to vote us into the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5162.301s">We</a>  will listen to what you have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5166.482s">But</a>  you don't have voting rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5172.845s">This</a>  is America. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5173.785s">It's</a>  a democracy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5175.086s">Like,</a>  we should have some sort of voting rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5180.595s">Bailey</a>  asked after that meeting, and we got the bylaws, it clearly says, at least by our interpretation, that we should have some voting rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5188.004s">It</a>  said there should be a budget, anything outside of that budget, we get to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5193.71s">And</a>  that's what we have been fighting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5198.803s">You</a>  guys don't know me, but my family, my mom was a commission human rights relation person for 25 years for the state of Delaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5208.071s">And</a>  my dad is a retired police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5211.134s">I</a>  grew up in a family of civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5213.677s">And</a>  I've never stood up and talked. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5215.538s">It's</a>  not who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5217.56s">But</a>  I find myself angry and standing up and unable to sit down because I feel like this is not what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5226.865s">It's</a>  about doing this for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5228.946s">And</a>  if, when was the last time you were at a meeting and the two people beside you said, I will get in and help. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5235.149s">I</a>  will build you a website. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5236.409s">I</a>  will throw some fundraisers and pay for them out of my pocket and grow this community that is the McGlynn and we really can be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5244.433s">And</a>  you look around at Medford, and we all chose to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5247.496s">We</a>  chose to be parents at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5249.878s">We</a>  all, if you talk to us, we all looked at private schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5252.62s">We</a>  all talked about, well, maybe we'll petition to go to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5256.283s">We</a>  live closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5257.123s">And</a>  we chose the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5259.726s">So</a>  I don't think I should be maligned because <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5263.545s">I</a>  need to buck up under this is the way it's always been and this is the way it will always be. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5269.99s">Medford</a>  as a city is energetic and it's changing and it's a really exciting place to live and I think looking at these PTG laws and moving forward with them, it would be a really, you know, I'm just excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5283.782s">I</a>  feel like it's a good starting place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5286.744s">My</a>  only request is maybe you can also <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5292.355s">You</a>  could also encourage a mission statement for these groups that does not strictly say it is a top-down policy, but that it is also a bottom-up listening structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5304.739s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5305.34s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5307.28s">We're</a>  going to move this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5308.281s">We</a>  have a lot on our agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5310.041s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here and giving your side. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5314.403s">And</a>  we certainly will move forward with the committee on rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5316.344s">The</a>  subcommittee will be looking at the policy and procedures going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5320.754s">next</a>  item up is item seven negotiations and legal matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5323.495s">I</a>  asked someone to move suspension of the rules to move to the end of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5326.755s">Mr.</a>  Russo, seconded by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5329.136s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5330.876s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5332.017s">Negotiations</a>  will be at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5334.257s">Old</a>  business recommendation to adopt USDA revised required school lunch charge policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5340.379s">As</a>  you know, in our committee of the whole last week, we asked Miss Patterson to make a few more adjustments to the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5347.04s">Tonight</a>  we have with us the final version, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5352.202s">I</a>  believe we made the adjustments you asked for the amounts of thresholds in the area, so I'd ask that you approve it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5460.257s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5461.117s">Um</a>  on this, I reviewed it and I didn't see a sign off from the school nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5466.341s">So</a>  it says the email is attached and the email that it's attached only says please provide me with the list of students so that way I can let you know if there's any medical. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5479.831s">There</a>  was no official write off.</p>

    <p>[OQKxfahlemU_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5484.317s">So</a>  if you look, yeah, I don't have the list of students yet because I wasn't able to finalize the list until I got approval of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5498.871s">Yeah,</a>  this is my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5501.475s">With</a>  the new paperwork that we just required everybody to fill out is you need a list of students going before you send it out for permission slips so you don't have the list until it's approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5513.892s">So</a>  it's like a catch 22.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5515.814s">No,</a>  aren't we supposed to approve the trip before they can go to their students too?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5520.338s">Right,</a>  but the way that the form does, it asks for the list of students when they're filling out the form so that way they can get the approval from the nurse and I think other schools are having this issue as well that I've been told about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5534.468s">So</a>  like you can't, the nurse can't tell you how many children or if any children have any medical issues that a nurse may be necessary or medications may be necessary or delegation of medications may be necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5547.001s">So</a>  we might need to re-look at this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5550.064s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5551.285s">So</a>  we need to change this, and I'd like you to look at that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5555.866s">I</a>  know we've talked about it on the phone this week, Superintendent Belson, and so if you, I'm noticing this problem here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5565.029s">So</a>  we need to get initial approvals going, and then provide a list, and then the nurse thing, which is difficult, because then you gotta estimate what the cost of the trip is with or without a nurse.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5579.236s">So</a>  we want to make it less bureaucratic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5583.8s">I</a>  mean, let's keep it simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5584.941s">Let's</a>  keep it simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5586.302s">Obviously,</a>  if there's a situation that requires an additional cost, we'll bring it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5591.146s">But</a>  if there's no such cost, let's not make people come back and forth five times. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5595.209s">I</a>  mean, the goal of this was to be inclusive and to provide appropriate care. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5600.334s">If</a>  it turns out that we have a situation, we'll bring it back.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5603.333s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5604.053s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5604.794s">But</a>  just make sure that all policy, everybody approving this and all teachers filling this out know that like it says here that you have to have a nurse's signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5617.3s">And</a>  if someone's trying to fill this out correctly, the teacher is going to say, I can't get the signature or curriculum director signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5625.744s">And</a>  it only says one is what if it's <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5629.293s">You</a>  know, it's getting tricky for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5631.414s">I'm</a>  getting phone calls about it, so it's getting tricky for people.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5634.315s">Well,</a>  we'll move through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5635.315s">I</a>  mean, there are some people that, you know, resist anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5638.436s">Look,</a>  earlier this evening, you were telling me that I'm making things too bureaucratic for the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5642.777s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5642.957s">I'm</a>  telling you, you're making things too bureaucratic for the teachers and everything like that.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5646.658s">No,</a>  no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5647.359s">We'll</a>  work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5648.099s">But</a>  this is a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5649.439s">I</a>  want, if there's a change necessary, because we just approved this, then we need to make those edits and make it easier for our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5656.782s">I'm</a>  not trying to make it harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5658.362s">I'm</a>  trying to take it down.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5659.322s">I</a>  think obviously the nurse has indicated it's okay until she sees something specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5664.044s">If</a>  something comes up, we'll come bring it back.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5666.705s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor for approval of the trip by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5669.886s">Kreatz,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5670.966s">Mastone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5672.226s">Roll</a>  call vote.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5877.057s">Before</a>  we leave tonight, I wanted to bring up one other discussion which I thought mr. Ruggiero might Today, mr. Ruggiero put online our packet of information and I think that There was <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5896.966s">One</a>  Piece which I was uncomfortable with which actually had to do with ski trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5902.209s">It</a>  didn't have names on it But if there was names I wanted that to be posted I wasn't certain that I wanted Everybody in the public to know exactly where the kids were going what time they were going whatever just as a safety thing I think that it's long been a <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5918.138s">thought</a>  that I know other school committee members share that some of our documents rather than having this big stack of papers could be online for us as well and so I think that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5936.475s">I</a>  think we should take both things together, figure out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5939.416s">There</a>  were some questions about afterwards, which people in the public raised, which I certainly wouldn't have thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5945.34s">So</a>  it was interesting input of saying, how do you best post our information for our meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5954.126s">So</a>  I'd like to make a motion, maybe in conjunction with Mr. Ruggiero, that we search how we're going to, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5964.053s">effectively</a>  put our documents online, both for the public and also so that we can minimize the amount of paper that we have for our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5976.601s">As</a>  a long-term school committee member, I can tell you that I could devote, I mean, whole rooms, buckets fills of these exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5985.367s">And</a>  frankly, it's just way too much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5987.588s">I</a>  mentioned to mr. Shira earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5989.729s">I</a>  spoke to the superintendent earlier today about that the possibility of us going paperless with an iPad To do our work and in the same time when they're uploading the files for us They can upload it to a separate the school website for all to see what what the backup is to the agenda item So the superintendent I even work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=6007.378s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=6007.558s">I</a>  made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=6008.439s">Do</a>  we want to just officialize it? <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=6010.34s">I</a> </p>
