1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:09,839
So today I'm here to ask for support and help for the Roberts PTO's grant application to the Community Preservation Commission for the restoration of our school playground.

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:18,706
The Roberts Elementary School is one of the most populous elementary schools in Medford and our playground, as are all the elementary school playgrounds, is in need of replacement.

3
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:22,068
The worst item in all our playgrounds seems to be the surfacing.

4
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,170
So I applied for this grant for a few reasons.

5
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:34,436
One was that I saw the mayor's capital improvement plan at a city council meeting and it included line items to replace one school playground per year, which is great.

6
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:44,002
And I thought if we coupled it with community preservation money, we could replace two playgrounds per year and everyone could have a new playground in two to three years.

7
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:49,345
So that would be about 2,400 students in our elementary schools that would all have a shiny new playground to play in.

8
00:00:50,615 --> 00:01:00,257
So that benefit would radiate out through the neighborhood that each school is in because it will allow their family members of the students to enjoy the playgrounds as well as people that just live in the neighborhood.

9
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:07,539
We've gone through the eligibility phase and we now have to prepare a complete application.

10
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,741
So we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost and we need help from the district in order to

11
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:19,384
figure out the parameters of what you'll require, companies that we have to go through.

12
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:26,129
This is outside of my scope of expertise as well as my authority as a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School.

13
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:30,752
We were able to apply with a supporting letter from the principal at our school.

14
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:37,657
But in order to go forward, we need approval and help from the school committee and the district.

15
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:40,379
So I'm hoping that we're going to be able to do that.

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,581
The application needs to be submitted by March 2nd.

17
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:57,027
I'm hoping that we'll make it through the first round because that will allow for completion to happen in the summer when the students are not in school so that they won't have any interrupted recess time and they'll be able to start September with a shiny new playground.

18
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:11,112
If we do receive community preservation funds, there are other grants that we can apply for to help supplement, but we're not eligible to apply for those grants until we receive funding from the community preservation.

19
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:15,788
I'm hoping that you guys can help me out.

20
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:17,230
That's pretty much why I'm here.

21
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,832
Superintendent and other estimates for the new school year.

22
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,313
Well, the estimates, you know, vary.

23
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:29,118
It depends on what we decide should be the surface on those playgrounds, because we may not want to go with the same surface.

24
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:37,104
You may want something different, something that maybe is a newer product than what we put in place 15, 16 years ago.

25
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:39,766
And we need to get a better estimate on that.

26
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:39,946
So.

27
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:45,612
While this may be an interesting opportunity, we're also looking at the community preservation grant for other issues as well.

28
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:56,283
Going forward, generally for us in the second round, and I was going to give you some materials on that at a subsequent meeting, because the second round will be coming up as well, and to look at a larger picture.

29
00:02:56,824 --> 00:03:01,769
But I think if we, since it's March 2nd, I think we put it on the table tonight.

30
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,670
I'll come back with more specifics.

31
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:11,373
and try to give you an idea of whether this is feasible under the Community Preservation Grant or whether it needs to go through some other process.

32
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:13,393
I think that's probably the best way to go.

33
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,274
Obviously, we're glad to get any funding we can get, appreciate your efforts.

34
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:21,795
But to do this right, this is not a $5,000 or $10,000 expenditure.

35
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:24,016
This could be $75,000, $100,000, or more.

36
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:28,857
So this is not something that's going to be easily acquired from any one source.

37
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,208
Motion on the floor to request an estimate from various entities.

38
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:54,155
Mr. Ruggiero In addition to that motion, I would like to ask that we We move this issue to do two of our subcommittees The first is the buildings and grounds to see how we can move forward on this issue and also to see if we could do Community relations to see if there are any subcontractors in the town that would be willing to donate

39
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,536
Generally, a paper goes to one committee, not to two.

40
00:03:56,676 --> 00:04:01,359
So if you send it to Building and Grounds, they could do their homework there with Mr. McLaughlin.

41
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,482
But in addition to the estimate, I'd like to suggest that we send this issue to Building and Grounds for more research.

42
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,870
On the motion that the paper be seconded by Ms.

43
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,371
Mostow, I'm sent to the Building and Grounds Subcommittee.

44
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:14,032
Mr. Benedetto, did you wish to speak on this?

45
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:25,760
I remember recently walking the playgrounds and that some of this preliminary work John might have already done and had ideas for different

46
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,241
different materials, so it's not a new idea.

47
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,662
It's something that we know that we're in great need for.

48
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:39,505
And some of the research might have been done, but we need to decide what products are best.

49
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:44,746
But I believe that we should work with Cheryl to move this forward right away.

50
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,288
This was on my wish list when I saw.

51
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:53,854
This thank you for taking it and running with it and making it come forward.

52
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,116
So I would like to move forward with this.

53
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:03,886
And I'm sure Mr. McLaughlin already has some ideas of where to call and what types of materials people are using.

54
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,766
There's a motion on the floor, seconded by Ms.

55
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,787
Mustone to move this paper into subcommittee building and grounds.

56
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:10,828
All those in favor?

57
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:11,548
Aye.

58
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:11,928
Speak on this?

59
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:12,169
Yes.

60
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:12,569
Ms.

61
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:13,409
Van de Kloot?

62
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,211
I just wanted to thank Cheryl for coming before us.

63
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:22,073
Cheryl, you're great at searching out opportunities to get money for the students at the Robertson.

64
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:23,114
I really appreciate that.

65
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:23,854
Thanks.

66
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:24,835
Thank you.

67
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:27,116
On the motion, all those in favor?

68
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:27,616
Aye.

69
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:28,757
All those opposed?

70
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:29,577
Motion carries.

71
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:30,057
Thank you, Ms.

72
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:30,637
Rodriguez.

73
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:31,358
Thank you, Ms.

74
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:31,698
Cheryl.

75
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:42,820
point of clarification is my stone so I can call a subcommittee for buildings and grounds Aaron Kathy and I are on it and we invite Cheryl and we can all and John or is there she go.

76
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,480
Cheryl.

77
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,621
We're going to.

78
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,321
So we'll meet.

79
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:50,945
So Aaron Kathy and I are on the subcommittee for buildings and grounds and then I'll just email us all to get together.

80
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:55,308
Public meeting it will be posted for 48 hours in compliance with open meeting.

81
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:55,989
All right.

82
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:56,429
Thank you.

83
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,590
Wanted on the next agenda.

84
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,711
It has to happen in between now and the next thing.

85
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,953
So she has a March 2nd deadline to submit.

86
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:06,659
Right.

87
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:14,890
Very good report of superintendent report on me see participation in superintendent search Mr. Superintendent.

88
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:26,267
So Mayor and members of the committee, earlier in the minutes you heard that we approved retaining Massachusetts Association of School Committees to be our agent to advance the search.

89
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:34,749
This afternoon, the Mayor and I met with Glenn Kuchar, the Executive Director of MASC, and went over all the different functions and activities that they can assist us with.

90
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,149
And it's quite substantial.

91
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,970
And as you know, because we pay dues,

92
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,633
You know, we're not incurring an additional charge, which we might if we contracted with someone else.

93
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:48,577
In the interim, we've put a pretty aggressive schedule together.

94
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:53,300
As the mayor indicated, we'll clean it up tonight and get something out to you over the next day or so.

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,223
But the first schedule was obviously the search committee, and the mayor's put something like that out.

96
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:04,507
But in the interim, just to give you some information with regard to this particular activity,

97
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:32,412
Glenn Kuchar indicated to us that he could distribute our brochure, he could distribute our applications, he could take in the applications as they came in, turn them around very quickly, give us a tiering as to who's eligible or not just simply by licensure and a few things like that, get it over to the search committee generally within a day, believe it or not, and create the circumstances in which this would go forward.

98
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,354
He would also work on creating focus groups

99
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:42,038
and other aspects of this search, site visits, and other things that you may or may not want to do.

100
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:51,444
But clearly, this will take us into high gear with the idea being that a decision would be made sometime at the beginning of April.

101
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:53,945
And this is the path we're on.

102
00:07:55,066 --> 00:08:03,072
The report I'm giving you right now gives you an idea that he'll get it out to a wide audience to help us screen the applicants to make sure the people are eligible.

103
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:10,657
The search committee will get every applicant, whether they consider them eligible or not, in hard copy as well as electronically.

104
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:16,242
The survey developed by the school committee, I want to talk to Mr. Rousseau about that.

105
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:20,888
He will assist in getting that out and pulling those results together along with the focus groups.

106
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:27,996
Again, pulling it together so that it takes the burden off any one member to do that or the administrations to keep it clean.

107
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:38,204
He'll assist in the preparation of interviews, you know, questions for you to help you develop questions and appropriate information so you can group them properly.

108
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:40,285
I went through a process of how they do that.

109
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:46,488
And then, of course, following up with contract negotiations with the successful candidate or the candidate that you select.

110
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:48,750
So there's a lot here.

111
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:59,576
Clearly having an agent on board moves it forward, takes the burden off us to do it, and it keeps us on track to have a decision by April, hopefully.

112
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:07,341
Now, the one thing we've got to understand is that when materials come in, it's confidential at this point in time.

113
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:13,966
Just because you get something doesn't mean you go talking about who applied, because people are entitled to a certain amount of privacy.

114
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:17,288
Once it reaches the final stage, privacy's off.

115
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,211
And then people can see it.

116
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,371
There'll be public interviews.

117
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:25,973
There'll be all the kinds of things that will give the community total transparency as to the process.

118
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:35,918
It's very extensive, and I think that, uh, based on the discussions we had today and based on what you will learn in the next few days, that, uh, you'll see this is a very, very wide open search.

119
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:38,639
It's intended to bring in candidates around.

120
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,860
Uh, he's in Lexington tonight.

121
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,162
I think Lexington's about to make a decision tonight on its selection.

122
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:46,844
And a few other communities that will be moving forward.

123
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:51,169
And I think we'll be excited to see pools of candidates come into our program.

124
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:55,653
So with that, I think that gives you an update on MASC's involvement.

125
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:57,715
Quickly came to the table with us today.

126
00:09:57,755 --> 00:09:59,537
Remember, we only did it last week.

127
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:02,220
And quickly came to the table today to work out some details.

128
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:07,980
This time I really would like to thank the committee that got together to put together the survey led by Ms.

129
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,303
Van de Kloot, Mr. Russo, Ms.

130
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:11,645
Kratz, formerly Ms.

131
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:19,134
Cuno, also served prior to January, along with Jenny Graham, a parent who stepped up and actually put the brochure together and really

132
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:23,838
nice looking brochure demonstrating the strengths of our community.

133
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:27,741
So I just want to thank all of you for your hard work in such a tight little time frame.

134
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:35,788
And if you do have any of the documents, including the survey, if you could get it to us so that we can get it to Glenn, so he can start to get them formalized and out the door.

135
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:41,832
Just if we will, we have to go over a couple of things because it's on your account and we need to move it over.

136
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:45,155
A couple of technical things that we're going to have to do.

137
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:57,367
Superintendent Belson, is it possible that Glenn could put on a presentation for the community?

138
00:10:57,888 --> 00:10:59,990
Because he's seen a lot of these superintendent searches.

139
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,770
It would be really helpful.

140
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:01,191
He is.

141
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:08,197
He's going to actually put together focus groups for not only the citizenry at large but also internally for teachers and administrators.

142
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,021
We will not be at the administrative meeting because they like to kind of do things with just him.

143
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:22,708
But we certainly, he will be putting something on for the public as well as the school committee and the ultimate search committee as well to say like the do's and the don'ts.

144
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:24,890
If certain questions are legal you cannot ask.

145
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,574
So everyone needs to be apprised of that and stick to that because it's a discriminatory practice.

146
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:32,556
So he will give us all guidance as we move along.

147
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:37,780
And tomorrow I'll have a group of dates that shows when we think we're going to hit these milestones.

148
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,561
Thank you.

149
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:44,138
I think the multitude of activities that you'll see will indicate this is going to be a very public process.

150
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:46,908
Mr Van de Kloot.

151
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:47,929
Thank you, Mayor.

152
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:52,533
I just wanted to mention, though, and I'm all for the M.A.S.C.

153
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:53,754
and taking over this.

154
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,055
When we voted on it last week, I put it forth.

155
00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:02,000
However, I do think that there is a cost incurred and it's an appropriate cost.

156
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,903
I don't think that all of these services are completely free.

157
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:08,105
So since you said free, I just don't want to mislead anybody in that.

158
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,468
Well, there'll be some cost for materials that we have to pass out and things like that.

159
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:13,449
But I don't we're not talking about search consultants.

160
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:21,972
So much based on what I've talked to her under right, but we'll get we'll get right I think he gave us the number Around 9,000 or so.

161
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,013
So that's no that's for full search done by them totally by them.

162
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:28,314
We've already put some things together Oh, so it's done quite a bit.

163
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:31,155
So it's different We'll get it.

164
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:36,817
We'll get a number but the number is not what okay would have been for a full search if they did it from scratch Okay, I just want to be clear

165
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:38,127
Very good.

166
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,730
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

167
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:41,472
So moved.

168
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:42,513
So moved.

169
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:43,274
Sergiero?

170
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:43,454
Ms.

171
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:43,775
Kretz?

172
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:44,816
All those in favor?

173
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:45,197
Aye.

174
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,319
All those opposed?

175
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,821
Motion carries.

176
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:48,161
Thank you.

177
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:54,449
Recommendation to begin search for foreign language director, school year 18-19.

178
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:02,953
So I'm telling you tonight that Rita DeCarlo, done an outstanding job for us in foreign language, has announced her retirement.

179
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:05,934
It's an important area for us.

180
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,375
She spent over 30 years.

181
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:12,317
And I'm telling you that I want to begin the search at this point in time for her replacement.

182
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:19,241
And we will do it the usual way we do it, where we have some candidates come in, we screen them down, and then we give you a chance through

183
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:25,149
to look at the top three candidates that come to you and you'll give us feedback and then we make an appointment.

184
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,112
I'd like to get going with that.

185
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:34,003
I spoke with the superintendent and asked that our diversity and inclusion director, Neil Osborne, be a part of the preliminary interviews.

186
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:36,153
Thank you.

187
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:41,157
There are motion to receive in places on file so moved by Mr Benedetto, seconded by Miss Van de Kloet.

188
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:41,998
All those in favor.

189
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,499
All those opposed?

190
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:44,540
Motion carried.

191
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:54,067
Mayor Burke, I'm sure we'll have an opportunity later on to congratulate Mrs DiCarlo and thank her for her work, but it would I can't let the moment pass.

192
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,348
She's been an asset to our community.

193
00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:03,574
She's a great lady, and we will certainly need to celebrate her tenure with us and her retirement.

194
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:04,764
Very good.

195
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:09,447
Item three, report on DESE, Leading the Nation initiative.

196
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:10,768
Mr. Superintendent.

197
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:21,254
So the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has launched an initiative which will celebrate Massachusetts and Massachusetts' achievements as leading the nation.

198
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:26,857
Massachusetts, you know, leads the nation in typical test scores and other kinds of indicators.

199
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:38,681
Also, if you look at the PISA results, the international results, if Massachusetts counts itself as a nation, which we do in the rankings, we're always very close to the top, if not on top.

200
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:52,045
So, Massachusetts has decided through the department to celebrate that, and they've begun a project to provide a statewide platform for public schools in Massachusetts to celebrate their great achievements.

201
00:14:52,685 --> 00:15:12,946
We've already begun to pull together highlights and other things that are particular to us that go beyond testing, that highlight the kinds of educational programs that we're running, that we believe make Massachusetts not only tops in those categories of testing, but actually makes Massachusetts, in places like Medford, you know, renowned for doing some

202
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:19,348
programs, whether it's Global Scholars, CCSR, or other things that you have heard about over the years.

203
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:27,911
I want to make you aware of it because we're going to start to ramp up very soon, and we hope that you'll all participate.

204
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:37,034
And you can see some of the things that are going to go on statewide at the Statehouse and other activities, which will give us an opportunity to highlight our school systems.

205
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:38,435
We'll also use our various media.

206
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:52,481
To talk about the things that are going well in our community and neighboring communities are the things we collaborate with so that's just an Informational piece for you right now to let you know and welcome any ideas that you may have Thank you

207
00:15:54,842 --> 00:16:00,707
On this subject, first of all, I think this is great in any way that we can highlight the work that our children in our community does.

208
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:15,841
I think it's marvelous, especially not only through this, but in general, I think we need to publicize more and more about the great opportunities that children of Method have and the great learning experiences they show our community.

209
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:26,584
Based on that, I also wanted to ask you about the new commissioner for DESC, and they finalized the last, down to three.

210
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:32,896
They've actually got some interviews going on, I believe, at the end of this week.

211
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:47,823
They'll be interviewing, they've narrowed it down to three finalists, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of New York, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of Texas, and the current superintendent of the Lawrence Public Schools have been designated as the three finalists.

212
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:58,191
The board will interview them and potentially even next week will make a decision and make their recommendation to the Secretary of Education, Mr. Pizer.

213
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:03,175
We'll have an affirmation or a veto at his discretion.

214
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:30,738
Hopefully we'll have someone in place very soon in that role when that person will actually take office I don't know probably depends on their current contracts and their current obligations But I assume that in the interim Jeff Wilson will continue to be the acting commissioner until that person can actually assume the role so we expect that to happen fairly soon and I'll get you posted as soon as I know

215
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:39,050
So in addition to that, any idea of what direction any of these new commissioners are going to go and what required like new.

216
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,831
They've named three finalists.

217
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:45,833
I mean, you know, so if I want to speculate, you know, I might have thoughts, but I mean, it'd be inappropriate.

218
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:46,413
OK.

219
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:50,872
I just want to keep a close eye on this, and I know that you do.

220
00:17:51,872 --> 00:18:04,856
It's just, you know, when a new commissioner comes in, new regulations, new mandates, different things, and not only do you have to advocate for that, but our next superintendent also has to have the wherewithal to do that as well.

221
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,076
I'll keep you posted.

222
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:07,517
Thank you.

223
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:09,057
Is there a motion to accept?

224
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:11,558
Motion to accept report and place on file.

225
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:12,598
Seconded.

226
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,558
All those in favor?

227
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:13,638
Aye.

228
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:15,079
All those opposed?

229
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:16,279
Motion passes.

230
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:23,244
Report on statewide accommodations for culturally responsive religious observances.

231
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:34,468
So as our community becomes culturally and religiously diverse, more so than it has been, although, you know, it's quite a change.

232
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:38,550
In 1982, 4% of our school population were persons of color.

233
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,472
Today, it's close to 38% in an idea of what's taken place over time.

234
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:59,055
But as we become more culturally diverse and religiously diverse, it's incumbent upon us to actively ensure that our students, employees, citizens are treated with respect and dignity and that they celebrate their personal cultures and religious observances.

235
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:06,379
So adopting appropriate, inclusive holidays, observances, protocols does not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.

236
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:11,002
There's a difference between establishing religion and just allowing people to celebrate.

237
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:13,463
It's a distinct difference.

238
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:19,185
Rather, it protects it by recognizing the rich diversity of people's experiences.

239
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:22,947
Massachusetts laws prohibit discrimination in all its forms.

240
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:30,310
The best way to ensure that discrimination does not occur is to educate our students and community through positive learning and experience.

241
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:35,953
We must always seek to move forward, to go beyond toleration to understanding.

242
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:41,694
and enlightened understanding for both our diverse and common human heritage.

243
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:51,642
The topic is far too involved to have a broad discussion this evening, but we need to invest more time through focus groups and additional sessions.

244
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:57,046
In the interim, I've provided you with some materials in preparation for a more robust discussion.

245
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:09,698
And we certainly will include people, and I've listed holidays and other things that deal with inclusive practices that have been put out by various agencies that are known for their expertise in this area.

246
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:15,644
Obviously, you know, this is not only a local thing, it's a national thing, it's a statewide thing.

247
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,947
And for us to be in the forefront of it is very important.

248
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:21,510
A lot of good things happening in our community already.

249
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,113
But the price of doing the right thing is eternal vigilance.

250
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:26,814
You have to be diligent with it.

251
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:27,775
You can't let it slip.

252
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:29,897
And we have a lot of things going on.

253
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:34,221
And different things will occur, and there'll be some people that perhaps don't understand it.

254
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:45,551
But it's our job to make sure that everyone feels protected, feels safe, and that we don't have any situation where a person feels isolated because of the policies and practices of our school system.

255
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:49,194
Are you good?

256
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,794
Motion to receive and place on file.

257
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:51,014
Ms.

258
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:51,934
Mustone, question?

259
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:53,495
Sure.

260
00:20:53,835 --> 00:21:03,237
So you had listed on our packet, the state of New Jersey has a resolution, the list of religious holidays permitting student absence from school, and there's a long list.

261
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:05,158
So is that something that we could consider?

262
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:13,180
Well, what we do is, I'll probably recognize the fact that if a person's out for those holidays and documents it, there's an excuse.

263
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:16,364
Right, but we don't have a resolution on fire.

264
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:16,964
No.

265
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:18,686
So is this something that we know?

266
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:21,288
No, just we've actually had a practice of doing so.

267
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,030
Okay, so you're just showing us.

268
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,390
Okay.

269
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,051
Okay.

270
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:24,451
Thank you.

271
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:28,995
On the motion that's report be placed on file.

272
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:29,856
All those in favor.

273
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:31,918
All those opposed.

274
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:33,299
Motion has it.

275
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:33,719
Thank you.

276
00:21:36,522 --> 00:21:39,705
Report on protocols for school closing due to inclement weather.

277
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:46,185
So every year we go through various stages of why we close school and why we keep open.

278
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:51,269
And some people understand it and some people agree and some people don't agree.

279
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:57,352
I found the last little while the people who are more aggressively emailing me are generally students.

280
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,034
High school students in particular.

281
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,635
High school students, generally around.

282
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:12,200
8 o'clock in the morning before a storm, I'm getting things being told that their life is being put in peril and we're endangering them and their families.

283
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:16,102
And I write back to them as courteously as I possibly can.

284
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,341
For the most part, people do understand it.

285
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:27,145
But I want to take a little bit of opportunity in between storms, if you will, to go over a couple things.

286
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:34,129
So if people are listening, and we'll put it on our website again, they'll get an idea as to how we make these decisions.

287
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:37,094
We want to keep open if we can.

288
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:40,978
There are many youngsters out there who have no one supervising them if we close the schools.

289
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:45,863
There are many youngsters out there who have no one feeding them if we close the schools.

290
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:55,852
On the other hand, if conditions warranted, having youngsters out in the cold and driving snow, possibly with vehicles sliding on the road,

291
00:22:56,773 --> 00:23:16,585
Has to be balanced with our decision to open the schools Parents always have the opportunity to make a decision and if they document that they kept the youngster home Because of you know the weather and we have a reason to believe that the weather was that way we will provide an excused absence

292
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:32,284
If, in fact, a youngster comes to us late on a day when conditions are such, rather than delay the whole day, which could mess up a number of things for a number of people, we won't mark them tardy to the extent that there's a reasonable arrival.

293
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:37,108
Now, if they come in two minutes before the closing, we might think that that's not reasonable.

294
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:44,454
But if they're an hour or so late, that's not a bad problem for us to recognize that as part of travel conditions.

295
00:23:45,295 --> 00:24:01,909
So we're entering the winter season, we're in the winter season, and from year to year, we may have more or less closings because of weather, or cold, or any other number of reasons, or for some reason that there's a building problem, or a safety problem that's different.

296
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,432
We will use our media to inform people.

297
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:07,993
We use all the television media.

298
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:10,355
We use our own media to put things out.

299
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,237
We use robocalls.

300
00:24:12,437 --> 00:24:16,500
We do everything we possibly can to let people know as soon as possible.

301
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:23,466
Now, this last storm had to wait till almost 6 o'clock in the morning to take a good hard look to see what would come in.

302
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:27,749
Now, I knew in this area we weren't going to get much snow.

303
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:35,156
But a little to the west and a little to the north and the southeast, they got snow and they got bad conditions.

304
00:24:35,937 --> 00:24:40,320
So that was a tough one because we weren't sure what actually would happen, how it would track.

305
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:45,532
The one before, people ask me, why didn't you call off school on that Tuesday when it was cold?

306
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:51,818
If I had called off school on that Tuesday when it was cold, we would have been out Thursday and Friday anyway.

307
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,601
We would have had one day of school that week because Monday was a holiday.

308
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:59,706
So sometimes you just have to balance it a little bit and think about what's going to happen.

309
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:04,831
You also have to think about the fact that teachers and others come from distance, and if they have

310
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:09,316
young people of their own that have to stay home with, they may not come in.

311
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:15,502
Or if they have the travel arrangements coming from the north or the south, it may not work for them to be in and on time.

312
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:17,144
It may not be a productive day.

313
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:24,131
So these are all kinds of considerations if you have to pay attention to where the DPW and the contractors can clear out lots.

314
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:37,395
whether we think that the buses can actually make it up and go the various routes, whether the bus stops and the sidewalks have had an opportunity to be cleared to the greatest extent possible, although it's never perfect.

315
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:38,936
It's very rarely perfect.

316
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:41,938
So there's a lot of considerations that we have to look at.

317
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:50,946
I do talk to area colleagues as we come into this kind of season, and we take a look and see what's happening, and we try to make decisions that way.

318
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:00,875
It's very important for people to understand that schools provide safety, it provides warmth, it provides nutrition to many youngsters.

319
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:03,357
And we don't take school closings lightly.

320
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:11,602
But if you think that safety is an issue, if you think that we can't clear the lots, we don't think we're going to have a productive day, we will call it.

321
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:16,145
And I will try to call it as early as possible, often the night before.

322
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:22,570
But some days it's not, we don't know until 5 o'clock in the morning, just the way it is.

323
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:44,146
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent recently the D ESC put out some new I don't know they didn't come up with regulations yet, but new discussion about possibilities of having students do work that had been prepared for them so that if we

324
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:52,609
Um, and if the teacher, uh, had a elongated time out, there was an option other than, uh, attacking on school days at the end or whatever.

325
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:55,949
Um I haven't read it completely.

326
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,750
I was thinking that we would be talking about it.

327
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:06,251
I definitely think that I understand that it's complex because you need to make sure that all students can access

328
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:19,060
tricky in our community where not everyone necessarily will have access to a computer, but many will have access to phones now.

329
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:26,348
You know, we're in a different age and all the kids that come in to volunteer at the hospital, they're all doing their homework on their phones.

330
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:35,917
If you're not prepared to talk about that in depth tonight, I think that we should talk about it in a curriculum subcommittee meeting and plan.

331
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,180
I see this not so much for the one or two day absence.

332
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:50,111
I see this in the how to figure out in the event that we have a prolonged week, say a blizzard that keeps us all home, how we're going to be proactive about this.

333
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:59,920
I would just tell you that there are people who, not what you're telling me, we should talk about long term, but there are people who rush to do what they call blizzard packs.

334
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:01,642
I find that unproductive.

335
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:04,844
We pay our teachers to teach 180 days of school.

336
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,093
It's not a trade-off to give kids some homework.

337
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,415
They're supposed to do homework anyway.

338
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:16,903
And you know, the reality is that we want our teachers in front of students and they don't want to trade days.

339
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:22,611
Now, if we get hit like the storm of 1978, we're out a whole week or ten days or something like that.

340
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:28,542
We could probably have a plan in place to send materials out, especially with today's electronics.

341
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:35,828
But I think we should be very careful that we start trading days for short-term days off.

342
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:36,668
But I hear what you're saying.

343
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:38,990
If it's long-term, maybe we should consider it through a meeting.

344
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:43,573
I had a question.

345
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:55,700
I did receive several calls from parents who mentioned that the day that school was open because it was very, very cold, that there was a lot of teachers absent.

346
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,842
And most of the kids were sent to lecture halls that were not heated, and they were freezing.

347
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:03,963
The children were just freezing.

348
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,124
This is at the high school.

349
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:14,107
For example, one student, one of his teachers was in, in all the other classes he went to freezing cold lecture halls that were not heated.

350
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:17,749
And it was just really, really, really, really cold.

351
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:31,915
students were wearing gloves and they had the little, what they're called, the heat warmers, right, they had hand warmers, passing them around, and a lot of kids got sick.

352
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:45,561
And I got a lot of calls about that, and I'm not sure if, I tried to identify what area, and I just don't know, but it was mainly that it was really, really cold in high school.

353
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:46,341
Yeah.

354
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:53,002
We sent you out on that particular day.

355
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:57,147
The high school was not badly attended that day.

356
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:59,129
It was over 80% of the people that were there.

357
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:03,293
That's pretty good since normal attendance is in the low 90s.

358
00:30:04,314 --> 00:30:05,796
Plus teachers, there weren't that many people.

359
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:09,239
There were people out, but there weren't that many people out comparatively to what could have been out.

360
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,067
As far as the cold goes, part of the issue was the fact that it came on so suddenly.

361
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:17,453
Certain areas of the building were still trying to adjust.

362
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,858
But we can work on the heating system.

363
00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:21,761
We can work on different aspects of it.

364
00:30:22,892 --> 00:30:31,934
A lot of people were in school, and for the 80% plus of the people that were in school, I think it was good to have them there, as opposed to shut it down and then everyone's out.

365
00:30:32,654 --> 00:30:37,055
We'd end up making it up, and I think it was a day to have, especially that week.

366
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:42,156
Because remember, again, if we called off school that day, we were in school potentially Wednesday.

367
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,597
That was a whole week would have been gone.

368
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:46,497
So at least we got a couple days in.

369
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:47,317
I hear what you're saying.

370
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:49,918
We'll certainly work on that, and John and I will check.

371
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:54,574
Or check the rooms before students are sent to them.

372
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:56,095
That was my suggestion.

373
00:30:56,655 --> 00:31:01,197
If the lecture halls were not heated, maybe have them go to the cafeteria.

374
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:08,481
We'll certainly have the principals review that as a practice so that they understand that check the room out.

375
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:10,502
Put them in the warmest place as possible.

376
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,471
Mr. Benedetto.

377
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:24,460
So going back to the blizzard bags this year, actually, throughout Western Mass, there are a few schools, districts that are piloting blizzard bags.

378
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:34,428
And with today's technology, there is a lot of online learning happening, especially for, I believe, our high school students who have AP exams.

379
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:38,712
And they take that exam no matter how many blizzard days or how many snow days we take.

380
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:45,295
They have to have so much curriculum covered by that date, and that's the date everybody in the nation takes that test.

381
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:56,540
So by losing days for snow, we are behind kids like in Georgia and California that aren't losing that learning time and who actually might start school in August.

382
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,042
They're at an advantage of some of these exams.

383
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:04,783
So I believe the future in education is more

384
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:13,809
electronic learning, more interactive learning, and I believe our teachers are savvy enough to teach those in that way.

385
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:24,455
I know that we don't have a per-child device at this point, and I know that our district would love to move forward with that, but that's a very expensive thing.

386
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,997
But if other school, other

387
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:34,139
school districts are doing this in learning, and we can see how they're using it effectively for all students.

388
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:40,080
In Western Mass, there are children that are in all different socioeconomic things, and they don't all have it.

389
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:53,783
We can learn from them, and maybe, I brought this up a year or two ago, actually, when we did have a bad winter, about two years ago, when we were going late, late into June, and almost into July.

390
00:32:54,043 --> 00:32:54,923
Might have been three years ago.

391
00:32:57,884 --> 00:33:16,894
think it is is coming towards method and we have to have an open mind with this and and start looking at it and you know seeing what options are out there and planning for our future rather than wait and see what happens so I don't agree I think that you know we should look forward to this if not for this year and the next year's coming

392
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:19,515
I'm sorry.

393
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:19,735
I'm sorry.

394
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:19,935
I'm sorry.

395
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:20,135
I'm sorry.

396
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:20,656
I'm sorry.

397
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:21,176
I'm sorry.

398
00:33:21,196 --> 00:33:21,596
I'm sorry.

399
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:22,636
I'm sorry.

400
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:23,277
I'm sorry.

401
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:23,917
I'm sorry.

402
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:24,537
I'm sorry.

403
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:25,097
I'm sorry.

404
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:25,497
I'm sorry.

405
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:26,158
I'm sorry.

406
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:26,798
I'm sorry.

407
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:27,158
I'm sorry.

408
00:33:27,178 --> 00:33:27,498
I'm sorry.

409
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:27,978
I'm sorry.

410
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:28,639
I'm sorry.

411
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:29,019
I'm sorry.

412
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:29,799
I'm sorry.

413
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:30,399
I'm sorry.

414
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:30,839
I'm sorry.

415
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:31,120
I'm sorry.

416
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,420
I'm sorry.

417
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
I'm sorry.

418
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm sorry.

419
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:34,341
I'm sorry.

420
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:34,921
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:35,901
I'm sorry.

422
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:36,382
I'm sorry.

423
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:37,222
I'm sorry.

424
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:38,262
I'm sorry.

425
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:38,662
I'm sorry.

426
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:39,002
I'm sorry.

427
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:39,383
I'm sorry.

428
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:39,903
I'm sorry.

429
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:40,283
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:40,603
I'm sorry.

431
00:33:40,623 --> 00:33:40,923
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:41,924
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:41,944 --> 00:33:42,164
I'm sorry.

434
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:42,564
I'm sorry.

435
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:42,784
I'm sorry.

436
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:43,004
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:43,324
I'm sorry.

438
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:43,664
I'm sorry.

439
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:44,044
I'm sorry.

440
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:44,405
I'm sorry.

441
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:44,625
I'm sorry.

442
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:45,005
I'm sorry.

443
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:45,305
I'm sorry.

444
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:45,545
I'm sorry.

445
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:45,885
I'm sorry.

446
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:47,186
I'm sorry.

447
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,006
I'm sorry.

448
00:33:51,420 --> 00:34:05,381
So just to the AP, most of the teachers already kind of take their own initiative individually as to, you know, what

449
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:11,236
what sort of assignments they can give over that snow day.

450
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:25,068
One of my teachers just says it will always be three days ahead so that in the case of catastrophic blizzard, we'll still be remotely on track.

451
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:29,131
So mostly the teachers are doing this already.

452
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:36,653
But what I do worry about is kids who don't have as much accessibility to technology.

453
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:55,948
I just want to congratulate our representative from the high school, Sebastian

454
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,834
under X. Means he'll be nice and close.

455
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:30,478
Mr. Ruggiero.

456
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:30,918
Blinken.

457
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:31,739
No.

458
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:46,571
Second the motion by Miss Van de Kloot that this paper be sent to the curriculum subcommittee to investigate the desi findings on alternative ways of conducting school business on snow days or emergency days off.

459
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,373
All those in favor.

460
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,534
All those opposed.

461
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:51,956
Motion passes.

462
00:35:56,277 --> 00:36:05,166
Item six, recommendation to adopt oversight guidelines for PTO slash PTG and other 501c3 organizations that support our public schools.

463
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:10,992
Mayor and members of the school committee, we had an extensive discussion in the committee of the whole.

464
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:15,777
And again, just to briefly summarize it,

465
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:21,577
The organizations that exist to support our schools are all good people.

466
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:22,538
They're working hard.

467
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:24,438
They give up a lot of their time.

468
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,419
They generate a lot of support for our schools.

469
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,260
We're very grateful and thankful.

470
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:47,147
However, in order to optimize it, in order to make it more efficient and more effective overall across the city, and in order to tie it together with our own work, it's important for us to adopt some guidelines, adopt some training protocols, so that we can help these organizations do that much better.

471
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:49,568
and to dovetail much better with us.

472
00:36:49,608 --> 00:37:00,051
So I've put together for you some recommendations to adopt oversight guidelines for PTOs, PTGs, and other 501c3 internal organizations.

473
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:08,914
And I say internal organizations because I'm not talking about if a major corporation's 501c3 gives us money, I'm not going to ask them to audit their books.

474
00:37:08,974 --> 00:37:14,976
But I'm talking about groups that technically work with us or use our name.

475
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,477
Michael Bloomberg gives us some money, I'm not going to ask him for his financials this week.

476
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:23,062
I guess you probably wouldn't send it to me anyway.

477
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:30,924
But I mean, but having said that, you know, our Cummings Foundation, things like that, they give us money and, you know, I'm appreciative that they do.

478
00:37:31,004 --> 00:37:34,125
But I'm talking about the internal groups that are clearly ours.

479
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:40,346
And so I've listed eight items and I would ask that you approve them.

480
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:44,947
I can read them off or you can accept them as they're written.

481
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,147
Let me know what you're.

482
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:47,127
Would you like me to read them?

483
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:47,828
Okay.

484
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,748
Would you like me to read them?

485
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:49,528
Up to you.

486
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:49,988
I can read them.

487
00:37:51,264 --> 00:38:01,556
One, all PTG, PTOs, and other internal 501c3 organizations affiliated with the Medford Public Schools must be registered with the superintendent's office annually.

488
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:05,781
All registrations must be renewed by September 1st of each year.

489
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:10,927
A registration is simply a process of recognizing that an organization exists.

490
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:19,891
If they're out in the street, that there's a number they can have, and if a person who's a member of the community wants to donate, they know this is a valid organization.

491
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:25,653
And they, we also know that they exist, and they're using our name, and raising money using our name.

492
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:28,154
To all registered organizations.

493
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:28,214
Ms.

494
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:29,495
Millstone.

495
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:33,954
Is it the same number every year?

496
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:36,114
That's the federal ID number.

497
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:37,114
That doesn't change.

498
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:38,415
That's not, that doesn't change.

499
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:41,855
This would be an internal, this would be our internal registration.

500
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,216
MPS one, two, three, four, whatever it is.

501
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:44,716
Okay.

502
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:47,777
I'm just curious what the registration form you imagined.

503
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:51,277
Which is a very simple thing, but I want to know they exist.

504
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:52,078
Who they are.

505
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:53,358
You'll see it as it comes down.

506
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,895
Well, it'll come down, you'll see it, okay, you'll see the things that you'll be on the form.

507
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:04,364
Who the officers are, you know, you know, and so and so forth, where they're banking, and the likes of this.

508
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,927
Just let me continue, some of it will flush out.

509
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:06,548
No, it'll come out.

510
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:07,870
And then there could be questions at the end.

511
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:18,171
All registered organizations must submit bylaws, names of officers and board members, annual fundraising and expenditure plans, and a year-end financial statement.

512
00:39:18,932 --> 00:39:21,654
Obviously, we want to know that every organization has some rules.

513
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:26,298
We want to know that they have a plan, that it's not just something.

514
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,860
Now, if they want to modify it, they can let us know they want to modify it.

515
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,504
I'm not running around trying to second guess every move, but they should have a plan.

516
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:42,122
And another reason for that is the fact that, you know, if everyone hits the same bank and everyone hits the same business over and over again,

517
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,522
We're working on our community pretty hard.

518
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:49,866
And also, when the school department goes to them for various things, they might say, well, you already gave.

519
00:39:50,566 --> 00:40:06,680
So it's important for us to know who is being asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for services, and whether or not it interferes with something that might be a larger project that the school department might be able to do for the greater benefit of all.

520
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:13,891
If I could just interject, I just asked you guys not to, but you don't know who you're going to go to at the beginning of your year.

521
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:16,675
That happens over the course of the year.

522
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:17,756
No, you generally.

523
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:19,093
I don't know.

524
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:25,557
You hit everybody, sometimes you focus on one, but it's dependent upon what you're trying to accomplish.

525
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:26,457
You can modify it.

526
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:27,718
You can make changes.

527
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,039
It's a projection.

528
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:31,400
It's like our budget.

529
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,881
We project certain things and changes happen during the year.

530
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:35,262
It's just that nature.

531
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:39,004
You can just send in a note and say we did something different or we added something.

532
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:40,305
Maybe it doesn't have to be that tight.

533
00:40:41,627 --> 00:40:43,709
Let me keep going and then we can hit it all, okay?

534
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,171
There's some of these things that sort of intersect with each other.

535
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:51,196
Three, bylaws must clearly identify how a person becomes eligible for membership.

536
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:54,303
and how a person becomes a voting member.

537
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:55,984
Distinct difference.

538
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:08,171
I mean, a person comes to a meeting, you know, they may be a member, but if they've been to one meeting in three years, do they have the right to make decisions for a group of people that have been, you know, working on it for an extended period of time?

539
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:10,432
That's a decision people can make.

540
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:16,469
Bylaws must identify what is a voting quorum.

541
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:20,350
Some of them, three people in the room could be a voting quorum.

542
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,730
Is that a voting quorum?

543
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,911
Do you have to have so many members of the executive board to be a voting quorum?

544
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:29,672
Do you have to have so many members of the established membership to make a major decision?

545
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:36,434
Bylaws must provide detailed information how, when elections for officers and board members will be implemented.

546
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:38,353
When is it going to happen?

547
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:40,014
What is the process?

548
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:44,937
What is the distribution of information so that people know that an election is coming?

549
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:56,609
Expenditures or funds must be done in coordination with the principal to ensure that supported programs, activities, and materials are consistent with the school's program and do not distract from the main mission of the school.

550
00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:03,811
Can't have an organization decide to buy a new curriculum that is counter indicative to the ones the school system has adopted.

551
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:13,915
We can't have people planning trips that get in the way of testing or planning trips that come just as the testing season's about to begin or planning trips that

552
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:18,717
are not tied to the curriculum in an important way.

553
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:20,798
Maybe once in a while, but not all the time.

554
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,619
Remember, we only have 180 days of school.

555
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:25,060
We want to make sure all of them are used properly.

556
00:42:29,023 --> 00:42:32,645
The public schools, through the superintendents, will offer training to each entity.

557
00:42:32,665 --> 00:42:37,567
We want to make sure they all know what forms they have to fill out, if they're raising funds, if they're a non-profit.

558
00:42:39,107 --> 00:42:42,869
We want them to understand regulations and ordinances, what they can do.

559
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:47,931
If you pay somebody money, and you pay them a certain amount of money, guess what?

560
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:52,513
You've got to give them a form, or technically you're paying them under the table.

561
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:53,714
That's not acceptable.

562
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:58,804
If you're giving people money as reimbursement, reimbursement for what?

563
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,526
What's your, what are you requiring?

564
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:03,430
I mean, tonight you asked, you know, about slips and things like that.

565
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:06,574
It's all heavily documented when it comes through the school system.

566
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:08,436
Are we documenting these things?

567
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:11,260
Give us an idea of those things.

568
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:21,874
And if a person doesn't participate and doesn't become these things, then we maybe decertify them and say, look, we're not going to register you.

569
00:43:22,314 --> 00:43:26,458
You're not going to be an allowable organization because we can't track what you're doing.

570
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:31,141
And then an annual report should be made to the school committee about all the organizations that exist.

571
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:48,161
And the general thing, it may not be every expenditure they have, but it certainly should give you an idea of what started the year, what ended the year, and the main activities and the like that they had, and if they had an election, did they change officers, if there were special circumstances, was it reported.

572
00:43:48,937 --> 00:43:53,239
And I think if we do something like that, we'll have helped these organizations be that much better.

573
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:59,723
And we'll help ourselves as we try to coordinate their activities with our initiatives as well.

574
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:02,685
So I guess the floor is open for discussion.

575
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:04,246
Mr. Benedetto.

576
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:05,826
Thank you.

577
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,427
Thank you for this.

578
00:44:07,788 --> 00:44:09,228
I think it's a good place to start.

579
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:31,275
So in the title of it, recommendation to adopt oversight guidelines for PTO and PTG, I would like to have friends of as well listed, not as under other, but directly PTO, PTG, and friends of groups.

580
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:39,722
Because I just want them to realize that they are included in part of this and the oversight will

581
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:57,850
Also include them and I would like to add a number nine Register any event that uses our building through community schools So we can track how much our schools are being used in which schools are being used the most so that way we can allocate funding for maintenance and

582
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:26,933
and repairs and custodial services and extra paper towels and toilet paper to those buildings and, you know, extra cleaning if that's necessary, and to track where in the city we're using a lot, like, and maybe we need to move it to another side of town so other people in the community can go that don't drive or have an opportunity to attend different things, especially if it's a big event.

583
00:45:27,653 --> 00:45:30,855
Okay, so those are the type of things I'd like to see added.

584
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:49,526
Thank you Mr. Russo Yes, thank you So the response I got from some PTO members when they saw this was Interesting It was sort of like well, that's that I'm done That was pretty much.

585
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:50,627
I'm sorry to do that.

586
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:51,207
That's it.

587
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:51,688
I'm done.

588
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:51,728
I

589
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,352
I'm not doing the PTO anymore.

590
00:45:56,755 --> 00:46:00,218
And, you know, most of this seems to be solving a problem that doesn't exist.

591
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:06,565
The financial aspects about having some kind of a reporting on the finances makes perfect sense.

592
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:13,192
But, you know, the voting stuff, you know, I know of a PTO that,

593
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:23,816
Nobody can remember having an election because there has never been enough people to show up to fill all the spots in the six years that they've been participating.

594
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:40,643
So it's fine to say we should have elections, but when you have three people, four people, or five people filling the six spots year after year, adding one more thing where they have to post that there's going to be an election, print it, get it distributed to all of the families,

595
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:50,242
have an actual meeting so that the three or four of them can come together with their cookies and say, I guess it's us again, but don't forget to take a roll call.

596
00:46:51,043 --> 00:46:55,706
And that kind of effort doesn't seem like that big a deal.

597
00:46:56,166 --> 00:47:09,275
But when you add things like the training, so if it's going to be the same treasurer for seven years in a row, are we going to make them go to training seven years in a row, or we decertify that organization?

598
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:17,929
We can certainly do that, but we're going to have a lot of trouble finding any treasurers.

599
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:23,278
making it available?

600
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:26,759
I think we're looking at people who don't have experience.

601
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:31,640
Obviously, if a person's been doing it and doing it successfully, you don't have to go to things.

602
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,061
We don't have our teachers take courses that they've already passed and know.

603
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:37,681
Sometimes there's a refresher.

604
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,362
Sometimes there's new rules.

605
00:47:40,122 --> 00:47:43,702
Sometimes there's new forms, you know, that need to be filed.

606
00:47:44,003 --> 00:47:45,123
Sometimes there's changes.

607
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:46,543
That may work.

608
00:47:47,203 --> 00:47:50,464
As far as the governance structure goes in elections,

609
00:47:51,918 --> 00:47:56,500
If there's no one running, you just simply certify it through the principal's office that we only have so many people.

610
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:08,285
But you've gotta let people know because, I mean, one of the complaints that we heard, rightly or wrongly, I'm not taking sides on this thing, was that people didn't know how you become an officer, how you participate.

611
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,627
And theoretically, under the school council, you're supposed to have that election every year.

612
00:48:13,248 --> 00:48:16,089
It's required by the statute.

613
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:18,870
Now, I know it doesn't always happen 100%, but it should.

614
00:48:20,491 --> 00:48:21,011
You know what I mean?

615
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:31,758
Or at least there should be some declaration that the only people that applied for these offices or want to do it are a handful of people, but after a reasonable attempt.

616
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:36,361
I think we've got to do that, or else people say, well, I'm not involved.

617
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:37,181
I don't get involved.

618
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:38,302
They don't consult me.

619
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,302
I mean, what's part of the discussion?

620
00:48:40,362 --> 00:48:41,343
Are people consulted?

621
00:48:41,363 --> 00:48:42,943
Do they have a chance to participate?

622
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:48,464
I mean, one of the issues I think you raised during the campaign was community engagement.

623
00:48:48,544 --> 00:48:52,545
Well, does the PTO engage the community that it represents?

624
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:54,205
I don't know.

625
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:55,425
I think there's a balance there.

626
00:48:55,445 --> 00:49:06,768
I don't think we have to make it into a very rigorous process, but I do think there should be some notification that there are officers available, there are board positions available.

627
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:08,128
Would you like to participate?

628
00:49:09,428 --> 00:49:09,889
Just a thought.

629
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:11,350
Can I continue?

630
00:49:12,511 --> 00:49:21,858
I do think the sort of slightly off that topic, the issue of other 501c3s, I mean, I think about like the Medford Education Foundation.

631
00:49:22,118 --> 00:49:25,941
I mean, they are about Medford public schools.

632
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:30,924
There's like Friends of Baseball, Friends of Rowing, Friends of that do a lot.

633
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:33,046
But we don't want the MEF to have to go through this.

634
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:34,407
Or do we?

635
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:34,847
I don't.

636
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:50,298
We do okay, so that kind of gets back to my very first kind of question I didn't ask yet was so The PTOs were not consulted for this Correct.

637
00:49:51,378 --> 00:50:02,482
I mean, no, we haven't done a wide sweep on that So, I mean, I just feel like that this should at least That they should be part of the conversation on What would work?

638
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:17,053
make a motion this be tabled pending or send to a subcommittee if you I'd like to make a motion this be sent to the is it the rules subcommittee I'm on support services so I would certainly be happy to send it there that's okay

639
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:33,967
Your motion, I guess I'd like to make a motion to send this to support services to create forms that are appropriate.

640
00:50:34,568 --> 00:50:38,309
Subcommittee, let's you know, let's let's understand what these subcommittees are supposed to do.

641
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:42,690
Support services deals primarily with services that support the educational program.

642
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,872
This is more rules of this is more of the rules of the operation.

643
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:56,294
You know, I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to clarify it for you because I mean, if you want to keep some integrity to your subcommittee assignments, you can do what you want.

644
00:50:56,454 --> 00:51:03,679
I mean, but I'll I'd like to make a motion to send this to the rules subcommittee on the motion as seconded by Miss Van de Kloet.

645
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:05,560
Did you also wish to comment prior to calling?

646
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,521
I did miss Van de Kloet.

647
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:11,965
So I have first the first thing I wanted to suggest or say that

648
00:51:13,105 --> 00:51:19,070
It also included all of those booster clubs or Athletic support groups as well.

649
00:51:21,032 --> 00:51:27,037
I Think September 1st is a bad day to pick Because it's you know often Labor Day weekend.

650
00:51:27,157 --> 00:51:30,500
I think it would make more sense to change it to September 15th or September 30th Okay

651
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:41,408
I understand that you're in financial support, saying the relative wealth of where they stand.

652
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:52,979
However, I get really uncomfortable, and you and I have had this discussion many times, when you start wanting to sound like Mr. Superintendent, micromanage who's going to go to what bank and whatever.

653
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:53,800
Can't do that.

654
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:55,081
Okay?

655
00:51:55,141 --> 00:51:56,062
We just can't do that.

656
00:51:56,202 --> 00:51:56,983
We understand.

657
00:51:57,263 --> 00:52:02,366
And if you were seeing all of them and you wanted to draw people together and have a discussion, that's be one thing.

658
00:52:02,726 --> 00:52:18,337
But I get really uncomfortable with the thought that you're going to tell the Medford Educational Foundation, or of which I, you know, belong, or a McGlynn PTO member or Columbus whatever, that, well, they can't have that fundraiser because somebody else is doing it.

659
00:52:18,777 --> 00:52:24,301
So I just want to put that out there and say, it makes me real nervous when you went down that path.

660
00:52:24,922 --> 00:52:26,243
And I don't think it's appropriate.

661
00:52:27,364 --> 00:52:34,970
I think when you get to number six, expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal slash administration or whatever.

662
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,452
Because for instance, the Medford Educational Foundation,

663
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:41,627
We have a principal sign-off sheet.

664
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:52,455
However, we've been known to work closely with administration to make sure that we are, in fact, not funding a program that would not be appropriate.

665
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:59,280
And when I spoke up before, I do believe that the Educational Foundation would, in fact, benefit from something.

666
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,486
Because we are a 501c3, and I think everybody who is a 501c this, you are required to have bylaws.

667
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:09,008
Now, how formally you play them out is another thing.

668
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:12,591
But somewhere in your organization, at some point, you have had bylaws.

669
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:15,753
Because if you're a 501c3, you needed to have that.

670
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:21,358
You needed to specify how the offices worked.

671
00:53:21,738 --> 00:53:30,085
So even though, Paul, I understand what you're saying and your concerns, some of that actually is called for by the nonprofit status.

672
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:37,413
any way otherwise than that I think that we can send it to send it off but those were some of my initial concerns.

673
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:38,637
Thank you.

674
00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:39,880
Mister zero.

675
00:53:41,278 --> 00:53:43,679
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for putting this forward.

676
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:56,304
I'd like to, seeing that we're sending this to subcommittee, I just want to add another item that we draft material that can be used to help these groups, maybe like a sample bylaws could be set up, not that anyone has to follow, but just like a template.

677
00:53:56,904 --> 00:54:05,968
We have a recommended set of best practices that we could put to maybe a binder that we could put together for different PTOs just to help them have the best process possible.

678
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,981
Yeah, I'm just making we're adding items on the list, right?

679
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:30,113
We're at nines If I could just from the chair item two, I think it goes back to your question All registered organizations must submit bylaws names of officers and board members and then it says the annual fundraising Expenditure plans if that could just be an annual budget And at the end

680
00:54:32,987 --> 00:54:36,751
in a year-end financial statement, including the Form 990 in state filings.

681
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:43,838
You have to do it to be a 990, to be a 501c3, you have to file with the state, and you also have to file with the IRS.

682
00:54:44,378 --> 00:54:47,522
So why not make it part of the package at the end of the year, they submit it to us.

683
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:51,586
And then we have, everything's copacetic as far as filings.

684
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:57,809
So if we could send this document as amended to the Rules Committee, which Ms.

685
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:59,270
Kretz will chair this year.

686
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,771
There's a second on the floor by Ms.

687
00:55:01,811 --> 00:55:02,492
Van de Kloot.

688
00:55:02,612 --> 00:55:04,133
Motion by Mr. Russo.

689
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:05,133
All those in favor?

690
00:55:05,153 --> 00:55:05,213
Aye.

691
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:06,814
All those opposed?

692
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:08,135
Motion has it.

693
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:11,097
Do you want me to list the amendments that were just now?

694
00:55:12,658 --> 00:55:13,098
You're all good?

695
00:55:13,178 --> 00:55:13,258
OK.

696
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:18,882
Why don't we get it from the minutes and then we'll move it over.

697
00:55:20,102 --> 00:55:20,243
Ms.

698
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:20,663
Van de Kloot.

699
00:55:25,175 --> 00:55:30,761
Are there any PTGs out there that would like to speak on this topic?

700
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:33,744
Certainly, if you'd like to step forward.

701
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:53,929
Your name and address, please, for our record.

702
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,450
My name is Louis Perdomo.

703
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,951
I live at 44 Washington Street.

704
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:03,296
Just on your comment, I'm sorry, I can't see your name.

705
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:03,736
Mr. Russo.

706
00:56:03,836 --> 00:56:15,584
Mr. Russo, on your comment on the sort of three, when there's three members at a time, and they're always there at all times, and usually nobody else joins as you'll use those three people.

707
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:17,366
The problem with that is,

708
00:56:19,152 --> 00:56:20,552
that they're not engaged in the community.

709
00:56:21,193 --> 00:56:27,115
When there's three people all the time, that means those three people are not doing whatever they're volunteered for.

710
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:31,136
So they're not, in a sense, engaged in the community.

711
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:37,178
So in the sense of looking for that, when you see just three people there all the time and nothing is being done,

712
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:40,801
That's when you sort of say, okay, what are you guys really doing?

713
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:43,163
And that's sort of for the comment that you were saying.

714
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:45,205
It's like, why do these people need the training or all this stuff?

715
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:51,011
Well, maybe they do need training to actually address those deficiencies.

716
00:56:51,852 --> 00:56:54,094
That, yeah, they're not engaging, they're not talking.

717
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:59,660
Because I've been a parent from the McGlynn School, and I really,

718
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:07,984
I cannot recall the one time that somebody from the PTG approached me and said, hey, listen, you're a parent.

719
00:57:08,544 --> 00:57:09,985
Would you like to join this organization?

720
00:57:10,705 --> 00:57:12,686
And that's why I'm sort of saying this now.

721
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:13,486
Thank you.

722
00:57:13,526 --> 00:57:15,347
Thank you.

723
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:19,429
Is there anyone else that would like to speak?

724
00:57:23,536 --> 00:57:25,857
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again, 281 Park Street.

725
00:57:26,597 --> 00:57:29,078
I am an active member of my PTO.

726
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:34,841
No one personally approached me, but I can tell you that my PTO sends constant flyers.

727
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:37,702
They have events almost monthly.

728
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:39,143
Every PTO does this.

729
00:57:39,243 --> 00:57:40,884
We have Facebook pages.

730
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:42,865
Some of us have Twitter accounts.

731
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,986
We make every effort to have people join.

732
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:47,747
I'm not a board member on a PTO.

733
00:57:47,907 --> 00:57:49,648
I went to a PTO meeting and I

734
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:58,937
raised my hand and volunteered, I've added programming to my PTO on a voluntary basis and people do the best that they can.

735
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:10,670
I've gone to meetings where there's been three people and I know for a fact that a flyer's gone out, that a flyer's been on the window at the school, that we've posted it on our Facebook page and there's three people there.

736
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:16,854
And that's not because we're not engaging our community, because we have signs up at every event that things are going on.

737
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:18,014
We send out emails.

738
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,696
There's only so much that you can do, but you have to be realistic.

739
00:58:22,176 --> 00:58:26,178
When I had my first child, I worked full time and I did not volunteer at the PTO.

740
00:58:26,218 --> 00:58:27,839
I did not have the time or the bandwidth.

741
00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:37,669
I'm lucky now that I can and I do, and I appreciate that a lot of people are not able to do that, and I don't think that we should be disparaging people on either side.

742
00:58:37,689 --> 00:58:39,551
People that do have the time to volunteer, great.

743
00:58:39,832 --> 00:58:42,274
People that don't, you know, that's fine too.

744
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:44,016
We're here for all of the children.

745
00:58:44,136 --> 00:58:46,098
We do fundraising for every child.

746
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:52,501
all the schools and we're not singling out and go oh Johnny's mother didn't help so he doesn't get a t-shirt on field day.

747
00:58:52,761 --> 00:58:58,863
So I think we need to remember that and I hope that some of your recommendations will include ways to help some of our PTOs.

748
00:58:59,383 --> 00:59:07,526
Especially those of us that are in high needs districts, high needs areas where our parents do work two jobs or our parents don't speak English.

749
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:15,695
are they have special needs children they have to attend to or they have three or four children and packing those kids up and coming to a PTO meeting is impossible.

750
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:21,843
We even tried to do our meetings on Facebook live and it didn't it didn't increase our attendance.

751
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:25,307
So we're all doing the best that we can and I hope that

752
00:59:25,787 --> 00:59:39,173
The district is able to help us because from year to year, some PTOs find that it's really hard for them to afford that $8,000 to $10,000 that we need for the buses or that field day event or that in-school enrichment and we do the best that we can.

753
00:59:39,513 --> 00:59:48,717
Sometimes you run a fundraiser and you think you're going to make $1,000 and you make $500 and you have to add another fundraiser on the fly because you're not going to cover those bills at the end of the year.

754
00:59:49,578 --> 00:59:49,798
Thanks.

755
00:59:53,026 --> 01:00:11,713
It would be a shame if this conversation ended with any thought that we're not appreciative of the extraordinarily hard work of our PTOs, PTGs, booster clubs, and any other organization that gives up their time and effort to raise money for our students.

756
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:33,433
I know from experience, I know from my time on the school committee and before that how hard people work and how often it is a very small group of people in the end who really bust their butt night after night making sure that all of the money is raised, that the kids get the opportunities.

757
01:00:33,894 --> 01:00:35,916
And so I just think that it's really important

758
01:00:36,456 --> 01:00:51,801
You know, many of you won't remember this, and the only two maybe in the room right now might be the superintendent and Diane Caldwell, remember that before I was on the school committee, one of the things that I did was an event called It's Your Night to Shine.

759
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:57,903
And that was a thank you to all the volunteers, all the PTO members who busted their butts,

760
01:00:58,543 --> 01:01:07,347
Because way back then, as someone who was just beginning in all of this, it was so clear to me that there were a few people who just kept things going.

761
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:15,311
And they were all, blessedly, that it's always somehow worked out that we have a group of parents at each and every school who will take this.

762
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:20,253
And sometimes it's because the void, they see that no one else is there and they step in and they make it happen.

763
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:22,494
So within all of this in this discussion,

764
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:38,562
By putting in something like this, ultimately the desire is not to just oversee and enforce and say you have to do one more thing, but to be helpful, to be positive, and always to say thank you so much for the work that you do.

765
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:41,183
Very good.

766
01:01:42,564 --> 01:01:43,845
Mr. Benedetto on this topic.

767
01:01:44,106 --> 01:01:44,907
Yes, thank you.

768
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:51,513
So on our agenda on the back page, there's a listing of reports that we've asked for.

769
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:59,462
And if you look under requested reports, the first one was a report on PTOs, including how they're helping the community and what they are working on.

770
01:01:59,522 --> 01:02:01,804
And that was requested last April, April of 2017.

771
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:17,156
Now, it needs to be amended because when we spoke at our committee meeting recently, the superintendent said that he is planning to have all the PTOs come before the school committee between the month of April and May.

772
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:21,679
So I would like that amended, that line item.

773
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:44,442
And the goal that I had when I requested that last April was to bring the pre-TOs forward to celebrate the things that they have done for the school district and to bring them forward so the rest of the community knows, like, hey, at the McGlynn, this is some of the things they've run, and they've run it for 10 years, and the kids still love it, or, you know.

774
01:02:45,623 --> 01:02:52,205
you know, second graders get to go to the science museum and the PTOs throughout the district have paid for the buses.

775
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:54,165
Let's celebrate some of these things.

776
01:02:54,225 --> 01:03:00,587
And that was my goal back in April because I just felt like less people have less time to do that.

777
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:07,048
And they're so involved with trying to get by and things are a little harder for families now or they're busier.

778
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:12,949
And it was just a way to bring them in to celebrate the work and the time and the effort they did.

779
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:14,930
My history,

780
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:17,709
has been started as a PTO.

781
01:03:20,051 --> 01:03:22,912
president, co-president with Ian Ricucci, who is amazing.

782
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:26,753
And I had a big mouth then, and I wasn't ready to be quiet.

783
01:03:26,793 --> 01:03:28,614
So that's why I ran for school committee.

784
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:30,454
And I'm here in front of you now.

785
01:03:30,694 --> 01:03:35,216
And didn't run until my youngest graduated, because I felt like I had a big voice as a parent.

786
01:03:35,676 --> 01:03:36,816
And you all have a big voice.

787
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:38,077
Everybody has a voice.

788
01:03:38,377 --> 01:03:39,517
Show up at these meetings.

789
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:40,938
Say what you need to say.

790
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:43,358
Ask us for what you need and what your children need.

791
01:03:43,658 --> 01:03:44,799
That's what we're here for.

792
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:47,780
And we need to celebrate the people who have volunteered

793
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:55,864
done so much already and before we ask them to do more, we need to show them that we do care and we are here to help support you.

794
01:03:57,005 --> 01:04:14,835
So I just want to applaud the people here tonight and encourage more people in the community to come forward and ask the superintendent to amend that piece so that way we do have the PTOs come in April and May of 2018 and we should invite the press.

795
01:04:15,535 --> 01:04:20,422
So that they get a list of all the wonderful things that have been happening, not only this year, but years past as well.

796
01:04:20,802 --> 01:04:24,488
I think I think it's time to celebrate some of the happenings in our community.

797
01:04:24,868 --> 01:04:26,851
So that's my request, Madam Mayor.

798
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:27,312
Thank you.

799
01:04:27,332 --> 01:04:29,675
Thank you, Miss Wright.

800
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:36,728
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson and School Committee.

801
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:40,170
I'm Jane Wright, treasurer of the McGlynn Elementary PTG.

802
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:50,815
I was not planning on speaking tonight after last Tuesday's school committee meeting when Superintendent Belson reported there was no malfeasance found in the finances of the McGlynn Elementary PTG.

803
01:04:51,856 --> 01:04:56,478
However, Mr. Ruggiero continues to perpetrate lies and misunderstandings on social media.

804
01:04:57,929 --> 01:05:06,014
I had anticipated after last week's meetings that there would be an effort to move forward with Superintendent Belson's recommendations, as reported out in his findings.

805
01:05:06,914 --> 01:05:08,035
I look forward to that effort.

806
01:05:08,775 --> 01:05:18,501
However, it seems that Mr. Ruggiero feels compelled to continue waging an assault on my integrity and the PTG, notwithstanding the superintendent's findings and recommendations.

807
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:29,101
Last Friday night, Mr. Egeri wrote on Facebook how going to the press was, I quote, a hard choice on how to alert the public to lost donation money.

808
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:36,507
There was no lost donation money, for if there was, it would have been reported in the investigation into the finances.

809
01:05:37,862 --> 01:05:44,446
At last Tuesday's meeting, I refuted Mr. Ruggiero's numerous quotes on how he tried to contact me many times over the course of a month.

810
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:48,108
I produced my cell phone records from October 1st, 2017 until January 13th, 2018.

811
01:05:48,168 --> 01:05:50,309
Mr. Ruggiero called me once on December 14th.

812
01:05:56,390 --> 01:06:03,838
Still, as he posted last Friday night, he is continuing to claim he made numerous calls, now texts, and Facebook messages.

813
01:06:04,939 --> 01:06:14,349
I received one call from Mr. Agero on December 14th, and no other attempts were made by Mr. Agero to contact me or anyone else on the board.

814
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:28,837
On the phone, Mr. Agero did not speak with me in a strong way, nor did he say that he had financial concerns that he needed to talk with me about regarding the PTG, as he asserted in one of his recent posts.

815
01:06:29,897 --> 01:06:37,381
As I said at last week's meeting, if I knew people were questioning the finances, I would have met with them that night, and I would not be here again.

816
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:47,952
At no time prior to December 22nd, when one mother asked me about the financials, was I approached to discuss the PTG finances.

817
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:56,680
And yet, the article came out a few days later, alleging, as Mr. Gero still claims, I was asked multiple times about financials.

818
01:06:57,561 --> 01:07:03,127
This is simply not true, and I have made my phone records readily available to substantiate the fact.

819
01:07:04,903 --> 01:07:12,009
I rescheduled one meeting on December 28th, not a whole host of meetings, as was written by Mr. Agiro.

820
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:18,074
Even though I rescheduled that meeting, I sent that information to be shared via email.

821
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:23,959
Mr. Agiro continues to post about the bylaws the parent asked for multiple times.

822
01:07:24,826 --> 01:07:30,932
Yes, they should have been made available sooner and I take full responsibility for that error.

823
01:07:31,693 --> 01:07:37,039
In fact, I apologized to the parents in our December meeting before the transcript article was published.

824
01:07:38,366 --> 01:07:47,154
Further, the current executive board had began discussing how the bylaws need to be amended, even before we heard the Superintendent Belson's suggestion in his report.

825
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:51,097
We look forward to incorporating Superintendent's recommendations.

826
01:07:51,998 --> 01:07:58,024
Bylaws were not mentioned in my speech when I addressed Mr. Giro's accusations and defamations.

827
01:08:00,058 --> 01:08:03,723
Mr. Jarrell claims that the PTG buried the fine for late taxes.

828
01:08:04,443 --> 01:08:06,846
However, the executive board at the time did not.

829
01:08:07,527 --> 01:08:11,292
It was reported immediately to the principal of the school who is no longer there.

830
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,977
We paid the penalties and have been in compliance ever since.

831
01:08:16,598 --> 01:08:24,520
Mr. Ruggiero is now claiming on social media that all of this went down before he was sworn in, and he therefore was acting as an ordinary citizen.

832
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:31,422
If that were true, he would not have introduced himself to me on the phone as Mr. Ruggiero, Medford School Committee member.

833
01:08:32,822 --> 01:08:43,565
The transcript article on December 26, 2017 was titled, New School Committee Member, Parents Raise Questions About McGlynn Elementary PTG.

834
01:08:45,215 --> 01:08:56,826
The transcript editors wrote on Friday, if newspapers fail to report on statements and actions made by our elected officials, whom we vote for, and whose salaries we pay in taxes, everybody loses.

835
01:08:57,847 --> 01:09:03,433
Mr. Ruggiero was identifying himself and acting as a school committee member despite not being sworn in yet.

836
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:17,220
Part of the role of the school committee for the Medford Public Schools is to vote to set the policy, set the budget, and hire the superintendent and evaluate his or her work for the Medford Public Schools.

837
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:31,105
Whether he was acting as a school committee member or member elect is utterly inappropriate for him to publicly berate and single out a member of the PTG, especially when based on unfounded accusations and misinformation.

838
01:09:32,202 --> 01:09:40,428
Even after the investigation's findings of no malfeasance, he continues to perpetuate the lies and misinformation on social media as recently as Friday.

839
01:09:41,989 --> 01:09:52,898
Mr. Ruggiero seems to want it both ways, running for cover as an ordinary citizen when criticized for his handling of the situation and then asserting as a public official he has a duty to get involved.

840
01:09:54,519 --> 01:09:58,182
As a public official, doesn't he have an obligation to set all the community

841
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:14,348
Doesn't he have an obligation to all in the community to set an example and exercise sound judgment and ensure that which he elevates as a public concern is carefully reviewed before making unfounded accusations and personally attacking individuals in the community?

842
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:24,063
I would like to also make you aware of a parent among Mr. Ruggiero's group who sent a threatening and harassing email to our president last Friday morning.

843
01:10:24,884 --> 01:10:27,084
I have copies of that email here for you to review.

844
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:42,529
In this email, despite the discussions and recommendations last week, this father continues to berate the PTG and threatens to call the school department officials and the Medford transcript if his demands are not met and on his timeline.

845
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:57,057
I think that we are in agreement there are improvements that can and should be made and I and the rest of the PTG board look forward to making those improvements with the administration in updating the bylaws and reporting procedures.

846
01:10:57,997 --> 01:11:05,741
However, in the meantime, it is concerning that we continue to be threatened and harassed by parents who are unwilling to accept that there was no malfeasance.

847
01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:15,320
Again, we are all volunteers doing the best that we can to plan, facilitate, and staff events and fundraisers for all of the students in our school.

848
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,462
Being threatened and harassed is unacceptable and it is counterproductive.

849
01:11:21,503 --> 01:11:32,649
I thank you for your time again this evening and hope that this matter can move on to more productive discourse and results and benefits for all stakeholders, most especially our students and teachers.

850
01:11:33,129 --> 01:11:33,549
Thank you, Ms.

851
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:33,750
Wright.

852
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,090
Thank you.

853
01:11:40,393 --> 01:11:47,223
So this statement will not change any minds those that know me in my commitment to transparency already know my work ethic I

854
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:48,922
I shall try my best.

855
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:49,943
We're having trouble hearing you.

856
01:11:50,003 --> 01:11:50,643
Oh, excuse me.

857
01:11:50,683 --> 01:11:51,503
I'll speak a little louder.

858
01:11:52,503 --> 01:11:54,384
This statement will not change any minds.

859
01:11:55,284 --> 01:12:00,105
Those that know me and my commitment to transparency already know my work ethic.

860
01:12:00,706 --> 01:12:07,267
For the rest, I shall try my best to open my heart and write as honestly as I can about this situation.

861
01:12:08,148 --> 01:12:08,688
Words matter.

862
01:12:09,668 --> 01:12:13,350
I've spent the past few weeks meditating on the words I've settled upon.

863
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:17,752
I've prayed to help me see any terrible mistake that I might have made.

864
01:12:18,772 --> 01:12:25,976
I've spent sleepless nights rereading the article in the transcript and my quotes in them and searching my motivations.

865
01:12:27,737 --> 01:12:31,319
While I now have access to

866
01:12:33,304 --> 01:12:42,806
more means of dealing with these situations in the future as a school committee member, as a private citizen from the bottom of my heart, I really, I regret nothing.

867
01:12:43,907 --> 01:12:44,487
Here's why.

868
01:12:45,787 --> 01:12:52,209
I want to live in a city where every resident is free to challenge those in positions of power, even me.

869
01:12:53,457 --> 01:13:00,780
It may seem like a silly thing to believe that a treasurer or a president of a PTG occupies a position of power, but they do.

870
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:08,163
Every group that works inside of our schools and inside of our city government occupies a position of power.

871
01:13:09,063 --> 01:13:16,928
As a candidate, I came across a $6,092 mistake that many, many people did not know about.

872
01:13:18,049 --> 01:13:29,176
While I appreciate the treasurer's statement that she made the community aware, it seems that the issue was buried, in my opinion.

873
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:41,218
This mistake should have been reported to the parents of Medford in 2014 when it happened, and not just maybe a small group of members of the PTG, but to the wider community at all.

874
01:13:43,194 --> 01:13:47,897
To my knowledge, neither Roy Belson nor many, many of the other parents knew about their losses of their donations.

875
01:13:48,197 --> 01:13:59,105
So after great deliberation with many of the parents involved, thinking about what kind of example we wanted to set our children, we decided to report the Ed Rarer to the people of Medford.

876
01:14:00,006 --> 01:14:08,411
I never once labeled any member of the McGlynn PTG a crook or a criminal or a monster.

877
01:14:09,572 --> 01:14:17,515
As a matter of fact, I never mentioned any names in any of the correspondence that we had in the transcript.

878
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:27,059
In my heart, I knew that hard-earned money was wasted, and the people of Medford deserve to know, so we called for transparency.

879
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:35,822
To the undecided in this room, I ask you, did you elect me to stay silent when I found evidence that money was wasted?

880
01:14:36,282 --> 01:14:37,923
Would you have preferred that I stand mute?

881
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:47,189
If I find evidence that our schools have not used money properly, I'm going to speak up.

882
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:53,459
I serve at your pleasure, but I forever stand as a fierce defender of the values I cherish and the city I love.

883
01:14:54,876 --> 01:15:00,181
The treasurer and the president of McGlynn PTG seem convinced that they run a tight ship.

884
01:15:00,721 --> 01:15:01,402
God bless them.

885
01:15:01,782 --> 01:15:05,986
They have worked very hard, and I appreciate all the time they have invested.

886
01:15:06,506 --> 01:15:07,807
But here are the facts.

887
01:15:08,688 --> 01:15:12,392
The laws of their group demand they present financial information when asked.

888
01:15:12,872 --> 01:15:13,392
They didn't.

889
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:20,399
The laws of their group demand they keep their rules and their ledgers handy at every meeting.

890
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:21,580
Didn't happen.

891
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:26,156
Their rules require a budget at the beginning of the year, but it wasn't provided.

892
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:29,780
Mothers felt belittled and humiliated.

893
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,202
How dare parents ask questions, eh?

894
01:15:33,374 --> 01:15:41,196
I have no doubt that every single parent at the McGlynn PTG loved the children and want to help our city grow.

895
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:45,338
Nonetheless, you can't play fast and loose with the rules.

896
01:15:46,378 --> 01:15:51,179
You would think that after stumbling into such a chasm with the IRS, people would be a little more cautious.

897
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:52,780
Those are the facts.

898
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:58,642
But before you go, I think it's really time we can move forward.

899
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:00,883
There's a great proposal on the table here.

900
01:16:02,243 --> 01:16:04,704
Parents will have financial information now when they're asked.

901
01:16:05,064 --> 01:16:09,566
Our school committees will work to help parent groups become as effective as possible.

902
01:16:10,186 --> 01:16:11,326
Training will be provided.

903
01:16:12,146 --> 01:16:14,747
Never again will thousands of dollars be lost into a hole.

904
01:16:17,028 --> 01:16:19,809
I think this is an exciting time and I think we have a great proposal here.

905
01:16:20,807 --> 01:16:25,330
And I hope everyone on both sides of this issue look forward to moving.

906
01:16:26,671 --> 01:16:26,971
Thank you.

907
01:16:27,352 --> 01:16:27,712
Thank you.

908
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:28,693
Ms.

909
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:30,634
Vander Kloot.

910
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:41,122
Mr. Ruggiero, as a new colleague, I want you to know that I have no doubt at all that you meant no harm.

911
01:16:42,534 --> 01:16:49,255
that you meant to be speaking up for parents and, in fact, were responding to parents' requests.

912
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:50,335
I know that.

913
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:54,776
And I know that you did it thinking that you were doing the very best thing.

914
01:16:55,056 --> 01:16:58,297
I have no, absolutely no doubt about that at all.

915
01:16:58,877 --> 01:17:00,537
I don't think you meant to be heavy-handed.

916
01:17:00,577 --> 01:17:03,198
I don't think you meant to be, cause this uproar.

917
01:17:03,378 --> 01:17:04,218
I don't think so at all.

918
01:17:05,278 --> 01:17:08,599
I do think you were inexperienced and, frankly, you learned.

919
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:14,227
Because you see, you know that it's caused great upset.

920
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:16,928
That was very evident the other night.

921
01:17:19,409 --> 01:17:25,532
We agree that we've now got some new things that have come out of this maybe and maybe that's all for the better.

922
01:17:26,112 --> 01:17:27,853
But there were some really hurt feelings.

923
01:17:30,274 --> 01:17:31,714
The treasurer has asked for an apology.

924
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:37,577
Saying I'm sorry doesn't cost you anything and it would help to move on.

925
01:17:39,325 --> 01:17:46,210
I understand that you didn't mean to hurt, but frankly, you did.

926
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:47,411
It happened.

927
01:17:48,391 --> 01:17:49,092
It's happened to me.

928
01:17:50,173 --> 01:17:51,914
I didn't mean to, but it did.

929
01:17:52,394 --> 01:17:53,195
And I said, I'm sorry.

930
01:17:54,035 --> 01:18:03,382
Sometimes those two little words are just the easiest thing to say if they're heartfelt and meant, because I truly believe, I truly believe that you meant no harm.

931
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,018
I look forward to working with you.

932
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:11,440
I look forward to figuring out what it means to be a team.

933
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,441
You and I have already had some discussions about personal styles, whatever.

934
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:20,864
And, you know, in my view, it is time to move on.

935
01:18:21,184 --> 01:18:24,045
But in order for that to happen, you need to say something.

936
01:18:29,127 --> 01:18:30,749
Hi, my name is Bailey Shindell.

937
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:32,730
I live at 46 Washington Street.

938
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:36,374
I am a parent of a kindergartener at the McGlynn School.

939
01:18:36,994 --> 01:18:45,963
At the beginning of this year, I started going to PTG meetings and was very excited about being part of the McGlynn PTG.

940
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:53,509
I've done lots of kind of community building work in the past in lots of different

941
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:59,492
forums, and so I was excited to, you know, share my skills with the PTG.

942
01:19:00,973 --> 01:19:04,414
I have, I'm just, I felt the need to speak tonight.

943
01:19:04,434 --> 01:19:12,818
I don't have anything prepared because I feel like this situation has been, I've gathered with other parents

944
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:22,301
to work with McGlynn PFTG and I feel like our position has been misrepresented in this forum.

945
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:36,585
I feel like we've been looked at as parents who came in and just tried to take over everything without listening or trying to get an idea of what the process was for participating in this organization.

946
01:19:37,965 --> 01:19:53,049
I've spent the last couple days, it's not finished yet, but putting together a timeline of how we engaged or attempted to engage with this organization that's well documented through emails and summaries of meeting.

947
01:19:53,109 --> 01:20:01,811
I mean, I basically have a practice from my experience of writing summaries after every meeting that I attend.

948
01:20:02,771 --> 01:20:04,892
So I just want to say that

949
01:20:05,412 --> 01:20:22,460
You know, we have documentation to show that each step of the way we approach and continue to approach the leadership of the McGlynn PTG and ask them to work with us and we are still being met with contention even to this day.

950
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:33,470
Um, there was, I personally felt, I mean, the most recent thing was these minutes that happened, um, from the last meeting were posted.

951
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:38,495
Um, there wasn't any process or approval of the minutes before they were posted in a public forum.

952
01:20:38,976 --> 01:20:43,961
The minutes were not representative of the meeting that we had.

953
01:20:45,402 --> 01:20:56,569
specifically like I had asked for certain information from the McGlynn leadership and that was not recorded in the minutes in any way.

954
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:07,797
I then have emailed the McGlynn leadership, again, in each email really trying to say how much I just really, still to this day,

955
01:21:08,437 --> 01:21:20,325
really want to work with this group and know by whatever process put in front of me to make changes and to provide things for our children.

956
01:21:24,107 --> 01:21:28,969
has not been responded to or my concerns have not been addressed.

957
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:43,975
Throughout this entire process, I've received conflicting information on how things are done, which then that information, after finally receiving the bylaws, was conflicted with the bylaws themselves.

958
01:21:44,215 --> 01:21:47,597
These are very concerning things that were happening.

959
01:21:48,217 --> 01:22:03,923
I also want to say that while, I mean, when we started looking at the finances, it was only because we wanted to get an understanding of what the money was being spent on, mostly so we could be like, yes, this is what they do.

960
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:14,246
told, you know, we do stuff, but we haven't, we've asked several times, like, what's, get a list of what you do.

961
01:22:14,866 --> 01:22:26,650
And we do stuff, the finances and the minutes from the meetings that I've requested several times would help me put together a better picture so I could brag about what they do when I try to promote the Glen PTG.

962
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:33,412
I don't think it's unreasonable for me to want to have a better understanding of the organization that I want to get involved in.

963
01:22:34,092 --> 01:22:45,021
And I think right now I'm speaking for myself, but I think the sentiment I'm putting forth is representative of other parents that I've been working with.

964
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:47,003
We want to grow this organization.

965
01:22:47,243 --> 01:22:50,566
We want to do great things for the McGlynn students.

966
01:22:50,606 --> 01:22:53,228
And we want to do that by working with these women.

967
01:22:55,627 --> 01:22:58,008
We need to be broadened.

968
01:22:58,248 --> 01:23:10,493
I guess that's all I... I also actually want to speak to the $6,000 mistake, and I absolutely believe it was a mistake, but I'm really concerned about the fact that

969
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:15,437
That money had to be paid out of McGlynn PTG funds.

970
01:23:15,497 --> 01:23:19,920
And McGlynn PTG funds are raised from the parents of our school.

971
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:24,825
The parents that we've already talked about not necessarily have a lot of finances.

972
01:23:24,845 --> 01:23:32,512
So I do think it's important that if we as a group are asking parents for money, that we're telling them where it's going.

973
01:23:33,552 --> 01:23:46,817
And I don't think any of the parents that bought pies in 2014, 15, whenever that fund was actually paid, like were aware that $6,000 of their money was going to pay for this mistake.

974
01:23:46,837 --> 01:23:51,119
And I think that's a fair thing for them to have knowledge of.

975
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:52,799
Thank you so much.

976
01:23:53,219 --> 01:23:53,600
Thank you.

977
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,580
I'm going to respond briefly.

978
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,722
On the motion, this has been, is there another individual that would like to speak?

979
01:24:04,391 --> 01:24:23,829
My name is Carrie cropper, I'm at 61 Dudley Street, and I was also one of the kindergarten parents I Wanted to say that we keep getting referred to as for kindergarten parents that makes me sound like I'm not knowledgeable three of the kindergarten parents own their own businesses we are

980
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:26,811
well aware of how finances should work.

981
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:34,152
Anyone here is going to say it's just as important what comes out of the kitty as what goes in and that was the question we were asked.

982
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:49,675
When Bailey was just talking about the meeting minutes to ask or to put in the meeting minutes that I asked about pizzas I think is not a fair representation of when I say what do we spend our money on for expenses for fundraisers.

983
01:24:53,485 --> 01:25:08,433
I didn't get up to speak last time during our last meeting because I realized that our PTG board has every right to protect the culture of the PTG.

984
01:25:08,953 --> 01:25:14,656
And Jane had every right to speak about that she was hurt and that she was offended and she felt attacked.

985
01:25:15,236 --> 01:25:16,177
That's their right.

986
01:25:16,917 --> 01:25:20,439
It was my right and our parents' right to be given bylaws.

987
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:22,020
It was unfair.

988
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:30,481
when we asked five times over the course of 30 days, which is standard, to be given bylaws and we were not given them.

989
01:25:31,062 --> 01:25:41,063
It was unfair to stand in their presence while they held the bylaws and did not give them to us and said, we're not sure if this is the correct version, we will get back to you.

990
01:25:41,384 --> 01:25:42,624
That was unfair.

991
01:25:45,164 --> 01:25:48,285
Since then, we've seen that the bylaws are not always what we're told.

992
01:25:49,376 --> 01:25:54,898
The night that they held the bylaws and didn't give them to us, we clarified, what are our voting rights?

993
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:58,860
And we were told, you don't have voting rights.

994
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:02,281
You have the right to vote us into the board.

995
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:05,762
We will listen to what you have to say.

996
01:26:06,482 --> 01:26:08,443
But you don't have voting rights.

997
01:26:12,845 --> 01:26:13,725
This is America.

998
01:26:13,785 --> 01:26:15,046
It's a democracy, right?

999
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:17,226
Like, we should have some sort of voting rights.

1000
01:26:20,595 --> 01:26:27,423
Bailey asked after that meeting, and we got the bylaws, it clearly says, at least by our interpretation, that we should have some voting rights.

1001
01:26:28,004 --> 01:26:32,809
It said there should be a budget, anything outside of that budget, we get to vote on.

1002
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,353
And that's what we have been fighting for.

1003
01:26:38,803 --> 01:26:47,671
You guys don't know me, but my family, my mom was a commission human rights relation person for 25 years for the state of Delaware.

1004
01:26:48,071 --> 01:26:50,614
And my dad is a retired police officer.

1005
01:26:51,134 --> 01:26:52,996
I grew up in a family of civil service.

1006
01:26:53,677 --> 01:26:55,338
And I've never stood up and talked.

1007
01:26:55,538 --> 01:26:56,699
It's not who I am.

1008
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:06,284
But I find myself angry and standing up and unable to sit down because I feel like this is not what it's about.

1009
01:27:06,865 --> 01:27:08,765
It's about doing this for our kids.

1010
01:27:08,946 --> 01:27:14,668
And if, when was the last time you were at a meeting and the two people beside you said, I will get in and help.

1011
01:27:15,149 --> 01:27:16,389
I will build you a website.

1012
01:27:16,409 --> 01:27:23,813
I will throw some fundraisers and pay for them out of my pocket and grow this community that is the McGlynn and we really can be great.

1013
01:27:24,433 --> 01:27:27,135
And you look around at Medford, and we all chose to be here.

1014
01:27:27,496 --> 01:27:29,397
We chose to be parents at the McGlynn.

1015
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:32,580
We all, if you talk to us, we all looked at private schools.

1016
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:36,223
We all talked about, well, maybe we'll petition to go to the Roberts.

1017
01:27:36,283 --> 01:27:37,103
We live closer.

1018
01:27:37,123 --> 01:27:39,646
And we chose the McGlynn.

1019
01:27:39,726 --> 01:27:42,047
So I don't think I should be maligned because

1020
01:27:43,545 --> 01:27:48,809
I need to buck up under this is the way it's always been and this is the way it will always be.

1021
01:27:49,990 --> 01:28:03,582
Medford as a city is energetic and it's changing and it's a really exciting place to live and I think looking at these PTG laws and moving forward with them, it would be a really, you know, I'm just excited about it.

1022
01:28:03,782 --> 01:28:05,924
I feel like it's a good starting place.

1023
01:28:06,744 --> 01:28:10,147
My only request is maybe you can also

1024
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:24,219
You could also encourage a mission statement for these groups that does not strictly say it is a top-down policy, but that it is also a bottom-up listening structure.

1025
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:25,160
Thank you.

1026
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:25,760
Thank you.

1027
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,101
We're going to move this.

1028
01:28:28,281 --> 01:28:30,001
We have a lot on our agenda tonight.

1029
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:33,583
Thank you so much for being here and giving your side.

1030
01:28:34,403 --> 01:28:36,324
And we certainly will move forward with the committee on rules.

1031
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:39,505
The subcommittee will be looking at the policy and procedures going forward.

1032
01:28:40,754 --> 01:28:43,415
next item up is item seven negotiations and legal matters.

1033
01:28:43,495 --> 01:28:46,695
I asked someone to move suspension of the rules to move to the end of the agenda.

1034
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:49,056
Mr Russo, seconded by Mr Benedetto.

1035
01:28:49,136 --> 01:28:49,936
All those in favor?

1036
01:28:50,876 --> 01:28:51,677
All those opposed?

1037
01:28:52,017 --> 01:28:53,377
Negotiations will be at the end.

1038
01:28:54,257 --> 01:28:59,758
Old business recommendation to adopt USDA revised required school lunch charge policy.

1039
01:29:00,379 --> 01:29:06,500
As you know, in our committee of the whole last week, we asked Miss Patterson to make a few more adjustments to the policy.

1040
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,461
Tonight we have with us the final version, Mr Superintendent.

1041
01:29:12,202 --> 01:29:19,084
I believe we made the adjustments you asked for the amounts of thresholds in the area, so I'd ask that you approve it.

1042
01:29:20,924 --> 01:29:24,986
Is there a motion on the floor for approval offered by Miss Mustone, seconded by Miss Kretz?

1043
01:29:25,806 --> 01:29:31,848
Roll call vote on the policy change.

1044
01:29:31,888 --> 01:29:36,830
We announced them in the Committee of the Whole and we'll publish the policy online as well.

1045
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:43,986
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1046
01:29:44,006 --> 01:29:45,848
Motion passes.

1047
01:29:56,877 --> 01:30:07,760
Also, during our Committee of the Whole, we voted in Executive Session to adopt a wage increase for our sub-cafeteria workers who are currently being paid $11 per hour.

1048
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:10,180
It will go up to $13 per hour.

1049
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:15,122
That paper has been moved out of Executive Committee and is before the body to adopt.

1050
01:30:16,422 --> 01:30:17,542
Motion for approval by Ms.

1051
01:30:17,582 --> 01:30:18,743
Vander Kloot, seconded by Ms.

1052
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:19,243
Mustone.

1053
01:30:19,263 --> 01:30:20,123
Roll call vote, please.

1054
01:30:21,766 --> 01:30:21,906
Yes.

1055
01:30:22,026 --> 01:30:26,553
Negative motion passes.

1056
01:30:36,994 --> 01:30:40,418
Communication recommendation to approve overnight field trip.

1057
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:41,719
We have an overnight.

1058
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:42,900
Let me see.

1059
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,381
I'm sorry.

1060
01:30:45,062 --> 01:30:47,525
Ski trip with Tufts Mountain Club.

1061
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:49,887
The trip has been approved by the headmaster.

1062
01:30:49,907 --> 01:30:53,931
This is from Medford High School and the required forms have been submitted and approved.

1063
01:30:53,951 --> 01:30:55,093
Is there a motion for approval?

1064
01:30:55,633 --> 01:30:57,174
have a motion.

1065
01:30:57,194 --> 01:31:00,116
Motion for approval by Miss Crutz, Mr Benedetto.

1066
01:31:00,257 --> 01:31:00,697
Thank you.

1067
01:31:01,117 --> 01:31:06,301
Um on this, I reviewed it and I didn't see a sign off from the school nurse.

1068
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:19,111
So it says the email is attached and the email that it's attached only says please provide me with the list of students so that way I can let you know if there's any medical.

1069
01:31:19,831 --> 01:31:21,633
There was no official write off.

1070
01:31:24,317 --> 01:31:37,965
So if you look, yeah, I don't have the list of students yet because I wasn't able to finalize the list until I got approval of the committee.

1071
01:31:38,871 --> 01:31:40,974
Yeah, this is my point.

1072
01:31:41,475 --> 01:31:53,311
With the new paperwork that we just required everybody to fill out is you need a list of students going before you send it out for permission slips so you don't have the list until it's approved.

1073
01:31:53,892 --> 01:31:54,913
So it's like a catch 22.

1074
01:31:55,814 --> 01:32:00,157
No, aren't we supposed to approve the trip before they can go to their students too?

1075
01:32:00,338 --> 01:32:13,988
Right, but the way that the form does, it asks for the list of students when they're filling out the form so that way they can get the approval from the nurse and I think other schools are having this issue as well that I've been told about.

1076
01:32:14,468 --> 01:32:26,580
So like you can't, the nurse can't tell you how many children or if any children have any medical issues that a nurse may be necessary or medications may be necessary or delegation of medications may be necessary.

1077
01:32:27,001 --> 01:32:29,944
So we might need to re-look at this event.

1078
01:32:30,064 --> 01:32:30,324
Yeah.

1079
01:32:31,285 --> 01:32:35,766
So we need to change this, and I'd like you to look at that issue.

1080
01:32:35,866 --> 01:32:44,448
I know we've talked about it on the phone this week, Superintendent Belson, and so if you, I'm noticing this problem here.

1081
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:58,012
So we need to get initial approvals going, and then provide a list, and then the nurse thing, which is difficult, because then you gotta estimate what the cost of the trip is with or without a nurse.

1082
01:32:59,236 --> 01:33:03,720
So we want to make it less bureaucratic.

1083
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,901
I mean, let's keep it simple.

1084
01:33:04,941 --> 01:33:05,742
Let's keep it simple.

1085
01:33:06,302 --> 01:33:10,225
Obviously, if there's a situation that requires an additional cost, we'll bring it back to you.

1086
01:33:11,146 --> 01:33:15,169
But if there's no such cost, let's not make people come back and forth five times.

1087
01:33:15,209 --> 01:33:19,813
I mean, the goal of this was to be inclusive and to provide appropriate care.

1088
01:33:20,334 --> 01:33:22,616
If it turns out that we have a situation, we'll bring it back.

1089
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:23,533
Right.

1090
01:33:24,053 --> 01:33:24,754
I agree with that.

1091
01:33:24,794 --> 01:33:37,220
But just make sure that all policy, everybody approving this and all teachers filling this out know that like it says here that you have to have a nurse's signature.

1092
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:45,664
And if someone's trying to fill this out correctly, the teacher is going to say, I can't get the signature or curriculum director signature.

1093
01:33:45,744 --> 01:33:47,765
And it only says one is what if it's

1094
01:33:49,293 --> 01:33:51,374
You know, it's getting tricky for people.

1095
01:33:51,414 --> 01:33:54,115
I'm getting phone calls about it, so it's getting tricky for people.

1096
01:33:54,315 --> 01:33:55,295
Well, we'll move through it.

1097
01:33:55,315 --> 01:33:57,896
I mean, there are some people that, you know, resist anything.

1098
01:33:58,436 --> 01:34:02,397
Look, earlier this evening, you were telling me that I'm making things too bureaucratic for the PTO.

1099
01:34:02,777 --> 01:34:02,897
Right.

1100
01:34:02,957 --> 01:34:06,578
I'm telling you, you're making things too bureaucratic for the teachers and everything like that.

1101
01:34:06,658 --> 01:34:07,319
No, no, no, no.

1102
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:08,039
We'll work it out.

1103
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:09,379
But this is a bigger issue.

1104
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:16,722
I want, if there's a change necessary, because we just approved this, then we need to make those edits and make it easier for our staff.

1105
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:17,882
I'm not trying to make it harder.

1106
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:19,302
I'm trying to take it down.

1107
01:34:19,322 --> 01:34:23,844
I think obviously the nurse has indicated it's okay until she sees something specific.

1108
01:34:24,044 --> 01:34:26,665
If something comes up, we'll come bring it back.

1109
01:34:26,705 --> 01:34:29,746
Is there a motion on the floor for approval of the trip by Ms.

1110
01:34:29,886 --> 01:34:30,906
Kretz, seconded by Ms.

1111
01:34:30,966 --> 01:34:31,586

Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

Have fun.

1128
01:34:52,777 --> 01:35:01,665
In addition to that, I would like a motion to send this to the Rules Committee to review this paperwork and make it more streamlined for all of our teachers.

1129
01:35:01,685 --> 01:35:06,329
On the motion to send to the Rules Committee, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1130
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:07,190

Aye.

1132
01:35:08,171 --> 01:35:08,912
All those opposed?

1133
01:35:08,972 --> 01:35:09,812
Motion carries.

1134
01:35:10,673 --> 01:35:13,655
All right, new business, school committee resolution.

1135
01:35:13,675 --> 01:35:19,058
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Karen Pirro.

1136
01:35:19,558 --> 01:35:23,320
Mrs. Pirro was the mother of Medford High School Administrative Assistant Lisa Bowler.

1137
01:35:24,401 --> 01:35:29,284
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Peggy Dunford.

1138
01:35:29,664 --> 01:35:29,864
Ms.

1139
01:35:29,884 --> 01:35:32,986
Dunford was the wife of vocational teacher Robert Drobnik.

1140
01:35:34,007 --> 01:35:38,789
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Colleen Hallisey.

1141
01:35:39,229 --> 01:35:39,369

1143
01:35:44,511 --> 01:35:49,313
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Joseph McAdam.

1144
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:52,954
Mr. McAdam was the father of retired high school teacher John McAdam.

1145
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:54,775
If we could all, we have an addition.

1146
01:35:55,815 --> 01:36:00,117

1148
01:36:06,628 --> 01:36:11,272
Was a retired school department employee all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these.

1149
01:36:12,553 --> 01:36:13,094
Citizens.

1150
01:36:13,114 --> 01:36:22,163
Thank you.

1151
01:36:24,075 --> 01:36:25,556
That actually is the end of our meeting.

1152
01:36:25,596 --> 01:36:30,601
We did have negotiations and legal matters, which were the cafeteria workers that we took a vote on.

1153
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:31,802
Motion for.

1154
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:39,830
Before we close, can I just remind the superintendent there are a couple items on the request or reports that were due in January 2018.

1155
01:36:41,412 --> 01:36:48,939
So the update report on enrollments in January 2018, including prospective number of students and new developments with units of

1156
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:50,960
100 plus.

1157
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:56,364
That was requested September 18th, and it was due in January 2018.

1158
01:36:56,564 --> 01:37:00,027
Can you update us with the prospective date?

1159
01:37:02,429 --> 01:37:10,334
Okay, and my last one is an update of next steps for RTI requested for February 1st.

1160
01:37:10,394 --> 01:37:11,655
This is just a reminder.

1161
01:37:12,096 --> 01:37:16,099
It's not February 1st yet, but I will be expecting that report soon.

1162
01:37:17,133 --> 01:37:20,457
Through the mayor to the superintendent to change the date until February 28th

1163
01:37:35,868 --> 01:37:37,049
I'm not sure if it's leap year.

1164
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:39,932
We'll amend requested reports.

1165
01:37:40,393 --> 01:37:44,517
The fourth bullet down to be due February 28th or end of month.

1166
01:37:44,738 --> 01:37:52,266
And I look forward to the report on the enrollments, including the prospective number of students in new developments at our next meeting.

1167
01:37:53,287 --> 01:37:53,627
Thank you.

1168
01:37:57,057 --> 01:38:15,365
Before we leave tonight, I wanted to bring up one other discussion which I thought mr. Ruggiero might Today, mr. Ruggiero put online our packet of information and I think that There was

1169
01:38:16,966 --> 01:38:21,468
One Piece which I was uncomfortable with which actually had to do with ski trip.

1170
01:38:22,209 --> 01:38:36,977
It didn't have names on it But if there was names I wanted that to be posted I wasn't certain that I wanted Everybody in the public to know exactly where the kids were going what time they were going whatever just as a safety thing I think that it's long been a

1171
01:38:38,138 --> 01:38:54,293
thought that I know other school committee members share that some of our documents rather than having this big stack of papers could be online for us as well and so I think that we should

1172
01:38:56,475 --> 01:38:59,156
I think we should take both things together, figure out.

1173
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:05,300
There were some questions about afterwards, which people in the public raised, which I certainly wouldn't have thought about.

1174
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:14,006
So it was interesting input of saying, how do you best post our information for our meetings?

1175
01:39:14,126 --> 01:39:22,872
So I'd like to make a motion, maybe in conjunction with Mr. Ruggiero, that we search how we're going to,

1176
01:39:24,053 --> 01:39:36,041
effectively put our documents online, both for the public and also so that we can minimize the amount of paper that we have for our meetings.

1177
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:45,227
As a long-term school committee member, I can tell you that I could devote, I mean, whole rooms, buckets fills of these exist.

1178
01:39:45,367 --> 01:39:47,168
And frankly, it's just way too much.

1179
01:39:47,588 --> 01:39:49,569
I mentioned to mr. Shira earlier.

1180
01:39:49,729 --> 01:40:06,898
I spoke to the superintendent earlier today about that the possibility of us going paperless with an iPad To do our work and in the same time when they're uploading the files for us They can upload it to a separate the school website for all to see what what the backup is to the agenda item So the superintendent I even work on that.

1181
01:40:07,378 --> 01:40:07,518
Okay.

1182
01:40:07,558 --> 01:40:08,259
I made a motion.

1183
01:40:08,439 --> 01:40:10,320
Do we want to just officialize it?

1184
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:10,360
I

1185
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:11,791
Sure.

1186
01:40:14,894 --> 01:40:16,776
Sure.

1187
01:40:17,376 --> 01:40:29,507
We'll include that in the motion that this be moved to the community relations subcommittee on the motion.

1188
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:31,348
All those in favor.

1189
01:40:31,368 --> 01:40:32,349
Aye.

1190
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:32,790
Opposed.

1191
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:33,550
Motion carries.

1192
01:40:34,271 --> 01:40:35,092
Motion to adjourn.
