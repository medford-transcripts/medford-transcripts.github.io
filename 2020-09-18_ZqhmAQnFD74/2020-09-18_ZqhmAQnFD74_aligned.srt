1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:02,330
If you do not ask mommy, you will go to jail now.

2
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:30,232
is to review the resolution on the disciplinary practices of suspension pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020, excuse me, order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law and the Governor's March 15, 2020, order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place.

And I will read just one of the Zoom.

14
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:55,238
There's two different Zoom links to get here.

15

HTTPS colon backslash backslash tinyurl.com slash YXZ64CY7.

16
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:10,958
The meeting ID is 970-8865-8077.

17
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:11,518
The passcode is 579751.

00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:13,400
And to find one of the phone numbers, you only need one, is 1312-626-6799.

19
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:32,431
and then you would enter the meeting ID after that.

20
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:33,613

Those submitting questions must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment.

24
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,055
The agenda for tonight is the purpose.

25
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:05,836
There's only one thing on the agenda.

26
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:11,980
The purpose of the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee is to review the resolution on the disciplinary practice of suspension.

27
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:18,124
I will read the resolution, which is going to be the shortest thing I've read so far.

28
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:22,967
The resolution was sent to the subcommittee by the full committee.

29
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:29,370
last Thursday, I believe, or I don't remember when our meeting was.

30
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:45,866
Resolution on the Disciplinary Practice of Suspension, whereas Mayor Lungo Kern and the Medford City Council have declared racism a public health emergency, whereas Black, Latinx, and disabled students are disproportionately suspended, whereas suspensions harm students that are not suspended.

31
00:03:46,718 --> 00:04:10,915
Whereas dropout rates are higher among students that are suspended, whereas out-of-school suspensions increase the likelihood of juvenile arrest, whereas suspended students are more likely to repeat a grade level, whereas students that are suspended are not being educated, whereas school attendance is a critical requirement to receive an education, whereas receiving an education is a requirement of academic achievement,

32
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,200
And whereas student achievement is the highest goal of all school committees.

33
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:40,150
Now, therefore be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools, one, ends the use of out-of-school suspensions effective the first day of the school year 2021, two, provides for the continuation of a learning environment for every in-school suspension, ensures that two, three, ensures that in-school suspensions will not occur in isolation without instruction or rehabilitative counseling,

34
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,653
Four, select alternative tools for use in disciplines such as restorative justice.

35
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:54,059
And five, incorporates any funding requirements to ensure the implementation of the selected alternatives with fidelity in the next budget cycle.

36
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,744
At this time, I will open the floor to anybody who has questions.

37
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,205
Any members want to speak?

38
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:14,216
I'll have a question, but I'm going to wait until the dialogue starts a little bit.

39
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:20,218
But I do have some questions, but I'd like to just let things roll, if you don't mind, first, before I start.

40
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,278
That's fine.

41
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:28,420
If you all could raise your hands, just so I can figure out who to call on.

42
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:36,083
You mean raise hands through the participants, Paul, or through physically?

43
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:40,360
Either one is fine because there's not 450 people in this meeting.

44
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:44,663
Mr. DeLava.

45
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,726
So good evening, everyone.

46
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,267
And thank you for attending.

47
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:52,930
I think I stated it at the last meeting.

48
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,591
And again, this is open to discussion.

49
00:05:54,651 --> 00:06:06,600
And thank you for holding this committee of the whole because I think having this kind of dialogue back and forth gets us to kind of understand where people are at or where their mindsets are and kind of where

50
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:08,227
things are going.

51
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:17,517
I did state last time that reading the resolution, I was concerned regarding laws, and I know that it was mentioned that we would still follow the law.

52
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:24,244
I did bring up Chapter 222, which has sort of changed our way, and this was in 2012.

53
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:25,406
It was implemented in 2014.

54
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:41,216
of how we would go about suspensions because, you know, there was data concerning about students losing education due to suspensions and they wanted to make sure that we weren't losing that focus.

55
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:55,159
So with that law in place, you know, the only concern I run into is there's some cases where we feel that suspensions need to be implemented.

56
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:04,348
Violence is definitely one of them in the wheelhouse that I kind of think of, you know, two students get into a fight as an example.

57
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:24,499
you know, it's sort of something that we've done so that we can separate but also bring back in and regroup and reintegrate so that they're within the community and things don't escalate to a point where things are, you know, getting out of hand.

58
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,980
That being said, I also agree that

59
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:32,151
you know, we shouldn't be issuing suspensions willy-nilly.

60
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:43,281
You know, the last time I heard someone say that they got suspended for chewing gum, I will honestly say in my years of being a principal here in the district, I've never suspended anyone for chewing gum.

61
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:50,448
So I think it's more of how we utilize those suspensions and how we are

62
00:07:51,207 --> 00:08:06,296
enforcing those, that's something that I'd like to focus on, but again, this is a subcommittee, so everyone's entitled to speak their opinion, but I wanted to make sure that, you know, I reiterated what I said at the school committee meeting to this group as well.

63
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:07,536
Thank you.

64
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:11,038
Thank you.

65
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,460
Anybody else?

66
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,221
Somebody else must want to speak.

67
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:15,901
They all came.

68
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Ms.

69
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,161
McLaughlin?

70
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:23,482
Member McLaughlin?

71
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:26,183
You say yes to me, Paul?

72
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:27,143
Yes, I'm sorry.

73
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:28,164
I guess it's fine.

74
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:29,965
Yeah.

75
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:34,107
So yeah, to Mr. DeLava's point, I guess that raises a good question.

76
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:43,232
What if you have two students, for example, that do get in a fight, and we did do indoor suspension, or there was an indoor suspension?

77
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:48,715
How would that address, I guess, or we would need to address those students

78
00:08:49,352 --> 00:09:03,901
I would imagine not being together in an indoor, you know, I don't even know if you're going to call it suspension, but, um, or maybe they would be in a restorative justice circle or, I don't know, I guess I'm just curious, how would you respond, um, to that as an example?

79
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:13,580
Just kind of point of order for you, Member McLaughlin, that in-school suspensions count the same as out-of-school suspensions.

80
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:21,724
No matter, the minute you remove a student from their regular academic classes for a period of time, it is considered a suspension.

81
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:28,847
So just so you're, that's part of Chapter 222 that Paul had cited earlier, part of the Reform Act of the Education Discipline Act.

82
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:29,627
All right.

83
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:31,578
Okay.

84
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:33,060
So then I guess, thank you, Mr. Downs.

85
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,961
Um, and I didn't know who was speaking.

86
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,342
So also it might be helpful.

87
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:37,763
I was looking for you on my screen.

88
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:38,204
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,625
I just, I'm double screening cause I'm taking my apologies.

90
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:41,846
No, that's okay.

91
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:47,971
So maybe we can just ask folks to, um, you know, before they speak, just maybe say their name and what their role is would be helpful.

92
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:51,574
Um, and I'm going to try to do my best with taking these minutes to Paul.

93
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:56,398
So, so maybe some elaboration on if it's not a suspension,

94
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:12,474
we're not doing, you know, if we're considering not having suspension for obvious reasons with disproportionality, what might consequences, if that's the right word, logical consequences or otherwise look like instead?

95
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:25,318
So I will say that when I was at the Andrews, and I think I stated this as well at school committee,

96
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:53,951
we did have in the high school here especially we did have the opportunity for change program which i thought was a was a great program um where we had sort of a counselor overseeing the student for the day they were still doing their academic work but the council was also working with them to try to um you know work on like okay let's talk about you know how you got here and let's talk about the things you would do

97
00:10:55,336 --> 00:11:23,756
so you won't you know be part of this again and what kind of like more of the restorative part the again the hard part then ran in is due to budget that that program got cut like again prior to the school committee so you know that program got cut and so we had to go back to following the law you know we we try a lot of alternative things we we've even implemented here at the high school a friday detention in a sense to kind of

98
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,226
We've never had detention on a Friday.

99
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,187
We've had our Saturday program, too.

100
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:36,253
But, you know, those are the alternative things that I'd like to, you know, also, you know, keep in mind as we're doing it.

101
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:50,542
The Saturday program's been here at the high school since I was a teacher here, and we're talking 21 years now, which was an alternative for suspension, and students were working on their academic work while the assistant principals were overseeing them.

102
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:59,191
And I think even when I went to the Andrews, I even changed it and implemented it more as like an academic sort of catch up day as well.

103
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:07,239
So students weren't just going in there for behavior, they were going in there to utilize the time to catch up on their schoolwork as well.

104
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:11,924
But a lot of, like when funding gets cut, we have to find the alternatives.

105
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,917
to kind of keep, you know, the areas safe.

106
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:24,486
And again, I'm not saying that, you know, suspensions are something that we have to implement, but I think it's how we utilize them is the main question.

107
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:30,952
So for example, you know, if someone's vaping, just as an example, let's say we find someone vaping in the bathroom.

108
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:34,996
Does it make sense for us to suspend that student so that they can go vape at home?

109
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:36,338
No.

110
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:48,363
Or do we try to find the alternative parts of the way that we do things where we put them into our programs, we now have the MGH study, and we try to do all these other things.

111
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:53,785
So I guess like the suspensions are part of things, but it's not the only thing that we utilize.

112
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:56,146
So again, I don't want to be the only one.

113
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,727
I feel like I'm the only one talking.

114
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:01,868
So please, anybody else, please jump in if they can.

115
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,164
But Ms.

116
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:07,504
McLaughlin.

117
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,047
Thank you, Mr. Russo.

118
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:19,454
Can you do me a favor and actually share, or I think it would be helpful to maybe read the resolution one more time.

119
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,215
I wish I had it.

120
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,517
I was trying to, when you were talking, I was typing.

121
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:23,478
I'm not going to do that again.

122
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:33,086
But maybe the last part of the resolution so I can, it would just help me as we're talking, just if you wouldn't mind, just one more time, just the last part.

123
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:39,980
I had all the whereas, whereas, whereas, but the summary of the, or the outcome that you're looking for, please.

124
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,962
Apparently, okay, can I share just one thing?

125
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:49,205
I have a lot of things open on my screen, one second.

126
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:57,789
There it is, I think.

127
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,471
Yes, share.

128
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,132
All right.

129
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,131
Everybody see that okay?

130
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:14,322
So one of the questions I had after listening to Mr. DeLeva was,

131
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:27,114
actually, it might have been Mr. Downs that mentioned that suspensions are, you know, in-school suspensions are treated the same because there's not an education being provided.

132
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:35,881
I think the state is still definitely reporting them separately as distinct things, Mr. Downs.

133
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:50,843
Any time you remove a student from the academic setting, whether you are emergency removing them for, let's say, the rest of the day, you put them in school suspension or you suspend them, it is part of the suspension under Chapter 37 and 3 quarters.

134
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:54,926
And again, the just one act that was enacted a few years ago.

135
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:59,287
in-school suspensions and out-of-school suspensions count as the same.

136
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,928
They're both considered suspensions.

137
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:09,911
Additionally, anytime you remove a student, again, from the academic setting, whatever you want to call it, again, you're removing them from the academic setting.

138
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:21,235
And if you go by the letter of the law, removing a student from the academic setting for discipline purposes, and that's what it would be, no matter what we call it, is considered the emergency removal or suspension.

139
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:22,595
So thank you for your time.

140
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:23,696
Thank you.

141
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:33,431
So are you saying nobody is tracking the difference between taking them out of the classroom and sending them to guidance and sending them home for a week?

142
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:42,356
Paul, Mr. Delato.

143
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,379
Excuse me one second.

144
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,419
Point of information, Paul.

145
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,180
Can you stop sharing the screen now?

146
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,641
Because I can't take notes when you do.

147
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:51,081
Thank you.

148
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:51,842
Sorry.

149
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,080
Zoom.

150
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,480
One second.

151
00:15:59,221 --> 00:15:59,761
Stop.

152
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:00,862
Share.

153
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:01,622
There we go.

154
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:02,122
Good.

155
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:05,063
Thank you.

156
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:21,129
I mean, my understanding is they're really, I mean, I understand that the law might say that they're the same thing, but unless somebody is telling me we never send a kid home and that they're always still on the premises, then there is a difference regardless of what the law says.

157
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,390
Paul?

158
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:26,264
Yeah, I would agree with you, Paul.

159
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:34,209
The thing is, is that we really don't have an in-school suspension program.

160
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:38,372
I mean, we're not coding kids on in-school suspension.

161
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:48,940
If you go to the DESE profile and you look at Days Missed, for example, they actually list it as in-school suspension and out-of-school suspension.

162
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,501
But as Michael's saying, he's right.

163
00:16:51,304 --> 00:17:01,293
you know, a suspension is considered a suspension whether or not it's looked at as the removal of academic work, right?

164
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:15,766
That's the main goal that, not goal, but that's the main identifier that DESE has sort of put out there when we've come up with 37H and a quarter and, you know, whatever the federal laws come.

165
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:31,115
Really and truly, if you looked at the DESI data right now, I can almost guarantee you everything is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 for in-school suspension, because the way everything that we have coded really goes for out-of-school suspension.

166
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:38,882
And that's just, again, we really don't have an in-school suspension program, because that needs oversight.

167
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,182
I'm happy to share their screen.

168
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:44,663
I have it right here in front of me.

169
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:46,544
It is definitely not zeros across the board.

170
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:48,285
For in-school?

171
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:54,429
They have student discipline days missed reported.

172
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:10,239
So there's no, I can't know whether or not discipline days missed means, if you're saying we don't have an in-school suspension program, then these are all days that kids were not in the building.

173
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,181
And then we're not reported at all when we take them out of class for two periods.

174
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:18,342
Because that's not accurate.

175
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:28,265
If you click student discipline, the one above it, discipline a day's missed, percent in-school suspension is zero across the board for the year 18-19.

176
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:29,246
No, it's not.

177
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,167
I'm looking at Medford.

178
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,068
I'm looking at Medford High School.

179
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:38,549
I'm sorry.

180
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:44,540
So you're looking at the district, and I'm looking at the high school.

181
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,160
That's the problem.

182
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:53,104
So if I was to share my screen right now, for Bedford High School, in-school suspension is zero across the board.

183
00:18:53,124 --> 00:19:04,250
So are you saying that that's because there's a data reporting issue, or are you saying that's because we just suspend everyone out of school?

184
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:08,733
I'm not clear what your conclusion is.

185
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,427
No, there's other things we do.

186
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,789
This is just what's reported to DESE regarding suspensions here at the high school.

187
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:22,631
There is no in-school suspension program that we have.

188
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:26,852
Therefore, if we are doing a suspension, it's reported out of school.

189
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,754
If we are, that's not our only wheelhouse of what we do.

190
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:43,379
So are you saying, I'm looking at, I think I'm looking at what you're referring to, Paul, and I'm looking at a grid that starts with all students and then it breaks down into subgroups.

191
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:51,983
All students, 1,400 students for the 18-19 school year, 112 students disciplined, 0% in school suspension, 8% out of school suspension, 0% expulsion, 0% alternate setting, 0% emergency removal,

192
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:05,833
0% students with school-based arrest.

193
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:17,323
So are you saying that that 8% should be distributed across all of those columns and that we are not accurately like categorizing and classifying what we're doing?

194
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:20,505
Or are you saying we simply don't do those other things?

195
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:25,970
I'm saying that I can tell you since my tenure here, there's been nobody that's been excluded.

196
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,554
No one that's been sent to an alternative setting.

197
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:35,459
No one that's needed an emergency removal, and that's usually two days under that.

198
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:47,466
So, I mean, I can't tell you regarding everything, but, you know, our assistant principals log in, you know, when we're doing suspensions, and they are being reported to DESE.

199
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:49,207
Okay.

200
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:53,229
So, the data, it's not a data issue then, right?

201
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,351
So, what you're saying is there aren't expulsions, so 0% makes sense.

202
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,942
Um, there aren't alternate settings.

203
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:01,163
So 0% makes sense.

204
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:10,730
So, so this date, what this data says is that 8% of students receive out of 1400, 8% or 112 received an out of school suspension in the 2018, 2019 school year.

205
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,211
Yes.

206
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:11,671
Okay.

207
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:14,413
And this resolution is saying, we want that number to be zero.

208
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:33,014
in favor of pick a different category.

209
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:34,475
Is that?

210
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:44,042
In favor of in-school suspension or better yet, getting to the root of the cause because, my apologies.

211
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:45,363
Correct.

212
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:50,547
Point of information, would you guys mind sharing that screen for one second?

213
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:54,910
I can try.

214
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:57,228
I don't know if I can do that.

215
00:21:57,268 --> 00:21:57,728
Let me try.

216
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,510
I can do the high school one if you want me to.

217
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,651
I think I have it right here.

218
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:00,951
Let me.

219
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:05,915
Do you know where my phone is?

220
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:09,738
Can you see something?

221
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:10,499
Yes.

222
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,460
OK.

223
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:18,125
Can you see a chart that says 2018-2019 student discipline data report?

224
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:19,466
OK.

225
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,690
I've got two screens, and I don't even know what I'm sharing at this point.

226
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,891
So tell me if it's something.

227
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:26,026
Not that.

228
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:34,071
So Melanie, I was reading across this top line, this all students line.

229
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:49,400
And so what we're saying is the goal is to take this 8% to zero and to either move the punishment, I guess I'll call it, right?

230
00:22:50,871 --> 00:23:04,378
to a setting where we can be focused on some of the things that Paul was saying we used to do and we don't do anymore, focusing on the rehabilitative aspects of what we're doing.

231
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,900
I think that's what we're trying to accomplish with this policy.

232
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:13,163
I think I saw Mr. Blough, yeah, I think I saw Mr. Blough cut his hand.

233
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,444
So I don't know, Paul, if you wanna.

234
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:17,666
calling him, but I also have another follow-up to this.

235
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:18,946
Jenny, thank you for sharing the screen.

236
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:21,546
Don't take it away yet, please, because I want to comment on something there.

237
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,008
Do you want to go first, Mr. Blauck, or do you want me to go?

238
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:29,748
Member Russo, it's your call.

239
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:30,949
If you'd like me to go, I can wait a minute.

240
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:31,509
Yeah, go ahead.

241
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:32,509
That's fine.

242
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:33,269
OK, so I'm Dave Blauck.

243
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:34,990
I'm one of the assistant principals at the high school.

244
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,990
I'm starting my 10th year as an administrator.

245
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:44,792
And I have suspended many kids, probably just about or more than anyone on this call.

246
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:49,726
I just want to say, you know, for the record, suspension out of school is a big deal.

247
00:23:51,087 --> 00:24:02,896
It's something that, you know, I think what we've learned through Chapter 222 and, you know, just trends that we need to respond to, you know, as the years pass, that we really shouldn't be doing it unless there's truly no other option.

248
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:12,383
You know, that said, going down to an absolute zero for suspension, I think it's extremely difficult, you know, if not impossible.

249
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:17,857
I mean, I think we're all making an effort district-wide to minimize suspension as much as we can.

250
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:29,145
But then again, every, if I find a kid with a knife, I mean, that child, from my viewpoint, needs to be on an emergency removal, you know, which is a suspension where the child can't appeal based on circumstances.

251
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:39,732
But, you know, there's some situations where we say, you know, we look around like the possibility of violence, an issue of sexual violence, you know, some things where we just say to ourselves, you know, this child does need to be off the premises.

252
00:24:40,356 --> 00:25:02,123
Now, I think that the types of suspensions that might have been acceptable, let's say 10, 15, 20 years ago, where let's say a situation of disrespect or someone has, I don't know, somebody has a vaping item or cigarettes or alcohol, you know, like we may say to ourselves, okay, that's not a violent situation.

253
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,004
That's not a, that's not posing a,

254
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:17,155
a substantial threat or a danger to the school or school population, you know, whereas there's some others I think we run into everyone, you know, who's been in these roles runs into at some point, we say to ourselves, you know, like this child truly does need to be off the premises.

255
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:20,577
So I think that's something that's important to just have as an option.

256
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:30,462
But after you have tried every single other thing, because as I said a moment ago, it's a very big deal to say that this child is not going to be permitted to attend school and access curriculum.

257
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,264
So I would say something to look into would be, you know, how do we

258
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:51,141
continue to support the efforts to re-engage children and to find additional tools in the toolbox to keep them in the building, accessing support, working on ways to work through problems that might be disrupting and disturbing them in that time.

259
00:25:51,181 --> 00:26:01,746
But then again, I look at, like I said, you find a child with a knife, it just isn't prudent to have that child remain in the building when you don't know what's going to happen there.

260
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:02,767
Thanks for the opportunity to speak.

261
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,049
Thank you.

262
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:23,496
I would, if I may, if we were equitably providing suspensions, I would be more than willing to have a conversation around how we can solve the problems that cause suspensions, but we are not.

263
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:30,638
62% of suspensions adjusted for race were not white people, and 38% were white people, white students.

264
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:48,667
So that tells me, unless we are comfortable having a conversation around the suggestion that the black kids are worse than the white kids, which I am not comfortable with, and I don't think there's any evidence to suggest that's an accurate view, that we have two problems.

265
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:53,130
We have the problem of how do we address kids that might actually need a suspension?

266
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:56,235
which is what I hear you talking about.

267
00:26:56,555 --> 00:27:05,961
But I don't hear you talking about the fact that the primarily white staff notices the black kids doing the same things the white kids are doing, and they're the ones that get suspended.

268
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:11,584
I mean, it's like, it's almost tiring that that needs to be repeated.

269
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,085
And I hope that nobody's offended.

270
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:19,048
And I also hope that if you are offended, you understand that you are not understanding the problem.

271
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:20,969
But,

272
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:26,110
You know, this, this problem is not the issue.

273
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,891
First of all, your example of a knife.

274
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:35,293
I mean, you know, I grew up in rural New Hampshire and I would have been shocked if any of the kids didn't in high school didn't have a knife in their pocket.

275
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,193
That would be weird.

276
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:45,636
And there wasn't a time, you know, long ago, perhaps even in my lifetime, when in some parts of this country, people brought guns to school and that wasn't actually

277
00:27:46,192 --> 00:27:47,452
call the police scenario.

278
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:57,334
So, you know, what I think of as like suspendable behavior and what you think of and what everybody thinks of isn't the same.

279
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:01,395
And it isn't the same for every child either.

280
00:28:01,535 --> 00:28:07,076
Which child is considered performing a suspendable behavior isn't the same child to child.

281
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:08,957
So, I mean,

282
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,221
My biggest concern right now is not whether or not a kid comes to school with a pocket knife.

283
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:18,503
I mean, I'm not talking about a big Bowie knife that is intended to behead a deer.

284
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:20,023
I'm talking about a pocket knife.

285
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,585
If that kid's getting suspended, I would say that's already a problem.

286
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:32,408
And I mean, I think if there's intent or any reason to believe that that knife is there for a violent purpose,

287
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:34,846
That's a different conversation.

288
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:44,271
But just the presence of a pocket knife, I mean, I think would be a pretty shocking reason to suspend, in my opinion.

289
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:48,773
And again, everybody has an opinion, and everybody's opinion is different.

290
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:49,833
That's another problem.

291
00:28:51,707 --> 00:29:00,070
So I mean, this resolution was intended to solve the problem that has not been solved with all of the good work of all of the good people in the school.

292
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,150
And I do believe it's good work.

293
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,912
This is not an attack on anybody, but it is still not getting better.

294
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:20,016
And so I think that a new, looking at this in a different light of, okay, we aren't gonna solve the racial disparities in how kids are seen.

295
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:23,005
simply by wishing it away.

296
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:34,828
And, you know, we can all take anti-bias training till we're blue in the face, but unless you grew up under a rock, you're still going to see the black kids as the kids that are threatening.

297
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:47,172
And so it's, I feel like it's my job on the school committee to figure out how to make sure that they're not getting suspended because these out of school suspensions are not just times where they're missing their education.

298
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:47,792
I mean, they're

299
00:29:48,547 --> 00:30:04,090
dramatically increased rates of dropping out, which we need to rephrase that all together, but also the opportunities to be involved with the police are dramatically increased when kids are not in school.

300
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,171
So I'll let other people talk.

301
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:08,131
Sorry, Ms.

302
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:08,571
McLaughlin.

303
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:11,312
Thank you.

304
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:17,373
And to that end, to Paul's point, I also want to point out the data here.

305
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:34,040
that 84% of 112, so about 80% of these discipline suspensions are students, high-need students.

306
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:38,423
So students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged English learners.

307
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:44,146
And that is, again, another data point that's really important to look at.

308
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:44,946
So looking at the 62%

309
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:51,016
persons of color and more than 80% or 80% high needs.

310
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:57,200
And so what is the intersectionality around addressing the social emotional component of this?

311
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,902
And I know that Stacey Shulman has her hand raised.

312
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:01,063
So I'll be curious to hear that.

313
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:10,529
But as we're addressing trauma, as we're addressing social emotional needs of children, and again, getting back to some of that implicit bias around that, what that looks like.

314
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:16,433
And, you know, a student who is experiencing a lot of aggression at home and then comes into school and

315
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:27,925
you know, maybe has a teacher or someone that is, seems threatening or aggressive to them and they explode, you know, we understand that that can be a root cause of trauma.

316
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:35,711
So, but the data does speak volumes in that 80% of our students that are getting disciplined are high needs.

317
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:38,573
And so I would love for folks to talk about that as well.

318
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,195
And then I- Point of information, Ms.

319
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:41,735
McLaughlin.

320
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:45,158
84 is the number of students.

321
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:48,113
11.5 is the percentage.

322
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:49,815
84 out of 112?

323
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:59,442
No, 84 out of, if you look at the chart, there's 729 students that are recognized.

324
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:00,963
84 of them are students.

325
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:01,443
Right.

326
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:03,625
It comes out to 11.5 percent.

327
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:12,411
Except it's not because it's 11.5 plus 15 plus 11.5 for the high need, well it depends on the students with disabilities

328
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:16,054
and the economically disadvantaged are also in the high needs 11.5.

329
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:23,160
Right, which is, but DESE, so DESE identifies the high needs of those three categories.

330
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,443
So they're taking all those students into account.

331
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:30,765
So the 15.8 and the 12.3 are the equivalent of the 11.5.

332
00:32:30,805 --> 00:32:32,807
That's the way I'm looking at it right now.

333
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:45,416
Well, then how can it, if it's students disciplined and 84 of them are high needs and the total students disciplined are 112, that's not 11%.

334
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:49,599
But that's out of all, that's, that's out of, that's a hundred.

335
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,763
No, I see what you're saying, but the percentage doesn't come out correct because you were, you were saying 84%.

336
00:32:55,803 --> 00:32:58,524
75% of students are high needs students who are disciplined.

337
00:32:58,544 --> 00:32:58,945
So of 112, 84 is 75%.

338
00:32:58,985 --> 00:32:59,085
So,

339
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:10,508
75% of students who are disciplined are high needs.

340
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,569
Thank you, Jenny.

341
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:15,691
So I was saying approximately 80, looking at 84 to the 112.

342
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,392
Right.

343
00:33:16,432 --> 00:33:20,895
But it's actually 75% because Jenny, you know, used her calculator or her brain and did the math.

344
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:21,275
Thank you.

345
00:33:21,295 --> 00:33:21,795
Calculator.

346
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,957
I was like, I assume calculator, but I didn't want to.

347
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:26,378
So thank you.

348
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,380
So that's a really, that's an important point.

349
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,743
75% of them are high needs of the students who are being disciplined.

350
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:46,269
And again, it goes to the same point that member Rousseau is saying, you know, are we saying that students who have high needs are, you know, require discipline more than students who don't?

351
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:53,813
Maybe, and maybe again, you know, Stacey Shulman can speak to that, but maybe suspension isn't the way to address that.

352
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,754
So I'm done now, but I wanted to just point out that data.

353
00:33:56,814 --> 00:34:02,937
And then I am going to ask if everyone's okay, Paul, that you stop sharing the screen just so I can go back to my Word document to take notes.

354
00:34:02,978 --> 00:34:03,298
Thank you.

355
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,628
Oh, do I have to unmute you, Stacey?

356
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:13,890
Oh, no, I can do it.

357
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,371
Hi, I'm sorry.

358
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:15,272
I didn't hear you calling me.

359
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:17,074
Good evening.

360
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:25,863
I just wanted to implore the committee to go back and re-review the data in a program evaluation method.

361
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:32,470
While I think it's helpful to look at the numbers here on the screen, there is a significant amount of data that's missing.

362
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:44,640
including the referrals on why these students were being referred to administrators for discipline and any other circumstances that we can find out.

363
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:54,749
While I think that it's definitely a great topic to be looking at at this time in terms of why are students being suspended and certainly why are students who are

364
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:59,896
of color being suspended at a higher level, which has been shown here in our district.

365
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:02,860
But it feels to me like there's some information missing.

366
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:10,348
And we've spoken today about how staff have engaged in implicit bias training and trauma training.

367
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:15,434
But really, I feel like we've scratched the surface on those levels and we need to go a little bit deeper.

368
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:22,656
So I would like to implore you all to take a step back and do more of a comprehensive program evaluation.

369
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:35,141
While we don't have 100% capacity of students in the building or any at all right now, we have the ability to take this time to really have an in-depth data review of what suspensions look like.

370
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:43,547
And what we need to do in order to train staff, and perhaps there is an additional cost to keeping staff in the building.

371
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:47,350
Mr. DeLava spoke earlier about the opportunity for change program.

372
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,073
While that was eliminated due to budget cuts, it also was an underperforming program.

373
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:53,955
It was not utilized well.

374
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,378
We performed an extensive program evaluation of that in 2017, but what it came down to

375
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,824
was that it wasn't running as effectively or efficiently as it could have because we actually needed more staff to make that happen.

376
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:23,434
As the Director of School Counseling, I have seen and participated in students either while they're, you know, having challenges in the building and may need to head home for the day and also upon their return.

377
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,477
I think one of the things that Medford does well is we have a really nice re-entry program.

378
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,558
Oftentimes, counselors are involved

379
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:34,301
However, engaging in counseling is not something we can mandate to students.

380
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,503
So that's on an elective basis as well.

381
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:50,654
But I really think that I would love to go back and I'm certainly happy to help with this effort and do a really deep dive on what this data is showing for us to make decisions going forward.

382
00:36:55,311 --> 00:37:05,217
Stacey, I actually think that that is the right way to go about getting at number five on the list.

383
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:14,821
So I still don't think that ending out of school suspensions is a bad sort of number one place to start.

384
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:23,566
But in terms of being able to accurately identify number five, an in-depth program review, so would

385
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:30,288
allow us to look at the data, as you said, like I agree, I think there's lots of data missing here.

386
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,670
Like I would like to see lots more data than is here.

387
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:51,000
So what I would suggest member Russo is that between four and five, we add something that says the administration will complete a comprehensive program review to identify the causes of suspension, as well as

388
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,144
recommend mitigation efforts so that number five can actually happen, right?

389
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:01,367
Because otherwise, we're just throwing a number at the wall.

390
00:38:02,688 --> 00:38:05,710
And we don't know if it's enough or if it's not enough.

391
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,333
But if we say, here's our problem.

392
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:12,176
Here's what it's going to take to address our problem.

393
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:14,518
And here's the money that we need to do that.

394
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,963
Now we have an actual path forward that is actionable.

395
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:33,494
So that would be my suggestion is that we add that as another bullet in terms of what will happen to get us to this place next fall, where we do not want to be issuing out of school suspensions.

396
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,300
Thank you, Miss Graham.

397
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,181
I think my worry here is that the suspension is the end result.

398
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:48,583
There has been some sort of behavior or incident that's happened there has been this suspension is the end result.

399
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:57,405
My worry is if we remove the action of suspension at this time without understanding and having the resources to mitigate students challenging behavior.

400
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:04,048
we will be adding more challenges to the system and potentially increasing student frustration across the board.

401
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:13,791
Students are suspended under, as Mr. Blauck and Mr. DeLeva have said, under extreme circumstances where they or others are in jeopardy of safety.

402
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:20,134
I know there was another incident referenced earlier, potentially of a student bringing a knife to school.

403
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:23,135
Administrators are very well trained and have been.

404
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:34,977
on threat assessments over the past few years, and particularly by Dr. Nancy Rappaport out of Cambridge, who is the leading expert on school threat assessments.

405
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,738
We're lucky to have her in the area, and she's assisted us with that.

406
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:52,101
So it's not taken lightly, but we often have situations where students are incredibly dysregulated, unable to regulate themselves, and it could lead to potentially more dangerous situations if we are unable to say at this moment in time,

407
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:57,707
You know, we need you to take a step back and come in the next day and we're happy to work on this situation.

408
00:39:58,068 --> 00:40:02,931
But we try, try, try again, especially at the elementary level to keep those kids in the building.

409
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:04,472
We know how important it is.

410
00:40:04,873 --> 00:40:09,376
But without the inability to have to have to take a step back because we don't have additional staff.

411
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:13,839
We don't have the resource room to, you know, potentially work with these students in the moment.

412
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:19,642
I fear we may be heading into other unsafe situations without knowing those protective strategies ahead of time.

413
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:25,585
But this resolution stops out-of-school suspensions at the start of next year.

414
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:31,409
So nothing is immediately happening is my read on this.

415
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:33,250
Is that correct, Paul?

416
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:36,032
That's my understanding, my intent.

417
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:36,933
OK.

418
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:40,610
So I mean, nobody is suggesting that this happened tomorrow.

419
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:41,890
I understand.

420
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:52,116
I think that I personally am anxious to see how students are regulating back to an in-school environment and what that looks like and what their needs are.

421
00:40:52,817 --> 00:41:01,362
And again, I implore you to do the program evaluation first before taking the action to say we are no longer going to issue out-of-school suspensions.

422
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:04,483
Just a quick point.

423
00:41:05,991 --> 00:41:23,265
The Department of Ed data that we reported to them indicated that 81% of our out-of-school suspensions, students disciplined with out-of-school suspensions, 81% of those were non-drug, non-violent, non-criminal related offenses.

424
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:30,791
So I would suggest if the feeling is that there's a threat involved, we need to take a hard look at how we're coding this stuff.

425
00:41:31,797 --> 00:41:35,738
because the story I'm hearing is that we're really concerned about the safety.

426
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,979
Well, the safety of what?

427
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,900
Somebody vandalizes the wall?

428
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,961
That doesn't seem like a safety offense to me.

429
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:54,524
So I would just ask that we, you know, as a note, realize we need to be really caring about how we report all of this data, because this is why we're here.

430
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,325
If the data reported

431
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:01,655
said that, you know, we were doing all these suspensions because people were trying to kill other kids.

432
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:05,235
I wouldn't we wouldn't have this resolution and we wouldn't be having this meeting.

433
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:14,277
But instead, it says 81 percent of the suspensions at the high school, at least, were for non-drug, non-violent, non-criminal related behaviors.

434
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:20,218
That to me is chewing gum, swearing at a teacher, writing on a wall.

435
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:26,399
I mean, I don't know what other other things fall in that category, but the vast majority are for things that

436
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:28,930
don't sound like what you're all concerned about.

437
00:42:28,951 --> 00:42:30,512
And that concerns me.

438
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:37,737
The other one thing I did want to quickly mention, and now I forgot it, but I'll come back to it.

439
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:38,797
But I do want to let Ms.

440
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:42,160
Moretti, who's been waiting a long time with her hand up, I apologize, speak.

441
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,360
Can you unmute yourself?

442
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,181
Great, thank you.

443
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:45,502
Thank you.

444
00:42:45,902 --> 00:42:47,683
I know it says Medford.

445
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:48,404
I don't know what happened.

446
00:42:48,424 --> 00:42:52,467
Nadine Moretti, I think most people on here might know me already.

447
00:42:54,974 --> 00:43:01,382
You know, I've been trying to be very on top of all the school committee meetings over the summer, listening to everything everyone's had to say.

448
00:43:02,904 --> 00:43:08,091
Mr. DeLaver and Mr. Bloch, I love everything that they've said, and I just wanna say a couple of things.

449
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:16,510
I must be old school because I still believe in children, people being held accountable for their actions.

450
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:20,373
I know there's so many different facets that we're talking about here.

451
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:23,916
Mr. DeLava did say no one's ever been suspended for chewing gum.

452
00:43:24,017 --> 00:43:25,037
I wouldn't think they would be.

453
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:35,787
I'm a little concerned, you know, as a parent listening to this, because for me, if a child was in school with a pocket knife,

454
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,383
That's a danger immediately because you can still get hurt.

455
00:43:42,345 --> 00:43:50,991
And, you know, it's up to these administrators who we entrust and who do all this, you know, that I trust their decisions and how you guys discipline.

456
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:56,415
I mean, I don't know enough about it, so I'm kind of just speaking maybe even just out of pure emotion right now.

457
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:03,688
I think that this, what I find is this adds a little more problems that I don't even know if this is necessary.

458
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:07,849
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Paul.

459
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,750
I really do.

460
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:17,032
But for me, listening to this type of discussion just exacerbates how I feel.

461
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:17,712
I think that

462
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:38,655
know the violent behaviors and it shouldn't be based on color because I think that if you have 20 kids and if 15 came in who were white and had knives or 15 came in people of color had not this really shouldn't matter like that should be a whole separate I don't even know how to even really say what I'm trying to say I

463
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:55,386
It aggravates me that this is so based on color, because if you have these kids coming in with the knives or with this behavior that causes the administrators to have to do what they have to do with suspensions, then that's how it should be.

464
00:44:57,168 --> 00:44:58,970
We're not holding people accountable anymore.

465
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,581
it's become so aggravating to listen to.

466
00:45:04,421 --> 00:45:17,044
So I mean, it just, to me, it would be very nerve wracking to have my children in the school and know that people aren't going to be held accountable for things that, say, the school committee or the subcommittee is going to find unoffensive.

467
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:21,265
Or you're taking away the authority of these other people, or at least trying to.

468
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:24,265
So I don't even know if what I'm saying makes sense to you guys.

469
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,045
And I apologize.

470
00:45:25,085 --> 00:45:26,606
I've had a very rough year.

471
00:45:28,749 --> 00:45:34,714
But I just wanted to, as a parent, just put it out there because it just doesn't make me feel comfortable.

472
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:44,401
If a kid came in with a pocket knife and one of my children got hurt or was in a room where this happened, I would be raising holy hell to Medford Public Schools, the city, and everything.

473
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:45,982
So you gotta think about that stuff.

474
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,904
Right now, in-school suspensions won't be happening.

475
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:50,045
Remember, we're not in school.

476
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:53,648
So if this is for next year, let's hope that we're back in school next year.

477
00:45:53,788 --> 00:45:57,111
And I think that it's everyone's duty on this,

478
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:04,340
you know, on this committee tonight and everywhere else to keep the kids safe, no matter what, but we still have to hold people accountable.

479
00:46:05,601 --> 00:46:12,827
No matter what their color, you know, anything, it's just, you still have to hold people accountable and you shouldn't take that away.

480
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:14,508
So thank you for the time.

481
00:46:14,568 --> 00:46:16,870
And I apologize if I'm all over the place.

482
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,071
Thanks.

483
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:18,852
Thank you.

484
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:24,898
Thank you.

485
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:32,632
I was listening and I just sort of wanted to ask folks or have folks think about a few things.

486
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:36,860
One is, I don't think that this is suggesting that we're taking away discipline.

487
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,261
I think it's

488
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:49,321
suggesting that we're taking a closer look at what the disciplinary measures that have been being used are, how effective they've been, and whether or not color has played or race has played a role.

489
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:55,345
And I think the data shows, I don't think, I know the data shows us that race clearly has played a role.

490
00:46:55,445 --> 00:47:03,970
So we were just listening to a student speaking the other day talking about wearing headphones in the hallway at the high school.

491
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,767
And she, and this wasn't recent, so I don't want anybody to think that this was them.

492
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:26,483
but she talked about walking in the hallway and she's a black woman student and being yelled at and disciplined for having her headphones on in the hallway as a white student was walking by her doing the exact same thing and did not get yelled at, did not get disciplined.

493
00:47:27,023 --> 00:47:28,324
And that is part of the problem.

494
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:30,225
And that is where the implicit bias comes in.

495
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:37,090
I think that people don't realize that we don't realize that we are built with this implicit bias because we are

496
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:47,188
part of a system that we were brought up in and have been part of our entire lives where we see things as threats related to color, unfortunately.

497
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:49,610
And we see them as more threatening when they're related to color.

498
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,912
And that's why we see disproportionality and discipline.

499
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:56,235
I mean, disproportionality and discipline is a national issue in the United States.

500
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,377
It's not something that's specific to Medford.

501
00:47:58,397 --> 00:47:59,458
It's a national issue.

502
00:47:59,938 --> 00:48:03,481
People of color are disproportionately disciplined.

503
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:10,154
in our schools and that, I think, is what Member Rousseau is trying to address in this subcommittee and in this resolution.

504
00:48:10,174 --> 00:48:12,735
And that's what I would like us to really take a look at.

505
00:48:12,775 --> 00:48:24,200
And the discussion that we're not hearing right now, I feel like, is, you know, I appreciated what Stacey Shulman was saying as well about, you know, going back and looking at the events and what sort of triggers the suspension.

506
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,541
And I think that's important, too, to look at the backstories and the data and the information.

507
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:32,283
But the fact still remains that we are still disproportionately disciplining

508
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:42,804
students of color and that is regardless of the instances or the you know what happened or whatever that is a direct result of our own bias and you know

509
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:58,543
I can share sort of one of my own stories, you know, as a mother of a white male student who, you know, in high school, I mean, in middle school, certainly was disciplined, but might have got a phone call home first.

510
00:48:59,183 --> 00:49:08,748
And again, as the co-chair of the CPAC and someone who's involved in the schools and someone who has maybe some means and has a relationship with the administration and all those other things, got phone calls home

511
00:49:09,338 --> 00:49:15,520
Um, from them to address any sort of discipline issues and also, you know, a student on a, on an ed plan.

512
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:23,342
Um, so the disability certainly was a factor in this role, but also in this situation, but also got the benefit of a phone call home.

513
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:32,164
Um, when another parent may not have gotten that, um, maybe because they didn't have a relationship or maybe because they weren't white, or maybe because we don't realize that we do those things.

514
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:35,145
They're not intentional, but they, we do do them.

515
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,446
And so we have to pay attention to those.

516
00:49:37,486 --> 00:49:38,526
And I think that's really.

517
00:49:39,028 --> 00:49:46,222
an important piece, and as much as I wish color wasn't a part of this, it clearly is because the data shows us that.

518
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:46,983
Thank you.

519
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:51,672
Superintendent, you would like to speak, I believe.

520
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,733
Yes, um, and I know there is nays iPhone.

521
00:49:55,773 --> 00:49:59,534
I've really been listening to the conversation this evening.

522
00:49:59,554 --> 00:50:09,058
I also have a document that I would like to share based on your resolution that was presented last week.

523
00:50:09,578 --> 00:50:22,990
with some proposed amendments that we, the administrative team here looked at today and made modifications to the original recommended resolution.

524
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:33,479
And the modifications that were made, we felt were more reflective of what the work could actually look like.

525
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:44,209
So I don't know if you want to take these questions first, and then I share that with just slight modifications.

526
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:50,473
But the essence of what you're trying to say, but at the same time, you know,

527
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:53,355
listening to what Ms.

528
00:50:53,395 --> 00:51:00,259
Moretti shared, and she apologized for sharing her thoughts, but I completely understood what you were saying, Ms.

529
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:00,679
Moretti.

530
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:11,226
And again, there are a lot of contexts and situations that do take place on any given day at a school.

531
00:51:11,306 --> 00:51:12,907
As we know, no two days are identical.

532
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:17,928
And we know that as a district, there is room for improvement.

533
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:21,010
And I am in agreement again with what Ms.

534
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:27,413
Schulman shared earlier about us doing a comprehensive review and really looking at

535
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:40,067
how discipline is meted out across the district, but at the same time also looking and delving deeper into our own implicit biases that do exist.

536
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,308
So we're not denying that.

537
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:45,810
And so after Ms.

538
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:55,456
Ney speaks, I would love to share the screen so the school committee can look at the proposed amendments that the administration

539
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:01,152
was in agreement with making to this resolution.

540
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:01,793
Thank you.

541
00:52:02,393 --> 00:52:02,733
Thank you.

542
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:07,858
Um, I'll have, um, may go next then, uh, member Graham.

543
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:10,159
Where did they go?

544
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,721
Did she, he or she lower their hand?

545
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:14,443
Paul, excuse me.

546
00:52:14,483 --> 00:52:15,644
That was me, Nadine.

547
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:20,868
I, I I'm nays iPhone, but yeah, I was having problems on the computer.

548
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:21,469
So thank you.

549
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:23,270
Thanks.

550
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:23,730
Okay.

551
00:52:24,671 --> 00:52:25,452
Uh, never Graham.

552
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:35,855
So I just wanted to, while we were talking, when I think about accountability, I think about our accountability to all students.

553
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:42,259
And I think we certainly have a responsibility to follow the law.

554
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:53,966
And it's my understanding that those violence issues, particularly that Nadine was talking about, would be cared for under the law and would not

555
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:58,909
this would not supersede any requirements that we have under the law.

556
00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:17,204
So, so there is that, but I also think accountability means figuring out how to not repeat the same situations that sort of escalate, particularly amongst students of color, but for any student at that, for that matter.

557
00:53:18,185 --> 00:53:22,889
And to make sure that we are doing the things that, that we need to do as a district,

558
00:53:23,629 --> 00:53:36,935
to deescalate those issues and to help those students sort of assess why their behavior is sort of leading to this place and get them on a better path.

559
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:51,422
But while we were talking, I looked at some other districts and I just wanted to note that Arlington High's out of school suspension rate is 2.1% to our eight

560
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:58,117
I'm looking at Malden right now.

561
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:08,163
Malden's out of school suspension rate is 7.9% at Malden High to our 8 point something percent.

562
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:17,287
And, you know, I just think we have an obligation to try to do better than we're doing.

563
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:20,667
I think we all agree on that.

564
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:28,670
And I don't know why there's so much resistance to saying we're gonna make a goal and move towards that goal in a meaningful way.

565
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:37,674
And frankly, to put the school committee on the hook for the resources and the prioritization of these goals, which is our job.

566
00:54:37,934 --> 00:54:41,916
So it is our job to decide what those priorities are.

567
00:54:43,177 --> 00:54:45,898
Obviously with a lot of input and direction from

568
00:54:46,832 --> 00:54:52,775
all of the administrators on the phone, which is frankly shocking given that school goes back tomorrow, that you all are here.

569
00:54:55,256 --> 00:55:03,600
And I wanna point out that it feels like you're all here because you're here to tell us that we're wrong and that out of school suspensions are not a problem.

570
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:12,624
And maybe that's not exactly why you're all here, but I would like to see us all get to a place where we can agree that goals are okay to have,

571
00:55:13,483 --> 00:55:21,549
And that in terms of working to achieve a goal, accountability is critically important.

572
00:55:22,129 --> 00:55:40,963
And that is on both the student and on incumbent on us to set those priorities and to do what we can to mitigate out of school suspensions in total, but also specifically for students who are disproportionately being suspended out of school.

573
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:52,588
I'll stop there, but I just wanted to point out that it feels like you're all very against this, and I really haven't heard anybody say why.

574
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:58,090
I just want to say one quick thing.

575
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:03,433
When I was writing the resolution, I didn't just sit down and pop it out in a half an hour and call it a day.

576
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:12,758
I mean, I did, I would say, many hours of research and read plenty of articles about how just banning it and calling it a day

577
00:56:13,527 --> 00:56:16,729
creates full-blown chaos and it's a nightmare for districts.

578
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:25,475
And there are plenty of districts that have done that in California, for instance, where no resources and no planning and no alternatives were even considered.

579
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:34,941
It was just the school boards over there, just like it might've been in the legislature, just said no out-of-school suspensions and chaos ensued.

580
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:38,364
And often that stuff was even reversed so bad.

581
00:56:40,532 --> 00:56:45,956
want to be clear that this resolution was not an attempt to just, you know, stick it to you all.

582
00:56:46,376 --> 00:56:47,377
That wasn't the goal.

583
00:56:47,697 --> 00:57:01,047
The goal was to, as Member Graham pointed out, you know, if we pass this, it is inclusive of the requirement that we provide the resources, which I heard earlier from Mr. Peleba and Ms.

584
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:07,652
Schulman that, you know, there was a program, it wasn't necessarily the best one, but then the resources just went away.

585
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:09,093
So, you know,

586
00:57:10,711 --> 00:57:19,877
The committee has to be as committed to making this happen long after, if we pass this, long after this passes.

587
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:29,122
Because we can't just forget at budget time that the restorative justice or whatever other program, that it's not free.

588
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:32,444
Aside from the staff, literally there's a lot of costs.

589
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:38,188
And I went to every single session on restorative justice at school committee conferences,

590
00:57:38,578 --> 00:57:39,339
on how to do it right.

591
00:57:40,379 --> 00:57:47,385
And most importantly, I was looking at what not to do, because every district seemed to have a story about how they screwed that up.

592
00:57:48,806 --> 00:58:07,560
And the theme among all of those districts that the biggest takeaways for how to not do it right was to not put any resources into it, to just think your staff is going to wake up in the morning and know what restorative justice is, or do it in one grade level and just hope it kind of just flows up.

593
00:58:08,843 --> 00:58:15,729
So this is not an attempt to just flip a switch, call it a day, and put a check mark next to our names that we cared.

594
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:21,994
So I think Mr. Assistant Superintendent Murphy would like to speak.

595
00:58:22,634 --> 00:58:22,894
Yes.

596
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:30,881
Thank you, Mr. So I just would like to briefly respond to Ms.

597
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:31,541
Graham's comments.

598
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:36,966
But I think I can fully understand how it could feel as though there's

599
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:40,433
some level of resistance.

600
00:58:41,114 --> 00:58:48,631
I don't think it's the, and the superintendent can obviously speak to this, but I don't think it's the superintendent's or excuse me, the administration's position that

601
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,951
there is not a need to look very closely at these issues.

602
00:58:54,451 --> 00:59:05,654
Because I think some of the statistics that you've read, and frankly, the experiences that districts across the state and the country are having, indicates that we have to look at proportionality.

603
00:59:06,035 --> 00:59:18,378
And when we see evidence of disproportionality, the only way to combat that is to hold ourselves accountable and put some of the measures in place and set some of the expectations from the school committee

604
00:59:18,758 --> 00:59:20,919
And I think, so I think it's an appropriate topic.

605
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:34,126
And I think it's, I think that the motion as it was introduced at the last school committee meeting establishes the contours in which we as a district can try to get to a place where you don't have

606
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,423
what appears at first glance to be relatively glaring evidence of disproportionality.

607
00:59:39,763 --> 00:59:48,870
So I think our view as a team is that this is a really important issue that warrants the committee's attention and requires action on the part of the administration.

608
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:57,716
That being said, I think there's two pieces that folks as the practitioners have reservations about.

609
00:59:58,197 --> 00:59:59,357
And the first is to Ms.

610
00:59:59,578 --> 01:00:04,101
Schulman's point that there's a need to establish more comprehensive data

611
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:08,823
if we are going to get to a place where we really understand what the causes are.

612
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:10,144
I think that's one piece.

613
01:00:10,425 --> 01:00:13,849
I don't think anything in the motion as written, frankly, prevents us from doing that.

614
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:14,710
But I think Ms.

615
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:21,578
Graham's point about potentially having an additional provision that sets a timeline by which the administration can investigate the issues

616
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,247
and report back as to what we're finding.

617
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:25,548
I think that's critical.

618
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:50,065
The second piece, and again, the people that are on the ground serving as assistant principals and principals can speak to this better, but I think what's important to remember is that while there is no law that would always, that would require on a per se basis, a student be excluded from school, the laws and the processes that are contemplated by those laws are meant to create a situation in which

619
01:00:50,558 --> 01:00:52,359
the exclusions are very rare.

620
01:00:53,399 --> 01:01:11,905
And the challenge is, if a district via a school committee policy were to prohibit out of – to prohibit exclusions of any kind – this, I see, is obviously designed for out of school, but people have already spoken to that distinction or lack thereof.

621
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:30,059
That if we were to prohibit it at the district level, you would have administrators who would find themselves in situations in which they have a statutory authority and therefore implicit responsibility to respond to a situation in which there are concerns about safety and the only way to do that.

622
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:37,729
to exercise their statutory authority would be to act in a way that is inconsistent with school committee policy.

623
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:43,637
And that I think sets up an inevitable conflict and where you have administrators who feel they have an obligation

624
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:51,645
to exercise the statutory power that they have been given by the legislature, but also a responsibility to adhere to the policies of the school committee.

625
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:55,888
And so what we've tried to do with the proposed amendments is to qualify it.

626
01:01:56,209 --> 01:02:10,440
That makes it very clear that the Medford Public Schools, through the governing body of the Medford Public Schools, has attempted to make very clear that from our organizing principle is we do not want students excluded from school.

627
01:02:10,967 --> 01:02:22,356
but that in those rare instances that are contemplated by the statute, the administration would still have the right to exercise its authority to exclude under those very narrow and very few circumstances.

628
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:29,902
And I think what's not in the amendments that we've provided, but what I think would be a strong addition would be the reporting piece that we've talked about.

629
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:36,508
So that way, when this policy gets into effect, both before and I would argue after, we can look to see if

630
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:45,955
this is advancing the objective that the committee has articulated, which is to essentially narrow the lane by which students are excluded.

631
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:46,996
And I think that would be important.

632
01:02:47,016 --> 01:02:57,665
But I think the concern is, I do not think that the administration's comments in any way represent an aversion to the public policy goal that's inherent in the proposed policy.

633
01:02:57,985 --> 01:03:03,170
But I do think there is concern, Esther, from an implementation perspective, there will be instances

634
01:03:03,732 --> 01:03:09,073
They should be rare, where due to safety concerns, the administration has to exclude a student from school.

635
01:03:09,513 --> 01:03:14,174
And when we do that, we don't want to be doing so in violation of a school committee policy.

636
01:03:15,634 --> 01:03:18,175
Thank you, Dave, Mr. Barker.

637
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:23,136
I just would use the words implied disproportionality, I believe you said.

638
01:03:23,956 --> 01:03:24,876
Let's be crystal clear.

639
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:26,316
There is no implication here.

640
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:30,597
It is absolutely no question that it is disproportionate.

641
01:03:31,692 --> 01:03:34,573
And any argument against that, I would just love to hear.

642
01:03:35,754 --> 01:03:36,714
I certainly don't have one.

643
01:03:36,754 --> 01:03:39,075
And I'm seeing the data that you are.

644
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:41,816
And I think that's why this is a conversation that we have to have.

645
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:45,617
And it's an issue that has to be addressed.

646
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:46,938
I don't think there's any question about that.

647
01:03:47,298 --> 01:03:52,920
It's just a question of how we address it so as to not create additional problems in the future.

648
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,020
Sure.

649
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,701
Thank you.

650
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:57,981
Looking at the amendments on the screen, and then I will call on Ms.

651
01:03:58,121 --> 01:03:58,562
Rodriguez.

652
01:04:00,353 --> 01:04:04,636
You know, across the nation, I don't really mind that part.

653
01:04:04,736 --> 01:04:06,177
It does sound a bit defensive.

654
01:04:06,558 --> 01:04:12,322
It's like, let's be clear, it's not just a Medford problem, but I think what just happened to me.

655
01:04:13,763 --> 01:04:14,384
I lost that.

656
01:04:14,844 --> 01:04:18,507
It's a tough time for it to cut out.

657
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:19,467
Yeah.

658
01:04:20,968 --> 01:04:21,869
Maryse, was that yours?

659
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,231
I stopped the share.

660
01:04:24,851 --> 01:04:25,952
Oh, OK.

661
01:04:26,933 --> 01:04:27,934
Why don't we let Ms.

662
01:04:27,974 --> 01:04:29,375
Rodriguez speak now, since she

663
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:33,262
Hi, I think I have two points.

664
01:04:33,422 --> 01:04:40,904
And that is that all three that whatever is done for an evaluation has to go down below the high school level.

665
01:04:41,485 --> 01:04:44,026
I see these issues at the middle school all the time.

666
01:04:44,326 --> 01:04:52,489
And by the time the kids get to high school, they're already kind of tagged as problems when really that's I don't think the case for some of them.

667
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:56,450
So it has to go down and not just be about suspensions, but

668
01:04:56,983 --> 01:05:01,044
about dress code violations and in trouble in the hall and everything else.

669
01:05:01,104 --> 01:05:08,825
It can't just be the kids who get all the way to the end because the problem starts in the beginning when kids are called out for certain things all the time.

670
01:05:08,865 --> 01:05:13,966
And I think that's where you're gonna also find a lot more of the implicit bias.

671
01:05:15,366 --> 01:05:19,967
I am very worried about there being no accountability for this.

672
01:05:21,267 --> 01:05:25,708
It's great to enact a rule or whatever, but if somebody is not looking at these statistics

673
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:35,800
on a regular basis and knowing who is the person who is handing out this discipline, not just the person who ultimately makes the decision, but the person who calls the students out.

674
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:44,825
That's how you get back to the person and have an honest conversation about why did you call this person out as opposed to, you know, this other person.

675
01:05:44,885 --> 01:05:51,769
Because I think that until you're confronted with your biases, you can't really overcome them and be a better person in this situation.

676
01:05:52,540 --> 01:06:02,228
And I will also say that I thought that the comment about the perceived bias in the data, I would say I didn't like that comment either.

677
01:06:02,328 --> 01:06:17,239
I don't think that there's any, the data is completely clear that two thirds or more of the kids are low income, all these minority are all these things.

678
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,723
And I think that it's a problem that it hasn't been discovered

679
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:29,403
by the school, the city itself, as opposed to the city, the school itself, as opposed to the city council having to bring it up.

680
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:32,465
That's it.

681
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:32,886
Thank you.

682
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:36,668
Is there another, Mr. Downs?

683
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:41,512
Thank you, member Russo.

684
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:44,901
Again, I'm similar to Mr. Murphy here.

685
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:48,203
I'm not, we're not here to, you know, argue with you or anything like that.

686
01:06:48,343 --> 01:06:50,244
I hope you understand that.

687
01:06:50,284 --> 01:06:59,269
This is, you know, I've been doing this for 21 years and there have been many students who have come across my desk who've done things that are very, very bad that I won't even give you those examples.

688
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:05,053
And that's one of those times where, you know, suspensions or the exclusions do come into play.

689
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:11,924
And for an example, we're all here because we don't want students to be targeted or anything like that.

690
01:07:12,004 --> 01:07:14,368
But in the instances where students are targeted,

691
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:36,238
and students' civil rights are violated, and they are feeling threatened at school, to say that we can't remove a student who is targeting students, and therefore that victim has to watch and look at that student perhaps in the very next day, that's just another example.

692
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:41,681
isn't always crystal clear and we're here to work together.

693
01:07:42,201 --> 01:07:51,025
But those are examples where sometimes we have to protect the victims that have things happen to them in school or out of school that does affect them in school.

694
01:07:51,685 --> 01:07:58,608
And so we don't want to have always, we don't want that ability to protect those victims necessarily removed from us either.

695
01:07:58,728 --> 01:08:00,529
So thank you for your time, Mr. Russo.

696
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,490
Thank you.

697
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:06,352
I think this is a really, really important point that Mr. Downs just brought up.

698
01:08:07,113 --> 01:08:14,259
You know, and I could never for a second defend, you know, suggest that we not defend victims.

699
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:26,030
But I also want to remind everybody that I don't believe there's any spot in the law that says we can just permanently take a student and never educate them because they have become a perpetrator against the victim.

700
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,632
They still have to get an education too.

701
01:08:29,613 --> 01:08:34,437
We're not talking about adults who can be just sent off to the prison and never seen again.

702
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,641
We're talking about a kid who did something wrong to another kid.

703
01:08:38,402 --> 01:08:42,204
And looking at the data, there's been no sexual assaults reported.

704
01:08:42,344 --> 01:08:43,645
I find that hard to imagine.

705
01:08:44,005 --> 01:08:48,347
I'm guessing it's, again, more of we're not reporting it the way it really happens.

706
01:08:49,028 --> 01:08:52,890
And I find that really problematic.

707
01:08:53,170 --> 01:09:04,496
But when a kid does something to another kid, no matter how egregious, that other kid is coming back to school, whether it's tomorrow, a week from now,

708
01:09:04,977 --> 01:09:09,278
the victim doesn't suddenly become whole and happy and like it never happened.

709
01:09:09,998 --> 01:09:19,540
So if the approach is to use punitive measures against the perpetrator, and that's the end of the story, we're not helping the victims at all.

710
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,760
Because first of all, the perpetrators are likely to be doing it again.

711
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:32,342
So I mean, the short term problem of dealing with an incident can't be the whole plan.

712
01:09:34,622 --> 01:09:45,910
How do we make it so that these two kids who are in the same AP bio class are going to be able to be in the same AP bio class for the rest of the semester?

713
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:54,276
Suspending one of them isn't going to make it easy on the other person, the other student, at all.

714
01:09:54,376 --> 01:09:58,919
I mean, they might feel better for a minute, like, yay, Johnny got suspended for doing what he did to me.

715
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:04,170
that doesn't make it any more comfortable for the victims.

716
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:09,214
And so I just think that focusing on, and that's the whole point of restorative justice.

717
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:14,898
And that is just in the resolution, it is such as restorative justice.

718
01:10:15,338 --> 01:10:18,200
This is not prescriptive as to what the school system will do.

719
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:22,903
I would leave it to the professionals to figure out what the right choice is.

720
01:10:22,963 --> 01:10:27,606
Restorative justice is one of several programs that are available and I have not evaluated them.

721
01:10:27,987 --> 01:10:31,049
And that's why it's not prescriptive as to what one gets to use.

722
01:10:32,115 --> 01:10:34,576
It's just the only, it's the one I've heard of the most.

723
01:10:35,716 --> 01:10:45,320
So, but, you know, the whole scenario that we have to be able to take the kid out that did something terrible, we're not talking about murder here.

724
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:52,522
Like, and we're not, according to the statistics that we keep reporting, we're not talking about sexual assaults and rapes.

725
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:59,685
We're talking about, according to this, the vast majority of these are non-violent, non-drug,

726
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,212
criminal offenses.

727
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:07,094
So that's not Johnny punched somebody in the face.

728
01:11:07,154 --> 01:11:10,957
That's not a rape.

729
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:26,948
The vast majority of these kids who are losing their education and are having increased probability of ending up in prison are kids that are doing things that I'm betting everybody on this call has done all of those things, many of those things.

730
01:11:28,268 --> 01:11:29,129
So I just think

731
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:33,331
We need to be careful with false equivalencies and drawing generalities.

732
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:43,495
And I also think that even for those severe things, unless there's some kind of loophole I know of where we can just say, Johnny, you don't ever come back to Medford Public Schools.

733
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:44,656
Good luck.

734
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:47,076
That kid's coming back.

735
01:11:47,497 --> 01:11:49,597
And that kid's going to make the victim uncomfortable.

736
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:51,658
So let's worry about that.

737
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:55,540
I'm worried about that.

738
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,720
My son's a ninth grader.

739
01:11:57,389 --> 01:12:00,051
Is he going to do anything wrong in his whole four years in high school?

740
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:00,651
I'm sure.

741
01:12:00,671 --> 01:12:04,834
And I hope that we have a plan more than just punishing him.

742
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,355
What about the person that got hurt?

743
01:12:07,696 --> 01:12:11,538
So who else wants to talk?

744
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:12,759
Ms.

745
01:12:12,779 --> 01:12:15,221
Graham?

746
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:22,566
I think that the edits that the superintendent shared, I'm generally fine with.

747
01:12:22,766 --> 01:12:23,066
I would.

748
01:12:23,658 --> 01:12:27,800
still ask that a program review be formally added to this resolution.

749
01:12:28,701 --> 01:12:47,230
And I would like to see the program review be about discipline in a broader sense than simply out of school suspension, because I think Maria is right that it's, we can't just feel good about solving like this tiny piece of the problem so that our metrics look good.

750
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:52,012
Like I want us to be endeavoring to do better

751
01:12:53,126 --> 01:12:53,926
sort of overall.

752
01:12:54,006 --> 01:13:03,088
So I think that that program review has to be a little bit more, um, sort of broad in its, um, in its review of discipline.

753
01:13:03,108 --> 01:13:10,189
Um, and I mean, that could include everything like up to and including taking recess away.

754
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:14,150
And we have, uh, we have a resolution that is tabled about recess.

755
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:21,731
Um, it continues to be a point of pain at the elementary schools, and maybe it's not like the most immediate thing because we're not going back into a school building tomorrow.

756
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:28,013
but it's a form of discipline that begins at the elementary school.

757
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:39,556
So I would like to still see us add that program review and craft some language that casts like a broader net so that we can address discipline in a comprehensive sense.

758
01:13:40,597 --> 01:13:45,358
And then I think to Mr. Murphy's point, there should be a number seven.

759
01:13:45,558 --> 01:13:50,000
So we're up to seven now that establishes some sort of reporting

760
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:58,300
on an annual basis where we all reflect upon ourselves about, are we making the right progress?

761
01:13:58,961 --> 01:14:00,442
Are our programs working?

762
01:14:02,303 --> 01:14:12,668
It sounds to me like it has to be a little bit more detailed in some way, and perhaps the program review can recommend what that way is, but I think that data

763
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:30,041
is informative to us to say are the programs that we're funding effective, but I think that data also needs to be parsed and provided in a feedback loop to those people issuing the discipline so that they can understand

764
01:14:31,115 --> 01:14:43,398
What discipline are they delivering and how does that compare to the system overall so that we can help people be aware of their unconscious biases?

765
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:45,619
Because it's not a criticism.

766
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,399
I mean, it is a criticism and it's not.

767
01:14:47,499 --> 01:14:49,760
We all have those and we all

768
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:55,830
need to be willing to look at how those are playing out in real time.

769
01:14:55,910 --> 01:15:10,594
So I think that that reporting mechanism needs to allow our staff to reflect on their own kind of part in this process, and not in a disciplinary way, but in a I think we all want to be better at our jobs kind of way.

770
01:15:12,423 --> 01:15:19,270
but that reporting should be informative in the macro level program sense, but also in the individual sense.

771
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:27,818
And that's when I think data and reporting sort of meet together to provide something really meaningful that can help us move forward.

772
01:15:27,838 --> 01:15:32,783
So those will be my two additions to what the superintendent shared as well.

773
01:15:34,605 --> 01:15:34,925
Thank you.

774
01:15:38,168 --> 01:15:38,808
Thank you.

775
01:15:39,089 --> 01:15:42,571
Um, member Graham, can you send me those two additions in the chat just for the notes?

776
01:15:42,911 --> 01:15:45,232
Um, I got the first one, but not the second.

777
01:15:45,893 --> 01:15:47,574
And then, um, thank you.

778
01:15:48,214 --> 01:15:57,860
And then, um, you know, I also just am hoping people recognize the fact that the rules policy and equity subcommittee is a new subcommittee.

779
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,682
We had not had an equity subcommittee before.

780
01:16:01,902 --> 01:16:04,704
Um, we've certainly had rules, um, subcommittee and,

781
01:16:06,017 --> 01:16:12,001
and policy, but equity is a different lens that we're really putting to the issue.

782
01:16:12,061 --> 01:16:14,083
And I think it's a really important perspective.

783
01:16:14,123 --> 01:16:21,769
And so when we're talking about reporting out, who are we reporting out to, you know, on an annual basis of that, you know, if that's sort of the

784
01:16:23,223 --> 01:16:31,585
The point is that, you know, I would say to the equity subcommittee specifically, um, to sort of look at this, but also within the administration, of course.

785
01:16:31,745 --> 01:16:34,886
And then I also believe I don't have it in front of me.

786
01:16:35,446 --> 01:16:38,527
Um, and I don't know, I believe I saw Joan on the call, uh, Ms.

787
01:16:38,567 --> 01:16:47,490
Bowen, but the coordinated program review, which happens every three years, um, and it's happening this year for the district and includes our high needs.

788
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,211
Uh, uh, some of our high needs population, our English learners and our, um,

789
01:16:52,082 --> 01:16:58,504
students with disabilities has an element of discipline in the CPR program review.

790
01:16:58,564 --> 01:17:00,885
So that's an important piece to also look at.

791
01:17:00,945 --> 01:17:04,266
And that will be coming starting this year.

792
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:07,007
So I think they report out in the spring.

793
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:10,148
So that might be an interesting opportunity for a look at data.

794
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:16,971
But Joan, if you're still here, can you address the section on CPR around discipline?

795
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:18,611
Yep.

796
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:19,191
So I'm here.

797
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:20,152
So can everyone hear me?

798
01:17:20,732 --> 01:17:20,912
Yes.

799
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:31,045
So we are the extent, we were given an extension to provide our documentation for, it's actually called our tiered focus monitoring now.

800
01:17:32,185 --> 01:17:42,130
So we do have a item about student discipline and we have to, I don't have the document in front of me which describes it.

801
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:52,944
But we will be taking a deeper look at student discipline for students with disabilities, our EL population, and need to look at that closely and complete a report regarding that.

802
01:17:53,824 --> 01:17:56,225
It will be submitted October 21st.

803
01:17:56,385 --> 01:18:05,549
And then after that time, DESE will review our documents that we submitted, and then they will be coming out for a record review.

804
01:18:05,669 --> 01:18:07,910
I'm not sure when they'll be doing that.

805
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,911
Typically, we were supposed to have this in

806
01:18:10,985 --> 01:18:13,927
at the springtime, but due to COVID, they've extended it.

807
01:18:14,007 --> 01:18:21,955
So once we provide all our documentation, then they will come out and visit the schools and look at all the documentation that we have provided to them.

808
01:18:21,975 --> 01:18:23,876
Thank you.

809
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:29,982
And is it also an opportunity in that I know that they speak directly with CPAC, but there's also opportunities for

810
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:36,349
families to reach out to DESE as part of their, they're not calling it a Coordinated Program Review anymore?

811
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:39,791
Oh, no, they just want to- No, they changed it, so it's just peer-focused monitoring.

812
01:18:39,811 --> 01:18:41,492
Peer-focused monitoring.

813
01:18:41,652 --> 01:18:42,112
Oh, okay.

814
01:18:42,232 --> 01:18:44,793
So TFM now, not CPR.

815
01:18:45,374 --> 01:18:46,314
Right.

816
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:54,799
But I find it to be a very valuable source of data for folks that are on the call.

817
01:18:54,839 --> 01:18:57,860
You can look at the last one, which was three years ago, right, Joan?

818
01:18:58,321 --> 01:18:58,401
Yes.

819
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:03,435
You can look at the last one that was three years ago to really get a sense of what the data is in that.

820
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:06,037
And it's very, very interesting data.

821
01:19:06,438 --> 01:19:21,893
And additionally, as DESE is doing the tiered focused monitoring research, community members and administrators and, you know, staff and school committee members and whoever can reach out to them and

822
01:19:22,301 --> 01:19:28,062
give them information or ask them questions or ask them to include information in the report and review.

823
01:19:28,102 --> 01:19:28,942
And it's really helpful.

824
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:32,763
And I know that they definitely reach out to the CPAC.

825
01:19:32,803 --> 01:19:38,904
I think they have some other requirements about who else they reach out to specifically in the community, but anybody can reach out to them.

826
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,384
So I think that's a really important piece.

827
01:19:41,564 --> 01:19:41,964
Thank you.

828
01:19:42,685 --> 01:19:43,305
Thank you.

829
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:43,925
Mr. Velpe?

830
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:49,946
Yeah, I find all of this very, very interesting.

831
01:19:51,141 --> 01:20:08,845
having brought about 36 years of experience in different administrative positions, whether it be director, director principal at the Curtis House or different schools that have since been closed due to inclusionary practices.

832
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:15,287
But I want to just bring us all to the fact that

833
01:20:17,593 --> 01:20:44,024
When these things are occurring, these incidents that are occurring that have had people, our children suspended, and we're trying to do the right thing, I think one of the things that's very important is to be able to observe the types of behavior

834
01:20:45,406 --> 01:21:02,030
And it is only then that we get a good sense of how we treat, what the response should be in terms of a social emotional norms that we're trying to set, what this subcommittee is trying to set.

835
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:13,952
It's very important that people get a firsthand look in the different settings, whether it be in the middle school, high school,

836
01:21:15,095 --> 01:21:33,847
any kinds of different types of settings, even the settings that we send students to after much evaluation and much thought, I want to just say that we all need to be interested.

837
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:37,068
The rules are there, but I think the observation

838
01:21:45,294 --> 01:21:50,936
is also necessary by all of us in those situations.

839
01:21:52,317 --> 01:22:12,485
And if one could see, get a bird's eye view of some of the incidents that in the past have, that I've experienced that had in fact required what was left to do even before we started

840
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:31,333
speaking about this equity thing, I think this has been eye opening and we should continue to progress along those lines, but also get a good view of what is going on within the school buildings themselves.

841
01:22:31,873 --> 01:22:40,099
It'd be difficult to do it during this time, but there are situations, as soon as we are back in full strength,

842
01:22:41,385 --> 01:22:52,676
I don't suggest that we put any of this on hold, but the observation within the building is a real necessary situation for all to see.

843
01:22:53,957 --> 01:22:54,277
Thank you.

844
01:22:59,482 --> 01:22:59,842
Thank you.

845
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:02,203
It's actually Michael Lyman.

846
01:23:02,523 --> 01:23:03,303
I'm a school parent.

847
01:23:04,084 --> 01:23:21,570
And I just wanted to address one of the administration's proposed edits on the resolution, which was in the first point of the resolution, where the original language, which I do support, says that the Medford Public Schools will end the use of out-of-school suspensions effective the first day of the school year 2021.

848
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,532
And the administration has asked to edit that to add, except as permitted by law.

849
01:23:27,572 --> 01:23:33,556
And I suspect that the administration's intention is something other than what it reads as literally.

850
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:47,986
But if this were taken as written, except as permitted by law, is not going to make any change in what has actually been the practice in the Medford public schools, unless the Medford public schools have been acting contrary to law prior to this.

851
01:23:49,267 --> 01:23:53,689
So I would ask the administration to please clarify what exactly they're trying to get at.

852
01:23:53,769 --> 01:24:00,772
Is it the specific instances of violence or drugs or other things that are called out in the law?

853
01:24:02,312 --> 01:24:06,714
Or are they intending here to actually try to simply neuter the entire resolution?

854
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:07,595
Thank you.

855
01:24:10,196 --> 01:24:10,716
Mr. Murphy?

856
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:13,817
The intent is not to neuter the entire resolution.

857
01:24:13,837 --> 01:24:18,279
There is a multi-part motion that was originally drafted that

858
01:24:18,814 --> 01:24:31,298
includes a series of additional affirmative obligations, but as written originally, would prevent the administration from exercising the statutory authority that has been vested within it.

859
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:43,222
And to do that, as I mentioned earlier, would put the administration in a very difficult position in which they would have to choose between violating a school play policy or

860
01:24:43,902 --> 01:24:52,950
failing to exercise a statutory authority that they've been given for a very specific reason to keep the school community safe.

861
01:24:53,250 --> 01:25:05,460
And so the reference to the statutory authority was intended to make sure that it was clear that the administration has a dual obligation both to follow the policy

862
01:25:06,036 --> 01:25:10,917
and to follow the law and to give the administration the necessary space to do that.

863
01:25:11,378 --> 01:25:24,041
The remainder of the policy speaks both to the values that the school committee would be articulating and expecting the administration to uphold and to the additional, as I said, affirmative obligations that the administration would have

864
01:25:24,656 --> 01:25:37,718
both with regard to from a reporting perspective, based on the discussion we've had tonight, and with regard to the implementation of restorative justice practices that are not currently statutory obligations on the part of the administration.

865
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:41,039
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

866
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:54,081
So I guess my question, and I apologize for not knowing this, but if we pass this, and of course you are suspending as required or allowed under statutory

867
01:25:54,585 --> 01:26:17,502
authority, and looking at the current Department of Ed dashboard, which is terrible, if anybody's not looked at it, you're lucky, is it a breach of any privacy rules for you to tell us explicitly what those suspensions were as related to how they were covered by the law?

868
01:26:18,117 --> 01:26:19,518
So that's a good question.

869
01:26:19,558 --> 01:26:23,682
I'd want to take a little bit of time to review it and probably consult with Mr Greenspan.

870
01:26:23,702 --> 01:26:33,151
But I what I would say is that the reporting that I've seen from Dusty before has essentially categories and it will itemize the nature of the disciplinary offenses.

871
01:26:33,591 --> 01:26:36,774
Could a school committee ask for even greater detail?

872
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:52,216
than what is required under the regulatory requirements, but Bessie, I suspect the answer to that is yes, but as your question applies, up to a point, because at some point, there would be the risk of being able to infer people's identities and things like that.

873
01:26:52,256 --> 01:26:59,779
So my guess is that there's somewhere, some room in between where the regulations end and where a school policy would need to end.

874
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:00,960
Right.

875
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,841
I think if I'm not,

876
01:27:04,255 --> 01:27:29,173
speaking for Michael that just spoke, you know, I mean, having this opening, which is there whether we put that in there or not, is fine as long as we can have a, you know, trust but verify that the stuff you put into that category is in fact, we can verify that you truly put the right things in that category.

877
01:27:30,353 --> 01:27:47,014
You know, I don't believe that the reporting on the Department of Ed's website is actually, unfortunately, and I don't, I mean, it's such a terrible website that I'm not surprised, but they really should just have a, you know, a section for required by that statute 222 or whatever it was.

878
01:27:48,523 --> 01:27:50,464
a whole dropdown that just simply lists that.

879
01:27:50,564 --> 01:27:56,708
So those would be the ones that you have to report that way and that you don't have a choice on suspension or something.

880
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:58,710
Unfortunately, they don't do that.

881
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:11,619
So I, you know, I just, you know, it can't be that today the report shows that 81% of the suspensions are for non-violence, non-drug and non-criminal related offenses.

882
01:28:11,739 --> 01:28:13,680
And then we do this and two years from now,

883
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:21,764
It turns out that we're at 80% of our suspensions are for violence, as if suddenly the whole population became violent overnight.

884
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:26,025
So I think we're all on the same page there, but.

885
01:28:26,685 --> 01:28:28,025
Can I just say quickly?

886
01:28:28,605 --> 01:28:30,566
Yeah.

887
01:28:30,926 --> 01:28:41,848
If the policy objective is achieved and the total number of exclusions is significantly reduced, then you very, I think it's likely that you would see that type of reversal.

888
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:48,591
where there would be a very high percentage that would be for those offenses that I think we all agree.

889
01:28:49,371 --> 01:29:01,035
I don't want to be presumptuous, but I think there's a consensus that there are some offenses that warrant an exclusion from school.

890
01:29:01,655 --> 01:29:06,717
I think there are very few, and I think they should happen on very rare occasions.

891
01:29:07,477 --> 01:29:10,538
When we're mostly remote, they should happen virtually at no times.

892
01:29:11,462 --> 01:29:23,745
There are some, but if the overall number comes down with regard to exclusions, then it stands to reason that the percentage that should go up are the things that we agree we should exclude students from school on those occasions.

893
01:29:23,805 --> 01:29:26,186
I think we can agree on the last part of that, not on the first part.

894
01:29:27,066 --> 01:29:33,267
I mean, if the student has not been imprisoned, they still have a right to an education.

895
01:29:33,287 --> 01:29:36,148
I agree with that part of it.

896
01:29:36,328 --> 01:29:38,609
And that is a statutory obligation, whether I agree or not.

897
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:41,751
Um, I don't know whose hand was up next.

898
01:29:41,771 --> 01:29:43,192
I think it was miss member grams.

899
01:29:43,933 --> 01:29:52,061
So I just, um, I sent these to, uh, to member McLaughlin, but I just wanted to, um, read them out loud.

900
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:59,027
Um, because as I was typing, I was like riffing a little bit over what I said earlier.

901
01:29:59,087 --> 01:30:01,369
So I just wanted to make sure I was clear about what this says.

902
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:02,490
So, um,

903
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:12,117
On the program review, the administration will complete a comprehensive program review of disciplinary practices across the district, including, but not limited to the use of out-of-school suspensions.

904
01:30:12,798 --> 01:30:23,067
The program review will recommend mitigation and improvement strategies and will provide specific recommendations on how student victims are supported through our disciplinary practices.

905
01:30:23,187 --> 01:30:29,032
So that does resonate with me as a woman, as somebody who,

906
01:30:31,775 --> 01:30:39,017
you know, women often are in a position where they are the victim, and there's very little recourse.

907
01:30:40,257 --> 01:30:48,220
And the likelihood of, you know, it sounds like we are lucky that we don't have sexual assaults in our midst.

908
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:51,260
If that's true, I think that's wonderful.

909
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:57,162
If it's not true, we need to be committed to reporting those as they are.

910
01:30:58,482 --> 01:31:00,363
But the vast majority of those

911
01:31:01,044 --> 01:31:11,628
those situations if they occur, that student who assaulted another student, particularly a woman, is going to be right back in class.

912
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:22,713
So I do want us to be focused in our program review on not just the discipline part of it, but how are we supporting those students who are victims?

913
01:31:23,973 --> 01:31:25,514
Because I do think they're important.

914
01:31:25,654 --> 01:31:29,135
And the goal of reducing out-of-school suspensions is not to

915
01:31:31,798 --> 01:31:36,482
ignore the importance of the victims in a particular situation.

916
01:31:36,602 --> 01:31:44,509
So I want there to be some focus and some time spent on how we are supporting students who may fall into that category.

917
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:49,473
And then the other piece was about the reporting requirements.

918
01:31:50,270 --> 01:32:02,353
The program review will identify annual reporting requirements that include, but is not limited to, system-wide disciplinary measures reporting to the school committee, as well as establishing a staff feedback process.

919
01:32:02,734 --> 01:32:11,296
And to Tony's point earlier, most people don't have the luxury of seeing this stuff in action.

920
01:32:13,354 --> 01:32:15,739
or the misfortune of seeing this stuff in action.

921
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:21,853
I don't know what the right qualifier is there, but what I would say is that

922
01:32:22,975 --> 01:32:27,618
It's not shocking to me that our reporting is totally inadequate on this front.

923
01:32:28,799 --> 01:32:34,824
I think as a district, we lack systemic support for the work that you guys do every day.

924
01:32:36,525 --> 01:32:45,792
And we need to commit to providing you the kind of support that would allow you to be able to describe those things in a consistent way and in a uniform way.

925
01:32:46,432 --> 01:32:59,242
so that when people ask about what's happening, there's a way that you can provide that information that doesn't require 25 people on a Zoom sharing anecdotal stories, right?

926
01:32:59,463 --> 01:33:13,754
But instead that there's some way that the reporting mechanisms you guys use provide you sufficient space and detail to be able to tell us what's happening and to aggregate it

927
01:33:14,249 --> 01:33:20,641
Because for all kinds of reasons, we're not all like right there in the thick of those situations as they happen.

928
01:33:21,623 --> 01:33:22,484
But it doesn't mean that

929
01:33:26,618 --> 01:33:31,179
people don't care or that people don't want to know, I just think it simply means that they're not there.

930
01:33:31,419 --> 01:33:44,343
And so the reporting and the systemic support of the work you guys are doing in that moment has to be there and it has to be easy for you all to comply with and be accurate about, otherwise it's not worth doing.

931
01:33:45,643 --> 01:33:53,065
And I have no idea how you report this stuff, but I continue to get mimeographed pages home

932
01:33:53,885 --> 01:34:06,395
from 1982, and I'm just here to say that it's probably consistent that we need to do better as a district in giving you guys the systemic support that you need to do what we're asking you to do.

933
01:34:08,116 --> 01:34:11,579
That is precisely, Ms.

934
01:34:11,599 --> 01:34:13,560
Graham, what I was getting to.

935
01:34:13,921 --> 01:34:21,987
And that is that systemic support, because the people who are in the trenches every day, they themselves

936
01:34:24,037 --> 01:34:26,098
At times, it's battle fatigue.

937
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:28,818
And they need that support.

938
01:34:29,678 --> 01:34:36,740
And the social emotional stuff that comes out that's going to go with it through, you know, working with Ms.

939
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,140
Schulman is fantastic.

940
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,561
And, you know, I fully support it.

941
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:51,743
But the systemic stuff, you know, it's that old saying, walk a thousand miles in my moccasins and see exactly

942
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,611
what goes on in the school building.

943
01:34:54,771 --> 01:35:03,934
Some of the stuff, whether it be at the high school, I've experienced it at Curtis Tufts myself, is shocking.

944
01:35:04,594 --> 01:35:06,314
And we need to do better.

945
01:35:06,654 --> 01:35:12,256
And there's no question, I don't think anybody here would say, would not agree with that.

946
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:21,739
But the ability to have each other together and work together to deal with these issues is paramount.

947
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,500
Thank you very much.

948
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:24,701
Thank you.

949
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:31,923
I just wanted to let everybody know we are a little over time, so I will let a couple of, if you could be brief, Member McLaughlin.

950
01:35:34,183 --> 01:35:34,623
Thank you.

951
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:49,708
Member Russo, I just wanted to mention, I'm not sure, I think you responded earlier, but wanted to make sure you didn't forget the comment in the chat regarding a suspension example during remote learning.

952
01:35:50,448 --> 01:35:50,608
Yes.

953
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:56,405
I will bring that up right at the end, because it's not that it's not relevant.

954
01:35:57,206 --> 01:35:59,609
It's, I believe, an entire meeting unto itself.

955
01:36:01,031 --> 01:36:01,631
Mr. DeLava?

956
01:36:03,594 --> 01:36:04,435
So thank you.

957
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:12,145
I just wanna make sure that I'm not coming across that I don't agree with what is being put forth.

958
01:36:12,946 --> 01:36:19,411
And the statement of that we're against, it's not that we're not against, I wanna make that clear.

959
01:36:20,732 --> 01:36:21,873
It's a change, right?

960
01:36:21,953 --> 01:36:32,963
So a change for administrators, we wanna be part of understanding and realizing and changing what we are currently doing.

961
01:36:34,263 --> 01:36:43,951
I always say to myself that, and I've told everyone this, you know, the Paul DeLava that started 21 years ago is not the same Paul DeLava that is now sitting in this chair.

962
01:36:44,392 --> 01:36:52,899
I wouldn't be an effective educator if I constantly did the same thing over and over and over again without the results that needed to be there.

963
01:36:52,959 --> 01:37:00,446
So I also want to thank Jenny for you saying, you know, systemic change and how you can help us with that, because I think that has a lot

964
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,846
to do with the direction that some directions that we've gone in.

965
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:12,790
So I just wanted to kind of make sure that I wasn't saying that, you know, that we're here because, you know, we're totally against it.

966
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:14,471
That's not what we're trying to say.

967
01:37:14,511 --> 01:37:17,252
We just know that this is going to be a change for everybody.

968
01:37:17,672 --> 01:37:20,053
And we just want to make sure we're understanding and being a part of it.

969
01:37:20,233 --> 01:37:20,934
So thank you.

970
01:37:21,474 --> 01:37:21,754
Thank you.

971
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,175
Mr. Murphy, did you want to speak real quick?

972
01:37:24,335 --> 01:37:24,615
Thank you.

973
01:37:25,096 --> 01:37:25,376
Thank you.

974
01:37:26,224 --> 01:37:53,361
And in the chat early on, there was a comment from Lisa and Michael about the issue of removing from the academic setting, which is sort of at the root of suspension from the academic, providing an education perspective, in that during our pandemic,

975
01:37:54,464 --> 01:37:56,125
What does that look like?

976
01:37:56,585 --> 01:38:07,631
I mean, if somebody is excluded from a class, my son, he had changed his name briefly in the Google Meet or Zoom session in the spring.

977
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:11,033
And as a result, the teacher kicked him out, which was fine.

978
01:38:12,534 --> 01:38:16,916
But the teacher at the moment didn't know that, in fact, there was no way to add him back.

979
01:38:17,116 --> 01:38:21,558
And so he was without that class for a while until we noticed that he wasn't actually participating.

980
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:27,226
And that was not an intentional type of situation that happened there.

981
01:38:27,386 --> 01:38:41,612
But the issue of excluding from the academic setting while we're in a remote educational situation, really, I mean, we would need several more hours tonight to go over that.

982
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:47,543
That is an important topic, I think, that hopefully the administration and principals are talking to their staff about.

983
01:38:48,544 --> 01:38:53,407
What does that mean to mute students, to remove them from classrooms?

984
01:38:54,448 --> 01:39:02,114
These are issues that, from a purely academic perspective, they're the same as suspension.

985
01:39:02,759 --> 01:39:08,643
I mean, we probably would, nobody would ever call it that, but that's probably a fairly accurate analogy.

986
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:11,885
And I'm going to bet we won't ever report that kind of stuff.

987
01:39:12,025 --> 01:39:13,065
How on earth could we?

988
01:39:14,006 --> 01:39:18,949
So I just think it's an important thing to make sure that is being talked about.

989
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:25,822
it's, it's, it's, we're way over time.

990
01:39:25,922 --> 01:39:33,365
So I don't know that I can really, Superintendent have, have you all had conversations about this particular topic yet?

991
01:39:37,427 --> 01:39:38,287
Sorry to put you on the spot.

992
01:39:38,766 --> 01:39:40,347
No, we did not.

993
01:39:40,687 --> 01:39:44,969
And that was the first time that I had seen something along those lines.

994
01:39:45,169 --> 01:39:56,035
I know for the purposes of Zoom, where we've been, or I've been on Zoom multiple times in official capacity, where the meetings have been Zoom-bombed.

995
01:39:56,575 --> 01:40:06,420
So if you're the host, you're able to mute and unmute in order just to have structure and not having six people speak at the same exact time.

996
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:17,693
The comment that I saw there, I'm not familiar with that particular situation.

997
01:40:17,713 --> 01:40:20,315
So that was the first time I ever heard of it.

998
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:23,857
But we meet with the administrators frequently.

999
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:33,423
So that's something that, as an administrative team, we can definitely meet and discuss and ensure that that isn't taking place.

1000
01:40:34,213 --> 01:40:39,598
that kind of a practice isn't taking place except for the purposes of running an organized meeting.

1001
01:40:40,839 --> 01:40:41,199
Thank you.

1002
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:52,608
And when I think about this particular scenario, it reminds me of the impact over intent is an important consideration here.

1003
01:40:53,489 --> 01:41:00,275
I mean, I've been muted on a meeting and I didn't take it personally, but that doesn't mean somebody else being muted didn't take it personally.

1004
01:41:00,875 --> 01:41:02,897
And when we're talking about young children,

1005
01:41:03,874 --> 01:41:06,115
they don't necessarily just take it personally.

1006
01:41:06,195 --> 01:41:08,615
It might really be a severe impact to them.

1007
01:41:09,616 --> 01:41:12,257
And certainly, obviously, would impact their ability to participate.

1008
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:15,738
So I appreciate that you'll bring that up with your staff.

1009
01:41:17,338 --> 01:41:19,099
Is there anybody who wants to say anything finally?

1010
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,439
Oh, we have to.

1011
01:41:21,219 --> 01:41:25,921
So I don't have really a copy of the amended version.

1012
01:41:27,121 --> 01:41:32,723
But if the members are comfortable with the amendments we've discussed, we can

1013
01:41:34,502 --> 01:41:42,789
we can cobble those together in a document, send it in the packet, and then if we get it wrong, we simply can amend it during the meeting.

1014
01:41:43,129 --> 01:41:54,039
So is there a motion to approve this as amended with the superintendent's changes and the reporting changes that member Gramp offered?

1015
01:41:54,199 --> 01:41:57,422
And forgive me if there are other amendments that I'm not thinking of.

1016
01:41:57,995 --> 01:42:20,832
Harmon Zuckerman, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PBS, she-her, PBS, she-her, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she-her, PB, she

1017
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:32,873
of minutes that I will send to you and to Susan Weiss, the superintendent's administrator, and they can marry the minutes together and we can work on the amendment.

1018
01:42:32,893 --> 01:42:34,534
So I make a motion to approve the amendment.

1019
01:42:34,574 --> 01:42:35,654
Is there a second?

1020
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:36,695
Second.

1021
01:42:38,035 --> 01:42:38,376
All right.

1022
01:42:38,416 --> 01:42:41,917
And member McLaughlin, I believe you have to do a roll call because.

1023
01:42:42,678 --> 01:42:43,698
Oh, OK.

1024
01:42:44,438 --> 01:42:44,879
Thank you.

1025
01:42:46,799 --> 01:42:47,420
Member Graham?

1026
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:47,960
Yes.

1027
01:42:49,546 --> 01:42:51,267
I will call myself Melanie McLaughlin.

1028
01:42:51,287 --> 01:42:51,667
Yes.

1029
01:42:52,908 --> 01:42:53,688
Member Rousseau.

1030
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:54,329
Yes.

1031
01:42:54,589 --> 01:42:55,509
Three in the affirmative.

1032
01:42:56,850 --> 01:43:06,216
So the resolution as amended will be sent to the school committee for our meeting following the next, I believe is the 28th of September.

1033
01:43:06,236 --> 01:43:06,296
And

1034
01:43:09,382 --> 01:43:15,303
as with anything that we send up, the school committee is more than welcome to amend it at that time as well.

1035
01:43:15,384 --> 01:43:18,244
So this does not necessarily make it set in stone.

1036
01:43:19,865 --> 01:43:22,285
Is there any other comments?

1037
01:43:22,345 --> 01:43:22,905
Is there a motion?

1038
01:43:23,305 --> 01:43:23,525
Ms.

1039
01:43:23,685 --> 01:43:23,986
Graham.

1040
01:43:25,326 --> 01:43:27,646
So I just wanted to say thank you to everyone on the phone.

1041
01:43:28,347 --> 01:43:29,147
Tomorrow's a big day.

1042
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,467
We're finally here.

1043
01:43:30,487 --> 01:43:31,567
So it's very exciting.

1044
01:43:31,687 --> 01:43:32,388
So thank you.

1045
01:43:32,908 --> 01:43:34,348
And I would make a motion to adjourn.

1046
01:43:35,658 --> 01:43:37,319
I would second both sentiments.

1047
01:43:37,419 --> 01:43:39,539
Congratulations, everyone, for tomorrow.

1048
01:43:39,559 --> 01:43:40,640
We're thinking of you.

1049
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,600
Thank you all.

1050
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,120
And see you soon.

1051
01:43:43,881 --> 01:43:44,101
Yes.

1052
01:43:44,381 --> 01:43:48,342
And Member McLaughlin, if you could take a roll call for.

1053
01:43:48,482 --> 01:43:49,262
OK.

1054
01:43:50,262 --> 01:43:51,003
Member Graham?

1055
01:43:51,703 --> 01:43:51,923
Yes.

1056
01:43:53,563 --> 01:43:54,724
Melanie McLaughlin, yes.

1057
01:43:54,784 --> 01:43:55,564
Member Russo?

1058
01:43:56,104 --> 01:43:56,304
Yes.

1059
01:43:56,364 --> 01:43:58,385
Thank you very much, everybody, and have a nice evening.

1060
01:43:58,425 --> 01:43:59,445
And good luck tomorrow.

1061
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:00,606
My kids are very excited.

1062
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:05,287
I've got to go read my fourth grade and sixth grade packets, so I'll be busy tonight.

1063
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:06,355
Goodnight.

1064
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:07,443
Bye.

1065
01:44:07,967 --> 01:44:08,269
Bye.
