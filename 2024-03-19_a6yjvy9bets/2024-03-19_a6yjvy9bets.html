    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4038.359s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4039.7s">I'd</a>  like to begin by wishing Ramadan Mubarak to our Muslim students, staff, and community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4046.345s">Ramadan,</a>  a month-long observance, which started last week, is a time for increased religious devotion and self-examination. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4055.051s">During</a>  this time, many Muslims fast during daylight hours, abstaining from food and drink until night. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4062.416s">We're</a>  wishing everyone who observes this holiday an easy and meaningful fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4068.775s">I</a>  also want to share that yesterday I hope that everyone enjoyed the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4072.976s">Patrick's</a>  Day holiday this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4075.777s">This</a>  holiday holds particular significance for many Irish and Irish American families in Medford and around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4083.539s">It's</a>  time for corned beef and cabbage, parades and musical performances. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4088.72s">And</a>  my favorite part, delicious soda bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4091.801s">Erin</a>  go bra. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4094.321s">I</a>  would also like to take a moment to thank and acknowledge Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4098.242s">Melanie</a>  McLaughlin, a former colleague and member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4103.284s">Melanie,</a>  we are all extremely grateful for your four years of service on the committee, in particular, your dedicated and tireless advocacy for equity and inclusion, the needs and priorities of our special education programs, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4118.829s">disability</a>  awareness and access throughout the district, and the voice and perspective of Medford Public Schools parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4126.662s">I</a>  am confident that you will continue to make a difference as an advocate for the Medford community for many years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4135.211s">As</a>  we bid farewell to Member McLaughlin, we also warmly welcome our new school committee member, Mr. John Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4144.298s">Member</a>  Intoppa is a Mustang through and through, even serving his Medford High School class of 2019 as class president. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4153.105s">We're</a>  excited to welcome his perspective to this school committee and are looking forward to our work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4161.38s">We</a>  want to remind our community about two upcoming religious holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4166.782s">All</a>  schools will be closed on Friday, March 29th, in observance of Good Friday, and on Wednesday, April 10th, in observance of Eid al-Fitr. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4181.523s">I</a>  also want to just point out a few highlights that took place across Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4188.406s">Congratulations</a>  to our Medford High School World Language and Culture Club and the World Language Department for hosting the school's first ever World Language Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4200.091s">I'd</a>  like to thank member Reinfeld who attended that event as well on a Friday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4208.095s">The</a>  festival did take place earlier in the lobby of the high school and featured performances from Medford High School students, our world language class, all of our world language classes, raffles and food sales collected from the event were all donated to world language student scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4226.804s">It</a>  was a great event and the event ended with amazing homemade dishes from a variety of world cultures and the celebration of world language learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4240.054s">Make</a>  sure to visit our Medford website to look at write-ups from our junior, Claire Gingo. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4245.877s">Thanks</a>  to everyone who worked hard to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4250.5s">Also</a>  earlier this month, local author, Maureen Harrington, and her inspirational pup, Ivy, joined Medford Elementary School students and their families at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4265.589s">for</a>  an interactive reading and discussion of Ivy, the very determined dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4272.05s">Thank</a>  you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4272.99s">Harrington,</a>  Ivy, the elementary reading department, and elementary principals and assistant principals for facilitating this great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4282.352s">Photos</a>  from the meet and greet can be found on Facebook and on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4289.133s">I</a>  have an important announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4290.674s">Middle</a>  school lottery is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4294.457s">We're</a>  actively preparing for the April middle school lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4299.2s">In</a>  2019, the school committee voted unanimously to implement a random lottery system with the goal of balancing our racial and socioeconomic differences between the Andrews and McGlynn middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4314.69s">This</a>  change in policy has resulted in progress toward this goal, with the sixth grade enrollment more balanced than in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4324.648s">The</a>  2024 lottery will follow the protocol established in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4330.271s">Grade</a>  five students from each elementary school will be assigned to one of the two middle schools, with some exceptions in place for sibling preference and specialized program offerings for English learners and special education students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4346.798s">It</a>  is important to note this year that sibling preference will not include younger siblings at the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4356.121s">Because</a>  of shifts in demand and population, the lottery cannot include the younger siblings this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4363.002s">However,</a>  the lottery will still take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4367.245s">I</a>  will be hosting a virtual information session concerning the lottery for all grade five students and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4375.348s">This</a>  information session will be held by Zoom this Wednesday, March 20th at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4383.831s">The</a>  lottery will take place on Tuesday, April 9th, and the results will be posted on the district website at 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4395.606s">Letters</a>  confirming each student's middle school assignment will be sent to all grade five students by Wednesday, April 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4407.073s">Also</a>  this week, there's going to be a very important Medford Malden Transition Fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4413.479s">The</a>  Medford and Malden public schools will join together for a transition fair to provide students, families, caregivers, and professionals with information about community based services for our adults with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4429.995s">This</a>  event is free and open to all Medford and Malden residents and surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4437.859s">Students</a>  between the ages of 14 to 22 years of age who receive special education services through an IEP along with their families and caregivers are welcome and encouraged to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4453.306s">This</a>  event has exhibitors, the event exhibitors serve adults with a number of disabilities, including autism, developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and emotional disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4468.351s">I</a>  hope that you take advantage of this great event taking place on Wednesday, March 20th in Malden this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4476.838s">At</a>  tonight's meeting, we have a packed agenda, including updates and reports from Stacey Shulman, our Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, and Paul Teixeira, our Director of English Learners, and Title III. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4493.902s">They'll</a>  be sharing insights and news from their respective departments, both of which are crucial to our day-to-day school operations and the overall educational mission of our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4505.545s">I'll</a>  also be sharing a recommendation to the committee regarding the state school choice law and an update on behalf of our director of finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4518.519s">Lastly,</a>  there will be a report on the resolution of, I'm sorry, there will be two additional reports, a recommendation to approve donations to the Medford Public Schools, and I'll be asking for your approval for those reports as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4537.619s">Thank</a>  you, those are my remarks for this evening.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4636.229s">Thank</a>  you, Director Edward-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4637.529s">Member</a>  Graham, then Member Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4640.33s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to approve both donations from the JS Limb Foundation in the amount of $4,000 and the Mabbitt & Associates donation in the amount of $2,100. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4649.173s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4651.734s">Member</a>  Reinfeld?</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4652.494s">I</a>  just wanted to know if this is the first, when, is this the first time these awards have been offered? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4660.717s">Are</a>  these inaugural or are they continuing?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4665.37s">I</a>  do not recall presenting on these two awards, and I'm not sure if anyone on the team is aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4673.036s">It</a>  may be the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4676.938s">These</a>  are continuous donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4680.381s">So</a>  the JS Slim is for $4,000, and the Mabit and Associates is for $2,100.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4689.778s">I'll</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4691.039s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4694.342s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4696.164s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4699.547s">I</a>  don't think a donation, but we could, just in case. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4702.309s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4704.111s">Sure,</a>  maybe I'll look up when we're supposed to, so I actually know after six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4710.496s">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4711.297s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4712.278s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4712.838s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4714.42s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4716.377s">Remember</a>  all the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4717.158s">Yes,</a>  remember Reinfeld.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4718.719s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4718.939s">Remember</a>  so yes Maryland.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4721.001s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmative zero negative donations accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4724.384s">Thank</a>  you to the foundation and to them, Maven and associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4729.008s">Number</a>  three recommendation to approve Medford as a no school choice district for school year 2425. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4733.251s">Again,</a>  Dr. Reese Edward Benson. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4734.352s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4740.942s">Medford</a>  public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4743.065s">We</a>  are doing a significant amount in every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4747.03s">We</a>  are required by Jesse to come before the committee and ask my recommendation to the committee is that we remain know school choice district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4757.484s">that</a>  if we were to participate in this program, we would have to accept students from other communities in the Commonwealth, receive baseline tuition, which could be well below the actual cost of the services that students may need. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4774.172s">And</a>  such acceptances would be on a seat available basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4780.135s">They</a>  could also affect enrollments selectively throughout the district, and as a result, increase costs that would add to our budgetary burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4791.66s">And</a>  so I do feel that Medford right now is doing a very good job of servicing our student population. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4799.684s">We</a>  have a very diverse community, and it would not be in our best interest to become a <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4807.722s">school</a>  choice district so my recommendation is that the committee vote to reject the school choice for school year 2425 motion to approve motion for approval by member Ruseau seconded by second member Graham, all those in favor.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4839.231s">Yes,</a>  so in your packets, you received a succinct summary from Mr. McHugh, our finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4848.439s">I</a>  will quickly go through this report so that you can hear what the findings were on the resolution for our budget shortfall. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4861.351s">Mr.</a>  McHugh appeared before the school committee on February 12 to report a potential shortfall of 2.5 million in the annual budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4871.398s">This</a>  was based on the first projection of what our spending versus budget would be by year end. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4879.824s">We</a>  began a process of reviewing spending, reviewing encumbered funds and identifying resources that could be utilized to ensure a balanced budget by year end. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4891.115s">This</a>  review identified the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4894.639s">One</a>  account was over encumbered by $265,000 due to a contract that crossed fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4902.126s">We</a>  identified spending that could be postponed to FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4907.37s">The</a>  city identified a balance in the FY 23 school budget that could be used for any FY 24 expenses that could be properly charged to FY 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4919.1s">We</a>  have a $173,000 balance in an account that holds state reimbursement funds for homeless transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4930.782s">We</a>  have a balance of 291,000 in the state funded circuit breaker account that can be used for special education tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4941.178s">We</a>  are projecting a balance in our final year of ESSER funds of $200,000, which can be used for eligible expenses currently being charged to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4952.662s">There</a>  is a balance in the vocational tuition revolving fund, and I've targeted $200,000 from this fund to pay for vocational program teachers being charged to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4965.886s">I</a>  created a charge back to our school lunch program of $57,000 to recover the proportional share of natural gas and electricity used by the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4978.957s">In</a>  addition, with the assistance of the city's finance director, an error was identified in the projection model, which was causing the deficit to be overestimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4989.526s">After</a>  correcting this error, correcting the account that was over encumbered by 265,000 utilizing the FY 23 budget to fund the final August 23 payment of the teamsters settlement of 212.5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5010.296s">In</a>  creating the school lunch fund charge back of 57,000, the projected deficit now stands at 216,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5019.243s">We</a>  will use the extra balance and other budget management initiatives to ensure we finish the year with a balanced budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5027.729s">Any</a>  of the identified resources that are not needed for deficit reduction in FY24 are eligible to be carried forward into FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5039.313s">They</a>  will be carried forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5041.274s">Attached</a>  is an additional document showing reconciliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5046.196s">And</a>  so that was just to give an overview of how the FY shortfall was addressed for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5054.759s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5055.865s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edwin-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5057.005s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5058.046s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5059.386s">I</a>  really want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5062.987s">This</a>  is what transparency looks like to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5065.768s">So</a>  there's lots of choices about how you deal with a shortfall, and sometimes you do it quietly, and sometimes you have to make choices about when to let the committee know. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5076.731s">And</a>  I think Jerry <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5078.735s">did</a>  exactly what we have been wanting and needing, really, since I've been on the committee, to be proactive, to talk to us about what the challenges were, and then to do the work that comes with these kinds of things with such a fluid budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5094.864s">And</a>  I just wanted to sort of commend Jerry and say this is what the community is looking for when they say they want transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5104.549s">Sometimes</a>  transparency is uncomfortable and ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5108.121s">And</a>  I think it has been uncomfortable and ugly to hear about a $2 million deficit or $2.5 million deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5115.185s">I</a>  do think it's our job as the committee to sort of listen to what our finance people are telling us and let them do the work and assume that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5123.91s">So</a>  I was happy to hear a brief update on this last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5128.993s">And</a>  I would encourage anybody who is particularly interested in our revolving funds to watch the Committee of the Whole that we had last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5135.357s">It</a>  was the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5136.812s">Since</a>  I've been on the committee where we actually had a conversation about revolving funds and what they looked like. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5142.537s">There</a>  are some absolute concerns in the but in the revolving funds budget, but we are now in a position to talk about them, which we've not been before so. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5152.285s">overall,</a>  there, you know, there was a lot of there were lots of comments about that in in our budget meeting committee of the whole last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5158.128s">So</a>  if you didn't join us, and I think most people did not, but are interested in like, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5163.13s">And</a>  what are those funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5164.751s">It</a>  was, I think, very educational and informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5168.592s">And</a>  it sort of helped guide us in terms of some of the resolutions you'll see on the agenda later tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5174.155s">But</a>  many thanks to Jerry and his hard work, navigating us through this and keep up the transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5181.258s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5181.926s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5182.786s">Member</a>  Branley?</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5185.068s">So,</a>  yes, a lot of thanks to Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5189.47s">Obviously,</a>  I was thrilled to hear that there was, you know, less of a deficit here than what we're looking at the day before, or the week before, the meeting before. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5198.654s">So</a>  I just have a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5200.455s">The</a>  error that occurred, the error was identified in the projection model, which was causing the deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5206.718s">Are</a>  we sure that that's correct, Val?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5210.373s">I</a>  think that Jerry and Bob Dickinson, who's a CFO from the schools, and Bob's the CFO from the city, were doing a lot of number crunching, and then they found that error. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5220.803s">So</a>  it sounds like this is correct, but as things progress, I think they're looking at things daily, weekly, together to make sure we cover that balance, and then budget for fiscal year 25.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5231.574s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5231.874s">So</a>  will we get an update if anything changed?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5234.741s">I</a>  think Jerry's showing us he's probably going to update us on a bi-weekly basis, if not sooner, if anything comes to a surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5243.203s">And</a>  we have our first budget meeting, I believe, April 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5245.564s">And</a>  then our next meeting is April 8th, regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5248.785s">So</a>  I'm sure we'll be getting regular updates now that it's budget season.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5252.626s">And</a>  then just one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5253.426s">It</a>  says, we identified spending that could be postponed to FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5258.749s">Does</a>  that make things look worse for us, for FY25? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5261.67s">I</a>  mean, we can push them off now and balance, but now, does that mean in FY25 we're causing a bigger problem?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5270.511s">It</a>  depends what he's projecting for that figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5273.112s">If</a>  he's talking thousands, if he's talking tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, yes, hundreds of thousands would be a problem, but I'm hoping that it's minimal, something that could be paid, and if we fall a little bit short, but I hope that we're not pushing much forward.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5288.837s">Yeah,</a>  so could we get a dollar amount on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5290.578s">Can</a>  we request that?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5292.2s">Yeah,</a>  we just request an update at our budget meeting on what you mean by what our school CFO means by carrying forward certain amounts to fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5301.488s">Perfect,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5303.649s">Motion</a>  by Member Bramley, seconded by Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5308.133s">Say</a>  something. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5309.394s">I</a>  think what he's suggesting is that balances <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5316.479s">that</a>  are not needed to cover the deficit can be moved forward, not costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5320.88s">Like</a>  I did not read what he wrote there in that paragraph as pushing spending out into next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5328.323s">What</a>  he's saying is if I'm planning to use $100,000 from a revolving fund and I don't need to, it'll stay in the revolving fund for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5335.925s">So</a>  I don't think it's actually a spending issue.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5338.246s">Even</a>  though it says spending.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5339.626s">Where</a>  does it say spending?</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5340.587s">It</a>  says we identified spending that could be postponed.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5345.828s">Whereas,</a>  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, honey. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5347.369s">Second</a>  line. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5348.309s">So</a>  yeah, I guess that is spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5351.03s">Sorry,</a>  I was reading the bottom paragraph, which is more about payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5355.932s">So</a>  yeah, there may be something in there that he is projecting into next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5360.114s">But</a>  we, we, I think, historically, when we have like big payments for curriculum and things like that, if we can prepay them, we do so sometimes it's not that <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5370.506s">they're</a>  due necessarily, but if we have the budget, we pay for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5372.927s">So</a>  it could be something like that, but he can better describe that.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5375.528s">So</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5376.969s">Yeah,</a>  I have an explanation on those two lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5379.07s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5379.871s">Member</a>  Branley, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5381.691s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5382.772s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5383.272s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5385.193s">Thank</a>  you for this update. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5387.194s">And</a>  thank you to our CFO as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5391.176s">We</a>  have, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5399.899s">Just</a>  if you press the button.</p>

    <p>[Eleanor O'Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5404.301s">Eleanor</a>  alert Larry 30 node circle, Secretary of the method teaches Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5410.103s">We</a>  were just wondering, the accounts that will be rolled over, or whatever they're going to be rolled over. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5416.218s">We</a>  know they will be affecting somehow the budget next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5419.379s">Will</a>  this be made public that we as teachers will know what's gonna happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5423.679s">Will</a>  it affect layoffs? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5425.98s">Will</a>  it affect how, what, where in the budget will this affect is what we would like to know as a union. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5431.281s">So</a>  I'm just wondering where this would be made public. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5433.421s">We</a>  know tonight it was being mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5435.922s">Will</a>  there be another meeting will be mentioned that we could all attend and find out?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5440.542s">All</a>  of our meetings will be posted as public.</p>

    <p>[Eleanor O'Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5445.373s">So</a>  the budget will be mentioned again. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5447.134s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5447.695s">Oh</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5448.455s">And</a>  from what I understand with the motion that was just made, we will have more clarification on what Jerry found. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5454.299s">And</a>  from what I've heard you say superintendent was, and I could be wrong, that he was saying that the bill did not have to be paid until 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5466.368s">So</a>  that was what I took that they were moving that money to the next budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5471.465s">So</a>  it doesn't have to pay till next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5473.386s">That</a>  would clear up money for here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5475.146s">But</a>  I agree that I agree with school committee Branley that is that going to be an issue with next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5481.988s">Because</a>  now all of a sudden, there's a bill that has to be paid that we thought we were paying this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5487.39s">And</a>  now it has to be paid next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5488.93s">So</a>  I think either way, it's going to affect somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5491.871s">And</a>  I hate to say this, but it always comes down to the backs of the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5495.972s">And</a>  that makes us a little nervous as a union. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5499.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5501.786s">Mayor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5503.788s">Sure.</a> </p>

We have four new members, so I think sometimes saying things that seem obvious have to be said anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5515.748s">We</a>  statutorily cannot run a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5519.891s">We</a>  cannot end the year with negative one cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5523.253s">We</a>  must have that money come from somebody, whether it's the mayor's office, or whether it's layoffs, or whether it's turning the power off. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5530.877s">We</a>  must get to zero by June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5533.479s">So</a>  most businesses and lots of other organizations can run a deficit and figure out what to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5542.344s">the</a>  day after, but we do not have that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5544.645s">So</a>  I think that's in my my time here, we have frequently done things like we have 300 extra $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5553.091s">So</a>  we prepay some out of district special education expense for tuition, or we buy stuff we know we're going to need, but we weren't planning to buy until July one, or we have <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5566.044s">a</a>  little bit of a deficit and we delay paying school committee members for a month or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5573.373s">So</a>  that the, because the zero is the only allowed number and I don't envy <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5582.864s">the</a>  finance department figuring how to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5585.786s">It's</a>  a terrible needle to thread in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5588.729s">So</a>  this is 100% normal that we do this every single year, whether there's a little extra or there's a little too little. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5594.694s">And</a>  200,000, 300,000, 400,000 is in fact a normal amount to be... It's a big number at the start of the <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5605.862s">the</a>  year when we do our budget, and that is a relatively small number, and I'm kind of amazed we get that close every year, considering all the unknowns about how many students we're gonna have, whether we're gonna have lots of staff out on leave and then have to hire additional staff, or all the other things that change every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5624.027s">So</a>  I think it's really normal, and I'm excited that the number is not 2.5 million, though, because that would have been a disaster, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Joanne McKay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5636.664s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5637.584s">McKay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5639.845s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5640.765s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5641.826s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5642.466s">Joanne</a>  McKay, I'm the financial secretary for the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5646.187s">So</a>  our question financially is, will we be privy to this formula error that they found? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5656.071s">Because</a>  it's a substantial amount that it went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5658.112s">It</a>  was two points of the million down to like 200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5660.672s">Does</a>  that become public? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5663.018s">Does</a>  the public get to see like, you all have a document there, is this something that's public record that we can see that we can see a formula? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5671.306s">Will</a>  that come out at a budget meeting or?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5672.908s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Joanne McKay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5674.509s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5675.871s">Two</a>  things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5676.371s">The</a>  error was a small piece of the reduction from what Jerry first cited to us as his concern and this reconciliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5685.922s">So</a>  that was a piece of the problem, not the entirety of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5690.423s">But</a>  yeah, this memo is on the floor, and so it's public record, and we can definitely send it to you so that you can have it and see it and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5699.166s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5699.506s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5700.466s">And</a>  then I would suggest that if you all haven't watched the Committee of the Whole from last week that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5707.569s">It</a>  was just really an interesting look at our enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5711.93s">We</a>  talked about our counts of low-income students, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5716.189s">the</a>  state's reimbursement is different for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5718.01s">So</a>  we talked about all the pieces that sort of make up funding the budget, so to speak, and what those numbers are looking like for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5727.374s">That's</a>  all very much still a moving target because the governor made her proposal, the house has to do their proposal, the Senate has to do their... So all those numbers are potentially subject to change, but he took a really thoughtful approach through those initial stages of like, what is the sort <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5745.333s">quote,</a>  revenue as, as it were. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5747.093s">And</a>  I think that look at the revolving funds is also really enlightening and important because that money is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5756.655s">It's</a>  intended to be used for very specific things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5759.436s">But</a>  he walked us through a whole process of allocating expenses to programs that generate revenue, like the afterschool program, for example, we've never like <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5771.653s">done</a>  any sort of facility charge to that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5774.276s">So</a>  it looks like that program is very, very, very profitable, but our general fund budget has been paying those expenses for all of eternity, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5783.084s">So</a>  all the electricity, all the space, all those things are being paid for out of the general fund, and he is actually implementing mechanisms to rightfully allocate <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5793.885s">Things</a>  like natural gas and all of those things to programs that are revenue generating so that a we can know what those really cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5802.455s">because</a>  I think everyone thinks they know what those programs really cost, but we are not charging back to those programs, so we don't, which I think will be very enlightening and maybe problematic in some cases, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5815.141s">Like</a>  when we talk about facility rentals, like we wanna make sure that the money we're bringing in for rentals is actually paying for the expenses that we're incurring, because if it's not, then our general fund budget is paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5825.986s">So</a>  he's doing a lot of good work in that space too, and that was all talked about in the committee of the whole, so I think that's another, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5832.202s">really</a>  important part of like what I see is like a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5835.987s">reshuffling</a>  how expenses are allocated this year that we've never done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5840.73s">But</a>  it's very timely and important.</p>

    <p>[Joanne McKay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5843.652s">And</a>  then not to waste your time, if I look at the meeting, could this be answered? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5849.115s">So</a>  by a revolving account, is that just programs like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5852.997s">Or</a>  is that things like we budgeted for two math coaches that were never hired? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5858.02s">Those</a>  would not be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5859.281s">Those</a>  would not be in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5860.261s">They</a>  would be in a general account. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5861.722s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5862.363s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5862.823s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5862.983s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5865.322s">Um,</a>  it's everything from like lost library books to kids corner to rentals before and after school, community, all those things that generate revenue.</p>

    <p>[Joanne McKay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5874.926s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5875.086s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5875.326s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5884.229s">He's</a>  an interim that will be around through this fiscal year, at least at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5891.792s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5894.727s">unless</a>  he commits to another year, yes.</p>

    <p>[Eleanor O'Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5896.987s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, he is doing all of that work to be able to build the budget.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5907.669s">So</a>  when you look at what the budget will ultimately look like, the ins and the outs can't be described to us until he has done some of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5916.611s">So</a>  yes, he's actively doing all of this to try to get ready to do that presentation in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5924.172s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5927.614s">Next</a>  up, we have our social and emotional learning.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5929.875s">I</a>  think we have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5931.776s">Didn't</a>  we have a motion to request? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5934.878s">I</a>  don't think we voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5936.399s">I</a>  think, I think we did take a motion.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5939.22s">Yeah,</a>  we can do it again, but motion by Member Branley, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5943.042s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5944.023s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5944.463s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5945.123s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5946.544s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5947.665s">Number</a>  five, social and emotional learning, SEL update. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5950.666s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5950.846s">Stacey</a>  Schulman, Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5954.807s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5960.373s">Hi,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5963.376s">Dr.</a>  Cushing is going to help guide my presentation up for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5977.038s">So</a>  this evening I'm going to talk to you a little bit about some general overviews about what is in the Department of School Counseling and Behavioral Health at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5986.582s">You</a>  can see there are five different specialties within the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5990.544s">School</a>  adjustment Councilors are social workers, school psychologists are school Councilors, which were previously called guidance Councilors, BCBAs and behavior specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6002.742s">Part</a>  of the department is also social-emotional learning, which has the five different components in it, self-regulation, self-awareness, responsible decision-making, relationship skills, and social awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6017.83s">So</a>  here's a general overview of the roles and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6020.772s">I</a>  won't read to you every single thing on the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6023.993s">But</a>  it just gives you a general sense of how those different positions differ from one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6028.736s">So</a>  how a school Councilor is really talking about the counseling on a broad level, more as a generalist, and then doing that academic transition, post-secondary planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6039.762s">working</a>  with 504s. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6040.962s">Our</a>  school adjustment Councilors or social workers, same name, are really more mental health specialists with counseling, consults, supporting the general school environment, communicating with liaisons, community needs assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6055.566s">And</a>  our school psychologists are even more specialized to be able to deliver those psychological evaluations for special education, and they do provide counseling services as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6067.864s">The</a>  different behavior roles BCBA board certified behavior analysts, we have four within the district are very highly specialized role they conduct FBA is provide trainings for faculty consult with staff and conduct observations and support plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6085.578s">Our</a>  behavior specialists, there are five positions within the district, assist with those support plans, support students in crisis, BCBAs do as well, and support the BCBAs with doing observations and FBAs and classroom support as well as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6103.283s">So</a>  your average counseling day, that's the largest number of staff we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6108.519s">is</a>  about 60% in direct counseling services, 15% consult staff meetings, and then 25% of their time is paperwork, evaluations, contact with service providers and the community parent outreach and work within the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6125.916s">For</a>  our elementary services, the support really focuses heavily on groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6131.08s">So</a>  we work a lot of lunch and social skills groups, also providing individual counseling behavior specialists are only in our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6140.686s">And</a>  we're often trying to provide all those resources and parent support the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6147.911s">This</a>  is an overview of our elementary counseling staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6151.343s">You'll</a>  notice that every elementary school has two school social workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6157.585s">The</a>  Brooks, one of those positions is filled by a community-based social worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6161.567s">We've</a>  contracted with Elliott to fill that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6165.528s">And</a>  there is a little bit of a difference between the number of school psychologists in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6170.97s">And</a>  that really is dependent on our special education programming and how many evaluations we think we will need. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6180.7s">Our</a>  elementary social-emotional learning consists of responsive classroom, the zones of regulation, our nexus classes, which is the specialists that we added in 2021, and our Sandy Hook promise programming, First Start with Hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6202.833s">Once</a>  you move up to middle school services, that's when school counseling, which we previously called guidance, comes into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6210.016s">Every</a>  student has a school Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6212.497s">We</a>  still offer lunch and social skills group based on need, and there's individual group counseling and, of course, resources and parent support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6223.68s">For</a>  our staffing, each of our middle schools has two school Councilors, and then they have a school social worker or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6232.305s">The</a>  McGlynn has one in-house school social worker and a community-based Councilor from Elliott who comes three days a week, and they each have a school psychologist. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6240.11s">And</a>  the difference in services for staff is really, again, dependent on the programming within the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6249.121s">For</a>  our middle school social-emotional learning, we have advisory slash guidance classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6254.243s">It's</a>  called advisory at the Anderson Guidance at the McGlynn, but we start really focusing on those restorative practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6260.885s">So</a>  talking to our students, we hold community groups and we also have conversations amongst themselves to build those social skills when something goes awry in the school environment between students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6277.005s">For</a>  our high school services, again, every student has a school Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6281.247s">Group</a>  support is available by topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6283.728s">So</a>  anxiety, grief, trauma, we have individual counseling. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6288.27s">Same</a>  resources for parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6290.151s">The</a>  difference for our high school students really comes in for our STEPS program, which is our hospital reentry program, which started in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6298.594s">And</a>  we also have a community Councilor within the building for students who have difficulty accessing it outside of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6308.945s">Our</a>  high school counseling staff consists of six school Councilors, four social workers, two school psychologists, and we of course have two school social workers at the Curtis Tufts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6320.095s">That</a>  gives you a sense of the general overall caseload for each of those specialties. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6329.784s">And</a>  then this is when we start to really introduce a heavy push on the college and career counseling. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6334.301s">So</a>  we're looking at students as individuals, what are their interests, their values, they're meeting with their school Councilor to talk about what all of our goal is, is to successfully transition you off into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6345.529s">So</a>  how can we help you get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6351.914s">We</a>  have started, once again, Coffee with Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6354.536s">This</a>  is for school Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6356.397s">Parents</a>  can come in on these dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6358.879s">It's</a>  in CAF 1 at the high school from 8 to 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6361.909s">We</a>  really welcome everyone to come to talk about certainly students and how we can help you help your child with their plans to transition after Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6376.492s">The</a>  high school social emotional learning consists of, once again, that heavy push on restorative practices, our advisory and wind blocks, health and wellness classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6386.794s">We</a>  also have a block of nexus at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6389.435s">It</a>  is a different iteration <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6391.517s">It's</a>  for ninth grade students that started in 2016, who we have identified in eighth grade as maybe just needing a little more of a home base. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6399.459s">There</a>  are two faculty within that classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6401.94s">It's</a>  a small group of students, and they focus on just providing a little bit of extra support for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6407.382s">And</a>  our Councilors have been going into our English learner classrooms to push in and provide more of those social emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6415.404s">support,</a>  certainly, as far as what they can expect from Medford High School compared to their previous high school in another country. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6424.41s">So</a>  I want to talk a little bit about our hospital re-entry program, which is called STEPS, which stands for Student in Transition for Engagement, Progress, and Success. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6432.095s">For</a>  staffing in that program, we have one social worker who is dedicated solely to that program, and we have six teachers who cycle through on a schedule to provide academic support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6443.386s">So</a>  we offer clinical counseling, family communication, and of course care coordination. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6447.75s">And</a>  this is for our students who either are coming back from some sort of extensive medical leave or an incident that has required them medically to be out of school for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6462.505s">So</a>  again, students are absent due to psychiatric hospitalizations, medical hospitalizations, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6467.435s">We</a>  have our fair share of concussion protocols we help students with or chronic absences due to a medical complication. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6474.622s">This</a>  gives you a little bit of data for our numbers for the STEPS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6479.506s">So</a>  again, we started in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6481.488s">Of</a>  course, that was an abbreviated year due to the closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6485.131s">But</a>  we're averaging, and I expect us to meet this as well, we're averaging about 60 episodes and about 45 students that we're supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6494.099s">each</a>  year, so an episode might be a hospitalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6496.681s">So</a>  for some of our students that have repeat hospitalizations, depending on the challenges that they're facing that year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6506.466s">This</a>  all fits into our multi tiered system of support, so information that and support that we're offering all of our students, groups of students and those really specialized tier three services for students in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6522.355s">So</a>  how it all works in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6524.264s">This</a>  is a visual for you, which really just groups all of those services I talked about in terms of how we're working with our tier one students, how we're filtering through our student support teams and referrals into group counseling supports or crisis management, and those individualized, really highly specialized services at tier three. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6548.093s">We</a>  offer a lot of screenings at our middle and high school <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6552.538s">One</a>  of the largest is SBIRT, so Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment, and this is around substance use. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6559.746s">So</a>  we're screening students in seventh grade, and we screen them again in 10th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6565.532s">And</a>  then we also utilize screening through our Signs of Suicide program, which is provided to us free of cost through Sandy Hook Promise, but developed through MindWise. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6575.014s">So</a>  students receive education within their health classes around suicide, how to identify the signs of it in themselves or their friends, where to go in the school for support, and then we screen our students for clinical depression and provide them a little more education or in more extreme circumstances, crisis evaluations at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6600.029s">I</a>  want to talk about our community partner highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6602.391s">This</a>  is something I haven't talked about more at school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6606.153s">This</a>  is a look at some of our major partnerships for mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6610.016s">So</a>  we're partnering a lot more with agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6613.698s">We</a>  really rely heavily. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6615.539s">CHA</a>  has been one of our newer partners with their walk-in clinic for mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6619.902s">They've</a>  done an excellent job, both with providing immediate services in a walk-in capacity and also crisis evaluations at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6627.788s">They</a>  come very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6628.868s">We</a>  really appreciate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6630.549s">Massachusetts</a>  Center for Adolescent Wellness is a new intensive outpatient program for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6637.155s">They've</a>  been extremely collaborative with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6640.237s">Children's</a>  Room is pushing in for grief groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6643.001s">We've</a>  worked with Elliott for quite some time with our clinicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6646.162s">Massachusetts</a>  Alliance for Portuguese Speakers has done a phenomenal job running groups for our Portuguese speaking students and providing them community supports. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6654.624s">And</a>  then BRITE is the overarching network within Massachusetts for hospital reentry programs that provided us startup support and continued support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6663.187s">I'll</a>  talk a little bit more about our partnership with MGH and Care Solace as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6669.212s">So</a>  Care Solace is the program and platform that we utilize to guide students, families, staff into community-based care. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6679.197s">As</a>  you can see here, this is the number of cases we've referred so far this year, 123, and Care Solace has made 61 appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6689.403s">There</a>  has been around 11,000 total communications between Care Solace and those seeking care. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6701.724s">So</a>  a couple more innovative partnerships for this year is we have a wellness coach through a grant from Massachusetts General Hospital and C4 Innovations to provide all of our SBIRT screening at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6718.357s">So</a>  previously, we were working with our nursing staff and our counseling staff to screen <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6724.75s">all</a>  of our ninth grade students in about one to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6727.491s">The</a>  wellness coach is actually transitioning to 10th grade students, and they meet with students for about 10 to 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6734.633s">So</a>  it's more robust education, it's more robust conversations around what their substance use practices are, but really more focusing on what are their positive habits that they have, how do they keep those going, what are their goals for their future, and providing them resources on how to stay on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6753.015s">And</a>  I Decide is a program that is for a tier two level for students who have self-identified or identified through the SBIRT screening process as needing substance use education and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6765.405s">And</a>  that is also curriculum offered to us for free from MGH, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6770.429s">These</a>  are some of our college and career partners we've worked heavily with this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6776.613s">They</a>  have been wonderful in providing us a lot of support for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6782.062s">I'll</a>  highlight a couple for you on the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6787.623s">So</a>  we've had several partnerships with local universities for on-the-spot admissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6792.984s">So</a>  they're coming in, they're meeting with students, they're reviewing their information, they say, great, you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6797.665s">So</a>  we had several students, I think about six, accepted very quickly to Lesley University in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6802.266s">We</a>  just went to UMass Dartmouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6804.386s">They</a>  hosted a nice meeting for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6807.727s">Bunker</a>  Hill Community College has also offered on-the-spot admissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6812.355s">And</a>  Middlesex has come in to talk about their dental assisting program and really give some hands on information to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6821.139s">We</a>  have a program that is sponsored through Tufts called Let's Get Ready, and it really helps students plan in a more robust way who need support for transitioning after high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6832.68s">And</a>  we also offer Bunker Hill dual enrollment courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6836.383s">So</a>  these offer the ability for students to take courses at Bunker Hill Community College. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6842.768s">And</a>  we provide assistance with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6845.691s">And</a>  it's been working really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6847.092s">We</a>  have a wait list for those courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6852.316s">community-based</a>  scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6854.298s">So</a>  these are scholarships that are either within Medford or very close region. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6858.261s">Currently</a>  we have over 30 scholarships that are offering our students a half million dollars a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6863.426s">So</a>  that program is incredibly robust and we're thankful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6868.61s">So</a>  what's next? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6870.612s">This</a>  spring we're looking to offer career panels for our juniors and seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6874.775s">We're</a>  going to be bringing in <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6876.141s">you</a>  know, different members of our community and those who are connected to community to talk about what their profession is so that our students can make informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6885.427s">We're</a>  going to continue to strengthen our community partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6887.849s">We</a>  really cannot be, you know, continue to offer all the robust programming we have without them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6893.553s">And</a>  caregiver engagement and education is certainly something we're looking to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6898.903s">The</a>  other exciting news is I've been on a list for seven years for a needs therapy dog, and I hound them every six months as far as when my application is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6909.01s">And</a>  they've been very patient with me, but they said it expected in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6914.653s">So</a>  I'll certainly come back to you if that application is accepted, and we'll talk about what that would look like.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6920.457s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6920.837s">Schulman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6921.517s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6923.271s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6924.132s">You</a>  covered all the basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6927.093s">I</a>  have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6928.935s">On</a>  the STEPS program, you mentioned there's six teachers that cycle through. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6932.237s">Are</a>  they current Medford Public Schools teachers that are leaving the classroom for a period of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6938.501s">How</a>  does that work?</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6939.521s">So</a>  every teacher at Medford High School has a mini section that they teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6943.464s">It's</a>  two classes per cycle, so two out of the six-day cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6947.627s">So</a>  instead of having a mini within their classroom, they're going down to the STEPS room. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6952.013s">And</a>  we have divided it out by specialty. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6954.235s">So</a>  we have history teacher, science, math, English, all rotating through to provide specialized support for our students during different times of the week.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6962.281s">Great,</a>  that's awesome that the schedule allows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6965.884s">I'm</a>  interested to hear how the new schedule, whenever that gets presented, will work. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6971.808s">SBIRT</a>  only in seventh and 10th grade, which I'm glad we're doing it, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6976.752s">I</a>  just think about <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6979.193s">middle</a>  school is not, I don't, most of us don't remember it fondly if you did go to middle school, but is there other places where they do it every year? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=6989.275s">And</a>  is that like, I'm sure there's a huge effort involved with doing this, but I just think about like, that's a lot of years, three years of major change for adolescents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7001.158s">And</a>  it seems like a long time, like, you know, seventh grade, they do this, everything looks dandy. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7006.779s">If</a>  in <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7008.041s">Later</a>  in the same seventh grade year eighth grade or ninth grade, they, they have a new addiction 10th grades a long time to wait to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7017.014s">So,</a>  is that, what are your thoughts on that we had previously done seventh and ninth grade.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7024.082s">the</a>  purpose of it is really to focus on preventative strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7027.904s">So</a>  we're looking to prevent substance use. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7030.946s">With</a>  the guidance of MGH, they've asked us based on their research protocols to switch it to 10th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7036.729s">And</a>  so those students who are currently in 10th grade undergoing the screening also underwent the same screening in ninth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7044.053s">But</a>  we've looked to our partners there as far as guidance and they've identified those are the best years for them.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7050.396s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7054.059s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7055.901s">Could</a>  I just ask that when coffee with the Councilors happens, some communication goes out to high school parents who are not available on Fridays between 8 and 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7066.59s">to</a>  ever hear what's being said in those sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7069.012s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7070.233s">I</a>  think the PTO has indicated a willingness to help disseminate that information, but I haven't seen it materialize yet, and I don't think it's for lack of asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7080.748s">I'm</a>  hoping the Councilors can formalize whatever it is that they're talking about and make sure it's shared a little bit more broadly than the audience who can make themselves available during the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7090.434s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7090.754s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7091.354s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7094.536s">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7096.498s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7098.279s">So</a>  I just wanted to compliment the STEPS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7100.78s">My</a>  family has benefited from that and it was a huge <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7106.348s">plus</a>  trying to get back to school, you know, when obviously you're going through something to make sure that that gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7112.509s">And</a>  the rotation is awesome with academics because the teachers are coming in there, they're helping when need be, and it's really a safe space. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7120.41s">Does</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7120.71s">Cunningham</a>  still?</p>

    <p>[Eleanor O'Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7122.211s">Yes,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7122.791s">She's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7123.571s">So</a>  I just want to give her a shout out for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7125.711s">I'm</a>  very grateful to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7127.632s">And</a>  then just one other question, the high school counseling, so that's nexus for high school, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7133.413s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7133.893s">And</a>  that's done by the Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7135.723s">No,</a>  it's academic teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7137.563s">Academic</a>  teachers, so like health teachers?</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7139.584s">No,</a>  so one is a ELA specialist and the other is science.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7145.945s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7146.485s">So</a>  it's a co-taught classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7148.086s">Co-taught</a>  classroom, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7149.766s">How</a>  does it not fall under health? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7151.326s">Like</a>  under health, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7155.948s">How</a>  does English and science <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7159.076s">teach</a>  the nexus portion of that?</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7161.337s">Am</a>  I making sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7162.658s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7163.058s">So</a>  the nexus curriculum is very similar to health in elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7167.381s">When</a>  you come up to high school, it's a very different model. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7170.523s">So</a>  it's a support classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7173.725s">And</a>  it's only for a small number of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7176.246s">OK,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7177.887s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7178.467s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7178.848s">Member</a>  Intoppa.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7180.711s">For</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7181.091s">Thank</a>  you, Director Schulman for presenting all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7184.053s">I</a>  guess the first question is a clarification on the STEPS program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7190.836s">It's</a>  very similar to the BRIDGE program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7192.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7192.457s">It's</a>  like our chapter of like we've renamed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7195.779s">Exactly</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7196.199s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7198.22s">that's</a>  huge, and that's proven in other districts to really help a lot of our youth, especially, well, not our youth, but it is, seems to be helping our youth, but youth in other districts, especially as the mental health crisis and epidemic, as people were calling it, is increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7217.708s">And</a>  we saw that in an increase in numbers, and then, you know, we're slowly seeing them come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7224.631s">In</a>  terms of tier one, tier two, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7227.972s">two</a>  and tier three in terms of, I noticed that, was it suicide screening and prevention was on all tiers and different approaches with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7237.839s">How</a>  are we approaching it at a tier one versus a tier three?</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7241.801s">So</a>  that works through our health classes and middle and high school.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7244.883s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7245.864s">And</a>  then love to see that a lot of things were starting in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7249.866s">I</a>  was curious to hear about some of the things that were starting in elementary school in terms of, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7255.797s">sort</a>  of education with this, because obviously you don't want to like put all these topics on elementary schoolers, but I know I was a student who suffered with severe anxiety and was put into therapy as a third grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7268.464s">And</a>  a lot of that was the unknown of what I was feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7271.926s">So</a>  I'm curious to see, there's two parts to this, curious to see where we're going in terms of possibly seeing in some soft integration of possible mental health education within our elementary schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7285.734s">because</a>  that can be one of the scariest parts of when you're eight, you don't know what's happening, why you feel a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7292.419s">I</a>  know that was certainly the case for me, as well as looking at, and we talked about it, I believe you talked about a little bit in the program about the self-reliance skills, not self-reliance, but it was social and emotional learning outside of the classroom and looking at other programs, sort of, I know that some universities are adapting <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7311.909s">Things</a>  like headspace subscriptions for students, you know, obviously institutionally wide but maybe for us case by case basis ways for students to learn how to I hate to use the word deal with these things but off hours of how students are able to get support and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7330.134s">Because</a>  a lot of these issues are still stigmatized. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7333.639s">There's</a>  still an issue of why are you stressed, you're 13, what's going on, what's stressing you out so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7339.106s">But</a>  for a lot of these students, it really is a huge, huge problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7345.013s">So</a>  curious to see the direction possibly we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7348.965s">of</a>  out-of-class help, support and resources, you know, even just like a brochure of phone lines to call if you're feeling this way in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7356.211s">Who</a>  do you get into contact with? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7358.673s">Because</a>  I don't, again, I've only been out of the public schools for five years now, but I don't ever remember seeing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7365.198s">Maybe</a>  it's because I didn't need the resources at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7368.04s">But</a>  that also says I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7371.621s">Or</a>  I am under the impression of, I feel like this information should be present without needing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7377.684s">Like</a>  we should have these ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7379.705s">It</a>  should be nowhere to go before we even need to, you know, think about the bridge program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7384.067s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7384.467s">So</a>  that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7386.768s">But</a>  I guess the two, the too long didn't read of all that is looking at possible integration with, you know, the elementary school, seeing where we're at in terms of screening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7396.974s">because</a>  that's also where I was screened for ADD, and that really helped set me up for my further education, as well as the, as it's put in the report, social-emotional learning integration throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7410.657s">So</a>  where we're at with that?</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7411.437s">So</a>  from an elementary school level, we utilize the Michigan model, which is health, and that has a social-emotional learning component within it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7419.059s">And</a>  then we're also using zones of regulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7420.999s">So</a>  part of zones of regulation is really talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7424.04s">How</a>  am I feeling? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7425.1s">What</a>  is this feeling? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7426.681s">And</a>  reducing the stigma of every feeling is a good feeling in some ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7430.321s">And</a>  certainly when you're feeling certain ways, sometimes you need to utilize coping strategies because they may not be appropriate for that environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7437.203s">So</a>  teaching our children about what is a feeling and when a feeling you might need help from somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7445.885s">So</a>  we're utilizing those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7447.445s">I'm</a>  always looking at screeners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7449.345s">So</a>  what is a screener that is valid and reliable? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7452.566s">How</a>  can we be screening more of our students for support? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7455.887s">And</a>  then leaning on community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7457.748s">Community-based</a>  care is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7460.069s">So</a>  we can only provide so much within six hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7463.81s">We</a>  want to make sure our students and families know where to go in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7467.531s">That's</a>  where Care Solace has come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7468.972s">They've</a>  helped us tremendously sort of reduce those personalized phone calls that our school social workers and Councilors were previously trying to make and on the behalf of our families as well to get community-based care. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7481.574s">after</a>  school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7483.355s">Did</a>  that answer your question?</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7484.335s">Yeah,</a>  and I guess the more part of like, I know this would probably be more for high school or would integrate starting in the high school, but again, that looking at other programs outside of the classroom for students to access, whether it's a portal online or even like, again, like a brochure of resources outside of the Medford Public Schools that they may utilize, looking at integration of that as well within this.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7509.822s">So</a>  we have a 30-page brochure of community-based resources that we provide to families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7515.345s">It's</a>  been translated. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7516.245s">It</a>  needs to be updated a little bit, but we go and make sure every year that things are relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7522.448s">I</a>  think certainly the addition of CHA with our walk-in clinic this year is something we've been trying to heavily promote for families, not waiting until you're in extreme crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7532.073s">But</a>  if you're feeling like you need care more urgently, they've been tremendous.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7535.99s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7536.37s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7537.051s">Really</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7540.415s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7544.039s">Next</a>  up, we have English learner EL update and enrollment report. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7548.904s">Mr.</a>  Paul Teixeira, director of ELL and title three. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7552.689s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7576.786s">Good</a>  evening, everyone, and welcome to our new members. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7583.272s">Tonight's</a>  presentation is an overview of the EL program to kind of help the new members understand what's happening in Medford with our English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7599.38s">The</a>  program that we have is a sheltered English immersion program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7602.363s">And</a>  that's a two component program where we ensure that students get access to grade level content curriculum, as well as English as a second language instruction to support English language development among our learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7618.359s">We</a>  have programs in every elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7623.023s">We</a>  have newcomer programs for students who are at the foundational level of English language acquisition at the McGlynn and at the Missituk in grades one through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7635.072s">And</a>  then we have EL pullout in every elementary school for students who are at the transitional level, which is three through five. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7644.522s">And</a>  then at the middle school, we have a program at the McGlynn Middle School, which encompasses newcomers as well as ESL. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7652.065s">And</a>  then at the high school, we have a newcomer program and ESL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7657.927s">And</a>  we offer, we have a dedicated teacher on the vocational side of the house to support newcomer students as well as transitional students with the CTE programs that we offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7673.459s">How</a>  these decisions are made is based on when students register, they fill out a home language survey form, which is a federal form that everyone's required to complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7687.504s">When</a>  we complete the registration, we test the students for their English language proficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7694.187s">It's</a>  a test that include all four domains. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7696.548s">So</a>  it's four separate tests and listening, reading, writing, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7700.575s">We</a>  administer the test, we get a level, we create a schedule and determine which program the students will go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7707.36s">Once</a>  the students have been in the program for a year, they take something called ACCESS. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7712.884s">That</a>  is a state mandated test similar to MCAS, but it's specifically for English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7720.225s">Again,</a>  it measures the four domains of language. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7723.407s">And</a>  based on this, they take the test in January, we get the results the end of May, and then we make our placement decisions in June for the following September. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7732.854s">This</a>  is only one piece of data that we use to make our placement determinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7737.097s">We</a>  use a lot of district determined measures, such as map scores, we do writing prompts that are used, that are scored using the WIDA writing rubric, which is what the ELD curriculum is based upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7752.105s">So</a>  enrollment numbers, I have the history going back to 2015-16, and I'm keeping it in there because eventually we're going to hit 700 students, and I want to know how many years it took us to double our numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7767.025s">So</a>  at this moment, and this says 631, but today we just had 632 join Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7774.887s">So</a>  we have 632 English learner students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7777.928s">That</a>  number is in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7780.049s">At</a>  the end of the year, when DESE runs their report, the number will go down because if you see 22, 23, that was at 528, but we actually at one point had 580 students last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7794.363s">DESE</a>  counts a student as an English learner in the previous year if they are recorded in our SIMS data, our student information management system, for two cycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7806.065s">So</a>  when we do our October report and our March report, then the student counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7811.586s">If</a>  the March report and the June report, the number counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7816.968s">But</a>  any students that leave us in the interim, even though they may have been with us for three months, don't count in those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7825.435s">So</a>  if you look at the bottom, we have how many students were tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7830.358s">So,</a>  which one?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7834.941s">Sorry</a>  to interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7836.262s">I</a>  saw that chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7837.823s">What</a>  year is that?</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7839.284s">This</a>  year, just since the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7841.946s">We've</a>  tested 391 new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7845.632s">in</a>  the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7846.432s">Of</a>  those 391, 259 qualified for EL services. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7853.215s">But</a>  then we've also had 134 students withdraw from the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7858.398s">We</a>  have a very fluid population of English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7861.659s">We</a>  have students who will come here because they may have existing family. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7866.021s">They</a>  get started here in Medford, then they find their own housing, they move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7870.103s">We</a>  have students that go back to their home country. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7873.384s">We</a>  have students that just leave the district to, unfortunately, many high school students, they go into the workforce to support and help their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7884.648s">So</a>  we've had 134 withdrawals this year, but basically 765 students have passed through our doors to date for English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7896.909s">So</a>  with that, we have university partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7900.67s">So</a>  we have a partnership with Lesley University. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7903.411s">They</a>  have an elementary education program with an add-on Yale license. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7908.112s">And</a>  what that means is while they're completing their coursework, they do a year-long internship in one of our newcomer classrooms in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7916.474s">So</a>  we get, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7918.955s">a</a>  teacher candidate from August through June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7924.279s">And</a>  the great piece of this is that essentially we get to train the teacher, and when we have openings, we can hire them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7933.105s">They're</a>  certified in both areas, and they're familiar with the district, they're familiar with our protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7940.267s">The</a>  other university partnership we have is the UMass program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7944.912s">Last</a>  year, I presented to you that we were part of a grant opportunity with the US Department of Education to have 15 seats for a free half masters in applied linguistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7961.167s">and</a>  that gets teachers an ESL certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7965.388s">So</a>  it's for existing teachers in the district to kind of broaden their teaching acumen so that they can put forth all of the teaching strategies beyond retail into their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7978.972s">So</a>  this program ends in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7982.493s">We</a>  had 13 people successfully complete the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7986.815s">and</a>  they'll be duly certified in their content area as well as ESL if they pass the MTEL. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7997.065s">So</a>  we have a District English Learner Advisory Council that is similar to Special Education CPAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8006.492s">I</a>  call this, many districts will call it an LPAC, English Language Parent Advisory Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8013.556s">I</a>  like to take the word parent out of it because many of our students are here without their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8018.48s">And</a>  so this is the equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8020.501s">It's</a>  the District English Learner Advisory Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8023.496s">We</a>  have monthly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8024.936s">Eventually</a>  what should happen with this group is that the caregivers will eventually take it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8031.238s">It's</a>  challenging because they all don't speak the same language. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8035.059s">And</a>  so we utilize high school students who are bilingual to come to these meetings, to serve as interpreters, kind of bridge the gap between the different languages in the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8047.422s">We</a>  have people who have signed up to be leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8051.683s">And</a>  they haven't started scheduling and running their own meetings, but it's a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8063.769s">And</a>  with that, we've also contracted some seminars for caregivers through the Massachusetts Partnership for Youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8073.573s">And</a>  in March, the presentation was on a healthy balance screen time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8078.914s">This</a>  was to support our caregivers with establishing boundaries with devices in their home, how they can support the school, how they can use them as learning tools and some internet safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8093.132s">and</a>  next month's presentation is going to be on vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8099.335s">Then</a>  we've also partnered with the Welcome Project in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8103.177s">The</a>  Welcome Project helps provide... <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8106.857s">caregivers</a>  with English classes for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8110.339s">They</a>  got a grant a year and a half ago to expand outside of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8114.462s">I</a>  was working in partnership with Sarah Londgren from the Welcome Project and we ended up creating classes here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8122.348s">We</a>  hold them at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8125.11s">This</a>  way here, families don't have to come into the schools, get quarry checked for the classes or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8131.254s">They</a>  have a beautiful new space in the library that they've been using. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8135.66s">We've</a>  run three in-person classes, and then those are on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and then we have virtual classes in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8143.604s">So</a>  the funding for this grant that the Welcome Project got is ending this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8148.066s">This</a>  will be the last class, but we're going to continue with the classes in the fall, and we'll use a federal grant, Title III, to continue these for our caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8159.911s">And</a>  then Tech Goes Home is another partnership we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8163.7s">This</a>  is an organization in Boston that allows us to teach digital literacy to our caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8172.126s">We've</a>  trained Medford teachers who will work in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8176.41s">We've</a>  created a curriculum for the caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8180.193s">It's</a>  everything from how to navigate the Medford Public Schools website, how to check for school lunches, how to communicate with your child's teacher, how to send an email, how to find English classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8191.842s">It's</a>  a 15 hour course. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8194.564s">And</a>  I actually just found out two hours before this meeting, our course was approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8198.688s">So</a>  we'll be running another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8200.09s">It</a>  begins August 8th and it will end in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8204.334s">And</a>  at the completion of this, the caregivers get a free Chromebook, a free year of internet access, headphones, carrying case. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8217.594s">In</a>  other news, the Yale department just completed its tiered focused monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8222.18s">This</a>  is similar to what special education just had to go through with the Department of Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8228.027s">Every</a>  three to six year, every three years on a three year cycle, Desi comes in and does a complete audit of the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8236.678s">There</a>  are 12 criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8238.98s">11</a>  seems to be cut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8240.601s">I</a>  mean, number 12 seems to be cut off on my computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8243.704s">But</a>  these are the criteria that they measure the efficacy of the EL program with. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8252.011s">So</a>  for the past year, I've had to upload hundreds of pages of documentation for each of these criteria and then <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8261.679s">criteria.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8262.72s">And</a>  then they came into the district in February, and they did classroom walkthroughs at the McGlynn, the Missittuck, the McGlynn Middle, and then also the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8275.226s">They</a>  interviewed caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8277.787s">They</a>  interviewed teachers, general education teachers, EL teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8281.729s">They</a>  interviewed students and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8286.391s">They'll</a>  be putting together a final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8288.716s">We</a>  should have it in the next few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8290.339s">I'm</a>  sure I'll be back here to explain the findings in their report to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8297.864s">And</a>  then the new literacy program at the elementary level into reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8302.408s">These</a>  are the new materials that were purchased that the teachers have received extensive PD on the EL teachers are included in this, whether they're a newcomer teacher or pull out teacher, even though we have our own English language development curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8318.38s">What</a>  the EL teachers are doing is they're modifying the curriculum to support components from the inter-reading program so that the goal is that students leave newcomers, will go into a mainstream classroom, and while they're in the mainstream classroom, they'll still get EL support, but all of the inter-reading, all of the strategies for early literacy will be the same, so it's not, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8344.261s">a</a>  culture shock when they change levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8347.344s">So</a>  there's a team of teachers putting together the curriculum, taking the old curriculum and aligning it with the new materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8358.752s">And</a>  then talking points is you'll hear people talk about this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8363.994s">This</a>  is a two-way communication platform that the district purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8369.416s">It</a>  pulls information from our student information system to allow teachers, administrators, district administrators to engage in two-way communication with our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8381.221s">This</a>  isn't just for English learner families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8383.882s">It's</a>  basically a text message system. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8386.803s">And</a>  if in our home language or in the home language is identified as something other than English, the app automatically translates the message. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8396.507s">So</a>  if it goes, you know, if Portuguese was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8399.861s">Teacher</a>  sends a classroom message home. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8401.862s">It</a>  gets translated into Portuguese just for that family. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8406.185s">The</a>  family responds in Portuguese. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8408.307s">It</a>  translates it back to English for the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8411.269s">So</a>  teachers have been using this now for a little over a year with the district subscription that we purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8416.953s">And</a>  I just pulled last week's data to show you like almost 1,700 messages were sent home in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8426.761s">Another</a>  translation device that we purchased for teachers and for school staff who interact with multilingual families is something called Pocket Talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8437.59s">It's</a>  an oral translation device. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8440.172s">So</a>  you hold the button, you choose your target language, you speak, it interprets it, flip it, the other person speaks their language, it transfers it, translates it back into English. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8453.547s">These</a>  were given to all building principals, all building secretaries, nurses, anyone that comes into contact with caregivers where they may need on-the-spot instant translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8467.834s">And</a>  this isn't going to take the place of talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8470.056s">It's</a>  not going to take the place of hiring interpreters for in-person meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8474.278s">This</a>  is just the on-the-fly, you need an interpreter. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8479.744s">We</a>  ended up purchasing 45 in the district and then Chad Fallon bought 15 for the CTE teachers because they'll have newcomer students going through the CTE rotations. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8490.688s">And</a>  sometimes it's really helpful for those teachers to be able to translate, especially where, you know, safety concerns in the shops right there on the fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8499.991s">And</a>  then all of the newcomer teachers have them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8505.714s">And</a>  then for professional development, the EL department offers professional development outside of the typical professional development days. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8513.899s">All</a>  content teachers need to earn 15 hours of professional development in SEI or ESL strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8522.665s">So</a>  these are on optional PD days. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8525.527s">These</a>  are in the evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8527.749s">So</a>  teachers, it helps them recertify, but these topics were based on what teachers have asked for and what we've seen in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8540.555s">And</a>  then coming up, we have summer enrichment planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8543.656s">We</a>  offer summer enrichment for elementary, middle, and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8550.458s">This</a>  slide has changed from what I gave you, because I realized I missed some stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8554.479s">So</a>  I'll give the new one to Lisa for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8558.48s">We</a>  run an elementary summer program, K-5 at the Missittauk. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8562.501s">And</a>  then I've partnered with Anthony Petrelis with Summer Fun, and I will fund teachers to work in the afternoon program, so they can take Yale students who want to stay longer for the day, and it's at no cost to the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8579.345s">We</a>  have a program for students in grades five and six. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8584.089s">It's</a>  called Starbase. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8585.29s">It's</a>  at Hanscom Air Force Base. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8587.032s">It's</a>  a STEM lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8588.033s">It's</a>  a week-long STEM lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8590.215s">Students</a>  get to use 3D printers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8594.078s">They</a>  have robotic wars with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8598.382s">They</a>  do the derby cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8600.063s">They</a>  launch rockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8601.805s">They</a>  do chemistry experiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8604.428s">That's</a>  offered through Starbase, and we've been doing that now for, I think, six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8613.131s">And</a>  then we have middle school summer enrichment at Medford High School, and then we do credit recovery for students in grades nine through 12, nine through 11, and then in grades six through 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8623.299s">We</a>  offer summer reading support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8626.342s">I</a>  can use Title III funds to pay teachers to do office hours at the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8631.546s">So</a>  any middle school and high school students that need help with their summer reading, choosing a book, any of their math packets or history packets that they get, there's somebody there <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8642.515s">two</a>  times a week, mornings and late afternoons to get that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8650.483s">And</a>  then this leads me to my last slide, which is an ask for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8656.71s">As</a>  our numbers are increasing, we have a large influx of students in kindergarten this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8663.795s">And</a>  I never have a crystal ball, I can never tell exactly how many students we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8668.885s">So</a>  I have to base it on trends from the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8674.361s">And</a>  so, Basing, we had, I think, 38 newcomer students last year in kindergarten, and we currently have 32 students in first grade newcomer classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8686.827s">Now,</a>  that's not all from that class, that's students who have come in through the year, but that's how I gauge what my numbers are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8694.41s">This</a>  year, we have 20 more newcomer students than we did last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8698.47s">And</a>  so we are going to need another first grade classroom for newcomer students, and preferably at the McGlynn, because that is where the bulk of the students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8710.537s">I</a>  won't know the exact number until the end of May, beginning of June, because with the kindergarten students, they take that access test in January, and there is so much growth in a kindergarten student from January to June, that it's not an accurate measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8728.087s">we</a>  take the two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8730.671s">If</a>  the teachers say this student is ready to be reclassified as a former English learner student, we give them a test called the WAPT. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8739.782s">Again,</a>  it measures all four domains, reading, writing, listening, and speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8744.727s">And</a>  that will give us the determination if they have the cut score to just go into a general education classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8750.349s">If</a>  they were a newcomer student and the teacher is recommending that they go into first grade newcomers, they also give that WAPT test. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8757.672s">That</a>  will give me the data I need to know that, yes, they have to remain in newcomers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8763.254s">And</a>  so that won't happen until the beginning of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8766.115s">But</a>  based on previous trends, this is what I'm predicting.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8771.097s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Taksara.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8772.558s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8775.168s">member</a>  Intoppa, then member Branley.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8777.57s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Director Zahara for coming and giving all these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8782.013s">I'd</a>  be interested to see at some point sort of our statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8787.057s">I</a>  know this probably pertains more to our high school students who come in as English language learners with their sort of integration into the arts and athletic departments and how they are sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8799.94s">coexisting</a>  in those spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8801.86s">I</a>  know that at least my time at the high school, it always seemed very sectioned off in terms of not just academics, but also in terms of culture, like the culture of just leisure and existing in these spaces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8819.944s">And</a>  that's really unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8823.065s">Even</a>  at, we had a lot of EL students participate as stage crew, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8828.736s">And</a>  the drama club and they always stuck together and we're off by themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8833.921s">And</a>  I'd love to find out if there's a way that we can minimize that culture of things I mean it's a very scary thing of. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8842.881s">you</a>  know, learning linguistics and settling in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8845.363s">And</a>  for some of these individual students, there was an individual who was on the crew team with member Olapade and I, who had just landed in the US in Somerville their first year, and we met them their second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8860.111s">And</a>  they didn't know the word for screwdriver. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8862.553s">And</a>  then by the end of it, you know, they were, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8867.014s">The</a>  growth that we witnessed with that individual because of how integrated they were and how socialized they were with us and how the program really benefited them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8876.644s">It</a>  was a really beautiful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8877.665s">So</a>  I'd love to see sort of what we're doing as a As a <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8886.758s">division,</a>  I don't know the right word, at the moment to push students to sort of more coexist together because it's benefit for both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8895.66s">It's</a>  benefit for all involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8897.84s">So</a>  I'd love to see that at some point.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8899.02s">Well,</a>  and that happens with the CTE exploratory programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8904.321s">All</a>  of the new students go through the same rotations, and they're not a cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8910.122s">It's</a>  six in this group, five in this group, so they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8913.983s">the</a>  students are integrated with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8915.945s">And</a>  those rotations include all the CTE exploratory programs as well as the arts.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8920.928s">Love</a>  to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8921.549s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8924.251s">Member</a>  Burnley? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8925.752s">I'm</a>  up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8926.212s">Well,</a>  thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8927.013s">This</a>  is very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8930.555s">One</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8931.816s">I'm</a>  looking at the numbers here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8933.538s">It</a>  looks like my glasses broke as I walked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8935.979s">So</a>  forgive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8937.833s">But</a>  it looks like our numbers have doubled from our 350 back in 2015 and 16 to 631 as of March 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8942.699s">So</a>  I'm curious how our staff has risen with that.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8954.625s">So</a>  we have been increasing staff throughout the years, and that is something, especially the elementary strand of newcomers at the McGlynn, which is where the biggest numbers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8968.374s">The</a>  way the program is structured is it's sustainable to continue to add new students, but that's why I brought up the first grade class, because I know that's not sustainable, because they can't have two first grade newcomer classrooms with 25 students in them each.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8985.365s">And</a>  I've been in some of those classrooms at the Brooks, and it is amazing to me, the teachers that teach these classes, not that they're not using their words, but it is such a diverse group. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9000.171s">I</a>  think I remember Allie, and I can't even think of her last name right now, but her saying to me that, you know, 10 languages in her class, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9010.305s">I</a>  remember saying, how do you do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9012.026s">I</a>  mean, we're speaking English in the kindergarten downstairs and I feel like half the kids aren't listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9017.911s">I</a>  feel like they're not hearing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9019.352s">So</a>  how are you doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9020.312s">And</a>  it just amazed me how creative they are so that everybody is getting the same curriculum at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9028.218s">It</a>  really is astounding. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9029.139s">So</a>  huge shout out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9031.161s">And</a>  then my other question, I want to thank Mr. Fallon for buying 15 of these little things. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9038.547s">He's</a>  a rock star too. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9040.509s">And</a>  then on one of these pages here, you have the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9049.837s">I</a>  don't see the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9051.358s">So</a>  I'm just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9054.563s">I</a>  know the programs are housed at the McGlynn Middle School, but how does that change their enrollment all year long? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9063.376s">I</a>  mean, it must be constantly changing.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9066.044s">It</a>  is, but what happens is with any other new students who are non-Yale that go to the Andrews or that come into middle school, if they don't need Yale programming, they go to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9076.389s">So</a>  the numbers are actually, and I'd have to look up what the exact numbers are, but the numbers between the two buildings are similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9083.232s">It's</a>  equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9083.733s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9083.953s">That</a>  was just my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9084.913s">Cause</a>  I'm figuring if all of these kids are influxing to just the McGlynn, how are we balancing that off? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9090.156s">Cause</a>  it seems. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9091.872s">like</a>  that would happen a lot more than someone that would move in still, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9095.694s">So</a>  if we could just get those numbers, I would love to see that if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9100.597s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9102.478s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9103.527s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Secretary.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9104.908s">And</a>  the last thing that I want to say on the last slide is that none of this work could happen without the EL teachers, because every committee I mentioned, every DELAC, there are people that I have EL teachers who work on all of those programs that I just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9120.881s">The</a>  Tech Goes Home, the summer programs, none of this work could happen without those teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9128.027s">So</a>  thank you to them.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9130.489s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9131.169s">Yes,</a>  thank you to you and our EL teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9134.09s">We</a>  do not have any presentations to the public or continued business, but we have a number of items and a new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9140.254s">First</a>  up, 2024-11 offered by member Rousseau, member Grimm, member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9146.157s">Resolution</a>  in support of Massachusetts Association of School Committees resolutions reaffirmation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9152.401s">Whereas</a>  the Massachusetts Association of School Committees bylaws article nine, section one requires adopted resolutions of the association to expire three years after adoption, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9164.329s">Whereas</a>  the MCAS, MASC bylaws article nine, section one requires Medford School Committee to vote for the readoption of expiring resolutions for consideration at the annual conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9178.192s">And</a>  whereas the following resolutions of matters that Medford School Committee has previously supported, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee reaffirms support for the following resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9190.935s">Access</a>  to menstrual supplies 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9194.201s">mandatory</a>  recess in public schools, 2021, prohibiting the use of Native American mascots, 2021, climate change, 2019, poverty and children, 2019, charter school reform, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9206.551s">Two,</a>  request the secretary of the Medford School Committee convene, oh, sorry, convey to the MASC resolutions committee chair our support for the above resolutions being reaffirmed, and request the secretary of the Medford School Committee engage <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9222.844s">with</a>  the MASC resolutions committee and other mass school committees as necessary to reaffirm the above resolutions presented to the bylaws of the MASC.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9233.343s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9234.465s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9234.925s">So</a>  last year, our professional association adopted a new bylaw because each year the resolutions committee would put forward and school committees could put forward resolutions for MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9251.231s">Then</a>  these would become the things that MASC would be pushing for with the legislature, their advocacy work would be centered around these resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9262.082s">Before</a>  last year, those resolutions just kept getting added. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9266.266s">So</a>  their docket of things for which they should be paying attention to was quite long. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9272.971s">And</a>  there was no mechanism, even if they succeeded, frankly, for them to stop pushing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9279.196s">So</a>  last year, they adopted, we adopted, the association adopted a new bylaw that says that every three years, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9288.382s">any</a>  resolution just automatically will expire. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9291.144s">That</a>  if a member school committee wishes to reaffirm that as a priority for our association, we had to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9300.791s">And</a>  then if three, I believe it's three, don't hold me to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9305.555s">If</a>  three different school committees reaffirm that the resolution should be continued as a priority, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9313.018s">then</a>  it will just automatically be continued to the actual conference in November, where it will be voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9322.221s">So</a>  that's the gist of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9324.041s">The</a>  list of expiring resolutions included many more that I think we all, many of us care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9331.843s">Some</a>  of them were partially already approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9335.512s">had</a>  been partially successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9337.774s">Others</a>  were, well, these are the ones that after I looked at the list I thought were important, and I also took a kind of a pragmatic view. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9347.124s">Some</a>  of them were things for which I didn't necessarily think the Association <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9352.577s">could</a>  effectively advocate for. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9356.199s">So</a>  that was just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9359.38s">But</a>  this is the list of the ones that I thought we should reaffirm, and hopefully we can get the association to continue that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9366.504s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9368.365s">Motion</a>  approved by Member Graham, seconded by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9373.568s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9374.308s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9375.268s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9376.849s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9377.61s">2024-12.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9383.24s">submitted</a>  by member Rousseau, policy BBBA slash BBBB, school committee member qualifications, oath of office will be updated with the following language. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9392.962s">To</a>  serve in the school committee, an individual must be registered voter in the city or town from which they elected or appointed and must take an oath of office as required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9402.323s">Each</a>  new member will present to the committee secretary official certification of having sworn the oath before the city clerk <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9411.223s">before</a>  entering on their official duties as a member of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9414.464s">From</a>  the superintendent, newly qualified committee members by law will receive and sign a receipt of a copy of Massachusetts Open Meeting Law governing the conduct of committee meetings in general and in executive sessions in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9428.267s">Newly</a>  qualified committee members shall, by law, receive and sign a receipt for, within 30 days of taking office, a copy of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission Summary of the Conflict of Interest Laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9439.611s">As</a>  Massachusetts employees, all school committee members shall receive a copy of said summary annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9445.476s">All</a>  school committee members shall, within 30 days of taking office, and every two years thereafter, complete the Massachusetts Ethics Commission's online training program. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9453.824s">Upon</a>  completing the online training program, members shall provide notice of such completion to be retained for six years by the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9462.992s">Member</a>  Ruseau and then Member Reinfeld.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9465.267s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9466.667s">So</a>  it was funny that I keep my own system for keeping track of resolutions that I want to put forward, and it's got a long list. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9476.491s">And</a>  I try to prioritize them because there's only so much work that can actually get done at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9480.932s">And</a>  I was cleaning up my list, and I found that I had this one sitting in there from several years ago, which I thought was very timely since we just had a new member. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9488.295s">This</a>  is language that is almost verbatim what everybody else has in other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9495.498s">with</a>  the exception that there's a lot of like. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9502.564s">to</a>  be generic for all the various types of communities we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9505.766s">So</a>  I. Cleaned it up because in most of these in the language that was originally provided that I found it was it said the city clerk would do things that are superintendent does, and I wasn't really looking to change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9519.915s">I</a>  was just looking to get the language to reflect what <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9529.275s">outdated</a>  and missing some of the stuff that changed in the law.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9535.301s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9536.222s">Member</a>  Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9537.083s">Yep,</a>  I had two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9540.046s">One,</a>  and I know this was in the old policy as well, what if the Secretary is a new member? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9545.772s">Is</a>  that, I mean, a new member can't, and the Secretary's elected <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9553.103s">during</a>  that first meeting, at which point the duties have started. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9555.385s">So</a>  I'm a little confused about the logistics, but I know this has stood as is for quite a while, so I don't know what to do about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9563.591s">And</a>  then my second question is, there was a phrase removed about non-discrimination, that there's membership on a school committee is not limited to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9576.442s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9577.403s">I'll</a>  take the first one first. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9579.024s">So,</a>  wait, what was the first one? <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9582.706s">How</a>  can a new member if Oh, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9586.15s">It's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9587.011s">And</a>  if we were all new. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9590.876s">Traditionally,</a>  and again it's just a tradition that the leadership of committees are typically not new members just because there's an awful lot to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9599.702s">but</a>  it is entirely possible, especially in Medford where everybody is up at the same time, that we could be an entirely new committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9606.166s">I</a>  think that that's not considered in the language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9610.868s">I</a>  think that we would vote for a secretary and then that person, good luck, but would have to then know all this stuff as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9620.674s">So</a>  I don't know that we can get into that because if that happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9625.857s">it's</a>  going to be very challenging for the committee anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9630.481s">The</a>  other question though, so we have been trying to clean up our policies and not have policies contain other policies.</p>
