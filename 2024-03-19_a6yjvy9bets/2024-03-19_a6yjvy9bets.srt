25
01:07:26,345 --> 01:07:34,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Ramadan, a month-long observance, which started last week, is a time for increased religious devotion and self-examination.

26
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:41,435
[SPEAKER_01]: During this time, many Muslims fast during daylight hours, abstaining from food and drink until night.

27
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:46,839
[SPEAKER_01]: We're wishing everyone who observes this holiday an easy and meaningful fast.

28
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:52,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to share that yesterday I hope that everyone enjoyed the St.

32
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,061

[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to just point out a few highlights that took place across Medford Public Schools.

45
01:09:48,406 --> 01:09:59,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations to our Medford High School World Language and Culture Club and the World Language Department for hosting the school's first ever World Language Festival.

46
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:06,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank member Reinfeld who attended that event as well on a Friday evening.

47
01:10:08,095 --> 01:10:24,663
[SPEAKER_01]: The festival did take place earlier in the lobby of the high school and featured performances from Medford High School students, our world language class, all of our world language classes, raffles and food sales collected from the event were all donated to world language student scholarships.

48
01:10:26,804 --> 01:10:37,750
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great event and the event ended with amazing homemade dishes from a variety of world cultures and the celebration of world language learning.

49
01:10:40,054 --> 01:10:45,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure to visit our Medford website to look at write-ups from our junior, Claire Gingo.

50
01:10:45,877 --> 01:10:48,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to everyone who worked hard to make it happen.

51
01:10:50,500 --> 01:11:04,608

01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:21,412

56
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:30,474
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an important announcement.

57
01:11:30,674 --> 01:11:32,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle school lottery is coming up.

58
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:38,500
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actively preparing for the April middle school lottery.

59
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:53,789
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2019, the school committee voted unanimously to implement a random lottery system with the goal of balancing our racial and socioeconomic differences between the Andrews and McGlynn middle schools.

60
01:11:54,690 --> 01:12:02,655
[SPEAKER_01]: This change in policy has resulted in progress toward this goal, with the sixth grade enrollment more balanced than in the past.

61
01:12:04,648 --> 01:12:08,670
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2024 lottery will follow the protocol established in 2019.

62
01:12:10,271 --> 01:12:25,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Grade five students from each elementary school will be assigned to one of the two middle schools, with some exceptions in place for sibling preference and specialized program offerings for English learners and special education students.

63
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:35,160
[SPEAKER_01]: It is important to note this year that sibling preference will not include younger siblings at the McGlynn Elementary School.

64
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:42,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of shifts in demand and population, the lottery cannot include the younger siblings this year.

65
01:12:43,002 --> 01:12:45,263
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the lottery will still take place.

66
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:54,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be hosting a virtual information session concerning the lottery for all grade five students and their families.

67
01:12:55,348 --> 01:13:01,790
[SPEAKER_01]: This information session will be held by Zoom this Wednesday, March 20th at 5 p.m.

68
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:13,454
[SPEAKER_01]: The lottery will take place on Tuesday, April 9th, and the results will be posted on the district website at 3 p.m.

69
01:13:15,606 --> 01:13:25,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Letters confirming each student's middle school assignment will be sent to all grade five students by Wednesday, April 24th.

70
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:32,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Also this week, there's going to be a very important Medford Malden Transition Fair.

71
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:48,874
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford and Malden public schools will join together for a transition fair to provide students, families, caregivers, and professionals with information about community based services for our adults with disabilities.

72
01:13:49,995 --> 01:13:56,998
[SPEAKER_01]: This event is free and open to all Medford and Malden residents and surrounding communities.

73
01:13:57,859 --> 01:14:12,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Students between the ages of 14 to 22 years of age who receive special education services through an IEP along with their families and caregivers are welcome and encouraged to attend.

74
01:14:13,306 --> 01:14:27,811

[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be sharing insights and news from their respective departments, both of which are crucial to our day-to-day school operations and the overall educational mission of our district.

78
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:14,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also be sharing a recommendation to the committee regarding the state school choice law and an update on behalf of our director of finance.

01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:37,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, there will be a report on the resolution of, I'm sorry, there will be two additional reports, a recommendation to approve donations to the Medford Public Schools, and I'll be asking for your approval for those reports as well.

104
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:52,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not recall presenting on these two awards, and I'm not sure if anyone on the team is aware of that.

105
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:54,577

[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:33,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

119
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:34,640

126
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:53,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three recommendation to approve Medford as a no school choice district for school year 2425.

127
01:18:53,251 --> 01:18:54,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, Dr. Reese Edward Benson.

128
01:18:54,352 --> 01:18:54,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

129
01:19:00,942 --> 01:19:02,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford public schools.

130
01:19:03,065 --> 01:19:06,349
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing a significant amount in every year.

131
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:16,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We are required by Jesse to come before the committee and ask my recommendation to the committee is that we remain know school choice district.

132
01:19:17,484 --> 01:19:33,212
[SPEAKER_01]: that if we were to participate in this program, we would have to accept students from other communities in the Commonwealth, receive baseline tuition, which could be well below the actual cost of the services that students may need.

133
01:19:34,172 --> 01:19:39,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And such acceptances would be on a seat available basis.

134
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:49,759
[SPEAKER_01]: They could also affect enrollments selectively throughout the district, and as a result, increase costs that would add to our budgetary burden.

135
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:59,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do feel that Medford right now is doing a very good job of servicing our student population.

136
01:19:59,684 --> 01:20:05,026
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very diverse community, and it would not be in our best interest to become a

137
01:20:07,722 --> 01:20:23,292
[SPEAKER_01]: school choice district so my recommendation is that the committee vote to reject the school choice for school year 2425 motion to approve motion for approval by member Ruseau seconded by second member Graham, all those in favor.

138
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:25,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I was opposed motion passes.

139
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:27,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Benson.

140
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:33,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, number four report on resolution of the fiscal year 2425.

141
01:20:34,827 --> 01:20:38,230
[SPEAKER_07]: potential budget shortfall, Dr. Mercedo-Vargas.

142
01:20:39,231 --> 01:20:48,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so in your packets, you received a succinct summary from Mr. McHugh, our finance director.

143
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:58,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I will quickly go through this report so that you can hear what the findings were on the resolution for our budget shortfall.

144
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:10,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. McHugh appeared before the school committee on February 12 to report a potential shortfall of 2.5 million in the annual budget.

145
01:21:11,398 --> 01:21:17,983
[SPEAKER_01]: This was based on the first projection of what our spending versus budget would be by year end.

146
01:21:19,824 --> 01:21:30,515
[SPEAKER_01]: We began a process of reviewing spending, reviewing encumbered funds and identifying resources that could be utilized to ensure a balanced budget by year end.

147
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:33,558
[SPEAKER_01]: This review identified the following.

148
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,962
[SPEAKER_01]: One account was over encumbered by $265,000 due to a contract that crossed fiscal years.

149
01:21:42,126 --> 01:21:47,330
[SPEAKER_01]: We identified spending that could be postponed to FY 25.

150
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:59,000
[SPEAKER_01]: The city identified a balance in the FY 23 school budget that could be used for any FY 24 expenses that could be properly charged to FY 23.

151
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:04,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a $173,000 balance in an account that holds state reimbursement funds for homeless transportation.

152
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:19,219
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a balance of 291,000 in the state funded circuit breaker account that can be used for special education tuition.

153
01:22:21,178 --> 01:22:31,581
[SPEAKER_01]: We are projecting a balance in our final year of ESSER funds of $200,000, which can be used for eligible expenses currently being charged to the general fund.

154
01:22:32,662 --> 01:22:44,506
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a balance in the vocational tuition revolving fund, and I've targeted $200,000 from this fund to pay for vocational program teachers being charged to the general fund.

155
01:22:45,886 --> 01:22:57,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I created a charge back to our school lunch program of $57,000 to recover the proportional share of natural gas and electricity used by the program.

156
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:08,706
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, with the assistance of the city's finance director, an error was identified in the projection model, which was causing the deficit to be overestimated.

157
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:24,793
[SPEAKER_01]: After correcting this error, correcting the account that was over encumbered by 265,000 utilizing the FY 23 budget to fund the final August 23 payment of the teamsters settlement of 212.5,000.

158
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:38,322
[SPEAKER_01]: In creating the school lunch fund charge back of 57,000, the projected deficit now stands at 216,000.

159
01:23:39,243 --> 01:23:46,728
[SPEAKER_01]: We will use the extra balance and other budget management initiatives to ensure we finish the year with a balanced budget.

160
01:23:47,729 --> 01:23:58,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the identified resources that are not needed for deficit reduction in FY24 are eligible to be carried forward into FY25.

161
01:23:59,313 --> 01:24:00,674
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be carried forward.

162
01:24:01,274 --> 01:24:05,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Attached is an additional document showing reconciliation.

163
01:24:06,196 --> 01:24:14,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was just to give an overview of how the FY shortfall was addressed for Medford Public Schools.

164
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:15,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

165
01:24:15,865 --> 01:24:16,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Edwin-Vincent.

166
01:24:17,005 --> 01:24:17,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

167
01:24:18,046 --> 01:24:18,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

168
01:24:19,386 --> 01:24:22,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to say thank you.

169
01:24:22,987 --> 01:24:25,188
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what transparency looks like to me.

170
01:24:25,768 --> 01:24:36,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's lots of choices about how you deal with a shortfall, and sometimes you do it quietly, and sometimes you have to make choices about when to let the committee know.

171
01:24:36,731 --> 01:24:38,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Jerry

172
01:24:38,735 --> 01:24:53,503
[SPEAKER_02]: did exactly what we have been wanting and needing, really, since I've been on the committee, to be proactive, to talk to us about what the challenges were, and then to do the work that comes with these kinds of things with such a fluid budget.

173
01:24:54,864 --> 01:25:04,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to sort of commend Jerry and say this is what the community is looking for when they say they want transparency.

174
01:25:04,549 --> 01:25:06,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes transparency is uncomfortable and ugly.

175
01:25:08,121 --> 01:25:14,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it has been uncomfortable and ugly to hear about a $2 million deficit or $2.5 million deficit.

176
01:25:15,185 --> 01:25:23,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's our job as the committee to sort of listen to what our finance people are telling us and let them do the work and assume that they are.

177
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:28,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was happy to hear a brief update on this last week.

178
01:25:28,993 --> 01:25:35,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would encourage anybody who is particularly interested in our revolving funds to watch the Committee of the Whole that we had last Wednesday.

179
01:25:35,357 --> 01:25:36,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time.

180
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:41,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I've been on the committee where we actually had a conversation about revolving funds and what they looked like.

181
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:51,245
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some absolute concerns in the but in the revolving funds budget, but we are now in a position to talk about them, which we've not been before so.

182
01:25:52,285 --> 01:25:58,088
[SPEAKER_02]: overall, there, you know, there was a lot of there were lots of comments about that in in our budget meeting committee of the whole last Wednesday.

183
01:25:58,128 --> 01:26:03,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you didn't join us, and I think most people did not, but are interested in like, what does that mean?

184
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:04,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are those funds?

185
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:07,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I think, very educational and informative.

186
01:26:08,592 --> 01:26:14,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sort of helped guide us in terms of some of the resolutions you'll see on the agenda later tonight.

187
01:26:14,155 --> 01:26:21,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But many thanks to Jerry and his hard work, navigating us through this and keep up the transparency.

188
01:26:21,258 --> 01:26:21,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

189
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:22,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

190
01:26:22,786 --> 01:26:23,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Branley?

191
01:26:25,068 --> 01:26:28,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yes, a lot of thanks to Jerry.

192
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:37,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I was thrilled to hear that there was, you know, less of a deficit here than what we're looking at the day before, or the week before, the meeting before.

193
01:26:38,654 --> 01:26:39,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just have a quick question.

194
01:26:40,455 --> 01:26:46,538
[SPEAKER_10]: The error that occurred, the error was identified in the projection model, which was causing the deficit.

195
01:26:46,718 --> 01:26:48,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we sure that that's correct, Val?

196
01:26:50,373 --> 01:27:00,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Jerry and Bob Dickinson, who's a CFO from the schools, and Bob's the CFO from the city, were doing a lot of number crunching, and then they found that error.

197
01:27:00,803 --> 01:27:11,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like this is correct, but as things progress, I think they're looking at things daily, weekly, together to make sure we cover that balance, and then budget for fiscal year 25.

198
01:27:11,574 --> 01:27:11,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

199
01:27:11,874 --> 01:27:13,736
[SPEAKER_10]: So will we get an update if anything changed?

200
01:27:14,741 --> 01:27:23,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Jerry's showing us he's probably going to update us on a bi-weekly basis, if not sooner, if anything comes to a surprise.

201
01:27:23,203 --> 01:27:25,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have our first budget meeting, I believe, April 3rd.

202
01:27:25,564 --> 01:27:28,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our next meeting is April 8th, regular meeting.

203
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:32,106
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure we'll be getting regular updates now that it's budget season.

204
01:27:32,626 --> 01:27:33,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And then just one other question.

205
01:27:33,426 --> 01:27:36,247
[SPEAKER_10]: It says, we identified spending that could be postponed to FY25.

206
01:27:38,749 --> 01:27:41,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make things look worse for us, for FY25?

207
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:49,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we can push them off now and balance, but now, does that mean in FY25 we're causing a bigger problem?

208
01:27:50,511 --> 01:27:53,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends what he's projecting for that figure.

209
01:27:53,112 --> 01:28:08,515
[SPEAKER_07]: If he's talking thousands, if he's talking tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, yes, hundreds of thousands would be a problem, but I'm hoping that it's minimal, something that could be paid, and if we fall a little bit short, but I hope that we're not pushing much forward.

210
01:28:08,837 --> 01:28:10,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so could we get a dollar amount on that?

211
01:28:10,578 --> 01:28:11,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we request that?

212
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:21,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we just request an update at our budget meeting on what you mean by what our school CFO means by carrying forward certain amounts to fiscal year 25.

213
01:28:21,488 --> 01:28:23,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect, thank you.

214
01:28:23,649 --> 01:28:28,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Member Bramley, seconded by Member Graham.

215
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:28,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Say something.

216
01:28:29,394 --> 01:28:34,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what he's suggesting is that balances

217
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:40,600
[SPEAKER_02]: that are not needed to cover the deficit can be moved forward, not costs.

218
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:47,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I did not read what he wrote there in that paragraph as pushing spending out into next year.

219
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:55,045
[SPEAKER_02]: What he's saying is if I'm planning to use $100,000 from a revolving fund and I don't need to, it'll stay in the revolving fund for next year.

220
01:28:55,925 --> 01:28:58,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think it's actually a spending issue.

221
01:28:58,246 --> 01:28:59,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though it says spending.

222
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:00,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it say spending?

223
01:29:00,587 --> 01:29:04,468
[SPEAKER_10]: It says we identified spending that could be postponed.

224
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:07,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, honey.

225
01:29:07,369 --> 01:29:07,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Second line.

226
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:10,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I guess that is spending.

227
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:15,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was reading the bottom paragraph, which is more about payment.

228
01:29:15,932 --> 01:29:20,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there may be something in there that he is projecting into next year.

229
01:29:20,114 --> 01:29:29,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, we, I think, historically, when we have like big payments for curriculum and things like that, if we can prepay them, we do so sometimes it's not that

230
01:29:30,506 --> 01:29:32,907
[SPEAKER_02]: they're due necessarily, but if we have the budget, we pay for them.

231
01:29:32,927 --> 01:29:35,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be something like that, but he can better describe that.

232
01:29:35,528 --> 01:29:36,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So second.

233
01:29:36,969 --> 01:29:39,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have an explanation on those two lines.

234
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:39,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

235
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:41,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Branley, seconded by Member Graham.

236
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:42,472
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

237
01:29:42,772 --> 01:29:43,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

238
01:29:43,272 --> 01:29:44,073
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

239
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:46,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for this update.

240
01:29:47,194 --> 01:29:48,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you to our CFO as well.

241
01:29:51,176 --> 01:29:52,517
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, yes.

242
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:00,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Just if you press the button.

243
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty loud.

244
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:03,841
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

245
01:30:04,301 --> 01:30:09,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Eleanor alert Larry 30 node circle, Secretary of the method teaches Association.

246
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:15,245
[SPEAKER_14]: We were just wondering, the accounts that will be rolled over, or whatever they're going to be rolled over.

247
01:30:16,218 --> 01:30:18,999
[SPEAKER_14]: We know they will be affecting somehow the budget next year.

248
01:30:19,379 --> 01:30:23,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Will this be made public that we as teachers will know what's gonna happen?

249
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Will it affect layoffs?

250
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:30,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Will it affect how, what, where in the budget will this affect is what we would like to know as a union.

251
01:30:31,281 --> 01:30:33,121
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just wondering where this would be made public.

252
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:35,381
[SPEAKER_14]: We know tonight it was being mentioned.

253
01:30:35,922 --> 01:30:40,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Will there be another meeting will be mentioned that we could all attend and find out?

254
01:30:40,542 --> 01:30:43,523
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our meetings will be posted as public.

255
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:47,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So the budget will be mentioned again.

256
01:30:47,134 --> 01:30:47,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

257
01:30:47,695 --> 01:30:48,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes.

258
01:30:48,455 --> 01:30:53,839
[SPEAKER_14]: And from what I understand with the motion that was just made, we will have more clarification on what Jerry found.

259
01:30:54,299 --> 01:31:05,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And from what I've heard you say superintendent was, and I could be wrong, that he was saying that the bill did not have to be paid until 2025.

260
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:10,471
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was what I took that they were moving that money to the next budget.

261
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:12,865
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't have to pay till next year.

262
01:31:13,386 --> 01:31:14,746
[SPEAKER_14]: That would clear up money for here.

263
01:31:15,146 --> 01:31:21,888
[SPEAKER_14]: But I agree that I agree with school committee Branley that is that going to be an issue with next year?

264
01:31:21,988 --> 01:31:26,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Because now all of a sudden, there's a bill that has to be paid that we thought we were paying this year.

265
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,630
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it has to be paid next year.

266
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:31,351
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think either way, it's going to affect somehow.

267
01:31:31,871 --> 01:31:35,532
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hate to say this, but it always comes down to the backs of the teachers.

268
01:31:35,972 --> 01:31:38,353
[SPEAKER_14]: And that makes us a little nervous as a union.

269
01:31:39,073 --> 01:31:39,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

270
01:31:41,786 --> 01:31:42,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor.

271
01:31:43,788 --> 01:31:44,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

272
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:54,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Ruseau, and then we'll... I just want to... We have four new members, so I think sometimes saying things that seem obvious have to be said anyways.

273
01:31:55,748 --> 01:31:57,809
[SPEAKER_08]: We statutorily cannot run a deficit.

274
01:31:59,891 --> 01:32:02,532
[SPEAKER_08]: We cannot end the year with negative one cent.

275
01:32:03,253 --> 01:32:10,757
[SPEAKER_08]: We must have that money come from somebody, whether it's the mayor's office, or whether it's layoffs, or whether it's turning the power off.

276
01:32:10,877 --> 01:32:13,359
[SPEAKER_08]: We must get to zero by June 30th.

277
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:21,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So most businesses and lots of other organizations can run a deficit and figure out what to do with it.

278
01:32:22,344 --> 01:32:24,545
[SPEAKER_08]: the day after, but we do not have that option.

279
01:32:24,645 --> 01:32:32,670
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's in my my time here, we have frequently done things like we have 300 extra $1,000.

280
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:43,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So we prepay some out of district special education expense for tuition, or we buy stuff we know we're going to need, but we weren't planning to buy until July one, or we have

281
01:32:46,044 --> 01:32:53,212
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit of a deficit and we delay paying school committee members for a month or something like that.

282
01:32:53,373 --> 01:33:02,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So that the, because the zero is the only allowed number and I don't envy

283
01:33:02,864 --> 01:33:05,286
[SPEAKER_08]: the finance department figuring how to manage.

284
01:33:05,786 --> 01:33:07,908
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a terrible needle to thread in my mind.

285
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:14,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is 100% normal that we do this every single year, whether there's a little extra or there's a little too little.

286
01:33:14,694 --> 01:33:18,657
[SPEAKER_08]: And 200,000, 300,000, 400,000 is in fact a normal amount to be... It's a big number at the start of the

287
01:33:25,862 --> 01:33:43,487
[SPEAKER_08]: the year when we do our budget, and that is a relatively small number, and I'm kind of amazed we get that close every year, considering all the unknowns about how many students we're gonna have, whether we're gonna have lots of staff out on leave and then have to hire additional staff, or all the other things that change every year.

288
01:33:44,027 --> 01:33:54,490
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's really normal, and I'm excited that the number is not 2.5 million, though, because that would have been a disaster, so thank you.

289
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:57,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

290
01:33:57,584 --> 01:33:57,884
[SPEAKER_15]: McKay.

291
01:33:59,845 --> 01:33:59,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

292
01:34:00,765 --> 01:34:01,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?

293
01:34:01,826 --> 01:34:02,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

294
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:05,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Joanne McKay, I'm the financial secretary for the union.

295
01:34:06,187 --> 01:34:15,331
[SPEAKER_15]: So our question financially is, will we be privy to this formula error that they found?

296
01:34:16,071 --> 01:34:18,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's a substantial amount that it went down.

297
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,972
[SPEAKER_15]: It was two points of the million down to like 200,000.

298
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:22,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that become public?

299
01:34:23,018 --> 01:34:30,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Does the public get to see like, you all have a document there, is this something that's public record that we can see that we can see a formula?

300
01:34:31,306 --> 01:34:32,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Will that come out at a budget meeting or?

301
01:34:32,908 --> 01:34:33,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

302
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:35,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

303
01:34:35,871 --> 01:34:36,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things.

304
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:45,440
[SPEAKER_02]: The error was a small piece of the reduction from what Jerry first cited to us as his concern and this reconciliation.

305
01:34:45,922 --> 01:34:49,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a piece of the problem, not the entirety of the problem.

306
01:34:50,423 --> 01:34:59,126
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this memo is on the floor, and so it's public record, and we can definitely send it to you so that you can have it and see it and all that.

307
01:34:59,166 --> 01:34:59,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

308
01:34:59,506 --> 01:35:00,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

309
01:35:00,466 --> 01:35:05,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would suggest that if you all haven't watched the Committee of the Whole from last week that you do.

310
01:35:07,569 --> 01:35:11,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just really an interesting look at our enrollment.

311
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:15,211
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about our counts of low-income students,

312
01:35:16,189 --> 01:35:17,950
[SPEAKER_02]: the state's reimbursement is different for them.

313
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:27,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about all the pieces that sort of make up funding the budget, so to speak, and what those numbers are looking like for this year.

314
01:35:27,374 --> 01:35:45,003
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all very much still a moving target because the governor made her proposal, the house has to do their proposal, the Senate has to do their... So all those numbers are potentially subject to change, but he took a really thoughtful approach through those initial stages of like, what is the sort

315
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:47,073
[SPEAKER_02]: quote, revenue as, as it were.

316
01:35:47,093 --> 01:35:55,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that look at the revolving funds is also really enlightening and important because that money is there.

317
01:35:56,655 --> 01:35:59,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's intended to be used for very specific things.

318
01:35:59,436 --> 01:36:11,078
[SPEAKER_02]: But he walked us through a whole process of allocating expenses to programs that generate revenue, like the afterschool program, for example, we've never like

319
01:36:11,653 --> 01:36:14,236
[SPEAKER_02]: done any sort of facility charge to that program.

320
01:36:14,276 --> 01:36:23,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like that program is very, very, very profitable, but our general fund budget has been paying those expenses for all of eternity, right?

321
01:36:23,084 --> 01:36:32,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the electricity, all the space, all those things are being paid for out of the general fund, and he is actually implementing mechanisms to rightfully allocate

322
01:36:33,885 --> 01:36:41,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like natural gas and all of those things to programs that are revenue generating so that a we can know what those really cost.

323
01:36:42,455 --> 01:36:55,101
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think everyone thinks they know what those programs really cost, but we are not charging back to those programs, so we don't, which I think will be very enlightening and maybe problematic in some cases, right?

324
01:36:55,141 --> 01:37:05,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we talk about facility rentals, like we wanna make sure that the money we're bringing in for rentals is actually paying for the expenses that we're incurring, because if it's not, then our general fund budget is paying for it.

325
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:11,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's doing a lot of good work in that space too, and that was all talked about in the committee of the whole, so I think that's another,

326
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:15,256
[SPEAKER_02]: really important part of like what I see is like a lot of

327
01:37:15,987 --> 01:37:20,670
[SPEAKER_02]: reshuffling how expenses are allocated this year that we've never done before.

328
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:23,451
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very timely and important.

329
01:37:23,652 --> 01:37:28,755
[SPEAKER_15]: And then not to waste your time, if I look at the meeting, could this be answered?

330
01:37:29,115 --> 01:37:32,917
[SPEAKER_15]: So by a revolving account, is that just programs like that?

331
01:37:32,997 --> 01:37:37,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is that things like we budgeted for two math coaches that were never hired?

332
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Those would not be in there.

333
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:40,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Those would not be in there.

334
01:37:40,261 --> 01:37:41,682
[SPEAKER_15]: They would be in a general account.

335
01:37:41,722 --> 01:37:42,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

336
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:42,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

337
01:37:42,823 --> 01:37:42,963
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

338
01:37:42,983 --> 01:37:43,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

339
01:37:45,322 --> 01:37:54,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's everything from like lost library books to kids corner to rentals before and after school, community, all those things that generate revenue.

340
01:37:54,926 --> 01:37:55,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

341
01:37:55,086 --> 01:37:55,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

342
01:37:55,326 --> 01:37:55,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

343
01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:11,712
[SPEAKER_07]: He's an interim that will be around through this fiscal year, at least at least.

344
01:38:11,792 --> 01:38:12,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

345
01:38:14,727 --> 01:38:16,227
[SPEAKER_07]: unless he commits to another year, yes.

346
01:38:16,987 --> 01:38:27,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, he is doing all of that work to be able to build the budget.

347
01:38:27,669 --> 01:38:36,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at what the budget will ultimately look like, the ins and the outs can't be described to us until he has done some of this work.

348
01:38:36,611 --> 01:38:41,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, he's actively doing all of this to try to get ready to do that presentation in a week.

349
01:38:44,172 --> 01:38:44,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

350
01:38:47,614 --> 01:38:49,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, we have our social and emotional learning.

351
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:51,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a motion on the floor.

352
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we have a motion to request?

353
01:38:54,878 --> 01:38:55,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we voted on.

354
01:38:56,399 --> 01:38:58,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think we did take a motion.

355
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:03,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can do it again, but motion by Member Branley, seconded by Member Graham.

356
01:39:03,042 --> 01:39:03,783
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

357
01:39:04,023 --> 01:39:04,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

358
01:39:04,463 --> 01:39:05,043
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

359
01:39:05,123 --> 01:39:05,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

360
01:39:06,544 --> 01:39:07,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

361
01:39:07,665 --> 01:39:10,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Number five, social and emotional learning, SEL update.

362
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:10,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

363
01:39:10,846 --> 01:39:13,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Stacey Schulman, Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health.

364
01:39:14,807 --> 01:39:15,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

365
01:39:20,373 --> 01:39:21,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, good evening.

366
01:39:23,376 --> 01:39:27,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing is going to help guide my presentation up for everyone.

367
01:39:37,038 --> 01:39:45,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So this evening I'm going to talk to you a little bit about some general overviews about what is in the Department of School Counseling and Behavioral Health at Medford Public Schools.

368
01:39:46,582 --> 01:39:50,044
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see there are five different specialties within the department.

369
01:39:50,544 --> 01:39:59,268
[SPEAKER_03]: School adjustment counselors are social workers, school psychologists are school counselors, which were previously called guidance counselors, BCBAs and behavior specialists.

370
01:40:02,742 --> 01:40:14,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the department is also social-emotional learning, which has the five different components in it, self-regulation, self-awareness, responsible decision-making, relationship skills, and social awareness.

371
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:20,732
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a general overview of the roles and responsibilities.

372
01:40:20,772 --> 01:40:23,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't read to you every single thing on the slides.

373
01:40:23,993 --> 01:40:28,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But it just gives you a general sense of how those different positions differ from one another.

374
01:40:28,736 --> 01:40:39,302
[SPEAKER_03]: So how a school counselor is really talking about the counseling on a broad level, more as a generalist, and then doing that academic transition, post-secondary planning.

375
01:40:39,762 --> 01:40:40,842
[SPEAKER_03]: working with 504s.

376
01:40:40,962 --> 01:40:55,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Our school adjustment counselors or social workers, same name, are really more mental health specialists with counseling, consults, supporting the general school environment, communicating with liaisons, community needs assessment.

377
01:40:55,566 --> 01:41:04,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And our school psychologists are even more specialized to be able to deliver those psychological evaluations for special education, and they do provide counseling services as well.

378
01:41:07,864 --> 01:41:25,022
[SPEAKER_03]: The different behavior roles BCBA board certified behavior analysts, we have four within the district are very highly specialized role they conduct FBA is provide trainings for faculty consult with staff and conduct observations and support plans.

379
01:41:25,578 --> 01:41:40,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Our behavior specialists, there are five positions within the district, assist with those support plans, support students in crisis, BCBAs do as well, and support the BCBAs with doing observations and FBAs and classroom support as well as needed.

380
01:41:43,283 --> 01:41:47,824
[SPEAKER_03]: So your average counseling day, that's the largest number of staff we have.

381
01:41:48,519 --> 01:42:03,188
[SPEAKER_03]: is about 60% in direct counseling services, 15% consult staff meetings, and then 25% of their time is paperwork, evaluations, contact with service providers and the community parent outreach and work within the building.

382
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:10,739
[SPEAKER_03]: For our elementary services, the support really focuses heavily on groups.

383
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:19,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work a lot of lunch and social skills groups, also providing individual counseling behavior specialists are only in our elementary schools.

384
01:42:20,686 --> 01:42:24,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're often trying to provide all those resources and parent support the best that we can.

385
01:42:27,911 --> 01:42:30,773
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an overview of our elementary counseling staff.

386
01:42:31,343 --> 01:42:37,065
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice that every elementary school has two school social workers.

387
01:42:37,585 --> 01:42:41,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The Brooks, one of those positions is filled by a community-based social worker.

388
01:42:41,567 --> 01:42:44,688
[SPEAKER_03]: We've contracted with Elliott to fill that position.

389
01:42:45,528 --> 01:42:50,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a little bit of a difference between the number of school psychologists in the building.

390
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:56,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really is dependent on our special education programming and how many evaluations we think we will need.

391
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:18,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Our elementary social-emotional learning consists of responsive classroom, the zones of regulation, our nexus classes, which is the specialists that we added in 2021, and our Sandy Hook promise programming, First Start with Hello.

392
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:29,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you move up to middle school services, that's when school counseling, which we previously called guidance, comes into play.

393
01:43:30,016 --> 01:43:31,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Every student has a school counselor.

394
01:43:32,497 --> 01:43:39,380
[SPEAKER_03]: We still offer lunch and social skills group based on need, and there's individual group counseling and, of course, resources and parent support.

395
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:51,645
[SPEAKER_03]: For our staffing, each of our middle schools has two school counselors, and then they have a school social worker or two.

396
01:43:52,305 --> 01:43:59,990
[SPEAKER_03]: The McGlynn has one in-house school social worker and a community-based counselor from Elliott who comes three days a week, and they each have a school psychologist.

397
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:04,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference in services for staff is really, again, dependent on the programming within the schools.

398
01:44:09,121 --> 01:44:14,223
[SPEAKER_03]: For our middle school social-emotional learning, we have advisory slash guidance classes.

399
01:44:14,243 --> 01:44:20,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called advisory at the Anderson Guidance at the McGlynn, but we start really focusing on those restorative practices.

400
01:44:20,885 --> 01:44:33,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So talking to our students, we hold community groups and we also have conversations amongst themselves to build those social skills when something goes awry in the school environment between students.

401
01:44:37,005 --> 01:44:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: For our high school services, again, every student has a school counselor.

402
01:44:41,247 --> 01:44:43,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Group support is available by topic.

403
01:44:43,728 --> 01:44:47,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So anxiety, grief, trauma, we have individual counseling.

404
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:49,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Same resources for parents.

405
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:57,714
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference for our high school students really comes in for our STEPS program, which is our hospital reentry program, which started in 2019.

406
01:44:58,594 --> 01:45:04,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have a community counselor within the building for students who have difficulty accessing it outside of school.

407
01:45:08,945 --> 01:45:18,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Our high school counseling staff consists of six school counselors, four social workers, two school psychologists, and we of course have two school social workers at the Curtis Tufts as well.

408
01:45:20,095 --> 01:45:25,220
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives you a sense of the general overall caseload for each of those specialties.

409
01:45:29,784 --> 01:45:33,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is when we start to really introduce a heavy push on the college and career counseling.

410
01:45:34,301 --> 01:45:44,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at students as individuals, what are their interests, their values, they're meeting with their school counselor to talk about what all of our goal is, is to successfully transition you off into our community.

411
01:45:45,529 --> 01:45:47,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can we help you get there?

412
01:45:51,914 --> 01:45:54,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We have started, once again, Coffee with Councilors.

413
01:45:54,536 --> 01:45:55,717
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for school counselors.

414
01:45:56,397 --> 01:45:58,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents can come in on these dates.

415
01:45:58,879 --> 01:46:00,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in CAF 1 at the high school from 8 to 9 a.m.

416
01:46:01,909 --> 01:46:11,571
[SPEAKER_03]: We really welcome everyone to come to talk about certainly students and how we can help you help your child with their plans to transition after Medford High School.

417
01:46:16,492 --> 01:46:26,014
[SPEAKER_03]: The high school social emotional learning consists of, once again, that heavy push on restorative practices, our advisory and wind blocks, health and wellness classes.

418
01:46:26,794 --> 01:46:29,355
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a block of nexus at the high school.

419
01:46:29,435 --> 01:46:30,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a different iteration

420
01:46:31,517 --> 01:46:38,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for ninth grade students that started in 2016, who we have identified in eighth grade as maybe just needing a little more of a home base.

421
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:41,360
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two faculty within that classroom.

422
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:46,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small group of students, and they focus on just providing a little bit of extra support for them.

423
01:46:47,382 --> 01:46:54,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And our counselors have been going into our English learner classrooms to push in and provide more of those social emotional learning.

424
01:46:55,404 --> 01:47:01,308
[SPEAKER_03]: support, certainly, as far as what they can expect from Medford High School compared to their previous high school in another country.

425
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk a little bit about our hospital re-entry program, which is called STEPS, which stands for Student in Transition for Engagement, Progress, and Success.

426
01:47:12,095 --> 01:47:21,982
[SPEAKER_03]: For staffing in that program, we have one social worker who is dedicated solely to that program, and we have six teachers who cycle through on a schedule to provide academic support.

427
01:47:23,386 --> 01:47:27,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So we offer clinical counseling, family communication, and of course care coordination.

428
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:38,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for our students who either are coming back from some sort of extensive medical leave or an incident that has required them medically to be out of school for some time.

429
01:47:42,505 --> 01:47:46,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, students are absent due to psychiatric hospitalizations, medical hospitalizations,

430
01:47:47,435 --> 01:47:53,320
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our fair share of concussion protocols we help students with or chronic absences due to a medical complication.

431
01:47:54,622 --> 01:47:58,965
[SPEAKER_03]: This gives you a little bit of data for our numbers for the STEPS program.

432
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:01,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we started in 2019.

433
01:48:01,488 --> 01:48:03,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that was an abbreviated year due to the closure.

434
01:48:05,131 --> 01:48:13,619
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're averaging, and I expect us to meet this as well, we're averaging about 60 episodes and about 45 students that we're supporting.

435
01:48:14,099 --> 01:48:16,540
[SPEAKER_03]: each year, so an episode might be a hospitalization.

436
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:22,024
[SPEAKER_03]: So for some of our students that have repeat hospitalizations, depending on the challenges that they're facing that year.

437
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:41,014
[SPEAKER_03]: This all fits into our multi tiered system of support, so information that and support that we're offering all of our students, groups of students and those really specialized tier three services for students in need.

438
01:48:42,355 --> 01:48:43,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So how it all works in.

439
01:48:44,264 --> 01:49:03,871
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a visual for you, which really just groups all of those services I talked about in terms of how we're working with our tier one students, how we're filtering through our student support teams and referrals into group counseling supports or crisis management, and those individualized, really highly specialized services at tier three.

440
01:49:08,093 --> 01:49:10,934
[SPEAKER_03]: We offer a lot of screenings at our middle and high school

441
01:49:12,538 --> 01:49:19,205
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the largest is SBIRT, so Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment, and this is around substance use.

442
01:49:19,746 --> 01:49:24,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're screening students in seventh grade, and we screen them again in 10th grade.

443
01:49:25,532 --> 01:49:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also utilize screening through our Signs of Suicide program, which is provided to us free of cost through Sandy Hook Promise, but developed through MindWise.

444
01:49:35,014 --> 01:49:55,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So students receive education within their health classes around suicide, how to identify the signs of it in themselves or their friends, where to go in the school for support, and then we screen our students for clinical depression and provide them a little more education or in more extreme circumstances, crisis evaluations at the school.

445
01:50:00,029 --> 01:50:02,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about our community partner highlights.

446
01:50:02,391 --> 01:50:05,633
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something I haven't talked about more at school committee.

447
01:50:06,153 --> 01:50:09,035
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a look at some of our major partnerships for mental health.

448
01:50:10,016 --> 01:50:13,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're partnering a lot more with agencies.

449
01:50:13,698 --> 01:50:14,939
[SPEAKER_03]: We really rely heavily.

450
01:50:15,539 --> 01:50:19,742
[SPEAKER_03]: CHA has been one of our newer partners with their walk-in clinic for mental health.

451
01:50:19,902 --> 01:50:27,727
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done an excellent job, both with providing immediate services in a walk-in capacity and also crisis evaluations at our school.

452
01:50:27,788 --> 01:50:28,768
[SPEAKER_03]: They come very quickly.

453
01:50:28,868 --> 01:50:29,869
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate them.

454
01:50:30,549 --> 01:50:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts Center for Adolescent Wellness is a new intensive outpatient program for students.

455
01:50:37,155 --> 01:50:39,316
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been extremely collaborative with us.

456
01:50:40,237 --> 01:50:42,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Children's Room is pushing in for grief groups.

457
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:45,462
[SPEAKER_03]: We've worked with Elliott for quite some time with our clinicians.

458
01:50:46,162 --> 01:50:54,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts Alliance for Portuguese Speakers has done a phenomenal job running groups for our Portuguese speaking students and providing them community supports.

459
01:50:54,624 --> 01:51:02,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And then BRITE is the overarching network within Massachusetts for hospital reentry programs that provided us startup support and continued support.

460
01:51:03,187 --> 01:51:06,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk a little bit more about our partnership with MGH and Care Solace as well.

461
01:51:09,212 --> 01:51:18,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So Care Solace is the program and platform that we utilize to guide students, families, staff into community-based care.

462
01:51:19,197 --> 01:51:27,402
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see here, this is the number of cases we've referred so far this year, 123, and Care Solace has made 61 appointments.

463
01:51:29,403 --> 01:51:36,587
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been around 11,000 total communications between Care Solace and those seeking care.

464
01:51:41,724 --> 01:51:57,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple more innovative partnerships for this year is we have a wellness coach through a grant from Massachusetts General Hospital and C4 Innovations to provide all of our SBIRT screening at the high school level.

465
01:51:58,357 --> 01:52:04,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So previously, we were working with our nursing staff and our counseling staff to screen

466
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,311
[SPEAKER_03]: all of our ninth grade students in about one to two minutes.

467
01:52:07,491 --> 01:52:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: The wellness coach is actually transitioning to 10th grade students, and they meet with students for about 10 to 15 minutes.

468
01:52:14,633 --> 01:52:31,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more robust education, it's more robust conversations around what their substance use practices are, but really more focusing on what are their positive habits that they have, how do they keep those going, what are their goals for their future, and providing them resources on how to stay on track.

469
01:52:33,015 --> 01:52:45,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And I Decide is a program that is for a tier two level for students who have self-identified or identified through the SBIRT screening process as needing substance use education and support.

470
01:52:45,405 --> 01:52:49,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is also curriculum offered to us for free from MGH, which is great.

471
01:52:50,429 --> 01:52:54,752
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some of our college and career partners we've worked heavily with this year.

472
01:52:56,613 --> 01:53:00,937
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been wonderful in providing us a lot of support for our students.

473
01:53:02,062 --> 01:53:05,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll highlight a couple for you on the next slide.

474
01:53:07,623 --> 01:53:12,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've had several partnerships with local universities for on-the-spot admissions.

475
01:53:12,984 --> 01:53:17,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're coming in, they're meeting with students, they're reviewing their information, they say, great, you're in.

476
01:53:17,665 --> 01:53:22,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had several students, I think about six, accepted very quickly to Lesley University in December.

477
01:53:22,266 --> 01:53:23,786
[SPEAKER_03]: We just went to UMass Dartmouth.

478
01:53:24,386 --> 01:53:26,427
[SPEAKER_03]: They hosted a nice meeting for us.

479
01:53:27,727 --> 01:53:31,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Bunker Hill Community College has also offered on-the-spot admissions.

480
01:53:32,355 --> 01:53:37,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And Middlesex has come in to talk about their dental assisting program and really give some hands on information to our students.

481
01:53:41,139 --> 01:53:50,864
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a program that is sponsored through Tufts called Let's Get Ready, and it really helps students plan in a more robust way who need support for transitioning after high school.

482
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:55,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also offer Bunker Hill dual enrollment courses.

483
01:53:56,383 --> 01:54:01,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So these offer the ability for students to take courses at Bunker Hill Community College.

484
01:54:02,768 --> 01:54:05,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And we provide assistance with that.

485
01:54:05,691 --> 01:54:07,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been working really well.

486
01:54:07,092 --> 01:54:09,254
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a wait list for those courses.

487
01:54:12,316 --> 01:54:13,557
[SPEAKER_03]: community-based scholarships.

488
01:54:14,298 --> 01:54:18,041
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are scholarships that are either within Medford or very close region.

489
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:23,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently we have over 30 scholarships that are offering our students a half million dollars a year.

490
01:54:23,426 --> 01:54:26,028
[SPEAKER_03]: So that program is incredibly robust and we're thankful for that.

491
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:29,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's next?

492
01:54:30,612 --> 01:54:34,735
[SPEAKER_03]: This spring we're looking to offer career panels for our juniors and seniors.

493
01:54:34,775 --> 01:54:35,656
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be bringing in

494
01:54:36,141 --> 01:54:44,967
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, different members of our community and those who are connected to community to talk about what their profession is so that our students can make informed decisions.

495
01:54:45,427 --> 01:54:47,789
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to continue to strengthen our community partnerships.

496
01:54:47,849 --> 01:54:52,953
[SPEAKER_03]: We really cannot be, you know, continue to offer all the robust programming we have without them.

497
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:57,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And caregiver engagement and education is certainly something we're looking to grow.

498
01:54:58,903 --> 01:55:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: The other exciting news is I've been on a list for seven years for a needs therapy dog, and I hound them every six months as far as when my application is coming up.

499
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:13,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've been very patient with me, but they said it expected in 2025.

500
01:55:14,653 --> 01:55:18,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll certainly come back to you if that application is accepted, and we'll talk about what that would look like.

501
01:55:20,457 --> 01:55:20,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

502
01:55:20,837 --> 01:55:21,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Schulman.

503
01:55:21,517 --> 01:55:22,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

504
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:23,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

505
01:55:24,132 --> 01:55:25,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You covered all the basics.

506
01:55:27,093 --> 01:55:28,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two questions.

507
01:55:28,935 --> 01:55:32,097
[SPEAKER_08]: On the STEPS program, you mentioned there's six teachers that cycle through.

508
01:55:32,237 --> 01:55:38,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they current Medford Public Schools teachers that are leaving the classroom for a period of time?

509
01:55:38,501 --> 01:55:39,041
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that work?

510
01:55:39,521 --> 01:55:43,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So every teacher at Medford High School has a mini section that they teach.

511
01:55:43,464 --> 01:55:47,587
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two classes per cycle, so two out of the six-day cycle.

512
01:55:47,627 --> 01:55:51,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of having a mini within their classroom, they're going down to the STEPS room.

513
01:55:52,013 --> 01:55:54,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have divided it out by specialty.

514
01:55:54,235 --> 01:56:01,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have history teacher, science, math, English, all rotating through to provide specialized support for our students during different times of the week.

515
01:56:02,281 --> 01:56:05,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, that's awesome that the schedule allows that.

516
01:56:05,884 --> 01:56:11,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested to hear how the new schedule, whenever that gets presented, will work.

517
01:56:11,808 --> 01:56:16,032
[SPEAKER_08]: SBIRT only in seventh and 10th grade, which I'm glad we're doing it, obviously.

518
01:56:16,752 --> 01:56:17,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think about

519
01:56:19,193 --> 01:56:29,035
[SPEAKER_08]: middle school is not, I don't, most of us don't remember it fondly if you did go to middle school, but is there other places where they do it every year?

520
01:56:29,275 --> 01:56:40,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And is that like, I'm sure there's a huge effort involved with doing this, but I just think about like, that's a lot of years, three years of major change for adolescents.

521
01:56:41,158 --> 01:56:46,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems like a long time, like, you know, seventh grade, they do this, everything looks dandy.

522
01:56:46,779 --> 01:56:47,379
[SPEAKER_08]: If in

523
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:55,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Later in the same seventh grade year eighth grade or ninth grade, they, they have a new addiction 10th grades a long time to wait to find out.

524
01:56:57,014 --> 01:57:01,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So, is that, what are your thoughts on that we had previously done seventh and ninth grade.

525
01:57:04,082 --> 01:57:07,724
[SPEAKER_03]: the purpose of it is really to focus on preventative strategies.

526
01:57:07,904 --> 01:57:10,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking to prevent substance use.

527
01:57:10,946 --> 01:57:16,289
[SPEAKER_03]: With the guidance of MGH, they've asked us based on their research protocols to switch it to 10th grade.

528
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:22,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those students who are currently in 10th grade undergoing the screening also underwent the same screening in ninth grade.

529
01:57:24,053 --> 01:57:30,376
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've looked to our partners there as far as guidance and they've identified those are the best years for them.

530
01:57:30,396 --> 01:57:31,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

531
01:57:34,059 --> 01:57:34,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

532
01:57:35,901 --> 01:57:46,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I just ask that when coffee with the counselors happens, some communication goes out to high school parents who are not available on Fridays between 8 and 9 a.m.

533
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:48,652
[SPEAKER_02]: to ever hear what's being said in those sessions.

534
01:57:49,012 --> 01:57:49,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

535
01:57:50,233 --> 01:57:59,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the PTO has indicated a willingness to help disseminate that information, but I haven't seen it materialize yet, and I don't think it's for lack of asking.

536
01:58:00,748 --> 01:58:09,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping the counselors can formalize whatever it is that they're talking about and make sure it's shared a little bit more broadly than the audience who can make themselves available during the school day.

537
01:58:10,434 --> 01:58:10,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.

538
01:58:10,754 --> 01:58:11,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

539
01:58:11,354 --> 01:58:11,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

540
01:58:14,536 --> 01:58:15,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Branley.

541
01:58:16,498 --> 01:58:17,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being here.

542
01:58:18,279 --> 01:58:20,600
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to compliment the STEPS program.

543
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:25,103
[SPEAKER_10]: My family has benefited from that and it was a huge

544
01:58:26,348 --> 01:58:32,469
[SPEAKER_10]: plus trying to get back to school, you know, when obviously you're going through something to make sure that that gets done.

545
01:58:32,509 --> 01:58:39,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And the rotation is awesome with academics because the teachers are coming in there, they're helping when need be, and it's really a safe space.

546
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:40,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Does Ms.

547
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:41,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Cunningham still?

548
01:58:42,211 --> 01:58:42,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes.

549
01:58:42,791 --> 01:58:43,531
[SPEAKER_10]: She's amazing.

550
01:58:43,571 --> 01:58:45,351
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to give her a shout out for that.

551
01:58:45,711 --> 01:58:46,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very grateful to her.

552
01:58:47,632 --> 01:58:53,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And then just one other question, the high school counseling, so that's nexus for high school, correct?

553
01:58:53,413 --> 01:58:53,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

554
01:58:53,893 --> 01:58:55,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's done by the counselors?

555
01:58:55,723 --> 01:58:57,223
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's academic teachers.

556
01:58:57,563 --> 01:58:59,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Academic teachers, so like health teachers?

557
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:04,345
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so one is a ELA specialist and the other is science.

558
01:59:05,945 --> 01:59:06,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

559
01:59:06,485 --> 01:59:07,746
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a co-taught classroom.

560
01:59:08,086 --> 01:59:09,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Co-taught classroom, okay.

561
01:59:09,766 --> 01:59:10,946
[SPEAKER_10]: How does it not fall under health?

562
01:59:11,326 --> 01:59:15,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Like under health, I guess.

563
01:59:15,948 --> 01:59:17,848
[SPEAKER_10]: How does English and science

564
01:59:19,076 --> 01:59:21,037
[SPEAKER_10]: teach the nexus portion of that?

565
01:59:21,337 --> 01:59:22,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I making sense?

566
01:59:22,658 --> 01:59:22,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

567
01:59:23,058 --> 01:59:26,921
[SPEAKER_03]: So the nexus curriculum is very similar to health in elementary school.

568
01:59:27,381 --> 01:59:30,283
[SPEAKER_03]: When you come up to high school, it's a very different model.

569
01:59:30,523 --> 01:59:31,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a support classroom.

570
01:59:33,725 --> 01:59:35,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only for a small number of students.

571
01:59:36,246 --> 01:59:37,047
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, perfect.

572
01:59:37,887 --> 01:59:38,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

573
01:59:38,467 --> 01:59:38,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

574
01:59:38,848 --> 01:59:39,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Intoppa.

575
01:59:40,711 --> 01:59:40,991
[SPEAKER_13]: For sure.

576
01:59:41,091 --> 01:59:44,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Director Schulman for presenting all this information.

577
01:59:44,053 --> 01:59:50,816
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess the first question is a clarification on the STEPS program.

578
01:59:50,836 --> 01:59:52,297
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very similar to the BRIDGE program.

579
01:59:52,317 --> 01:59:52,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

580
01:59:52,457 --> 01:59:55,759
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like our chapter of like we've renamed it.

581
01:59:55,779 --> 01:59:56,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly right.

582
01:59:56,199 --> 01:59:56,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

583
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:17,648
[SPEAKER_13]: that's huge, and that's proven in other districts to really help a lot of our youth, especially, well, not our youth, but it is, seems to be helping our youth, but youth in other districts, especially as the mental health crisis and epidemic, as people were calling it, is increasing.

584
02:00:17,708 --> 02:00:22,550
[SPEAKER_13]: And we saw that in an increase in numbers, and then, you know, we're slowly seeing them come down.

585
02:00:24,631 --> 02:00:27,372
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of tier one, tier two,

586
02:00:27,972 --> 02:00:37,698
[SPEAKER_13]: two and tier three in terms of, I noticed that, was it suicide screening and prevention was on all tiers and different approaches with that?

587
02:00:37,839 --> 02:00:41,761
[SPEAKER_13]: How are we approaching it at a tier one versus a tier three?

588
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:44,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So that works through our health classes and middle and high school.

589
02:00:44,883 --> 02:00:45,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

590
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:49,246
[SPEAKER_13]: And then love to see that a lot of things were starting in middle school.

591
02:00:49,866 --> 02:00:54,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I was curious to hear about some of the things that were starting in elementary school in terms of,

592
02:00:55,797 --> 02:01:07,724
[SPEAKER_13]: sort of education with this, because obviously you don't want to like put all these topics on elementary schoolers, but I know I was a student who suffered with severe anxiety and was put into therapy as a third grader.

593
02:01:08,464 --> 02:01:11,266
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of that was the unknown of what I was feeling.

594
02:01:11,926 --> 02:01:24,694
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm curious to see, there's two parts to this, curious to see where we're going in terms of possibly seeing in some soft integration of possible mental health education within our elementary schools,

595
02:01:25,734 --> 02:01:31,298
[SPEAKER_13]: because that can be one of the scariest parts of when you're eight, you don't know what's happening, why you feel a certain way.

596
02:01:32,419 --> 02:01:51,271
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that was certainly the case for me, as well as looking at, and we talked about it, I believe you talked about a little bit in the program about the self-reliance skills, not self-reliance, but it was social and emotional learning outside of the classroom and looking at other programs, sort of, I know that some universities are adapting

597
02:01:51,909 --> 02:02:08,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Things like headspace subscriptions for students, you know, obviously institutionally wide but maybe for us case by case basis ways for students to learn how to I hate to use the word deal with these things but off hours of how students are able to get support and resources.

598
02:02:10,134 --> 02:02:13,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Because a lot of these issues are still stigmatized.

599
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:19,026
[SPEAKER_13]: There's still an issue of why are you stressed, you're 13, what's going on, what's stressing you out so much.

600
02:02:19,106 --> 02:02:24,112
[SPEAKER_13]: But for a lot of these students, it really is a huge, huge problem.

601
02:02:25,013 --> 02:02:27,637
[SPEAKER_13]: So curious to see the direction possibly we're looking at.

602
02:02:28,965 --> 02:02:36,051
[SPEAKER_13]: of out-of-class help, support and resources, you know, even just like a brochure of phone lines to call if you're feeling this way in the middle of the night.

603
02:02:36,211 --> 02:02:37,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Who do you get into contact with?

604
02:02:38,673 --> 02:02:45,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't, again, I've only been out of the public schools for five years now, but I don't ever remember seeing that.

605
02:02:45,198 --> 02:02:47,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's because I didn't need the resources at that time.

606
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:49,381
[SPEAKER_13]: But that also says I feel like

607
02:02:51,621 --> 02:02:57,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Or I am under the impression of, I feel like this information should be present without needing it.

608
02:02:57,684 --> 02:02:59,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we should have these ready.

609
02:02:59,705 --> 02:03:03,747
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be nowhere to go before we even need to, you know, think about the bridge program.

610
02:03:04,067 --> 02:03:04,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

611
02:03:04,467 --> 02:03:05,588
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a lot.

612
02:03:06,768 --> 02:03:16,333
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess the two, the too long didn't read of all that is looking at possible integration with, you know, the elementary school, seeing where we're at in terms of screening there.

613
02:03:16,974 --> 02:03:30,257
[SPEAKER_13]: because that's also where I was screened for ADD, and that really helped set me up for my further education, as well as the, as it's put in the report, social-emotional learning integration throughout.

614
02:03:30,657 --> 02:03:31,397
[SPEAKER_13]: So where we're at with that?

615
02:03:31,437 --> 02:03:38,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So from an elementary school level, we utilize the Michigan model, which is health, and that has a social-emotional learning component within it.

616
02:03:39,059 --> 02:03:40,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're also using zones of regulation.

617
02:03:40,999 --> 02:03:43,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of zones of regulation is really talking about

618
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,000
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I feeling?

619
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:46,060
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this feeling?

620
02:03:46,681 --> 02:03:50,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And reducing the stigma of every feeling is a good feeling in some ways.

621
02:03:50,321 --> 02:03:56,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly when you're feeling certain ways, sometimes you need to utilize coping strategies because they may not be appropriate for that environment.

622
02:03:57,203 --> 02:04:05,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So teaching our children about what is a feeling and when a feeling you might need help from somebody else.

623
02:04:05,885 --> 02:04:07,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're utilizing those programs.

624
02:04:07,445 --> 02:04:08,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always looking at screeners.

625
02:04:09,345 --> 02:04:12,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is a screener that is valid and reliable?

626
02:04:12,566 --> 02:04:14,907
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we be screening more of our students for support?

627
02:04:15,887 --> 02:04:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And then leaning on community, right?

628
02:04:17,748 --> 02:04:19,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Community-based care is really important.

629
02:04:20,069 --> 02:04:23,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can only provide so much within six hours.

630
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:27,111
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure our students and families know where to go in the community.

631
02:04:27,531 --> 02:04:28,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where Care Solace has come in.

632
02:04:28,972 --> 02:04:40,836
[SPEAKER_03]: They've helped us tremendously sort of reduce those personalized phone calls that our school social workers and counselors were previously trying to make and on the behalf of our families as well to get community-based care.

633
02:04:41,574 --> 02:04:42,254
[SPEAKER_03]: after school hours.

634
02:04:43,355 --> 02:04:44,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that answer your question?

635
02:04:44,335 --> 02:05:08,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I guess the more part of like, I know this would probably be more for high school or would integrate starting in the high school, but again, that looking at other programs outside of the classroom for students to access, whether it's a portal online or even like, again, like a brochure of resources outside of the Medford Public Schools that they may utilize, looking at integration of that as well within this.

636
02:05:09,822 --> 02:05:15,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a 30-page brochure of community-based resources that we provide to families.

637
02:05:15,345 --> 02:05:16,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been translated.

638
02:05:16,245 --> 02:05:22,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be updated a little bit, but we go and make sure every year that things are relevant.

639
02:05:22,448 --> 02:05:32,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I think certainly the addition of CHA with our walk-in clinic this year is something we've been trying to heavily promote for families, not waiting until you're in extreme crisis.

640
02:05:32,073 --> 02:05:35,295
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're feeling like you need care more urgently, they've been tremendous.

641
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:36,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

642
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:36,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

643
02:05:37,051 --> 02:05:39,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Really appreciate it.

644
02:05:40,415 --> 02:05:40,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

645
02:05:44,039 --> 02:05:48,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, we have English learner EL update and enrollment report.

646
02:05:48,904 --> 02:05:52,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Paul Teixeira, director of ELL and title three.

647
02:05:52,689 --> 02:05:52,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

648
02:06:16,786 --> 02:06:21,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to our new members.

649
02:06:23,272 --> 02:06:32,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's presentation is an overview of the EL program to kind of help the new members understand what's happening in Medford with our English learners.

650
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:42,223
[SPEAKER_09]: The program that we have is a sheltered English immersion program.

651
02:06:42,363 --> 02:06:57,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a two component program where we ensure that students get access to grade level content curriculum, as well as English as a second language instruction to support English language development among our learners.

652
02:06:58,359 --> 02:07:02,222
[SPEAKER_09]: We have programs in every elementary school.

653
02:07:03,023 --> 02:07:14,532
[SPEAKER_09]: We have newcomer programs for students who are at the foundational level of English language acquisition at the McGlynn and at the Missituck in grades one through five.

654
02:07:15,072 --> 02:07:23,439
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have EL pullout in every elementary school for students who are at the transitional level, which is three through five.

655
02:07:24,522 --> 02:07:31,544
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the middle school, we have a program at the McGlynn Middle School, which encompasses newcomers as well as ESL.

656
02:07:32,065 --> 02:07:36,586
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the high school, we have a newcomer program and ESL program.

657
02:07:37,927 --> 02:07:50,551
[SPEAKER_09]: And we offer, we have a dedicated teacher on the vocational side of the house to support newcomer students as well as transitional students with the CTE programs that we offer.

658
02:07:53,459 --> 02:08:06,884
[SPEAKER_09]: How these decisions are made is based on when students register, they fill out a home language survey form, which is a federal form that everyone's required to complete.

659
02:08:07,504 --> 02:08:13,547
[SPEAKER_09]: When we complete the registration, we test the students for their English language proficiency.

660
02:08:14,187 --> 02:08:16,468
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a test that include all four domains.

661
02:08:16,548 --> 02:08:19,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's four separate tests and listening, reading, writing, and speaking.

662
02:08:20,575 --> 02:08:26,700
[SPEAKER_09]: We administer the test, we get a level, we create a schedule and determine which program the students will go in.

663
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:32,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Once the students have been in the program for a year, they take something called ACCESS.

664
02:08:32,884 --> 02:08:38,969
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a state mandated test similar to MCAS, but it's specifically for English learner students.

665
02:08:40,225 --> 02:08:42,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it measures the four domains of language.

666
02:08:43,407 --> 02:08:52,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And based on this, they take the test in January, we get the results the end of May, and then we make our placement decisions in June for the following September.

667
02:08:52,854 --> 02:08:56,576
[SPEAKER_09]: This is only one piece of data that we use to make our placement determinations.

668
02:08:57,097 --> 02:09:08,705
[SPEAKER_09]: We use a lot of district determined measures, such as map scores, we do writing prompts that are used, that are scored using the WIDA writing rubric, which is what the ELD curriculum is based upon.

669
02:09:12,105 --> 02:09:26,084
[SPEAKER_09]: So enrollment numbers, I have the history going back to 2015-16, and I'm keeping it in there because eventually we're going to hit 700 students, and I want to know how many years it took us to double our numbers.

670
02:09:27,025 --> 02:09:34,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this moment, and this says 631, but today we just had 632 join Medford.

671
02:09:34,887 --> 02:09:37,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have 632 English learner students.

672
02:09:37,928 --> 02:09:39,508
[SPEAKER_09]: That number is in real time.

673
02:09:40,049 --> 02:09:48,531
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the year, when DESE runs their report, the number will go down because if you see 22, 23, that was at 528, but we actually at one point had 580 students last year.

674
02:09:54,363 --> 02:10:05,545
[SPEAKER_09]: DESE counts a student as an English learner in the previous year if they are recorded in our SIMS data, our student information management system, for two cycles.

675
02:10:06,065 --> 02:10:11,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we do our October report and our March report, then the student counts.

676
02:10:11,586 --> 02:10:16,467
[SPEAKER_09]: If the March report and the June report, the number counts.

677
02:10:16,968 --> 02:10:23,829
[SPEAKER_09]: But any students that leave us in the interim, even though they may have been with us for three months, don't count in those numbers.

678
02:10:25,435 --> 02:10:29,618
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you look at the bottom, we have how many students were tested.

679
02:10:30,358 --> 02:10:33,861
[SPEAKER_09]: So, which one?

680
02:10:34,941 --> 02:10:36,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to interrupt.

681
02:10:36,262 --> 02:10:37,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that chart.

682
02:10:37,823 --> 02:10:38,944
[SPEAKER_07]: What year is that?

683
02:10:39,284 --> 02:10:41,406
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, just since the school year.

684
02:10:41,946 --> 02:10:43,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We've tested 391 new students.

685
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,272
[SPEAKER_09]: in the district.

686
02:10:46,432 --> 02:10:52,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Of those 391, 259 qualified for EL services.

687
02:10:53,215 --> 02:10:57,757
[SPEAKER_09]: But then we've also had 134 students withdraw from the district.

688
02:10:58,398 --> 02:11:01,059
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a very fluid population of English learners.

689
02:11:01,659 --> 02:11:05,301
[SPEAKER_09]: We have students who will come here because they may have existing family.

690
02:11:06,021 --> 02:11:09,622
[SPEAKER_09]: They get started here in Medford, then they find their own housing, they move out.

691
02:11:10,103 --> 02:11:12,463
[SPEAKER_09]: We have students that go back to their home country.

692
02:11:13,384 --> 02:11:23,667
[SPEAKER_09]: We have students that just leave the district to, unfortunately, many high school students, they go into the workforce to support and help their families.

693
02:11:24,648 --> 02:11:33,011
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've had 134 withdrawals this year, but basically 765 students have passed through our doors to date for English learners.

694
02:11:36,909 --> 02:11:40,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, we have university partnerships.

695
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:42,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a partnership with Lesley University.

696
02:11:43,411 --> 02:11:47,292
[SPEAKER_09]: They have an elementary education program with an add-on Yale license.

697
02:11:48,112 --> 02:11:56,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And what that means is while they're completing their coursework, they do a year-long internship in one of our newcomer classrooms in the district.

698
02:11:56,474 --> 02:11:57,075
[SPEAKER_09]: So we get,

699
02:11:58,955 --> 02:12:03,518
[SPEAKER_09]: a teacher candidate from August through June.

700
02:12:04,279 --> 02:12:13,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And the great piece of this is that essentially we get to train the teacher, and when we have openings, we can hire them.

701
02:12:13,105 --> 02:12:19,070
[SPEAKER_09]: They're certified in both areas, and they're familiar with the district, they're familiar with our protocols.

702
02:12:20,267 --> 02:12:24,211
[SPEAKER_09]: The other university partnership we have is the UMass program.

703
02:12:24,912 --> 02:12:40,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, I presented to you that we were part of a grant opportunity with the US Department of Education to have 15 seats for a free half masters in applied linguistics.

704
02:12:41,167 --> 02:12:44,928
[SPEAKER_09]: and that gets teachers an ESL certification.

705
02:12:45,388 --> 02:12:58,292
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's for existing teachers in the district to kind of broaden their teaching acumen so that they can put forth all of the teaching strategies beyond retail into their classrooms.

706
02:12:58,972 --> 02:13:01,953
[SPEAKER_09]: So this program ends in June.

707
02:13:02,493 --> 02:13:05,334
[SPEAKER_09]: We had 13 people successfully complete the program.

708
02:13:06,815 --> 02:13:13,337
[SPEAKER_09]: and they'll be duly certified in their content area as well as ESL if they pass the MTEL.

709
02:13:17,065 --> 02:13:25,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a District English Learner Advisory Council that is similar to Special Education CPAC.

710
02:13:26,492 --> 02:13:33,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I call this, many districts will call it an LPAC, English Language Parent Advisory Council.

711
02:13:33,556 --> 02:13:37,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to take the word parent out of it because many of our students are here without their parents.

712
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:40,381
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this is the equivalent.

713
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:42,823
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the District English Learner Advisory Council.

714
02:13:43,496 --> 02:13:44,716
[SPEAKER_09]: We have monthly meetings.

715
02:13:44,936 --> 02:13:50,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Eventually what should happen with this group is that the caregivers will eventually take it over.

716
02:13:51,238 --> 02:13:54,519
[SPEAKER_09]: It's challenging because they all don't speak the same language.

717
02:13:55,059 --> 02:14:06,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we utilize high school students who are bilingual to come to these meetings, to serve as interpreters, kind of bridge the gap between the different languages in the group.

718
02:14:07,422 --> 02:14:10,483
[SPEAKER_09]: We have people who have signed up to be leaders.

719
02:14:11,683 --> 02:14:16,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And they haven't started scheduling and running their own meetings, but it's a work in progress.

720
02:14:23,769 --> 02:14:32,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, we've also contracted some seminars for caregivers through the Massachusetts Partnership for Youth.

721
02:14:33,573 --> 02:14:38,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And in March, the presentation was on a healthy balance screen time.

722
02:14:38,914 --> 02:14:51,759
[SPEAKER_09]: This was to support our caregivers with establishing boundaries with devices in their home, how they can support the school, how they can use them as learning tools and some internet safety.

723
02:14:53,132 --> 02:14:56,334
[SPEAKER_09]: and next month's presentation is going to be on vaping.

724
02:14:59,335 --> 02:15:02,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we've also partnered with the Welcome Project in Somerville.

725
02:15:03,177 --> 02:15:05,618
[SPEAKER_09]: The Welcome Project helps provide...

726
02:15:06,857 --> 02:15:09,779
[SPEAKER_09]: caregivers with English classes for free.

727
02:15:10,339 --> 02:15:13,882
[SPEAKER_09]: They got a grant a year and a half ago to expand outside of Somerville.

728
02:15:14,462 --> 02:15:22,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I was working in partnership with Sarah Londgren from the Welcome Project and we ended up creating classes here in Medford.

729
02:15:22,348 --> 02:15:24,309
[SPEAKER_09]: We hold them at the Medford Public Library.

730
02:15:25,110 --> 02:15:31,234
[SPEAKER_09]: This way here, families don't have to come into the schools, get quarry checked for the classes or anything like that.

731
02:15:31,254 --> 02:15:34,316
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a beautiful new space in the library that they've been using.

732
02:15:35,660 --> 02:15:43,063
[SPEAKER_09]: We've run three in-person classes, and then those are on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and then we have virtual classes in the evening.

733
02:15:43,604 --> 02:15:48,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So the funding for this grant that the Welcome Project got is ending this year.

734
02:15:48,066 --> 02:15:57,170
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be the last class, but we're going to continue with the classes in the fall, and we'll use a federal grant, Title III, to continue these for our caregivers.

735
02:15:59,911 --> 02:16:02,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Tech Goes Home is another partnership we have.

736
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:10,805
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an organization in Boston that allows us to teach digital literacy to our caregivers.

737
02:16:12,126 --> 02:16:15,589
[SPEAKER_09]: We've trained Medford teachers who will work in the evening.

738
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:19,712
[SPEAKER_09]: We've created a curriculum for the caregivers.

739
02:16:20,193 --> 02:16:31,341
[SPEAKER_09]: It's everything from how to navigate the Medford Public Schools website, how to check for school lunches, how to communicate with your child's teacher, how to send an email, how to find English classes.

740
02:16:31,842 --> 02:16:33,183
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 15 hour course.

741
02:16:34,564 --> 02:16:38,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually just found out two hours before this meeting, our course was approved.

742
02:16:38,688 --> 02:16:40,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be running another one.

743
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:42,933
[SPEAKER_09]: It begins August 8th and it will end in June.

744
02:16:44,334 --> 02:16:52,883
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the completion of this, the caregivers get a free Chromebook, a free year of internet access, headphones, carrying case.

745
02:16:57,594 --> 02:17:01,759
[SPEAKER_09]: In other news, the Yale department just completed its tiered focused monitoring.

746
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:07,527
[SPEAKER_09]: This is similar to what special education just had to go through with the Department of Ed.

747
02:17:08,027 --> 02:17:16,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Every three to six year, every three years on a three year cycle, Desi comes in and does a complete audit of the department.

748
02:17:16,678 --> 02:17:18,400
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 12 criteria.

749
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:19,961
[SPEAKER_09]: 11 seems to be cut off.

750
02:17:20,601 --> 02:17:23,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, number 12 seems to be cut off on my computer.

751
02:17:23,704 --> 02:17:31,471
[SPEAKER_09]: But these are the criteria that they measure the efficacy of the EL program with.

752
02:17:32,011 --> 02:17:40,358
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the past year, I've had to upload hundreds of pages of documentation for each of these criteria and then

753
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:42,239
[SPEAKER_09]: criteria.

754
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:54,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they came into the district in February, and they did classroom walkthroughs at the McGlynn, the Missittuck, the McGlynn Middle, and then also the high school.

755
02:17:55,226 --> 02:17:57,667
[SPEAKER_09]: They interviewed caregivers.

756
02:17:57,787 --> 02:18:01,329
[SPEAKER_09]: They interviewed teachers, general education teachers, EL teachers.

757
02:18:01,729 --> 02:18:04,310
[SPEAKER_09]: They interviewed students and administrators.

758
02:18:06,391 --> 02:18:08,616
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be putting together a final report.

759
02:18:08,716 --> 02:18:10,319
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have it in the next few weeks.

760
02:18:10,339 --> 02:18:14,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I'll be back here to explain the findings in their report to you.

761
02:18:17,864 --> 02:18:21,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the new literacy program at the elementary level into reading.

762
02:18:22,408 --> 02:18:37,800
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the new materials that were purchased that the teachers have received extensive PD on the EL teachers are included in this, whether they're a newcomer teacher or pull out teacher, even though we have our own English language development curriculum.

763
02:18:38,380 --> 02:19:03,440
[SPEAKER_09]: What the EL teachers are doing is they're modifying the curriculum to support components from the inter-reading program so that the goal is that students leave newcomers, will go into a mainstream classroom, and while they're in the mainstream classroom, they'll still get EL support, but all of the inter-reading, all of the strategies for early literacy will be the same, so it's not,

764
02:19:04,261 --> 02:19:06,584
[SPEAKER_09]: a culture shock when they change levels.

765
02:19:07,344 --> 02:19:15,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a team of teachers putting together the curriculum, taking the old curriculum and aligning it with the new materials.

766
02:19:18,752 --> 02:19:23,154
[SPEAKER_09]: And then talking points is you'll hear people talk about this all the time.

767
02:19:23,994 --> 02:19:28,616
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a two-way communication platform that the district purchased.

768
02:19:29,416 --> 02:19:40,501
[SPEAKER_09]: It pulls information from our student information system to allow teachers, administrators, district administrators to engage in two-way communication with our families.

769
02:19:41,221 --> 02:19:43,282
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't just for English learner families.

770
02:19:43,882 --> 02:19:46,343
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a text message system.

771
02:19:46,803 --> 02:19:55,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And if in our home language or in the home language is identified as something other than English, the app automatically translates the message.

772
02:19:56,507 --> 02:19:58,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it goes, you know, if Portuguese was selected.

773
02:19:59,861 --> 02:20:01,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Teacher sends a classroom message home.

774
02:20:01,862 --> 02:20:05,325
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets translated into Portuguese just for that family.

775
02:20:06,185 --> 02:20:08,167
[SPEAKER_09]: The family responds in Portuguese.

776
02:20:08,307 --> 02:20:10,589
[SPEAKER_09]: It translates it back to English for the teacher.

777
02:20:11,269 --> 02:20:16,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So teachers have been using this now for a little over a year with the district subscription that we purchased.

778
02:20:16,953 --> 02:20:22,437
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just pulled last week's data to show you like almost 1,700 messages were sent home in a week.

779
02:20:26,761 --> 02:20:36,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Another translation device that we purchased for teachers and for school staff who interact with multilingual families is something called Pocket Talk.

780
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:39,431
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an oral translation device.

781
02:20:40,172 --> 02:20:52,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So you hold the button, you choose your target language, you speak, it interprets it, flip it, the other person speaks their language, it transfers it, translates it back into English.

782
02:20:53,547 --> 02:21:07,314
[SPEAKER_09]: These were given to all building principals, all building secretaries, nurses, anyone that comes into contact with caregivers where they may need on-the-spot instant translation.

783
02:21:07,834 --> 02:21:09,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And this isn't going to take the place of talking points.

784
02:21:10,056 --> 02:21:14,218
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to take the place of hiring interpreters for in-person meetings.

785
02:21:14,278 --> 02:21:18,040
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just the on-the-fly, you need an interpreter.

786
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:30,248
[SPEAKER_09]: We ended up purchasing 45 in the district and then Chad Fallon bought 15 for the CTE teachers because they'll have newcomer students going through the CTE rotations.

787
02:21:30,688 --> 02:21:39,491
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes it's really helpful for those teachers to be able to translate, especially where, you know, safety concerns in the shops right there on the fly.

788
02:21:39,991 --> 02:21:42,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all of the newcomer teachers have them as well.

789
02:21:45,714 --> 02:21:52,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for professional development, the EL department offers professional development outside of the typical professional development days.

790
02:21:53,899 --> 02:22:02,045
[SPEAKER_09]: All content teachers need to earn 15 hours of professional development in SEI or ESL strategies.

791
02:22:02,665 --> 02:22:05,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are on optional PD days.

792
02:22:05,527 --> 02:22:06,888
[SPEAKER_09]: These are in the evenings.

793
02:22:07,749 --> 02:22:15,494
[SPEAKER_09]: So teachers, it helps them recertify, but these topics were based on what teachers have asked for and what we've seen in the district.

794
02:22:20,555 --> 02:22:23,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And then coming up, we have summer enrichment planning.

795
02:22:23,656 --> 02:22:28,937
[SPEAKER_09]: We offer summer enrichment for elementary, middle, and high school.

796
02:22:30,458 --> 02:22:33,999
[SPEAKER_09]: This slide has changed from what I gave you, because I realized I missed some stuff.

797
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:37,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll give the new one to Lisa for you.

798
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:41,601
[SPEAKER_09]: We run an elementary summer program, K-5 at the Missittauk.

799
02:22:42,501 --> 02:22:57,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I've partnered with Anthony Petrelis with Summer Fun, and I will fund teachers to work in the afternoon program, so they can take Yale students who want to stay longer for the day, and it's at no cost to the families.

800
02:22:59,345 --> 02:23:03,448
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a program for students in grades five and six.

801
02:23:04,089 --> 02:23:05,190
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Starbase.

802
02:23:05,290 --> 02:23:06,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's at Hanscom Air Force Base.

803
02:23:07,032 --> 02:23:07,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a STEM lab.

804
02:23:08,033 --> 02:23:09,574
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a week-long STEM lab.

805
02:23:10,215 --> 02:23:13,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Students get to use 3D printers.

806
02:23:14,078 --> 02:23:17,761
[SPEAKER_09]: They have robotic wars with cars.

807
02:23:18,382 --> 02:23:19,943
[SPEAKER_09]: They do the derby cars.

808
02:23:20,063 --> 02:23:21,585
[SPEAKER_09]: They launch rockets.

809
02:23:21,805 --> 02:23:23,506
[SPEAKER_09]: They do chemistry experiments.

810
02:23:24,428 --> 02:23:31,602
[SPEAKER_09]: That's offered through Starbase, and we've been doing that now for, I think, six years.

811
02:23:33,131 --> 02:23:42,819
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have middle school summer enrichment at Medford High School, and then we do credit recovery for students in grades nine through 12, nine through 11, and then in grades six through 11.

812
02:23:43,299 --> 02:23:44,881
[SPEAKER_09]: We offer summer reading support.

813
02:23:46,342 --> 02:23:51,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I can use Title III funds to pay teachers to do office hours at the Medford Public Library.

814
02:23:51,546 --> 02:24:01,134
[SPEAKER_09]: So any middle school and high school students that need help with their summer reading, choosing a book, any of their math packets or history packets that they get, there's somebody there

815
02:24:02,515 --> 02:24:07,320
[SPEAKER_09]: two times a week, mornings and late afternoons to get that support.

816
02:24:10,483 --> 02:24:15,148
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this leads me to my last slide, which is an ask for the committee.

817
02:24:16,710 --> 02:24:22,376
[SPEAKER_09]: As our numbers are increasing, we have a large influx of students in kindergarten this year.

818
02:24:23,795 --> 02:24:28,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And I never have a crystal ball, I can never tell exactly how many students we're going to have.

819
02:24:28,885 --> 02:24:33,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have to base it on trends from the previous year.

820
02:24:34,361 --> 02:24:46,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, Basing, we had, I think, 38 newcomer students last year in kindergarten, and we currently have 32 students in first grade newcomer classes.

821
02:24:46,827 --> 02:24:53,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, that's not all from that class, that's students who have come in through the year, but that's how I gauge what my numbers are going to be.

822
02:24:54,410 --> 02:24:57,772
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, we have 20 more newcomer students than we did last year.

823
02:24:58,470 --> 02:25:08,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we are going to need another first grade classroom for newcomer students, and preferably at the McGlynn, because that is where the bulk of the students are.

824
02:25:10,537 --> 02:25:26,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't know the exact number until the end of May, beginning of June, because with the kindergarten students, they take that access test in January, and there is so much growth in a kindergarten student from January to June, that it's not an accurate measure.

825
02:25:28,087 --> 02:25:30,070
[SPEAKER_09]: we take the two options.

826
02:25:30,671 --> 02:25:39,342
[SPEAKER_09]: If the teachers say this student is ready to be reclassified as a former English learner student, we give them a test called the WAPT.

827
02:25:39,782 --> 02:25:43,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it measures all four domains, reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

828
02:25:44,727 --> 02:25:49,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will give us the determination if they have the cut score to just go into a general education classroom.

829
02:25:50,349 --> 02:25:57,132
[SPEAKER_09]: If they were a newcomer student and the teacher is recommending that they go into first grade newcomers, they also give that WAPT test.

830
02:25:57,672 --> 02:26:02,654
[SPEAKER_09]: That will give me the data I need to know that, yes, they have to remain in newcomers.

831
02:26:03,254 --> 02:26:05,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that won't happen until the beginning of June.

832
02:26:06,115 --> 02:26:09,156
[SPEAKER_09]: But based on previous trends, this is what I'm predicting.

833
02:26:11,097 --> 02:26:12,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Taksara.

834
02:26:12,558 --> 02:26:13,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?

835
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:16,909
[SPEAKER_07]: member Intoppa, then member Branley.

836
02:26:17,570 --> 02:26:21,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you, Director Zahara for coming and giving all these numbers.

837
02:26:22,013 --> 02:26:26,937
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be interested to see at some point sort of our statistics.

838
02:26:27,057 --> 02:26:38,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I know this probably pertains more to our high school students who come in as English language learners with their sort of integration into the arts and athletic departments and how they are sort of

839
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:41,660
[SPEAKER_13]: coexisting in those spaces.

840
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:59,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that at least my time at the high school, it always seemed very sectioned off in terms of not just academics, but also in terms of culture, like the culture of just leisure and existing in these spaces together.

841
02:26:59,944 --> 02:27:02,905
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really unfortunate.

842
02:27:03,065 --> 02:27:07,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Even at, we had a lot of EL students participate as stage crew,

843
02:27:08,736 --> 02:27:12,960
[SPEAKER_13]: And the drama club and they always stuck together and we're off by themselves.

844
02:27:13,921 --> 02:27:22,129
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd love to find out if there's a way that we can minimize that culture of things I mean it's a very scary thing of.

845
02:27:22,881 --> 02:27:25,302
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, learning linguistics and settling in.

846
02:27:25,363 --> 02:27:39,891
[SPEAKER_13]: And for some of these individual students, there was an individual who was on the crew team with member Olapade and I, who had just landed in the US in Somerville their first year, and we met them their second year.

847
02:27:40,111 --> 02:27:41,993
[SPEAKER_13]: And they didn't know the word for screwdriver.

848
02:27:42,553 --> 02:27:44,894
[SPEAKER_13]: And then by the end of it, you know, they were,

849
02:27:47,014 --> 02:27:55,943
[SPEAKER_13]: The growth that we witnessed with that individual because of how integrated they were and how socialized they were with us and how the program really benefited them.

850
02:27:56,644 --> 02:27:57,625
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a really beautiful thing.

851
02:27:57,665 --> 02:28:01,589
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd love to see sort of what we're doing as a As a

852
02:28:06,758 --> 02:28:15,640
[SPEAKER_13]: division, I don't know the right word, at the moment to push students to sort of more coexist together because it's benefit for both sides.

853
02:28:15,660 --> 02:28:17,140
[SPEAKER_13]: It's benefit for all involved.

854
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:19,000
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd love to see that at some point.

855
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:23,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and that happens with the CTE exploratory programs.

856
02:28:24,321 --> 02:28:29,942
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the new students go through the same rotations, and they're not a cohort.

857
02:28:30,122 --> 02:28:33,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It's six in this group, five in this group, so they are.

858
02:28:33,983 --> 02:28:35,845
[SPEAKER_09]: the students are integrated with everyone.

859
02:28:35,945 --> 02:28:40,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And those rotations include all the CTE exploratory programs as well as the arts.

860
02:28:40,928 --> 02:28:41,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Love to see that.

861
02:28:41,549 --> 02:28:41,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

862
02:28:44,251 --> 02:28:44,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Burnley?

863
02:28:45,752 --> 02:28:46,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm up.

864
02:28:46,212 --> 02:28:46,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for this.

865
02:28:47,013 --> 02:28:49,575
[SPEAKER_10]: This is very interesting.

866
02:28:50,555 --> 02:28:51,176
[SPEAKER_10]: One question.

867
02:28:51,816 --> 02:28:52,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at the numbers here.

868
02:28:53,538 --> 02:28:55,899
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like my glasses broke as I walked in.

869
02:28:55,979 --> 02:28:56,800
[SPEAKER_10]: So forgive me.

870
02:28:57,833 --> 02:29:02,639
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks like our numbers have doubled from our 350 back in 2015 and 16 to 631 as of March 1st.

871
02:29:02,699 --> 02:29:05,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm curious how our staff has risen with that.

872
02:29:14,625 --> 02:29:27,794
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have been increasing staff throughout the years, and that is something, especially the elementary strand of newcomers at the McGlynn, which is where the biggest numbers are.

873
02:29:28,374 --> 02:29:42,644
[SPEAKER_09]: The way the program is structured is it's sustainable to continue to add new students, but that's why I brought up the first grade class, because I know that's not sustainable, because they can't have two first grade newcomer classrooms with 25 students in them each.

874
02:29:45,365 --> 02:29:59,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've been in some of those classrooms at the Brooks, and it is amazing to me, the teachers that teach these classes, not that they're not using their words, but it is such a diverse group.

875
02:30:00,171 --> 02:30:08,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I remember Allie, and I can't even think of her last name right now, but her saying to me that, you know, 10 languages in her class,

876
02:30:10,305 --> 02:30:11,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember saying, how do you do this?

877
02:30:12,026 --> 02:30:17,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're speaking English in the kindergarten downstairs and I feel like half the kids aren't listening.

878
02:30:17,911 --> 02:30:19,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like they're not hearing us.

879
02:30:19,352 --> 02:30:20,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So how are you doing this?

880
02:30:20,312 --> 02:30:27,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just amazed me how creative they are so that everybody is getting the same curriculum at the same time.

881
02:30:28,218 --> 02:30:29,119
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is astounding.

882
02:30:29,139 --> 02:30:30,800
[SPEAKER_10]: So huge shout out to them.

883
02:30:31,161 --> 02:30:38,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my other question, I want to thank Mr. Fallon for buying 15 of these little things.

884
02:30:38,547 --> 02:30:39,948
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a rock star too.

885
02:30:40,509 --> 02:30:47,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on one of these pages here, you have the schools.

886
02:30:49,837 --> 02:30:50,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see the Andrews.

887
02:30:51,358 --> 02:30:52,559
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just curious.

888
02:30:54,563 --> 02:31:03,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the programs are housed at the McGlynn Middle School, but how does that change their enrollment all year long?

889
02:31:03,376 --> 02:31:04,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it must be constantly changing.

890
02:31:06,044 --> 02:31:16,249
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, but what happens is with any other new students who are non-Yale that go to the Andrews or that come into middle school, if they don't need Yale programming, they go to the Andrews.

891
02:31:16,389 --> 02:31:23,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So the numbers are actually, and I'd have to look up what the exact numbers are, but the numbers between the two buildings are similar.

892
02:31:23,232 --> 02:31:23,713
[SPEAKER_09]: It's equitable.

893
02:31:23,733 --> 02:31:23,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

894
02:31:23,953 --> 02:31:24,893
[SPEAKER_10]: That was just my question.

895
02:31:24,913 --> 02:31:30,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I'm figuring if all of these kids are influxing to just the McGlynn, how are we balancing that off?

896
02:31:30,156 --> 02:31:30,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause it seems.

897
02:31:31,872 --> 02:31:35,554
[SPEAKER_10]: like that would happen a lot more than someone that would move in still, right?

898
02:31:35,694 --> 02:31:39,816
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could just get those numbers, I would love to see that if that's possible.

899
02:31:40,597 --> 02:31:41,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

900
02:31:42,478 --> 02:31:42,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

901
02:31:43,527 --> 02:31:44,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

902
02:31:44,908 --> 02:32:00,461
[SPEAKER_09]: And the last thing that I want to say on the last slide is that none of this work could happen without the EL teachers, because every committee I mentioned, every DELAC, there are people that I have EL teachers who work on all of those programs that I just described.

903
02:32:00,881 --> 02:32:07,967
[SPEAKER_09]: The Tech Goes Home, the summer programs, none of this work could happen without those teachers.

904
02:32:08,027 --> 02:32:09,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to them.

905
02:32:10,489 --> 02:32:10,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

906
02:32:11,169 --> 02:32:12,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you to you and our EL teachers.

907
02:32:14,090 --> 02:32:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any presentations to the public or continued business, but we have a number of items and a new business.

908
02:32:20,254 --> 02:32:25,357
[SPEAKER_07]: First up, 2024-11 offered by member Rousseau, member Grimm, member Olapade.

909
02:32:26,157 --> 02:32:31,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Resolution in support of Massachusetts Association of School Committees resolutions reaffirmation.

910
02:32:32,401 --> 02:32:42,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the Massachusetts Association of School Committees bylaws article nine, section one requires adopted resolutions of the association to expire three years after adoption,

911
02:32:44,329 --> 02:32:57,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the MCAS, MASC bylaws article nine, section one requires Medford School Committee to vote for the readoption of expiring resolutions for consideration at the annual conference.

912
02:32:58,192 --> 02:33:09,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And whereas the following resolutions of matters that Medford School Committee has previously supported, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee reaffirms support for the following resolutions.

913
02:33:10,935 --> 02:33:12,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Access to menstrual supplies 2019,

914
02:33:14,201 --> 02:33:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: mandatory recess in public schools, 2021, prohibiting the use of Native American mascots, 2021, climate change, 2019, poverty and children, 2019, charter school reform, 2019.

915
02:33:26,551 --> 02:33:42,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, request the secretary of the Medford School Committee convene, oh, sorry, convey to the MASC resolutions committee chair our support for the above resolutions being reaffirmed, and request the secretary of the Medford School Committee engage

916
02:33:42,844 --> 02:33:52,742
[SPEAKER_07]: with the MASC resolutions committee and other mass school committees as necessary to reaffirm the above resolutions presented to the bylaws of the MASC.

917
02:33:53,343 --> 02:33:53,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

918
02:33:54,465 --> 02:33:54,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

919
02:33:54,925 --> 02:34:10,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So last year, our professional association adopted a new bylaw because each year the resolutions committee would put forward and school committees could put forward resolutions for MASC.

920
02:34:11,231 --> 02:34:19,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Then these would become the things that MASC would be pushing for with the legislature, their advocacy work would be centered around these resolutions.

921
02:34:22,082 --> 02:34:26,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Before last year, those resolutions just kept getting added.

922
02:34:26,266 --> 02:34:31,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So their docket of things for which they should be paying attention to was quite long.

923
02:34:32,971 --> 02:34:38,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was no mechanism, even if they succeeded, frankly, for them to stop pushing for it.

924
02:34:39,196 --> 02:34:47,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So last year, they adopted, we adopted, the association adopted a new bylaw that says that every three years,

925
02:34:48,382 --> 02:34:50,684
[SPEAKER_08]: any resolution just automatically will expire.

926
02:34:51,144 --> 02:35:00,391
[SPEAKER_08]: That if a member school committee wishes to reaffirm that as a priority for our association, we had to vote for it.

927
02:35:00,791 --> 02:35:05,155
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if three, I believe it's three, don't hold me to that.

928
02:35:05,555 --> 02:35:12,400
[SPEAKER_08]: If three different school committees reaffirm that the resolution should be continued as a priority,

929
02:35:13,018 --> 02:35:20,400
[SPEAKER_08]: then it will just automatically be continued to the actual conference in November, where it will be voted on.

930
02:35:22,221 --> 02:35:23,941
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the gist of it.

931
02:35:24,041 --> 02:35:30,723
[SPEAKER_08]: The list of expiring resolutions included many more that I think we all, many of us care about.

932
02:35:31,843 --> 02:35:34,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them were partially already approved.

933
02:35:35,512 --> 02:35:37,194
[SPEAKER_08]: had been partially successful.

934
02:35:37,774 --> 02:35:46,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Others were, well, these are the ones that after I looked at the list I thought were important, and I also took a kind of a pragmatic view.

935
02:35:47,124 --> 02:35:51,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them were things for which I didn't necessarily think the Association

936
02:35:52,577 --> 02:35:54,718
[SPEAKER_08]: could effectively advocate for.

937
02:35:56,199 --> 02:35:58,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was just my opinion.

938
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:05,704
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is the list of the ones that I thought we should reaffirm, and hopefully we can get the association to continue that.

939
02:36:06,504 --> 02:36:07,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

940
02:36:08,365 --> 02:36:12,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion approved by Member Graham, seconded by Member Olapade.

941
02:36:13,568 --> 02:36:14,288
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

942
02:36:14,308 --> 02:36:14,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

943
02:36:15,268 --> 02:36:16,049
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

944
02:36:16,849 --> 02:36:17,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

945
02:36:17,610 --> 02:36:17,630
[SPEAKER_07]: 2024-12.

946
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:32,162
[SPEAKER_07]: submitted by member Rousseau, policy BBBA slash BBBB, school committee member qualifications, oath of office will be updated with the following language.

947
02:36:32,962 --> 02:36:41,703
[SPEAKER_07]: To serve in the school committee, an individual must be registered voter in the city or town from which they elected or appointed and must take an oath of office as required by law.

948
02:36:42,323 --> 02:36:50,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Each new member will present to the committee secretary official certification of having sworn the oath before the city clerk

949
02:36:51,223 --> 02:36:53,684
[SPEAKER_07]: before entering on their official duties as a member of the committee.

950
02:36:54,464 --> 02:37:07,407
[SPEAKER_07]: From the superintendent, newly qualified committee members by law will receive and sign a receipt of a copy of Massachusetts Open Meeting Law governing the conduct of committee meetings in general and in executive sessions in particular.

951
02:37:08,267 --> 02:37:18,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Newly qualified committee members shall, by law, receive and sign a receipt for, within 30 days of taking office, a copy of the Massachusetts Ethics Commission Summary of the Conflict of Interest Laws.

952
02:37:19,611 --> 02:37:24,876
[SPEAKER_07]: As Massachusetts employees, all school committee members shall receive a copy of said summary annually.

953
02:37:25,476 --> 02:37:33,203
[SPEAKER_07]: All school committee members shall, within 30 days of taking office, and every two years thereafter, complete the Massachusetts Ethics Commission's online training program.

954
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:41,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Upon completing the online training program, members shall provide notice of such completion to be retained for six years by the superintendent.

955
02:37:42,992 --> 02:37:44,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau and then Member Reinfeld.

956
02:37:45,267 --> 02:37:45,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

957
02:37:46,667 --> 02:37:55,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was funny that I keep my own system for keeping track of resolutions that I want to put forward, and it's got a long list.

958
02:37:56,491 --> 02:38:00,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And I try to prioritize them because there's only so much work that can actually get done at a time.

959
02:38:00,932 --> 02:38:07,535
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was cleaning up my list, and I found that I had this one sitting in there from several years ago, which I thought was very timely since we just had a new member.

960
02:38:08,295 --> 02:38:13,296
[SPEAKER_08]: This is language that is almost verbatim what everybody else has in other districts.

961
02:38:15,498 --> 02:38:17,990
[SPEAKER_08]: with the exception that there's a lot of like.

962
02:38:22,564 --> 02:38:25,706
[SPEAKER_08]: to be generic for all the various types of communities we have.

963
02:38:25,766 --> 02:38:39,775
[SPEAKER_08]: So I. Cleaned it up because in most of these in the language that was originally provided that I found it was it said the city clerk would do things that are superintendent does, and I wasn't really looking to change anything.

964
02:38:39,915 --> 02:38:42,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just looking to get the language to reflect what

965
02:38:49,275 --> 02:38:52,599
[SPEAKER_08]: outdated and missing some of the stuff that changed in the law.

966
02:38:55,301 --> 02:38:56,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

967
02:38:56,222 --> 02:38:57,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld?

968
02:38:57,083 --> 02:38:58,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I had two questions.

969
02:39:00,046 --> 02:39:05,752
[SPEAKER_04]: One, and I know this was in the old policy as well, what if the Secretary is a new member?

970
02:39:05,772 --> 02:39:12,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, I mean, a new member can't, and the Secretary's elected

971
02:39:13,103 --> 02:39:15,345
[SPEAKER_04]: during that first meeting, at which point the duties have started.

972
02:39:15,385 --> 02:39:22,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a little confused about the logistics, but I know this has stood as is for quite a while, so I don't know what to do about that.

973
02:39:23,591 --> 02:39:34,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my second question is, there was a phrase removed about non-discrimination, that there's membership on a school committee is not limited to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.

974
02:39:36,442 --> 02:39:37,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

975
02:39:37,403 --> 02:39:38,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take the first one first.

976
02:39:39,024 --> 02:39:41,306
[SPEAKER_08]: So, wait, what was the first one?

977
02:39:42,706 --> 02:39:45,469
[SPEAKER_08]: How can a new member if Oh, yes.

978
02:39:46,150 --> 02:39:46,811
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great question.

979
02:39:47,011 --> 02:39:49,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we were all new.

980
02:39:50,876 --> 02:39:58,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Traditionally, and again it's just a tradition that the leadership of committees are typically not new members just because there's an awful lot to learn.

981
02:39:59,702 --> 02:40:06,146
[SPEAKER_08]: but it is entirely possible, especially in Medford where everybody is up at the same time, that we could be an entirely new committee.

982
02:40:06,166 --> 02:40:09,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's not considered in the language here.

983
02:40:10,868 --> 02:40:19,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we would vote for a secretary and then that person, good luck, but would have to then know all this stuff as well.

984
02:40:20,674 --> 02:40:25,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know that we can get into that because if that happens,

985
02:40:25,857 --> 02:40:28,539
[SPEAKER_08]: it's going to be very challenging for the committee anyways.

986
02:40:30,481 --> 02:40:37,606
[SPEAKER_08]: The other question though, so we have been trying to clean up our policies and not have policies contain other policies.

987
02:40:37,626 --> 02:40:39,527
[SPEAKER_04]: This is covered by the non-discrimination.

988
02:40:39,627 --> 02:40:49,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, we have a non-discrimination policy and by inserting the language all over the place, every time we change it, we effectively need to update dozens or more policies, which we never do.

989
02:40:49,574 --> 02:40:50,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So then there's like

990
02:40:50,775 --> 02:40:53,417
[SPEAKER_08]: language is outdated and wrong all over the place.

991
02:40:53,897 --> 02:40:59,400
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is not an attempt to suggest that a school committee member would not be following that.

992
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:10,385
[SPEAKER_08]: On the other hand, it's also important to note that elections are elections, and that if a school committee member wants to violate all of our policies and wants to violate the law, there's literally nothing that can be done about it.

993
02:41:10,485 --> 02:41:13,147
[SPEAKER_08]: So having meaningless language

994
02:41:14,287 --> 02:41:16,468
[SPEAKER_08]: is something I'm opposed to because less is more.

995
02:41:17,028 --> 02:41:21,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think having language that is enforceable is important.

996
02:41:22,449 --> 02:41:23,210
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you.

997
02:41:23,630 --> 02:41:23,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

998
02:41:25,090 --> 02:41:26,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to waive the first reading.

999
02:41:29,211 --> 02:41:31,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Bern Topper had his hand up first.

1000
02:41:31,252 --> 02:41:32,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, my apologies.

1001
02:41:32,312 --> 02:41:34,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1002
02:41:34,353 --> 02:41:38,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I share a similar concern with Premier Reinfeld about section two.

1003
02:41:38,874 --> 02:41:42,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Each new member will present to the committee secretary official certification.

1004
02:41:42,175 --> 02:41:42,195
[SPEAKER_13]: I

1005
02:41:43,604 --> 02:41:45,746
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure where else it's done.

1006
02:41:46,947 --> 02:41:59,616
[SPEAKER_13]: But to me, I feel like this as someone who just went through the process of policy not existing and policy being vacant and a week of anxiety around what happens next.

1007
02:42:01,438 --> 02:42:04,900
[SPEAKER_13]: This, I, it almost, it,

1008
02:42:06,519 --> 02:42:09,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to say it feels unnecessary, because I appreciate the work that's been done.

1009
02:42:09,802 --> 02:42:14,227
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't see what the committee secretary has to do with the process.

1010
02:42:14,407 --> 02:42:16,689
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, that could just be my naiveness of this.

1011
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:18,631
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm two weeks into this.

1012
02:42:20,173 --> 02:42:26,259
[SPEAKER_13]: But to me, I feel like striking almost this from the policy, I don't see it's

1013
02:42:30,592 --> 02:42:31,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you said, less is more.

1014
02:42:31,853 --> 02:42:37,258
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, again, if we have a total rehaul of our school committee, which could happen, what does this do?

1015
02:42:37,738 --> 02:42:39,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And what happens then?

1016
02:42:40,420 --> 02:42:52,250
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would almost move to have, like the rest of the policy, very understandable, makes sense, especially the Massachusetts Ethics Commission summary of the common interest law, making sure we're up to date on that information.

1017
02:42:52,290 --> 02:42:56,874
[SPEAKER_13]: However, section two, to me, feels almost like it could be striking out of this policy.

1018
02:43:02,819 --> 02:43:06,622
[SPEAKER_08]: The current policy already actually says that this is supposed to come to the secretary.

1019
02:43:07,442 --> 02:43:09,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that's language directly out of the law.

1020
02:43:10,884 --> 02:43:21,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want this, it doesn't make sense to me that it would come to the secretary, like the keeper of our records by law is me, but by practice is the superintendent.

1021
02:43:22,352 --> 02:43:30,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's the case in virtually every school committee there is, because the secretary is not a nine to five full-time job.

1022
02:43:31,198 --> 02:43:32,279
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think,

1023
02:43:33,550 --> 02:43:46,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if there's anything in the statute about should we be delegating authority to the superintendent or not, but that's, that's the way it, I mean, this is current language, and

1024
02:43:49,141 --> 02:43:50,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make sense to me.

1025
02:43:50,141 --> 02:43:53,882
[SPEAKER_08]: And if nobody ever comes and gives this to me, I'm perfectly fine with that.

1026
02:43:54,702 --> 02:43:55,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody has ever done it.

1027
02:43:55,882 --> 02:43:57,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not aware.

1028
02:43:58,283 --> 02:44:00,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wouldn't know what to do with it if you gave it to me.

1029
02:44:01,123 --> 02:44:12,486
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the superintendent has her office acts as the keeper of records, even though like I take the votes and that's because of the secretary's role.

1030
02:44:12,686 --> 02:44:14,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So I certainly understand that it's,

1031
02:44:15,700 --> 02:44:16,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just weird.

1032
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:29,604
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the other thing, though, is that in Massachusetts, while school committees, for the most part, there's different sizes, but they're still fairly the same kind of idea.

1033
02:44:30,244 --> 02:44:31,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Districts are not.

1034
02:44:31,024 --> 02:44:38,246
[SPEAKER_08]: There's regional school districts, and they're very different kinds of districts.

1035
02:44:38,946 --> 02:44:42,288
[SPEAKER_08]: some regional districts are literally municipalities like a city.

1036
02:44:42,948 --> 02:44:45,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, we're not in this municipality as a school district.

1037
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:49,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there's some other weirdness.

1038
02:44:49,452 --> 02:44:53,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think whenever they write these laws, they want to make universal.

1039
02:44:54,254 --> 02:44:58,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Things get frankly, muddy is an understatement.

1040
02:44:58,377 --> 02:45:01,598
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hear your point, but it's current.

1041
02:45:01,939 --> 02:45:08,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So on that point, if I may, just from the chair, and then I'm going to member Graham, if it's not law,

1042
02:45:08,869 --> 02:45:17,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we could change it, shall present to the city clerk to get sworn in by oath before entering their official duties.

1043
02:45:17,717 --> 02:45:19,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it makes more sense.

1044
02:45:19,319 --> 02:45:28,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say, because I believe that is the protocol we had to follow, was we had to present the certification of election, or in my case, appointment to the city clerk.

1045
02:45:29,568 --> 02:45:33,252
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the language to say the oath is with the clerk.

1046
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:36,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham.

1047
02:45:37,462 --> 02:45:44,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to offer like a really tactical example of why somebody on the committee knowing what's going on is really important.

1048
02:45:44,331 --> 02:45:48,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I chaired the meeting two weeks ago, or whatever that was,

1049
02:45:49,130 --> 02:46:05,575
[SPEAKER_02]: the entire committee was completely unclear whether we had an absent member, whether we only had six members, whether we had a new member who wasn't yet sworn in and like nobody here until like the very last moments of the meeting was clear about what that was.

1050
02:46:05,635 --> 02:46:08,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So we recorded a member as absent, which was not true, it turned out.

1051
02:46:10,036 --> 02:46:17,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this language makes sense because there is a role for this in our group, but also once we,

1052
02:46:18,208 --> 02:46:26,355
[SPEAKER_02]: adopt it, we should send it to the clerk so that he understands his responsibility to the committee when he swears a member into office.

1053
02:46:26,555 --> 02:46:29,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So he would still swear people in.

1054
02:46:29,558 --> 02:46:34,342
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to know what's happening here so that we can conduct business accordingly.

1055
02:46:34,442 --> 02:46:38,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a motion on the floor to waive the first reading.

1056
02:46:38,705 --> 02:46:41,728
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no motions to amend.

1057
02:46:41,848 --> 02:46:43,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to waive the first reading by member

1058
02:46:44,653 --> 02:46:47,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

1059
02:46:47,455 --> 02:46:48,416
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1060
02:46:48,436 --> 02:46:49,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1061
02:46:49,377 --> 02:46:50,057
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1062
02:46:50,097 --> 02:46:50,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1063
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:58,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve the updated policy as outlined.

1064
02:46:59,285 --> 02:47:04,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve policy as outlined by Member Graham, seconded by Member Olapade.

1065
02:47:04,949 --> 02:47:05,690
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1066
02:47:05,710 --> 02:47:06,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1067
02:47:06,611 --> 02:47:07,231
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1068
02:47:07,251 --> 02:47:08,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1069
02:47:09,593 --> 02:47:13,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like we all need to get our certifications to Member Ruseau.

1070
02:47:17,689 --> 02:47:21,011
[SPEAKER_07]: 2024-13 submitted by Member Reinfeld.

1071
02:47:21,171 --> 02:47:45,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the public has a right to view meetings during and after their occurrence, and whereas both Medford Public Schools and Medford Community Media currently provide online access to meetings, if you result, the school committee meetings page on the Medford Public Schools website will include a link to archived recordings of Medford Public School Committee meetings, and that individual recording links, when available, will be posted along with past meeting minutes

1072
02:47:46,067 --> 02:47:49,088
[SPEAKER_07]: whose posted is described by policy BEDG.

1073
02:47:49,789 --> 02:48:15,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Be further resolved that meeting notifications described by policy BEDA will include information about non-participatory real-time viewing options via local access television, Comcast Channel 8, Verizon Channel 45, and streaming services, e.g., Medford Community Media, Video On Demand, Medford Public Schools, YouTube, along with individual Zoom access links.

1074
02:48:15,879 --> 02:48:22,045
[SPEAKER_07]: This resolution is offered with the goal of making Medford School Committee meetings more accessible to members of the Medford community.

1075
02:48:22,751 --> 02:48:26,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, Reinfeld, I'm going to give it to you to maybe explain the lower level.

1076
02:48:27,116 --> 02:48:33,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of this used to exist, and then when we moved to Zoom, that became the only online access that was announced in meetings.

1077
02:48:34,023 --> 02:48:40,189
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just to say when people go to look at the minutes, they should be able to get to the videos quite easily.

1078
02:48:40,289 --> 02:48:44,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize that it can be difficult to post the individual video links.

1079
02:48:44,874 --> 02:48:45,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I did talk to

1080
02:48:47,608 --> 02:48:49,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom about whether or not this would be possible.

1081
02:48:49,850 --> 02:48:50,831
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it would be fine.

1082
02:48:51,291 --> 02:48:57,096
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the absence of that, I would be completely fine with just the link to find previous recordings here.

1083
02:48:57,896 --> 02:49:02,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It was suggested that there might be some policy changes required on this.

1084
02:49:03,020 --> 02:49:10,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I went and I looked at the policies, and they really just describe what's in the minutes and what's in the announcements about time and place.

1085
02:49:10,426 --> 02:49:10,767
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't

1086
02:49:12,242 --> 02:49:16,323
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be, doesn't seem to be needing an amendment on the videos.

1087
02:49:16,423 --> 02:49:20,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that language if we need to add them, but it kind of changes the name of the resolution.

1088
02:49:20,624 --> 02:49:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm happy for questions.

1089
02:49:22,205 --> 02:49:24,745
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just about making these things available to the public.

1090
02:49:25,645 --> 02:49:26,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, do you have a question?

1091
02:49:27,166 --> 02:49:27,346
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1092
02:49:28,386 --> 02:49:28,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1093
02:49:30,247 --> 02:49:31,127
[SPEAKER_07]: You have your light on, sorry.

1094
02:49:31,167 --> 02:49:33,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, that's how I've been trying to see.

1095
02:49:33,647 --> 02:49:34,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve?

1096
02:49:34,688 --> 02:49:35,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve.

1097
02:49:35,488 --> 02:49:39,789
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could ask a question, or Tom, if you don't mind coming up because

1098
02:49:40,885 --> 02:49:53,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to better understand each meeting, Director of Communications Dalton will have to go and get the link for Medford Community Media and then put it on the minutes.

1099
02:49:53,519 --> 02:49:54,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're asking for?

1100
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:55,942
[SPEAKER_04]: To post, yes.

1101
02:49:56,382 --> 02:49:58,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the agenda and then we have...

1102
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:01,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have the minutes are posted.

1103
02:50:02,022 --> 02:50:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the minutes are approved, the minutes go up and it would be easy enough to just add that Zoom link or so I'm told.

1104
02:50:08,707 --> 02:50:11,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be perfectly happy with just a here's where to go and find it.

1105
02:50:11,949 --> 02:50:26,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was gonna say, so it's, would that, how time consuming is that compared to just making sure that people have full access to Medford Community Media where they know they can just type in the date and then the meeting recording comes up?

1106
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you, Mayor, and thanks to the committee.

1107
02:50:31,043 --> 02:50:32,404
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely doable either way.

1108
02:50:33,244 --> 02:50:35,766
[SPEAKER_12]: I could defer to the preference of the committee.

1109
02:50:35,826 --> 02:50:38,948
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean, when we get it up and running, I can even show you the difference.

1110
02:50:39,008 --> 02:50:47,674
[SPEAKER_12]: But the bottom line, basically, is that not only Medford Community Media, but also the Medford Public Schools YouTube page is a repository for all the meetings.

1111
02:50:48,735 --> 02:50:52,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the zoom meetings get pushed straight to stream on YouTube as well.

1112
02:50:53,719 --> 02:51:06,489
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'd be really, really simple just at the top of the web page that we list all of the meeting minutes on the past meeting minutes to just have a link to Medford community media link to the YouTube page, you know, here are two options for.

1113
02:51:06,869 --> 02:51:08,770
[SPEAKER_12]: accessing the video recordings of past meetings.

1114
02:51:09,010 --> 02:51:21,595
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we found there was a strong preference for whatever reason, we could also list the individual links to each video next to the minutes at the same time that we upload the approved minutes for each meeting.

1115
02:51:22,475 --> 02:51:27,057
[SPEAKER_12]: That said, I think that just having a link to the YouTube channel probably does the job.

1116
02:51:27,197 --> 02:51:28,118
[SPEAKER_12]: It's under our control.

1117
02:51:28,158 --> 02:51:29,418
[SPEAKER_12]: We know it's not going anywhere.

1118
02:51:29,878 --> 02:51:31,759
[SPEAKER_12]: It's easy to navigate because it's YouTube.

1119
02:51:32,779 --> 02:51:34,240
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it would be simple enough.

1120
02:51:34,827 --> 02:51:38,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I only ask because it would be your time.

1121
02:51:39,009 --> 02:51:53,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you if we do approve this policy, you're going to you might have people like really check in daily to make sure you are getting those links up and you're going to you will get emails, you'll get emails and say the March 18 meeting isn't up yet.

1122
02:51:53,455 --> 02:51:53,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is it?

1123
02:51:54,176 --> 02:51:59,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And it might just be a lot of time where we definitely want you doing our press releases and helping with calm.

1124
02:51:59,478 --> 02:51:59,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So

1125
02:52:00,555 --> 02:52:06,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how the committee feels, but I would be fine with just the links so then people know where to access.

1126
02:52:07,098 --> 02:52:16,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and if I could add also, I mean, I think the other benefit of linking to it is that then we're also not waiting for minutes to get approved because the recording is the recording is the recording, right?

1127
02:52:17,501 --> 02:52:19,522
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't take the committee's approval for that to be.

1128
02:52:19,922 --> 02:52:24,784
[SPEAKER_12]: It's up immediately after the meeting ends and it's always there if you know how to find it.

1129
02:52:24,904 --> 02:52:29,126
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I mean, I would favor just having the YouTube link and we can do it from there.

1130
02:52:30,179 --> 02:52:30,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1131
02:52:30,659 --> 02:52:32,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham, did you have your hand up?

1132
02:52:32,700 --> 02:52:33,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one part.

1133
02:52:33,400 --> 02:52:42,261
[SPEAKER_04]: The other part was about letting people know where they can watch it on cable and through live streams, which, as I said, used to be the case.

1134
02:52:43,182 --> 02:52:52,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And as somebody who would often tune in and listen to these meetings while I'm dealing with dinner or children, it was helpful to have those links with the meeting info.

1135
02:52:54,884 --> 02:52:59,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so do we need an amendment just to make sure, so the first,

1136
02:53:00,404 --> 02:53:07,367
[SPEAKER_07]: First paragraph, is that okay to change it to making sure that YouTube link is up as well as MCM?

1137
02:53:09,608 --> 02:53:16,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I think you can just strike and that individual recording links through the end of that sentence there.

1138
02:53:17,631 --> 02:53:21,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Just archives recordings of Medford Public School Committee meetings.

1139
02:53:24,338 --> 02:53:26,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Edward Minson has a question.

1140
02:53:27,702 --> 02:53:38,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld, so just from a clarification perspective, on the actual agenda you're asking that we place the channels as well, is that what you're saying?

1141
02:53:38,856 --> 02:53:39,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

1142
02:53:39,878 --> 02:53:40,939
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this

1143
02:53:42,833 --> 02:53:59,801
[SPEAKER_01]: box the table that we have on this first page, where we have the Zoom link, if we add one more bar that says TV access channel, Comcast, Verizon, that would be sufficient if we add an additional row?

1144
02:54:00,302 --> 02:54:00,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1145
02:54:00,882 --> 02:54:01,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

1146
02:54:02,603 --> 02:54:02,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1147
02:54:03,742 --> 02:54:07,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to add on that front in terms of listing the specific channel.

1148
02:54:08,467 --> 02:54:15,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We did do that, like even as recently as when I started with the district last year, we were still listing the channels.

1149
02:54:15,453 --> 02:54:22,059
[SPEAKER_12]: At some point, the channels changed and we couldn't quickly find which channels they were updated to.

1150
02:54:22,079 --> 02:54:26,182
[SPEAKER_12]: We were getting mixed reports about which channels local access was available on.

1151
02:54:26,202 --> 02:54:29,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these are the education channels and there's a separate local access.

1152
02:54:29,105 --> 02:54:30,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And is it not consistent?

1153
02:54:30,586 --> 02:54:31,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it is consistent.

1154
02:54:32,007 --> 02:54:42,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I think at the time we were getting ready to post a meeting agenda and we said, you know what, let's just say it's available on Medford Community Media and not list a channel number until we confirm.

1155
02:54:42,756 --> 02:54:48,861
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a helpful reminder that we can in fact track down that channel number and make sure that we include it.

1156
02:54:49,962 --> 02:54:58,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to be a pain, but if I may from the chair again, if there are multiple meetings in a night and we have a subcommittee meeting, if the council's here,

1157
02:54:58,919 --> 02:55:01,881
[SPEAKER_07]: we have a subcommittee meeting, the channels do all change.

1158
02:55:03,362 --> 02:55:05,724
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just gonna be extra work.

1159
02:55:05,844 --> 02:55:11,329
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so the live stream to Zoom, though you're saying that our Zooms do get pushed to YouTube.

1160
02:55:12,029 --> 02:55:12,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, that's right.

1161
02:55:13,770 --> 02:55:18,374
[SPEAKER_12]: This meeting is streaming on YouTube right now in addition to Medford Community Media.

1162
02:55:19,295 --> 02:55:20,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And that link's the same, right?

1163
02:55:21,156 --> 02:55:23,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, it's always the same channel.

1164
02:55:23,318 --> 02:55:26,180
[SPEAKER_07]: We can put the YouTube link on the agenda.

1165
02:55:27,423 --> 02:55:28,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1166
02:55:28,323 --> 02:55:29,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1167
02:55:29,804 --> 02:55:32,386
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford community media that was often not up for several days.

1168
02:55:32,746 --> 02:55:39,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, I feel like we should send a mailer I know it costs too much but

1169
02:55:39,824 --> 02:55:40,645
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube is amazing.

1170
02:55:40,665 --> 02:55:42,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally you can watch us right now.

1171
02:55:42,166 --> 02:55:49,231
[SPEAKER_08]: You can press pause, go to the bathroom and come back and hit resume as if this meeting was literally pausing for you live right now.

1172
02:55:49,852 --> 02:55:50,752
[SPEAKER_08]: What did Paul just say?

1173
02:55:50,772 --> 02:55:52,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Scroll back a little bit.

1174
02:55:52,214 --> 02:55:52,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

1175
02:55:53,955 --> 02:55:59,139
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, if you have access to Medford Community Media, you're on the internet.

1176
02:55:59,179 --> 02:56:00,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have YouTube.

1177
02:56:00,660 --> 02:56:06,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So not that I don't love Medford Community Media, but I can't imagine why anybody would use it when YouTube exists because

1178
02:56:07,285 --> 02:56:09,027
[SPEAKER_08]: you can scroll around in the meeting.

1179
02:56:09,047 --> 02:56:16,873
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot do that on Medford Community Media unless you download the five gigabyte file to your local device, which is what I used to do before we had YouTube.

1180
02:56:17,534 --> 02:56:22,178
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're using Medford Community Media, now's your time to know, go to YouTube.

1181
02:56:23,319 --> 02:56:26,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a fan of just having the link.

1182
02:56:26,802 --> 02:56:34,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I also did wanna say that we have a policy that if we want to, our agenda format is actually in a policy.

1183
02:56:35,089 --> 02:56:36,850
[SPEAKER_08]: to amend B. E. D. B, which I think you mentioned.

1184
02:56:37,751 --> 02:56:37,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Um.

1185
02:56:39,032 --> 02:56:39,472
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you don't.

1186
02:56:39,612 --> 02:56:44,996
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we want to change the format of the agenda, we actually need to amend B. E. D. B. Which we can do it.

1187
02:56:45,056 --> 02:56:45,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Another meeting.

1188
02:56:46,777 --> 02:56:48,038
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's fine.

1189
02:56:48,138 --> 02:56:52,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was looking at that as the minutes and the notification, but Sure.

1190
02:56:54,542 --> 02:56:55,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Um we're

1191
02:56:59,699 --> 02:57:03,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just gonna say, does a motion to amend need to be put on the floor?

1192
02:57:03,382 --> 02:57:06,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I can do that right now, is what I'm asking.

1193
02:57:06,465 --> 02:57:15,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Member Reinfeld put the amendment on to change the first paragraph to YouTube and MCM links and to strike and that individual recording links.

1194
02:57:16,794 --> 02:57:27,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we'll just need a motion to amend if that's how Member Reinfeld wants to proceed with the YouTube link on the agenda versus the channel numbers.

1195
02:57:29,625 --> 02:57:31,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a strong preference on this.

1196
02:57:33,989 --> 02:57:45,738
[SPEAKER_04]: My sense is that the people who aren't watching it online want the channel numbers, but... I would, not to be difficult, but I would make a motion to amend to

1197
02:57:46,678 --> 02:57:58,023
[SPEAKER_13]: have the channel links, but to have the community media link, the YouTube link, as well as the channel numbers, because again, it helps if you're trying to watch that on the TV.

1198
02:57:58,183 --> 02:58:00,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say channel numbers and YouTube.

1199
02:58:01,284 --> 02:58:02,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Channel numbers and YouTube, correct, yes.

1200
02:58:03,625 --> 02:58:08,887
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be my motion to amend, would be to strike that and include channel numbers and YouTube link.

1201
02:58:14,063 --> 02:58:16,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, not to make it too busy on the agenda on the agenda.

1202
02:58:16,626 --> 02:58:24,974
[SPEAKER_11]: But for those just getting the paper agenda, we put the QR code on now so they can go directly into the zoom, I can swap that cue, we can swap that QR code.

1203
02:58:25,114 --> 02:58:27,937
[SPEAKER_11]: So it goes directly into the YouTube instead, however you want to do it.

1204
02:58:28,858 --> 02:58:30,599
[SPEAKER_11]: But however you want.

1205
02:58:32,761 --> 02:58:34,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll also say that I think the

1206
02:58:37,168 --> 02:58:40,209
[SPEAKER_12]: resolution is completely practicable as written.

1207
02:58:41,310 --> 02:58:48,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Just from my perspective as probably the primary staffer to carry it out, I think it's totally doable the way it's written.

1208
02:58:48,753 --> 02:58:51,974
[SPEAKER_12]: So amend, don't amend, but I can manage it.

1209
02:58:52,774 --> 02:58:59,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I will also say that these meetings, sorry, the notice is posted to the website where we have agreed to put that link.

1210
02:59:00,017 --> 02:59:03,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So that link exists where meeting notification exists.

1211
02:59:03,318 --> 02:59:05,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't need that link on the agenda.

1212
02:59:06,311 --> 02:59:08,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the channels make sense on the agenda.

1213
02:59:08,912 --> 02:59:11,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so no YouTube link, just the channel numbers.

1214
02:59:11,473 --> 02:59:12,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

1215
02:59:12,834 --> 02:59:17,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think that we have to also consider if we put the wrong information, whether the meeting can proceed.

1216
02:59:18,276 --> 02:59:22,938
[SPEAKER_08]: If we say we're meeting here and we decide to meet elsewhere, we are not having a legal meeting.

1217
02:59:23,478 --> 02:59:30,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we put channels and they're not gonna be right, I think it's reasonable to ask whether or not the meeting should proceed.

1218
02:59:31,081 --> 02:59:34,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So can we get these channels and always have them right?

1219
02:59:34,702 --> 02:59:42,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's not fair to tell people this is how you can watch this meeting live, and then they go there and they can't.

1220
02:59:42,705 --> 02:59:52,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, there are alternatives, but just like if the power goes out here and we decide we want to go to the high school, no, that's not an option.

1221
02:59:53,368 --> 02:59:55,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my only concern about the channels.

1222
02:59:56,029 --> 02:59:59,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I think more information is great, but it has got to be accurate all the time.

1223
03:00:00,539 --> 03:00:07,826
[SPEAKER_08]: or we have taken the public's ability to participate in a meeting in public.

1224
03:00:08,386 --> 03:00:09,827
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my concern.

1225
03:00:10,088 --> 03:00:10,248
Yeah.

1226
03:00:13,110 --> 03:00:13,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Dapa.

1227
03:00:14,652 --> 03:00:17,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Then, yeah, with that, that information makes complete sense.

1228
03:00:17,775 --> 03:00:22,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I would move to make a motion to amend and just have the YouTube link on the

1229
03:00:23,576 --> 03:00:25,798
[SPEAKER_13]: agenda circling back thousands of times.

1230
03:00:25,899 --> 03:00:37,591
[SPEAKER_13]: But if the if we can't rely on the channels being consistent, even if they're next to each other, we do open ourselves up to that liability of, again, false advertising, where the it's being broadcasted.

1231
03:00:37,631 --> 03:00:46,320
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was thinking from a standpoint of people who may not have smart TVs, maybe using, you know, the educational platform, but then again, we don't want to run into that issue.

1232
03:00:46,789 --> 03:00:48,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we're back to a different amendment.

1233
03:00:48,370 --> 03:00:53,333
[SPEAKER_07]: So YouTube and ACM, paragraph one, YouTube link, paragraph two.

1234
03:00:53,413 --> 03:00:57,115
[SPEAKER_07]: If everybody feels that is, let's take a vote for that.

1235
03:00:57,515 --> 03:01:02,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion for approval by Member Intoppa as amended, seconded by?

1236
03:01:02,338 --> 03:01:05,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I can second.

1237
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:06,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Branley.

1238
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:07,701
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1239
03:01:08,441 --> 03:01:08,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1240
03:01:09,102 --> 03:01:09,862
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1241
03:01:09,902 --> 03:01:10,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1242
03:01:10,702 --> 03:01:15,065
[SPEAKER_07]: 2024-14 submitted by Member Ruseau, Member Graham, and Member Olapade.

1243
03:01:15,854 --> 03:01:34,417
[SPEAKER_07]: resolution in support of a stabilization fund for the city of Medford, whereas the use of free cash only possible for a few months each year from one fee free cash is certified by the state through June 30 when the fiscal year ends, whereas the public schools may experience unexpected expenses, not planned for in the budget cycle such as a major

1244
03:01:34,847 --> 03:02:00,739
[SPEAKER_07]: equipment failure, floods, fires, roofs, et cetera, whereas Medford Public Schools cannot borrow money to cover such expenses, whereas at present, the only mechanism for Medford Public Schools to receive additional funding to cover unexpected expenses is by a supplemental appropriation submitted by the mayor to the city council for approval, whereas the inability to use free cash for much of the year places the Medford Public Schools and the city of Medford in a precarious position

1245
03:02:01,277 --> 03:02:06,641
[SPEAKER_07]: should a supplemental appropriation be required to ensure educational continuity for our students.

1246
03:02:07,661 --> 03:02:26,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas a stabilization fund provides a mechanism for the allocation and spending of money throughout the year, and whereas the use of a stabilization fund for resources requires a mayoral request to the city council for approval, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee thanks the Medford City Council for approving the creation of a stabilization fund.

1247
03:02:26,883 --> 03:02:42,131
[SPEAKER_07]: urges the Medford City Council, when a request to add funds to the stabilization fund is received, to approve the request before the expiration of free cash, and requests the superintendent of schools sends this resolution in a record of the vote of the school committee to the Medford City Council.

1248
03:02:42,652 --> 03:02:43,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

1249
03:02:44,292 --> 03:02:45,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor.

1250
03:02:45,693 --> 03:02:53,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I should also thank you, since you wrote the paper that went to City Council, and as soon as you're reading it, I'm like, oh my gosh, sorry.

1251
03:02:53,177 --> 03:02:54,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

1252
03:02:54,478 --> 03:02:55,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I did watch this,

1253
03:02:57,230 --> 03:03:00,571
[SPEAKER_08]: this part of the city council meeting, was it last week, the week before?

1254
03:03:00,751 --> 03:03:01,411
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all a blur.

1255
03:03:02,011 --> 03:03:14,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that, you know, the stabilization fund is not like a, free cash is the worst, the most poorly named concept I think that ever existed, especially as a taxpayer.

1256
03:03:14,693 --> 03:03:17,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like everybody should think free cash, that's my cash.

1257
03:03:18,374 --> 03:03:23,655
[SPEAKER_08]: But conceptually, it just means it's the money that the city has that didn't get spent from the previous year.

1258
03:03:23,675 --> 03:03:23,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And,

1259
03:03:26,201 --> 03:03:32,388
[SPEAKER_08]: not having access to that money for almost the whole year is kind of bonkers.

1260
03:03:32,408 --> 03:03:34,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I can't find a better word.

1261
03:03:35,150 --> 03:03:44,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, while the city has money, something horrible can happen, and we literally can just look at the money and just like, wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the money on

1262
03:03:44,949 --> 03:03:46,450
[SPEAKER_08]: the urgent problem.

1263
03:03:47,471 --> 03:03:53,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that having a stabilization fund, which did get approved, but I believe at this moment there are $0 in it.

1264
03:03:54,215 --> 03:04:09,666
[SPEAKER_08]: So when free cash gets certified by the state, I obviously urge that the mayor, as I'm sure she will want to, will ask the city council to transfer some of that money from the free cash account into the stabilization fund and give her

1265
03:04:10,866 --> 03:04:15,549
[SPEAKER_08]: give her give the city council and give the school committee the ability to respond to emergencies.

1266
03:04:16,109 --> 03:04:25,975
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in Somerville they had a roof partially collapsed and they closed the school over a weekend, and they had to spend a ton of money I'm sure to figure out what to do with all those students.

1267
03:04:26,495 --> 03:04:27,516
[SPEAKER_08]: That was not planned for.

1268
03:04:28,056 --> 03:04:35,239
[SPEAKER_08]: that happens here, it better happen between the middle of March and June 30th, or we don't have the money to do that.

1269
03:04:35,720 --> 03:04:44,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this is a critical thing, and it's a constant risk that we just sit with when it doesn't need to be.

1270
03:04:44,344 --> 03:04:47,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for your efforts, Mayor, and thank you to the City Council.

1271
03:04:47,905 --> 03:04:48,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Member Graham.

1272
03:04:49,619 --> 03:04:49,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1273
03:04:52,021 --> 03:05:04,434
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to emergencies, this is the kind of fund that we will need to rely on to demonstrate to MSBA that we have set aside adequate money for feasibility study, which we will need to do to get out of the eligibility phase.

1274
03:05:04,514 --> 03:05:06,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am completely for it.

1275
03:05:07,237 --> 03:05:11,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is part of stabilizing our budgeting process, which we've all been working on.

1276
03:05:13,111 --> 03:05:28,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do hope that council will approve any requests that you send them to put money into the stabilization fund, both for the unexpected and also eventually for the feasibility study for MSBA's process.

1277
03:05:28,317 --> 03:05:28,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1278
03:05:29,317 --> 03:05:31,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for putting the resolution on.

1279
03:05:31,758 --> 03:05:38,701
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, from the chair, I proposed a $5 million stabilization account the spring of 2023.

1280
03:05:38,741 --> 03:05:39,381
[SPEAKER_07]: That did fail at the time.

1281
03:05:42,469 --> 03:05:52,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanna thank the current city council for approving, opening up the account so that we can hopefully next month add at least 5 million into that account.

1282
03:05:52,792 --> 03:06:10,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as you wrote in the resolution, come July 1 until free cash is certified again, which has been mid to late March of the last year, and it will be this year, there is no money available except what's in our budgets to pay for emergencies.

1283
03:06:11,596 --> 03:06:29,186
[SPEAKER_07]: or any any type of outside funding outside of the budget that we happen to need that free cash gets closed down and you cannot spend it so we have a situation where we need money for, like you mentioned a roof, or an emergency or even, we need a million dollars to get an OPM to do a new high school.

1284
03:06:29,466 --> 03:06:35,209
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the account we would have to take it from because there will be no other account so that this is extremely important.

1285
03:06:35,529 --> 03:06:38,711
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been able to get by because we have that nine more months of ARPA.

1286
03:06:40,117 --> 03:06:48,082
[SPEAKER_07]: this is important passing because once December 30th comes until free cash certifies in 2025, there will be no funding.

1287
03:06:48,223 --> 03:06:54,027
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the year after that, July 1, 2025 until March 2026, there will be no outside funding.

1288
03:06:54,087 --> 03:06:57,989
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of unheard of that city, our size does not have one.

1289
03:06:58,369 --> 03:07:00,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Some cities and towns have multiple.

1290
03:07:00,771 --> 03:07:01,852
[SPEAKER_07]: This is long overdue.

1291
03:07:01,872 --> 03:07:09,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a huge accomplishment for the school committee, city council, and our office to get this set up and

1292
03:07:09,639 --> 03:07:11,879
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to be able to get us prepared for emergencies to come.

1293
03:07:12,220 --> 03:07:15,940
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for the support, and I see this move approval.

1294
03:07:17,361 --> 03:07:18,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember finally.

1295
03:07:19,981 --> 03:07:22,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry So I was also in attendance.

1296
03:07:22,902 --> 03:07:29,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I was here actually during all of this the other night at the City Council, and it didn't seem like the voters were very happy about that.

1297
03:07:30,223 --> 03:07:31,464
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like there was a lot of uproar

1298
03:07:38,547 --> 03:07:41,349
[SPEAKER_10]: How are we going to manage this, this fund?

1299
03:07:41,850 --> 03:07:45,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know it says here emergencies, but then we also said the stability.

1300
03:07:45,752 --> 03:07:47,433
[SPEAKER_10]: So can we use that for anything?

1301
03:07:49,195 --> 03:07:54,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a stabilization account, but it would need to come from the mayor's office.

1302
03:07:54,318 --> 03:07:58,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be a recommendation by the school committee if it was school spending.

1303
03:07:58,501 --> 03:08:02,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it would have to be every dollar that's spent out of the stabilization account.

1304
03:08:03,524 --> 03:08:07,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a 99.9% sure would have to be approved by the city council.

1305
03:08:09,462 --> 03:08:09,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1306
03:08:12,703 --> 03:08:15,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was a maybe a lot of emotions in that room.

1307
03:08:15,184 --> 03:08:24,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I think once you're clear on what a stabilization account which is a spending, putting, taking money from free cash and putting it into an account.

1308
03:08:24,746 --> 03:08:29,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Some cities and towns have multiple stabilization accounts.

1309
03:08:29,188 --> 03:08:33,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So, capital improvement, stabilization account, stabilization account for emergencies.

1310
03:08:33,929 --> 03:08:37,670
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just our first of at least have something

1311
03:08:38,214 --> 03:08:45,879
[SPEAKER_07]: on the books to be able to spend in case we do have an emergency or some sort of spending we need without that free cash being available.

1312
03:08:46,999 --> 03:08:49,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is citywide, not designated for schools.

1313
03:08:50,522 --> 03:08:51,742
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not designated for schools.

1314
03:08:51,762 --> 03:09:01,068
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a city stabilization account, but of course could be spent on a roof that collapses, you know, that needs major repair that we don't have 300-400,000 to fix.

1315
03:09:01,128 --> 03:09:01,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Second?

1316
03:09:06,533 --> 03:09:09,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion approval by Member Ruseau, I believe it was.

1317
03:09:09,195 --> 03:09:10,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Member Graham.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1340
03:09:41,770 --> 03:09:44,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Five in the affirmative, one no, one abstained.

1341
03:09:47,431 --> 03:09:50,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion is approved.

1342
03:09:50,572 --> 03:09:55,473
[SPEAKER_07]: 2024-15, submitted by Member Ruseau, Member Graham, and Member Olaparte.

1343
03:09:56,333 --> 03:10:02,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the resolution on the disciplinary practice of suspension was unanimously adopted by the Medford School Committee on October 14th, 2020,

1344
03:10:04,158 --> 03:10:30,528
[SPEAKER_07]: whereas the language of the resolution on the disciplinary practice of suspension provides that the following actions will be taken by the Medford public schools, ends the use of out of school suspensions effective the first day of the school year 2021 except as provided by law, provides for the continuation of a learning environment for every in-school suspension, ensures that in-school suspensions will not occur in isolation without instruction or rehabilitative counseling,

1345
03:10:31,297 --> 03:10:36,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Selects alternative tools for use in discipline, such as restorative justice wherever possible.

1346
03:10:36,240 --> 03:10:55,111
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll complete a comprehensive program review of disciplinary practices across the district, including but not limited to system-wide disciplinary measures, reporting to the school committee, social and emotional supports for victims, as well as establishing a staff feedback process to be presented to the school committee in May 2021.

1347
03:10:56,980 --> 03:11:15,511
[SPEAKER_07]: seeks to incorporate any funding requirements to ensure the implementation of the selected alternatives with fidelity in the next budget cycle and establishes an annual reporting process that includes, but is not limited to system-wide disciplinary measures, reporting to the school committee, as well as establishing staff feedback process.

1348
03:11:16,331 --> 03:11:24,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas it appears that there are occurrences of noncompliance with the policy happening in the district and the occurrences have been observed since the effective date of the policy,

1349
03:11:25,691 --> 03:11:50,548
[SPEAKER_07]: and whereas the annual reporting requirements of the resolutions have not occurred, now therefore be it resolved that the superintendent will, number one, provide a description of the onboarding process that ensures district staff, including teachers, vice principals, principals, and our prides of the policy, two, provide a report of training available to all staff, including staff participation and training offered disaggregated by building,

1350
03:11:51,152 --> 03:11:59,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Three, provide a detailed report of disciplinary actions taken from the start of the 2023-2024 school year through March 1st, 2024.

1351
03:11:59,797 --> 03:12:06,802
[SPEAKER_07]: The report provided should be a model to comply with the annual reporting requirement going forward and will contain the following minimum data.

1352
03:12:07,502 --> 03:12:09,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Types of incidents, determinations, and discipline.

1353
03:12:10,244 --> 03:12:12,686
[SPEAKER_07]: The above data elements summarized for the district.

1354
03:12:13,106 --> 03:12:17,889
[SPEAKER_07]: The above data elements disaggregated by school, by grade level, and by school and grade level.

1355
03:12:18,885 --> 03:12:23,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Four, provide a description of how central administration determines compliance with the policy.

1356
03:12:23,668 --> 03:12:32,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Five, provide a report of the number of times the above policy has not been followed by building leadership and what actions are being taken to remedy these instances of noncompliance.

1357
03:12:33,613 --> 03:12:44,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Six, conduct a review of all suspensions from the start of the 2023-2024 school year through March 1st, 2024, and provide an assessment of how many suspensions were inappropriate

1358
03:12:45,097 --> 03:12:49,123
[SPEAKER_07]: and provide information requested above at the April 8th school committee meeting.

1359
03:12:51,167 --> 03:12:52,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

1360
03:12:53,290 --> 03:12:54,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor.

1361
03:12:54,292 --> 03:12:59,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually think it's self-explanatory, so I don't need to keep us here till midnight on it.

1362
03:13:00,622 --> 03:13:15,834
[SPEAKER_02]: approval by member Rousseau second member Graham yeah I just wanted to add that in addition to this the resolution which has been repeated here the district also issued guidance in

1363
03:13:18,696 --> 03:13:32,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that outlined a specific set of occurrences for which the district had identified that a suspension was both appropriate and in compliance with this policy.

1364
03:13:32,767 --> 03:13:42,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're bringing this forward because we are continuing to hear about instances outside of that set of parameters that is both compliant with the policy.

1365
03:13:44,849 --> 03:13:49,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And compliant with the like set of reasons outlined by the administration.

1366
03:13:50,776 --> 03:13:56,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just have a lot of concerns that a this policy was never properly implemented in the first place.

1367
03:13:57,203 --> 03:14:03,531
[SPEAKER_02]: The things that were described in terms of funding and the things that needed to happen from a

1368
03:14:05,503 --> 03:14:16,571
[SPEAKER_02]: from a funding and implementation perspective, none of those things were brought to us and we have to, I think we, I think we're just veering way far away from the intent of the policy.

1369
03:14:16,591 --> 03:14:23,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is symptomatic of bad implementation and we have to think about how we can recover from that.

1370
03:14:23,156 --> 03:14:25,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to make sure that

1371
03:14:26,986 --> 03:14:30,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be clear and I think there are some people who want to speak tonight about this.

1372
03:14:31,689 --> 03:14:41,876
[SPEAKER_02]: From their perspective, but I want to make sure that we are we are really evaluating whether the things that are happening in our buildings are appropriate and consistent with this policy.

1373
03:14:42,852 --> 03:14:52,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was always our intention to hear from the administration on on multiple occasions about how the implementation was going and I don't think we've really done that at all.

1374
03:14:52,438 --> 03:14:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I think we need to start to change the dynamic here around this policy.

1375
03:14:57,441 --> 03:15:04,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can make sure that a we're funding the supports needed appropriately that came up very specifically in 2021

1376
03:15:05,865 --> 03:15:26,362
[SPEAKER_02]: when it became clear that there was no staff or mechanism for an in school suspension which is an alternative to suspending kids out of school, which I think is very viable and used by a lot of districts but we just have never properly like resourced or funded such a thing so it's fine if we don't need that because we don't have reasons for it but

1377
03:15:27,051 --> 03:15:48,552
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're hearing about students being suspended for things that are outside of our policy, like I think that's definitely a signal that we need to go back to the drawing board on this implementation and make sure that everyone in the district understands the policy and the guidance provided and that we can start to adhere to those things or something can come forward to us for consideration and we can make a change.

1378
03:15:50,646 --> 03:15:51,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Intoppa?

1379
03:15:52,087 --> 03:15:53,328
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can, I'd like to waive my time.

1380
03:15:53,348 --> 03:15:55,670
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe a member of the public would like to speak.

1381
03:15:55,771 --> 03:16:02,676
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I can waive out of order and then circle back, because I don't know if I have some questions about impact.

1382
03:16:02,696 --> 03:16:10,663
[SPEAKER_13]: So if the member of the public has any answers about that, I can reassess my questions, I believe.

1383
03:16:10,703 --> 03:16:11,564
[SPEAKER_13]: So I waive my time.

1384
03:16:12,305 --> 03:16:13,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record.

1385
03:16:13,245 --> 03:16:15,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so my name is Mary Davis.

1386
03:16:15,687 --> 03:16:17,369
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to press the button, sorry.

1387
03:16:18,353 --> 03:16:18,673
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

1388
03:16:18,953 --> 03:16:19,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1389
03:16:19,373 --> 03:16:19,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1390
03:16:19,774 --> 03:16:20,654
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mary Davis.

1391
03:16:20,734 --> 03:16:25,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two children at the high school and one that graduated in 2022.

1392
03:16:26,336 --> 03:16:33,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to share a deeply unfair incident that occurred with our family in terms of the long-term suspension at the high school.

1393
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:40,883
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to say that none of my children have been involved in any disciplinary actions in the past, so we are not repeat offenders.

1394
03:16:41,543 --> 03:16:47,446
[SPEAKER_00]: But this January, my daughter was heckled and bullied by a large group of girls that ultimately ended in a fight.

1395
03:16:48,446 --> 03:16:50,667
[SPEAKER_00]: There were eight of them and there was one of her.

1396
03:16:51,047 --> 03:16:53,529
[SPEAKER_00]: She was surrounded and closed off in one of the bathrooms.

1397
03:16:53,649 --> 03:16:56,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to her, she threw the first punch out of fear.

1398
03:16:57,691 --> 03:17:01,713
[SPEAKER_00]: After that first punch, a number of the girls actively assaulted my daughter and filmed it.

1399
03:17:02,834 --> 03:17:07,696
[SPEAKER_00]: When I picked my daughter up that day, the school acknowledged that the fight started out of bullying of my daughter.

1400
03:17:08,516 --> 03:17:13,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And this statement was reiterated by the assistant principal later in a police report filed by the school.

1401
03:17:14,399 --> 03:17:16,761
[SPEAKER_00]: But the school ultimately lumped all the girls together

1402
03:17:17,681 --> 03:17:21,342
[SPEAKER_00]: that engaged in the physical altercation into a criminal assault charge.

1403
03:17:22,303 --> 03:17:28,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my daughter received a long-term suspension pending the outcome of the criminal charge that the school submitted.

1404
03:17:29,305 --> 03:17:36,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the administrators acknowledged to me that her actions related to the criminal charge were clearly an act of self-defense and that was on video.

1405
03:17:37,588 --> 03:17:39,929
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a videotaped act of self-defense.

1406
03:17:40,489 --> 03:17:45,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Most concerning to me was the fact that the school refused to share any information related to the incident

1407
03:17:46,531 --> 03:17:51,814
[SPEAKER_00]: and the disciplinary action that I needed to understand and refute the charges at that long term suspension hearing.

1408
03:17:52,514 --> 03:18:01,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I hired an attorney to draw the school's attention to their own policy and legal violations, at which point my daughter's long term suspension was reduced to five days.

1409
03:18:02,363 --> 03:18:05,725
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, she had already spent two and a half weeks out of school.

1410
03:18:06,346 --> 03:18:10,569
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter has very high needs and was on an IEP with a high level of services.

1411
03:18:11,109 --> 03:18:18,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So during that time when she was suspended indefinitely, they also effectively eliminated her IEP services along with it.

1412
03:18:19,075 --> 03:18:22,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is still struggling to make up the lost time from school.

1413
03:18:22,697 --> 03:18:27,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So although I do agree that suspensions have a place in some extreme circumstances,

1414
03:18:28,561 --> 03:18:35,845
[SPEAKER_00]: as it relates to safety, my concern is that the current school practice is totally out of line with legal expectation and due process.

1415
03:18:36,465 --> 03:18:42,928
[SPEAKER_00]: They can suspend a kid indefinitely without providing any evidence, at least in my case, of why a kid's a danger to the school.

1416
03:18:43,248 --> 03:18:52,692
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take away their access to education and health services without providing evidence to the family on what happened and why taking away their kid's education is a fair punishment.

1417
03:18:52,772 --> 03:18:53,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I support

1418
03:18:54,329 --> 03:18:57,431
[SPEAKER_00]: the school committee doing a further deep dive into school practices.

1419
03:18:57,512 --> 03:19:05,398
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also add that I would really like, I didn't see this in the motion, but paying particular attention to the effect on kids with IEPs.

1420
03:19:06,378 --> 03:19:08,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that they're being suspended at a higher rate.

1421
03:19:11,022 --> 03:19:12,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for presenting.

1422
03:19:12,944 --> 03:19:15,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Intoppa and then Member Branley.

1423
03:19:15,386 --> 03:19:19,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, first off, I just want to thank you for coming forward and sharing your story.

1424
03:19:19,949 --> 03:19:20,910
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not easy.

1425
03:19:21,130 --> 03:19:23,452
[SPEAKER_13]: And I apologize that that happened.

1426
03:19:25,179 --> 03:19:40,728
[SPEAKER_13]: My question surrounded the effectiveness of what we're proposing, but it almost sounds like we need to take a reassessment of what we look at in terms of the disciplinary practice of suspension looking at the cases.

1427
03:19:42,478 --> 03:19:53,506
[SPEAKER_13]: and also just to do the work looking at the claim of who's being affected higher in terms of suspension rates, as you had mentioned with IEP students.

1428
03:19:56,128 --> 03:20:06,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So my questions have greatly shifted, but I'm wondering where we have to look at, reassess the language and to see what fits in best practice.

1429
03:20:10,077 --> 03:20:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Branley?

1430
03:20:11,761 --> 03:20:15,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So, this obviously hits very close to home for me I know that we spoke.

1431
03:20:17,537 --> 03:20:24,261
[SPEAKER_10]: privately over email, but I just want to thank you for being brave enough to come up here, because I know personally how hard that is.

1432
03:20:25,061 --> 03:20:26,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I promised myself that I would never cry at a school community meeting.

1433
03:20:27,043 --> 03:20:28,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to start now.

1434
03:20:28,523 --> 03:20:31,205
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still too early in my term, but there's still time.

1435
03:20:32,126 --> 03:20:32,726
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you.

1436
03:20:33,186 --> 03:20:36,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much for sharing your story with us, because I know what that feels like.

1437
03:20:37,028 --> 03:20:38,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how all of this feels.

1438
03:20:38,569 --> 03:20:45,674
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that when I did return my email to you, that I said it actually took me courage to even respond to you.

1439
03:20:47,034 --> 03:20:52,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for standing there and know that this could be the result of you standing there one time.

1440
03:20:53,655 --> 03:20:55,476
[SPEAKER_10]: You just never know where the road is going to lead you.

1441
03:20:55,936 --> 03:20:56,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So always speak up.

1442
03:20:57,116 --> 03:21:08,158
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say that to anybody that's out there in the public, like you never know where the road will lead you or sometimes, you know, what you think or what is your some of your darkest days turns into something completely different.

1443
03:21:08,178 --> 03:21:11,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for being brave enough to come here and tell your story.

1444
03:21:13,359 --> 03:21:14,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a motion on the floor.

1445
03:21:15,219 --> 03:21:15,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

1446
03:21:16,161 --> 03:21:19,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to make a motion to approve, but I have an amendment.

1447
03:21:21,747 --> 03:21:26,592
[SPEAKER_08]: So my motion is, since I wrote it, I can motion to approve as amended if you agree with that.

1448
03:21:29,167 --> 03:21:36,609
[SPEAKER_08]: The bullet under three, the third bullet says the above data elements disaggregated by school, by grade level, and by school and grade level.

1449
03:21:36,669 --> 03:21:41,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish to add comma, and by DESE category, reporting categories.

1450
03:21:43,271 --> 03:21:50,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to list them here, but DESE has a set of reporting categories, which includes students with disabilities and a host of others.

1451
03:21:51,413 --> 03:21:52,953
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my amendment.

1452
03:21:53,893 --> 03:21:56,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, motion for approval as amended by Member Ruseau.

1453
03:21:57,464 --> 03:22:00,105
[SPEAKER_02]: member Graham, can I offer another?

1454
03:22:02,246 --> 03:22:02,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things there.

1455
03:22:02,887 --> 03:22:04,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody on zoom who would like to speak?

1456
03:22:05,007 --> 03:22:07,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there might be somebody with a hand in the air.

1457
03:22:07,669 --> 03:22:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see anybody, OK?

1458
03:22:11,150 --> 03:22:17,233
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I would also like to make an amendment to item.

1459
03:22:18,794 --> 03:22:23,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three that maybe it's its own sub bullets.

1460
03:22:24,178 --> 03:22:37,441
[SPEAKER_02]: that describes the number of instances where Medford Public Schools has filed a police report in a related incident to a suspension.

1461
03:22:37,461 --> 03:22:49,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I am super concerned about students with records and charges against them.

1462
03:22:49,583 --> 03:22:51,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna make sure that we're doing

1463
03:22:52,969 --> 03:23:02,855
[SPEAKER_02]: our due diligence to keep the community safe, but that we are not ruining the lives of children in our care who make bad decisions at times.

1464
03:23:02,916 --> 03:23:05,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely a needle to thread there.

1465
03:23:05,357 --> 03:23:09,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to see us explore an understanding of that.

1466
03:23:09,740 --> 03:23:14,763
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, in item number three, is that member member is that the number of

1467
03:23:15,273 --> 03:23:17,914
[SPEAKER_04]: incidents with the police report or the number of police reports?

1468
03:23:17,934 --> 03:23:25,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my understanding is there are sometimes multiple police reports filed around a single incident or is an incident defined as one student?

1469
03:23:26,956 --> 03:23:33,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say per student, but I don't know how that data is collected.

1470
03:23:33,697 --> 03:23:38,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have like a strong opinion about how we know about the reporting of it.

1471
03:23:38,839 --> 03:23:40,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that we are discussing that.
