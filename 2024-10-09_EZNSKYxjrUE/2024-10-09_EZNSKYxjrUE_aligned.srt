1
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:33,297
This is the Medford City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

2
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:36,738
October 8th, 2024, 6 p.m.

3
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,780
This meeting is called to order.

4
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,982
And Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

5
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:44,642
Absolute.

6
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:45,783
Councilor Kelly.

7
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:46,403
Present.

8
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:47,864
Vice President Collins.

9
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:48,604
Present.

10
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:50,185
Council Member.

11
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:51,305
Present.

12
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:53,566
Councilor Sands.

13
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:54,567
Present.

14
00:05:56,904 --> 00:05:58,765
Present, five present, none absent.

15
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,025
This meeting is called to order.

16
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,906
The meeting is today.

17
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:08,047
We are discussing two items, which we've discussed at a previous meeting as well.

18
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:24,632
24-036 offered by Vice President Kit Collins, resolution to discuss an overgrowth ordinance, as well as 24-461, also offered by Vice President Collins, resolution to meet and discuss updates to the rodent control ordinance.

19
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,285
These are two items that are joined together because they affect each other.

20
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:39,633
And today we will be talking about the, well, I'll let Vice President Collins discuss.

21
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:44,398
We're going to go over the language that's been shared with us.

22
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,820
Vice President Collins.

23
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:55,953
Thank you so much trailers are I apologize for holding up the start of this meeting I was running late and then my computer took 10 minutes to join the Wi-Fi, my apologies.

24
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,639
I'm joining the Zoom now, so I'll be able to screen share.

25
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:27,596
But just to recap, so the Overgrowth Ordinance was a proposal from, I believe, the previous term that was discussed with the Director of the Board of Health, as well as the Code Enforcement Officers from the Building Department, to deal with issues of accessibility on our public ways, such as sidewalk, and just to make sure that accessibility is maintained even when

26
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:34,040
yards and vegetation originating on private property is perhaps a little less closely tended to.

27
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:46,608
In a lot of cases that's totally fine, but in cases where it becomes a harborage for pests or insects or rodents or it grows so large that it affects people's ability to walk on the sidewalk, that's a problem and the city does need a mechanism to

28
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,010
step in in that case.

29
00:07:50,871 --> 00:08:04,266
And similarly, in how it affects the pest issue specifically, we were also requested to take another look at the rodent control ordinance by the Director of the Board of Health and some of the collaborators in City Administration.

30
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:18,653
As has been a topic of many many conversations in the city council over the past few years than a city staff are diligently working on every week of the year, you know the rodent population in Medford as a neighboring communities is a really big issue.

31
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:23,895
And as we see more development both from private developers and from public projects such as the MBTA.

32
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,036
displacing rodent populations.

33
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:38,767
We're getting more and more complaints, and I know that the Board of Health and the Health Department has been actively seeking to, you know, not just continue what they're already doing, but to be able to do more by way of prevention and mitigation.

34
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:51,418
And obviously, controlling the rodent pest population in Medford is something that, if we have something that's working over here and something that's not working over here, then the problem isn't really getting better, because

35
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:55,824
Rats can change leases a lot more easily than people can.

36
00:08:58,749 --> 00:08:59,410
I've heard it said.

37
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:15,319
So at our first meeting on this topic, we discussed these two issues broadly with the board of health director and reviewed some preliminary ideas from mainly the board of health director, as well as code enforcement officers.

38
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:24,086
And we motioned out to see an initial draft of the overgrowth ordinance, which I had the clerk circulate yesterday and have shared with city staff.

39
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:30,311
And we also motioned to have some first drafts

40
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,592
updates made to the rodent control ordinance.

41
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:38,254
So committee members have both of those documents before them this evening.

42
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:50,617
I have some feedback from city staff on these documents, and I know that Director O'Connor is also on the line as well.

43
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:54,778
So I thought that tonight we could, in not too much time, we could

44
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:59,275
I know that councilors have reviewed these documents already, most likely.

45
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:05,259
I thought that we could quickly go over these drafts, flag any initial comments or questions that councilors do have.

46
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,284
Note any comments that Director O'Connor has for how to take these forward.

47
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:22,152
I know that the building commissioner is also going to weigh in and then report out some planned updates or amendments to take these

48
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:27,183
further into our third meeting onto this topic based on the feedback that we heard tonight.

49
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:47,252
And then hopefully the next time we meet on this, we can have a pretty close to finalized document on both counts, having undergone a legal review as well that we can report out expeditiously, hopefully, if it is the will of this committee, and just put these new mechanisms on the books so that our city staff can implement them.

50
00:10:49,949 --> 00:11:05,226
So I would be happy to turn it over to Director O'Connor for preliminary comments, and then I can just quickly walk through both documents, unless I'd be happy to turn the floor over to any of my fellow councilors who had questions or comments that they wanted to start out with.

51
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,992
Are there any comments from, oh, Councilor Callahan.

52
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:22,295
I just wasn't sure if I quite understood you properly, but this, I assume, has not yet gone to legal review, like we're finalizing it to make sure that it's what staff needs first, and then we'll send it to legal.

53
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:22,915
Is that correct?

54
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,036
That's correct.

55
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:24,516
Thank you.

56
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:27,158
Great.

57
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:32,402
Any other questions or comments from councilors before I turn it over?

58
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,243
Okay.

59
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:37,406
Director O'Connor, I would love to hear from you.

60
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:41,684
Hi, good evening, everyone.

61
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,791
I want to thank Vice President Collins for acting and moving forward on this.

62
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:56,544
I think the ordinance as presented really does a lot to help us in our efforts, and I really don't

63
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,072
see any additions or changes.

64
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:07,336
I just, I didn't know if DCR needed to be added in there under number three and purpose of intent.

65
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:10,697
I'm not really sure they would, but that was my only thought.

66
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:15,377
And then as far as definitions, I can't see anything else.

67
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:19,859
I don't know why ragweed keeps popping in my head.

68
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,723
I don't know where that fits in here, but that certainly, you know, it becomes a public health issue as far as overgrowth is concerned.

69
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:32,265
So I don't know if that means to be pointed out.

70
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:32,845
I really don't.

71
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:34,646
It's just throwing it out there.

72
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:40,169
But I really think it works to help us in our efforts and I appreciate it very much.

73
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,331
Excellent, thank you.

74
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:47,354
I do have a small question.

75
00:12:52,358 --> 00:13:01,027
I do appreciate the suggestion of DCR possibly or in some professional capacity.

76
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:06,852
I don't know personally what constitutes standing water, for instance.

77
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,396
Is that a birdbath?

78
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,577
Is that a man-made pond?

79
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:26,943
Do like man-made water feature kind of yard situations require some level of movement of water?

80
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:27,663
I'm not sure.

81
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:31,845
That articulates my kind of lay person.

82
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:33,926
Yeah, that's a great question.

83
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:34,767
No, that's a great question.

84
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,247
So stagnant water is,

85
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:42,044
really a perfect nesting place for mosquitoes.

86
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:46,085
So during the summer, that's something that we always talked to people about.

87
00:13:47,246 --> 00:14:04,812
Some people for some reason will have tires, you know, in their backyards or under their decks or whatever, and they accumulate stagnant water or empty, you know, plant pots or, you know, that they just, if it rains, they let them fill up and

88
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:08,556
That stagnant water is a perfect nesting ground for mosquitoes.

89
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:12,561
So, that's, that's not we're not talking about

90
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,108
you know, pools or anything like that.

91
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:21,230
But certainly bird feeders are stagnant as well.

92
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,932
Well, some of them, some people do have little fountains in them, I suppose.

93
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:29,234
But again, they are perfect nesting grounds for mosquitoes.

94
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:38,139
And as well as bird feeders are obviously a water source for rodents as are any stagnant water on your property.

95
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:39,760
So anything that would accumulate

96
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:43,350
you know, after it rains, and you just let it sit there.

97
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:45,452
That's what we're talking about.

98
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,454
Okay, got it.

99
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:48,934
Thank you.

100
00:14:52,917 --> 00:15:04,665
I guess it probably when we go when we do legal review of this document, though, there'll be like a professional understanding of kind of which

101
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:22,309
maybe, I guess my only thought about this is that like there's a level of expertise that we don't necessarily have as a council on some of this stuff, but that somebody will and we'll be referring it to them.

102
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,389
Am I correct?

103
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:26,369
Yes, director.

104
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:35,971
Actually, that is a good point about maybe including that in the definitions, what standing or stagnant water is as in

105
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:41,605
Yeah, I think that would be advisable.

106
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:42,125
Yeah.

107
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:53,852
If I may, yeah, it sounds like there's, I think there's a good argument for defining standing water as a term, much like we included a definition for bird feeder in the wildlife feeding ordinance.

108
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,613
It's one of those things where if you know what it means, you don't need it.

109
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:59,575
But if you don't, it's good to have it articulated.

110
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:03,297
Yeah, I would agree.

111
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:05,939
So the timeline here is,

112
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:14,484
These documents get reviewed, then it's reviewed by legal once we approve.

113
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:18,666
I'm sorry, could you say that last part again?

114
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:22,348
Once we would approve this, it would get reviewed by legal after the fact.

115
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:24,429
What I would recommend is that

116
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:46,243
I'd like for in this meeting for us to end with a motion to send both the overgrowth ordinance and the updates to the rodent control ordinance, incorporating any amendments or planned amendments that we talk about in this meeting, for those amendments to be incorporated by myself and for them then to be sent to legal review before our next committee meeting on the topics.

117
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:53,229
Then when we see it again, it includes any updates that this committee would like to see, Director O'Connor or Commissioner Vandewall would like to see,

118
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,770
and has undergone legal review with those changes, and then we'll review it again and report it out.

119
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,471
That would be my proposal.

120
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:02,072
Great.

121
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:09,054
I thought that the, I had no feedback besides the standing order question.

122
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:13,535
Is there, Councilor Callahan just stepped out.

123
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:18,917
Do we have any other thoughts or comments by Councilors?

124
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:22,938
Yes, Vice President

125
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,100
Thank you.

126
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:37,025
And I'll just note, because I know we discussed a lot about the purpose and intentions of this ordinance at our first meeting, but just to quickly revisit because we're not going line by line on this, because frankly, it's pretty straightforward.

127
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:37,865
I don't think that we need to.

128
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:44,368
Just to summarize as briefly as I can, what this document says is essentially

129
00:17:46,474 --> 00:18:05,470
stating what we talked about as the goals being to give the city a mechanism to do enforcement when there is really problematic overgrowth that isn't being addressed on its own, defining the terms as needed, essentially saying overgrowth and harborage conditions that infringe on the public right of way or create nuisance conditions are prohibited.

130
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:13,855
making a clear exception that nothing in this section shall be interpreted as to prohibit gardening, landscaping, etc.

131
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:21,780
And that enforcement is only necessary if it is determined to be the cause of a public's safety threat or nuisance by city officials.

132
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:39,471
It lays out who's enforcing it and penalties, and then it also does stipulate, as Director O'Connor suggested, that any penalty fines that are collected from enforcement of this ordinance will be deposited into the rodent control account to create revenue for doing rodent mitigation citywide.

133
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:52,420
And I know that this draft was promulgated after the agenda for this meeting went out, so I'll make sure that the clerk can attach it to the committee report for this meeting so that the public can view it ahead of our next committee meeting.

134
00:18:53,858 --> 00:19:04,606
So with that, I would be happy to offer a motion to, I think the only thing left to do on this draft is to add in that we want a definition for standing water.

135
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:21,618
And then I will forward this along to legal review and also ask for legal input on some of the questions and highlighted parts in the draft that I sent around to counselors, which is mostly asking for their input on how to define certain terms the right way.

136
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:24,276
I'll second that motion.

137
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:27,937
OK.

138
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:32,838
Do we have any public participation comments?

139
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,939
Seeing none in the audience, anybody on Zoom?

140
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,440
OK.

141
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,561
Seeing none, I on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

142
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:46,261
Yes.

143
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:50,542
Do you have a motion to add a definition for standing water?

144
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:57,343
and then this has been incorporated, docking out early orders.

145
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:57,763
Is that correct?

146
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:59,624
Clerk, can you turn your microphone on, please?

147
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,125
Got it, yeah.

148
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:06,125
Did you hear me, Councilwoman?

149
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,246
You may repeat.

150
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:09,646
It's very quiet.

151
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:10,626
I still can't quite.

152
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:14,267
Just for the audio recording.

153
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,467
I can hear you.

154
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,227
It's just very quiet.

155
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:17,488
I think it's through someone else's mic.

156
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,508
OK.

157
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:41,055
The clerk just clarified that the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming, is to clarify definitions in the ordinances and then pass the ordinances on to legal for review.

158
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:43,276
I can put that.

159
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,798
We had to add a definition for standing water also.

160
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,319
And to add a definition for standing water will be an amendment.

161
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,500
So I'll say clarify definitions also.

162
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,941
Clarify definitions, yes, okay.

163
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:57,920
Okay, and once you have that written out, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

164
00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:02,023
Councilor Kellyanne.

165
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:02,363
Yes.

166
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:04,004
Vice President Collins.

167
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:04,225
Yes.

168
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:05,426
Councilor Lemming.

169
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:05,866
Yes.

170
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:07,828
Councilor Seng.

171
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:08,588
Yes.

172
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:10,590
Chair Lazaro.

173
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,330
Yes.

174
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,912
Five in the affirmative, none in the negative.

175
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,033
The motion passes.

176
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,758
Thank you, Vice President Collins for bringing this forward and for your work on these.

177
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:29,733
It's not very glamorous, but it is very necessary, and it's going to move forward in a way that is timely and useful for our city.

178
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:31,914
So it's much appreciated.

179
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:37,556
Thank you, Director O'Connor as well for your work on this and for bringing it to our attention.

180
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:41,858
Are there any other motions, Vice President Collins?

181
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,660
Yeah, if I may, I'd love to run quickly through the road and control ordinance updates.

182
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,321
Thank you.

183
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:50,482
This one is a little more

184
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:59,290
I think it's equally straightforward, but it's a little more complicated because we're updating an existing ordinance.

185
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:11,543
So I would be happy to just quickly summarize what I've added, or I could also quickly share my screen and just go through it, walk through it for our counselors and the public.

186
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,585
And just, I just wanna,

187
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:31,009
make sure that we run through it very quickly before we... I would also make a motion to incorporate any suggestions from councillors, continue to work with Director O'Connor to further tweak these updates and then submit this for legal review as well.

188
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,190
So I defer to my councillors.

189
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,996
And if we would like to see it on the screen and go through it section by section, again, very quickly, or if a summary would be sufficient.

190
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:43,899
Summary's good for me.

191
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:48,890
Yes, I would favor a summary.

192
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,052
Any other preferences?

193
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:55,314
It seems like a summary is good.

194
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:57,004
Great, can do.

195
00:22:58,465 --> 00:23:03,467
So again, this is along many of the same goals that we have already discussed.

196
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:10,110
And this is just a bit more for counselors to read through because it is updates to the existing ordinance.

197
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:24,496
What I am suggesting here in incorporating some of the new goals that we've heard from Director O'Connor for this ordinance to give the health department more tools to do the enforcement that they need to do.

198
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,104
In adding those, I think that it would be helpful for us to do some light reorganization of the ordinance.

199
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:38,470
So in the draft that I passed around to councilors prior to this meeting, which again, I will have the clerk attached to the committee report.

200
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:43,494
I think that up until now, the ordinance has mostly been about

201
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:48,718
definitions and then permitting requirements for commercial properties.

202
00:23:50,379 --> 00:24:01,808
Things that they have to do to get a permit as it pertains to rodent control, such as creating an integrated pest management plan, what has to be involved in that plan, what to do if they don't follow that plan, etc.

203
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:14,358
A lot of what Director, or not a lot of, but some of the cornerstone of what Director O'Connor and I are trying to do in these updates is to put it all in the same ordinance, what we expect of commercial properties,

204
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:18,700
what we expect of residential properties and what we expect of different types of residential properties.

205
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:35,471
So I'm suggesting that we add in those goals that we discussed the first meeting and then reorganize the ordinance so that it kind of sets our purpose and goals up top, talks about residential properties, and then it talks about commercial properties, including all of those rules around integrated pest management plans and whatnot.

206
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:43,207
So that draft does move around the sections a little bit and I propose that we just finalize the section numbers once everything is actually solidified.

207
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:53,691
I have kind of slotted in everything that Director O'Connor and I have spoken about with goals for the updated ordinance.

208
00:24:54,191 --> 00:25:14,776
There are some specific questions that I have on wording, language sufficiency, making sure that things are phrased in such a way that it'll be seamlessly enforceable for city officials, to make sure that things are phrased in such a way that it will be really easy for residents and property owners to understand what is expected of them.

209
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:27,184
So that's the type of thing that I would just like to get another round of feedback from city staff on and also get feedback during the legal review on to make sure that this language is where it ought to be.

210
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:34,008
This ordinance also,

211
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:58,245
One thing, another specific thing that I'd be looking for input from legal counsel on is one goal of the health department was to have different levels of fines for noncompliance with the rodent control ordinance from residential buildings with less than three units versus residential buildings with more than three units.

212
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:07,067
I thought that there's kind of a fairness factor to having a heavier penalty for failure to do anything about rodent prevention and mitigation be levied upon

213
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:32,217
condo buildings, apartment buildings, buildings that are run more similarly to commercial buildings, as opposed to your single families, your duplexes, your triplexes, owner-occupied buildings, which I think makes a lot of sense, but I want some guidance to make sure that we're just phrasing that the right way since ordinance fines are governed by state law and how we may allocate those fines.

214
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,639
So I'm just calling that as a specific question that we put into legal counsel.

215
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:51,075
Just running through to see if there's anything else major that I want to make sure that counselors are aware of in this draft.

216
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:52,889
And I don't believe that there are.

217
00:26:52,909 --> 00:27:03,199
I think I have several more nitty gritty language questions that I'd like to forward along to legal counsel, which were included in the markup version that was circulated to counselors, and that will be attached to the committee report.

218
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,065
But apart from that, the other major change in this ordinance is that it specifically, you know,

219
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:13,068
It doubles down on the language for designating the rodent control account.

220
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:24,974
And this newly states that integrated pest management permit fees will be deposited into the rodent control account, which is new as of these updates.

221
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:36,840
I think those are the major points that I wanted to flag, the most substantial points that I wanted to flag from the update, but I defer to Director O'Connor if there's anything that we've missed or anything that she'd like to add or underline.

222
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:41,325
Director O'Connor, is there anything you'd like to add?

223
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:43,008
I thank you.

224
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:50,297
Um, no, I appreciate again, appreciate so much Vice President Collins work on this.

225
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:56,364
I have minor tweaks that we can I can put in tomorrow.

226
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:58,307
I think the issue of the

227
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,650
more than three units, you know, needs to be addressed.

228
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:17,373
And, you know, I know, again, going obviously through legal counsel, but the 21D, I think we could do the, you know, one, two, $300, and then daily, I mean, that's an issue too, daily fines after noncompliance.

229
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:21,094
I'd like to have that maybe discussed with legal.

230
00:28:23,774 --> 00:28:26,495
But I know we did talk about potentially for the,

231
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:35,194
the bowel replacement, maybe having that first time be waived.

232
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:43,398
I'm not sure if we got any feedback back from DBW if that's even possible, but that might lessen the burden for some.

233
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:48,401
And I believe that, again,

234
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:54,149
Composting, you know, we're talking about that.

235
00:28:54,189 --> 00:29:00,832
The city has that new curbside composting, which is supposed to really assist with the rodent issue.

236
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:06,715
But if folks are gonna do the private backyard composting, I appreciate the language here.

237
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:13,578
That requires it to be done properly with a locking lid, et cetera.

238
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:18,060
So I think that would be my major.

239
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,521
The only thing,

240
00:29:24,273 --> 00:29:32,518
614 C eradication measures as reasonably required by the Board of Health director.

241
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:35,701
I would exclude the word director and just say the Board of Health.

242
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,302
It's just a minor.

243
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,584
What section was that, Director O'Connor?

244
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:43,166
Section 614, I think.

245
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:43,586
Yeah.

246
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:49,090
We have two C's, we might have two C's.

247
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,556
Under duty to respond to infestation of rodent burrows on the second page.

248
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,842
Paragraph one.

249
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:01,504
Okay, got it.

250
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:02,144
Yes.

251
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:04,507
Thank you.

252
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,111
And then my only other

253
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:10,835
Minor.

254
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:14,138
Input would be under 6-112A.

255
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:35,837
Complaints about rodent activity, I would say, would be directed to the health department as opposed to handled to in case it may be under the purview of code enforcement or the building department.

256
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:45,400
So it would be that complaints about rodent activity would be directed to the health department, and then we would be able to refer to the appropriate department if necessary.

257
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:53,751
But again, thank you very much for your work on this.

258
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:55,293
Truly appreciate it.

259
00:30:57,476 --> 00:30:58,697
Thank you so much, Director O'Connor.

260
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:10,332
And I would just note one thing I neglected to mention that was also sent around to councillors is the fee schedule that describes

261
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:26,312
that the fees attached to integrated pest management, fees for rodent control issues that are attached to street openings are referenced in this ordinance, but those are governed by Appendix A, which is our fee schedule.

262
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:39,362
So there are also proposed updates to that, which I will finalize, run by legal counsel, and attach to the updated version of this ordinance that comes before this committee at our next meeting date on this topic.

263
00:31:43,407 --> 00:32:07,843
So thank you so much for those comments, and I'd be, if there aren't any other comments or questions from councilors, I would make a motion to continue to incorporate feedback from Director O'Connor, run relevant sections of this update by the Commissioner of Public Works, Building Commissioner, run the section on composting by Director Hunt,

264
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:18,718
and then get a legal review of the document, and also get some input from city staff on the updated fee schedule.

265
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:26,060
And then when all of those documents are complete, keep this in committee and meet again after the legal review.

266
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:37,482
The current fee schedule is not, it's kind of a proposed new amount section as you're waiting on legal to help fill that in.

267
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:40,798
Yeah, legal or just professional insight.

268
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:42,399
Yeah.

269
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:49,322
As with the rest of our updating of the fee schedule across various departments, just want to make sure that we're in line with what other communities are doing.

270
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:49,903
Yeah.

271
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,784
Understood.

272
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:54,265
Okay, great.

273
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:57,526
Can you repeat the motion for me?

274
00:32:58,087 --> 00:32:59,127
Oh, you got it.

275
00:32:59,307 --> 00:32:59,727
Yes, please.

276
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,963
This is what I have so that we can edit from there if we need to.

277
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:24,171
Vice President Collins moved to continue to incorporate feedback from Director O'Connor, the Commissioner of Public Works, the Building Commissioner, and Director Hunt, and to seek legal input while keeping this paper in committee until legal review is complete or until all department review is complete, or how do you wanna word that?

278
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:27,553
How about until legal review and all department review is complete?

279
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:32,016
Until legal review and all department review is complete, okay.

280
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:37,337
Okay, do we have a second?

281
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:39,720
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

282
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:45,586
On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

283
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,708
Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

284
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,070
Sure.

285
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,251
Give me a quick second, please.

286
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:50,992
Take your time.

287
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:03,641
Councilor Callahan?

288
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,001
Yes.

289
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:05,542
Vice President Collins?

290
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:05,822
Yes.

291
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:06,883
Councilor Lemming?

292
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:07,483
Yes.

293
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:09,324
Councilor Seng?

294
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:10,705
Yes.

295
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:12,145
Chair Lozaro?

296
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:13,026
Yes.

297
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:16,107
Five in the affirmative, none in the negative.

298
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,528
The motion passes.

299
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:22,210
Thank you again for this important work.

300
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:28,833
I especially appreciate updating this with the new rules about composting and seeing all the compost bins around town.

301
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:37,798
with their beautiful locking lids that everybody should use and love because they're great.

302
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,144
Do we have another item to discuss or another motion perhaps?

303
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:45,985
Motion to adjourn.

304
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,328
Motion to keep the papers in committee and adjourn.

305
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:55,783
Okay, on Vice President Collins' motion seconded by Councilor Leming, let's say that.

306
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,345
Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?
