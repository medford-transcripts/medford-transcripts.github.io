1
00:00:01,177 --> 00:00:04,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping YW Shen and her family close to my heart today.

2
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:15,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, an attacker shouting racist slurs disturbed YW Shen's daily walk in Medford, shoving her to the ground by a busy playground before sprinting off.

3
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,793
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, this is both heartbreaking and personal.

4
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:29,861
[SPEAKER_00]: We have watched hate crimes against Asian Americans soar throughout the country, fueled by the casual racism of elected officials

5
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:33,083
[SPEAKER_00]: and a long history of anti-Asian hate.

6
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:41,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of my friends and I have spent the last year worrying about our own families and friends, and teaching our elders how to protect themselves.

7
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent the day thinking about something Mrs. Shen said.

8
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:51,808
[SPEAKER_00]: People usually jump to help someone if they've fallen down.

9
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:59,470
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as if we are not seen as really belonging to American society, so it feels okay to treat us differently.

10
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,131
[SPEAKER_00]: These words hit close to home.

11
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford is not immune to the epidemic of racism.

12
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:13,234
[SPEAKER_00]: We must work together to join in the centuries-long fight against hate and white supremacy.

13
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:20,316
[SPEAKER_00]: We must listen to and engage with our neighbors, and we must ensure that these stories don't go unheard.

14
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:27,759
[SPEAKER_00]: We must address hate crimes in our own backyard, ensure that there are decent translation services available,

15
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:32,794
[SPEAKER_00]: and create trusted channels for residents that report incidents of hate.

16
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity and inclusivity are not just slogans.

17
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:41,959
[SPEAKER_00]: These values must guide us in everything we do.

18
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Only this way can we truly stop Asian hate and keep our communities safe.

19
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:54,205
[SPEAKER_00]: In Chinese, we have a cheer, jiayou, which means fuel up or let's go.

20
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:55,986
[SPEAKER_00]: To Mrs. Shen,

21
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,174
[SPEAKER_00]: to her family and to Medford.

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Jiayou!
