I'm keeping YW Shen and her family close to my heart today. Last week, an attacker shouting racist slurs disturbed YW Shen's daily walk in Medford, shoving her to the ground by a busy playground before sprinting off. For me, this is both heartbreaking and personal. We have watched hate crimes against Asian Americans soar throughout the country, fueled by the casual racism of elected officials

and a long history of anti-Asian hate. Many of my friends and I have spent the last year worrying about our own families and friends, and teaching our elders how to protect themselves. I've spent the day thinking about something Mrs. Shen said. People usually jump to help someone if they've fallen down. It's as if we are not seen as really belonging to American society, so it feels okay to treat us differently.

These words hit close to home. Medford is not immune to the epidemic of racism. We must work together to join in the centuries-long fight against hate and white supremacy. We must listen to and engage with our neighbors, and we must ensure that these stories don't go unheard. We must address hate crimes in our own backyard, ensure that there are decent translation services available,

and create trusted channels for residents that report incidents of hate. Diversity and inclusivity are not just slogans. These values must guide us in everything we do. Only this way can we truly stop Asian hate and keep our communities safe. In Chinese, we have a cheer, jiayou, which means fuel up or let's go. To Mrs. Shen,

to her family and to Medford. Jiayou!
