1
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:40,773
Test one, two.

2
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:54,044
April 1st.

3
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:59,565
This is a meeting of the Committee on Public Health and Community Safety.

4
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:00,905
Thank you all for being here.

5
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:10,987
We are meeting today to discuss the public or the gender affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance.

6
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,867
Thank you for your patience.

7
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:21,549
We have a draft of the ordinance that has been worked on for quite a while.

8
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,100
Um, the draft was circulated with committee members.

9
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:38,524
Um, this week, and it was also reviewed over the past few weeks with with our legal representation at KP law.

10
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:46,107
And Councilor Sang and I met and discussed with our council and

11
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:52,596
Um, we have a version that is not we can't circulate that where we can't present to the public.

12
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:55,077
Because it's attorney client privilege.

13
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,797
The comments can't be circulated.

14
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,558
So I do have a clean version.

15
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:06,259
But what I what I shared with the council with the committee members is the red line version.

16
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,060
Um, to compare with

17
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:14,461
what we have as the draft of the last version that we reviewed.

18
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:26,051
So what I wanted to say as an introduction before we get into our deliberations is just reviewing the purpose of this ordinance.

19
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:36,812
uh, initially, it was to reaffirm that gender affirming care and reproductive health care is a right in Medford.

20
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,755
That is true at the state level as well.

21
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:47,743
Um, but, uh, everything is very uncertain right now.

22
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:50,546
So it is nice to have something, um,

23
00:18:51,925 --> 00:19:06,918
when you're not sure where things are going, where your community is heading to know that your local lawmakers are sort of shoring up the right to gender affirming care and reproductive health care in all its forms.

24
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,679
in your local laws.

25
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,922
So that's what this ordinance is aiming to do.

26
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:31,892
It is reaffirming access to those healthcare resources, also reaffirming that healthcare providers will not be in trouble for providing those resources, also saying that Medford is a welcoming community in these ways.

27
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:40,460
for people of any gender and anybody trying to access this type of care and provide this type of care.

28
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:54,412
It also goes into a type of business called a limited services pregnancy center, which is a business that can present itself like it's a

29
00:19:56,093 --> 00:20:07,320
something that would provide reproductive health care, but really is misrepresenting itself and doesn't really provide that kind of health care services.

30
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,922
Correcting the record on some of that and also

31
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:17,948
I'm not sure.

32
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:26,878
Oh, and I'm just saying that people who provide health care services won't be penalized for doing so in Medford.

33
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:49,627
So what I was hoping that councilors can do is look at the two versions of this document, decide which of the changes we would like to adopt in our final version, and then hopefully send it to the regular city council meeting so that we can move forward with adopting the ordinance if we'd like.

34
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:52,550
Councilor Singh.

35
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,057
Oh, I have to touch you.

36
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:57,378
Okay, that's seven.

37
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,278
You're seven.

38
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,878
Yes.

39
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:05,719
Thank you.

40
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,940
Thank you for your introduction of what this ordinance is.

41
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:19,623
This is, I believe, maybe the third time that our current form of this committee has worked on it so far.

42
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,503
I know we've met in prior sessions before we had this city council elected.

43
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:36,973
So this is something I'm really excited to get across the finish line, particularly at a time when we see such insecurity.

44
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:47,896
from the federal government with regards to the rights of people to practice what is legally possible in their own jurisdiction.

45
00:21:49,957 --> 00:22:01,520
I mean, needless to say that a lot of what people are doing is constitutionally protected, at least in Massachusetts, it's protected by the state constitution and state law.

46
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:06,382
And yet we still see instances where

47
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:15,714
there is law enforcement coming in and taking people away, locking people up for those activities.

48
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:41,319
When the Dobbs decision rolled around years ago, I think the big question for policymakers at the state and local level was how can we protect our residents, particularly from out-of-state efforts to impose their law on us, and to seek the arrest or the punishment of people who come to Massachusetts

49
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:48,224
for care and to Massachusetts doctors and medical professionals who provide that care as well.

50
00:22:48,845 --> 00:23:03,597
And since that conversation, this effort, which is an effort that a lot of cities have pursued, has grown into an effort to also protect people seeking gender-affirming care and providing gender-affirming care as well.

51
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:20,574
And I think it's a matter of semantics, but this particular version of the ordinance in both forms derives from what a lot of municipalities and what the state government is doing to protect our residents.

52
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:28,958
And the language is pretty much one-to-one besides the references to Medford and making it a little bit Medford specific.

53
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:43,559
And that aspect, I think, is really important, because it's important for us to note that a lot of cities are pursuing trans-sanctuary city legislation, reproductive sanctuary city legislation.

54
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,341
That is this.

55
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:48,203
And this is actually stronger than a lot of those efforts.

56
00:23:48,911 --> 00:24:00,574
Because some of those efforts are ordinances, but rather just resolutions, which means that it's non-binding, has no legal force, that the city wanted to revoke it at any time.

57
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:04,374
The city could do it even without a vote of the city council.

58
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:13,376
And this codifies those protections for a resident so they can know that they are safe from that behavior in Massachusetts.

59
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:43,021
Now, with regards to our meeting with legal representation, the second draft that counselors have, the one with the red line edits, is a draft that aligns the text that we have been reviewing in this committee before to the text of the state law and to a lot of municipalities that are now passing these ordinances and aligning themselves with state law.

60
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:44,362
And now the big benefit of that

61
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,451
is that substantively, there's not much of a change in terms of what we're protecting.

62
00:24:50,851 --> 00:25:03,093
But in the case of litigation, if that, God forbid, ever happens, this gives us more legal protection because we can work with other cities and the state government to protect ourselves in court.

63
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:09,715
And that means less pressure on our city's legal resources as well.

64
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:11,155
Yeah.

65
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,720
I think that there's a huge benefit to that because it's different.

66
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:27,943
It's harder for a single municipality to defend a single text versus when you have a bunch of municipalities, a bunch of lawyers working on this, plus the state government and AG's office working on this to defend the text.

67
00:25:28,524 --> 00:25:38,106
I also want to underscore that this is a very much a legal effort and that this is in the wheelhouse of state and local governments.

68
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,580
There's been some questions raised about that.

69
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:53,203
The 10th Amendment is really clear that there are powers that are given to the state and to the local government, that the state has what we call police power.

70
00:25:53,323 --> 00:26:04,246
So the power to make laws for the general welfare, particularly law enforcement and what law enforcement can and can't do is very much in that world.

71
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:11,466
of police power, which means that the state and local governments are the ones to make that decision.

72
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:17,550
And the federal government can't coerce state and local governments to change their policies to match the federal government.

73
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:23,173
That's been tried many, many times in the federal courts.

74
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:25,074
It's been tried with the Supreme Courts before.

75
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:28,756
And that principle holds very, very strongly.

76
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:32,418
And while litigation over

77
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:40,548
This particular ordinance and this, you know, the gender affirming care and the reproductive health care ordinances is still relatively young.

78
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:50,361
This has made it up to circuit courts, it's made it up, you know, the court chain, and it's been upheld in most, if not all cases.

79
00:26:51,402 --> 00:27:11,277
except in jurisdictions with judges that are politically appointed, that are staffed against the effort, which is not a situation we face in Massachusetts, because the First Circuit, because of Massachusetts courts, are much more politically neutral and not like that.

80
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:21,375
So I wanted to give a bit of the legal argument for my fellow counselors and for residents who asked me those questions over the last few weeks as well.

81
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:25,958
And I look forward to discussing this text with everyone.

82
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,500
Thank you.

83
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:37,646
So I would suggest if we have any motions, I know that

84
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:48,264
Councilor Collins is on actually she may not be she may have just she may be coming in the building now.

85
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:53,834
Council Collins was on zoom but is arriving.

86
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:14,864
Um, and I wanted to give her an opportunity to speak on this topic, but a couple of the changes that were recommended by our council was to explicitly align the text with our state with the state law, um, specifically in the first section.

87
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:14,924
Um,

88
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:24,857
which has in the second paragraph of the first section, which maybe I can put our draft ordinance on the screen.

89
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:28,420
Can you tell me how to do that?

90
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,145
So I can put it on Zoom, share my screen on Zoom?

91
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:33,585
Okay.

92
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,275
Thank you.

93
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:18,422
Okay, this is our draft that we shared with our lawyers.

94
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:39,147
In the second paragraph that we have here, they replaced it with, it is therefore declared to be the city of Medford's public policy for the city to comply with the provisions of state law, including quote, enact expanding protections for reproductive and gender affirming care, chapter 127 of the acts of 2022 as set forth herein.

95
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:53,176
Um, I'm curious to hear thoughts from counselors on adopting or not adopting that as an amendment to the ordinance.

96
00:29:56,158 --> 00:29:57,138
Welcome, Councilor Collins.

97
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,460
Actually, oh, Councilor Collins.

98
00:29:59,580 --> 00:29:59,780
Okay.

99
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:02,362
Still, okay.

100
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:04,072
Thank you.

101
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:06,494
I was listening in on my commute here.

102
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:08,115
Sorry for being late to the chambers.

103
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:14,620
On the specific amendment, I just wanted to clarify, is this replacing any text from the draft?

104
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,824
So I think it is replacing, actually,

105
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:29,735
Is it fully replaced the second paragraph or is it pulled up?

106
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:31,795
Yeah, it does replace the second paragraph then.

107
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:37,497
Yeah, the second paragraph that's up here as written is replaced by what I just read out.

108
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:42,858
I would say, in general, I want to be deferential to the sponsors of the ordinance.

109
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:49,680
And you have been very, very closely involved in crafting a language to meet the intent of this.

110
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,341
And I trust that intent is to be as strongly protected as possible, which is my preference as well.

111
00:30:56,722 --> 00:31:01,364
I like that the original second paragraph calls out very explicitly what we're trying to do.

112
00:31:01,464 --> 00:31:15,812
I hear the concerns about adhering this with other city ordinances and state law as a protective mechanism for being able to do this protective work while also making sure that if the federal government decides to pick a fight legally, we'll have allies.

113
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:16,692
I think that's a good idea.

114
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:20,714
But I'm curious if we think there's a utility to keeping both.

115
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:31,037
So would you be interested in adding that section in addition?

116
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,477
Okay.

117
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:44,200
Yeah, depending on if other councillors disagree and, you know, have a good reason, then I'm amenable to that, but I would keep both.

118
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,220
Would you like to say that in the form of a motion?

119
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:52,668
I will, if there's any, if anybody has a reaction to that, I'd hear it first, but if others agree, then I would.

120
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:55,109
I just don't want to step on any toes.

121
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:59,049
Personally, I think I would agree with that as well.

122
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:08,911
I think that there is a hesitation to, oh, I'll be right with you.

123
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:16,573
I think there's a hesitation to explicitly state

124
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:20,733
What it is we're trying to do?

125
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:21,894
What it is we're trying to do?

126
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:29,518
I guess, in a sense, because of where we're at.

127
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:36,141
And I think that's a lot of what we're grappling with in this ordinance.

128
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:45,466
And I think that's just a decision that we all have to make, is how explicitly are we doing what we're doing?

129
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,327
And that's all I'll say about that.

130
00:32:51,665 --> 00:33:05,462
I think this is one of the examples where, so there are some edits in here where I don't think it's necessarily so important or so material to go one way or the other.

131
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,767
And I think I could see an argument for even combining the two.

132
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:28,253
you know, keeping the reference to the state law, and then also just keeping what we want to be the purpose and the policy of the of the ordinance, and then, you know, having another conversation with legal counsel, if they flag it.

133
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:48,126
I am curious what happens if the state law is changed or repealed, or then the specificity of it is changed at all, if it negates anything, or if we have to go back in and amend it because it's so specific.

134
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:51,570
Yeah.

135
00:33:54,403 --> 00:34:00,867
Okay, is there anything else from, well, I mean, there's a lot of, there are a lot of changes suggested.

136
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:14,314
So I guess another option is, do we want to, do we want to adopt the changes?

137
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,975
Do we want to not adopt the changes?

138
00:34:16,115 --> 00:34:22,219
Do we want to take some time and go through them?

139
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:25,606
piece by piece.

140
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:26,108
Councillor say.

141
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:36,205
Yes, I think my recommendation is that because we have someone online will have to take a roll call vote.

142
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:43,508
I would prefer that maybe we move section by section and then I can keep track of, no one's online?

143
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,989
No, Councilor Lemming is absent.

144
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:49,411
So, and now that Vice President Collins is here, we're all here.

145
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,051
Wonderful.

146
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:54,153
In that case, we can, I think, go section by section.

147
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:55,013
Yeah.

148
00:34:58,004 --> 00:34:59,585
Councilor Callahan.

149
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:00,865
Thanks.

150
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:02,166
I just wanted to clarify.

151
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:05,547
To me, it actually looks like there aren't very many changes.

152
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,848
A lot of these are simply a comment saying that it is consistent with state law.

153
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:16,971
So that is, you know, 1234567 just on the first page and almost all of the comments on the first page as well as in one of the comments.

154
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:22,133
I might be wrong about that.

155
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:25,254
But many of these what look like changes aren't.

156
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:29,436
And I wonder, could we go over just the substantive changes first?

157
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:30,577
Would that be okay?

158
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm comfortable with that.

159
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,511
Are we comfortable with just going over?

160
00:35:34,571 --> 00:35:34,811
Yeah.

161
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:41,212
So OK, so that that section in the in the top paragraph felt like a substantive change to me.

162
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:54,795
A lot of the a lot of the recommendations in the track changes are comments about like broad strokes, big picture things about like, are we comfortable with the level of.

163
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,217
Are we comfortable with doing this period?

164
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:01,858
Um, then it's you know.

165
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:05,020
Yes, this is aligned with state law.

166
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,543
Um, you know, align with state law line of state law.

167
00:36:08,623 --> 00:36:14,026
All of those things are, um, just updating us on that, which is really helpful.

168
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:24,893
Um There is a comment on In the the, uh,

169
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:29,608
What is I think the third page of our printed copy?

170
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:33,392
That says where it says city agent.

171
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:34,473
It's a definition.

172
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:36,454
City agent means any employee.

173
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:37,736
I will scroll.

174
00:36:42,545 --> 00:37:01,140
City agent means any employee of the city of Medford, whether full time or part time, regular or seasonal, any intern or volunteer when acting on behalf of the city of Medford, any contractor for the city of Medford while a contract between the city of Medford and said contractors in effect, and any recipient of city funding grants, awards or appropriations.

175
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:09,447
And there is a suggestion that the city should carefully think about what that

176
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:16,091
like how broad that is, that maybe it would include too many people.

177
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:38,369
I think also it does occur to me that like, you know, there are organizations that we give grants and funding to like, you know, churches to fix a building or nonprofits to provide transportation to individuals that may not need to be kind of

178
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:39,883
included.

179
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:43,691
So that's one thought.

180
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:46,436
I will go to Vice President Collins.

181
00:37:48,864 --> 00:37:49,024
Yes.

182
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:50,105
Thank you.

183
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:50,665
And I'm sorry.

184
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:54,286
I don't have a direct response to what you were just speaking to.

185
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:58,688
I'm just I'm noticing some areas.

186
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:05,391
I'm noticing some discrepancies between the two versions of the ordinance that aren't noted in the markup.

187
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:09,253
So I just want to be certain that there, I think that there might be things that

188
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:25,811
were changed by legal counsel in the markup version that just weren't aren't being called out using the traditional markup notation like we're not seeing the strikeout we're not seeing this was added or at least I'm not in this version of the printout and I just want to make sure we call those out and discuss them if we need to.

189
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:33,654
For example, the definition of gender identity has been changed, maybe not substantively, but substantially.

190
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:35,155
And I think we should talk about that.

191
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:39,836
And I also note that these are just two that I noted off the top of my head, and I suspect there may be others.

192
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:53,320
Under definitions, pregnancy related service has been deleted.

193
00:38:59,222 --> 00:39:09,908
So I think unless I'm missing something, and that's always entirely possible, I think it might be worth going through this section by section, because there's some stuff that's been changed that is not apparent.

194
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:14,930
Yeah.

195
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:28,217
Yes, I just can't put it on.

196
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:32,444
Okay, I, yes.

197
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:37,625
So the way that this prints when you print it doesn't have every change.

198
00:39:37,785 --> 00:39:40,926
I know that there were something like 141 edits made.

199
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:47,607
So I think I can, if I send it to you, could you email it to the committee?

200
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:56,309
I think it's just...

201
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:06,123
Let me turn on your, sorry.

202
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:35,297
So the conversation is about whether we include contractors.

203
00:40:35,577 --> 00:40:43,341
Essentially it boils down to whether we include recipients of city funding grants, awards, or appropriations in the definition for city agent.

204
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:46,864
Now something I did notice in

205
00:40:47,914 --> 00:41:02,288
comparing the two copies is that in the KP law suggested copy, the one that aligns our language with the state, there's actually no reference to agents, in which case that definition actually, we should probably take that definition out.

206
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:10,695
And actually, if there is a real big substantive change, I think that is one of them, is the

207
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:32,999
KP law's suggested version of the ordinance essentially takes out the enforceability or the kind of like the oversight that we would have over contractors and people who receive city funds or appropriations grants.

208
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,922
And I think that's something for us to think about.

209
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:40,494
Yeah, that's a policy thing.

210
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:43,678
And I think the pros are, I think it'd be nice to get something stronger.

211
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:48,423
I think the con is, does that take us out of alignment with the state?

212
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:50,506
Will we have to defend that separately in court?

213
00:42:50,394 --> 00:42:55,436
Otherwise, the edits to the definition sections aren't really that big.

214
00:42:57,477 --> 00:43:05,920
Essentially, any change to the definitions in the section are based on state law.

215
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,382
So it's just copying and pasting in how the state has defined certain terms.

216
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:13,703
and then making sure that we're defining the terms the same as how the state is defining the terms.

217
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:15,963
Thank you for the clarification.

218
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:25,825
But the big one is city agent, I guess, which that's the whole other substantive debate that I just laid out.

219
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:30,626
OK.

220
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:32,046
Thank you.

221
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:34,827
So you think that that was removed for that reason, that it's not in the state law?

222
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,411
City agent.

223
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:39,212
Yeah, I guess.

224
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:45,556
So KP law actually didn't suggest, didn't make a solid recommendation about whether we change the definition of city agent.

225
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:48,837
Like they didn't, they didn't modify the language.

226
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:51,119
They just suggested that we look at it.

227
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:51,499
Yeah.

228
00:43:51,919 --> 00:44:03,266
Um, but I can also see the argument being that we, we take it out if we choose to have this ordinance apply to city employees or officials.

229
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:05,668
if that makes sense.

230
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:12,390
If we want to expand the scope, if that's what we choose, then we might want to.

231
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,851
We will need this definition.

232
00:44:22,413 --> 00:44:23,113
OK.

233
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:28,215
The clerk is sending the fully redlined version.

234
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:41,644
I do think my impression is aligned with Councilor saying that the majority of the changes will be to align the language with the state law.

235
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:51,592
Is that you getting an email?

236
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:58,137
So some of the changes are things like capitalizing the C in the word city.

237
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:04,915
So there are a lot of changes like that that I think we can adopt comfortably.

238
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:11,398
There are other changes like removing the second paragraph or condensing it.

239
00:45:12,138 --> 00:45:14,099
There are some things that were redundant.

240
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:27,064
And I guess there are larger shifts that we should probably look at really carefully and think

241
00:45:28,131 --> 00:45:30,194
carefully about if we would want to adopt them.

242
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:42,630
I did also reach out to the chief of police about a section at the end, but we can get to that.

243
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:43,992
Vice President Collins.

244
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:48,405
Great, thank you for those clarifications I appreciate it.

245
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:51,387
So just to be clear, the updated definitions.

246
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:54,550
They now match the language in state law.

247
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:55,951
Okay.

248
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:57,272
All right.

249
00:45:57,472 --> 00:45:57,773
Thank you.

250
00:45:58,053 --> 00:46:03,417
There are ones that I would change but I guess that would require a changing state law and I see the merit of having them be in alignment.

251
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:07,736
I don't think it requires that we change state law.

252
00:46:07,836 --> 00:46:11,219
I mean, we can have something that's not perfectly in alignment.

253
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:13,000
We would just have to make the choice to do that.

254
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:29,011
And if we're, I mean, I think if we believe solidly that it's not enough or it doesn't go far enough or whatever, or it needs greater protection for whatever reason, I don't think it precludes us, but I don't think it's not possible for us to do.

255
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:30,612
It's just what was recommended to us.

256
00:46:33,955 --> 00:46:34,095
Yeah.

257
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:39,712
I've made it more confusing.

258
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:41,933
Thank you, sorry.

259
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:53,115
I'm just thinking, I admit I was reading over the state definition of gender identity and the part that says like provided however that this gender identity may be demonstrated through like essentially paperwork was surprising to me.

260
00:46:56,115 --> 00:47:00,236
Obviously that's a statewide vulnerability if that's the language that the state has.

261
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:05,217
Sorry, I feel like I derailed us.

262
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:06,757
I'm happy to continue going through.

263
00:47:08,003 --> 00:47:08,264
flag.

264
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,606
That's for circling back at the end.

265
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,049
Okay.

266
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:13,994
Um, okay.

267
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:17,841
Counselor saying

268
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:38,661
I guess I think that is a decent like, yeah, it's a vulnerability in the state's definition of gender identity, which doesn't really line up 100%, I think it's like 80%, maybe 70% there with what people conceive of as gender identity, but that last 20% isn't there.

269
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:43,822
I think that's something worth considering, worth talking about.

270
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,443
Yeah, I mean, I think,

271
00:47:53,124 --> 00:48:11,507
Essentially, I think a lot of the edits that this committee could make today, I would say we would be fine making those edits, moving out of committee, and then getting legal counsel to have a second look at it, or just choosing to adopt what legal counsel did and to cut out that stuff.

272
00:48:11,907 --> 00:48:17,308
So I think a lot of the edits today will fall in one or two, one or either one of the buckets.

273
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:21,283
Yeah.

274
00:48:21,383 --> 00:48:32,009
I did also want to make a point about city agents, since we were still talking about that, and there's that whole attached conversation of how expansive do we want this to be.

275
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:44,556
I think something to consider, not to say that this is the make or break, but I think something for us to consider is, do we realistically foresee that extra reach being very helpful?

276
00:48:50,452 --> 00:48:51,692
I can see that breaking either way.

277
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:55,734
So let's take the recipients of city funding grants, awards, or appropriations.

278
00:48:56,894 --> 00:49:01,856
I guess we should ask ourselves, what are those groups that are getting that money?

279
00:49:02,337 --> 00:49:08,079
And is there even any way that they could break this ordinance, break this law?

280
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:11,120
Because they might, I mean,

281
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,790
They're not carrying out the warrants.

282
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,551
They're not carrying out the arrests.

283
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:16,812
They're not reporting the data.

284
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,554
And they don't have the image to report.

285
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:24,779
And so perhaps, even though we're technically narrowing the scope, practically, we're not making a change.

286
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:34,568
But you can see an argument where maybe there just happens to be a law enforcement-related grantee or recipient.

287
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:39,494
And we want this to extend to them as well.

288
00:49:39,554 --> 00:49:43,797
Although I can't think of any of my mind, any groups in my mind with that power.

289
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:57,947
Yeah, I think the, our goal here is to broaden the protections as much as possible and not necessarily broaden the like, punishments.

290
00:49:59,047 --> 00:49:59,548
Because

291
00:50:01,587 --> 00:50:01,707
that.

292
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:06,931
As long as our residents and visitors are protected, then that.

293
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:08,031
Then we're

294
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:23,947
or a contractor while they're under contract with the city.

295
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:26,909
That feels to me like what we mean when we say city agent.

296
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:31,053
And I think in the language, if we were saying something else, we would say something else.

297
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:32,954
We wouldn't be saying city agent.

298
00:50:34,175 --> 00:50:41,000
I don't think when we're talking about like a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford, we're saying city agent.

299
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,162
We would just say that probably.

300
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:50,318
Yeah, although they would fall under what we originally have, they would fall under the definition of the same agent.

301
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:52,581
Right, which I think is probably too broad.

302
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:54,624
I think that's a good point made by our council.

303
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:06,108
That is not actually a change that's suggested, that's a comment.

304
00:51:06,248 --> 00:51:07,008
Yeah, it's a comment, right.

305
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:09,149
Yeah, so that would have to be a separate motion.

306
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:16,072
If we were to say, like, adopt the changes, then separate motion if we wanted to take that in.

307
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:31,237
I would say, I think, contractors, where I kind of, like, think we should see if we can include contractors.

308
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:39,162
I think that is the like that's the one that's in the definition for an agent that's not in the rest of the ordinance, right?

309
00:51:39,322 --> 00:51:44,703
Or as keep you all suggested that I think potentially I can see that overlap being there.

310
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:55,406
I think the contractor while under contract with the city, I would agree with you because I think that can include a lot of people who have long term contracts with the city.

311
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:58,567
Um Yeah, I think so, too.

312
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:00,028
We might have data.

313
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:00,348
Sure.

314
00:52:00,388 --> 00:52:00,668
Yeah.

315
00:52:01,628 --> 00:52:01,768
Yeah.

316
00:52:07,402 --> 00:52:09,824
Um, do counselors have any other thoughts about.

317
00:52:09,844 --> 00:52:17,770
Uh, any of the other sections where I know it takes a while to look over the stuff.

318
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:41,039
Councilor Calihan, wait, you're six, yes.

319
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:42,080
Councilor Calihan.

320
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,541
Thanks.

321
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:58,230
You notice one thing as I'm looking, so just below that, after D before E, all city agents shall comply with any state regulation pertaining to reproductive and gender-affirming healthcare, not otherwise explicitly stated in this ordinance.

322
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:05,214
And the change is all city employees and officials shall comply with any state or federal law.

323
00:53:07,803 --> 00:53:18,331
Clearly, we understand the current state of federal actors and potential for federal law changes.

324
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:27,290
And I wonder, was that state regulation very specific to not include federal regulation when it was originally written?

325
00:53:28,311 --> 00:53:34,636
Is that something that we specifically want to keep and perhaps leave out federal law silently?

326
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:41,042
Because I don't think that's going to get us in any trouble just to not include the words or federal.

327
00:53:47,918 --> 00:53:49,358
don't know about that.

328
00:53:49,678 --> 00:53:58,100
My understanding was always that when we write these, we have to include, notwithstanding any state or federal law, to the contrary.

329
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:01,921
Though it is also, I think, implied.

330
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:08,023
Vice President Collins can confirm that for me.

331
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:09,143
Actually, you're nodding.

332
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:10,744
And you're requesting, anyway.

333
00:54:11,504 --> 00:54:12,264
Vice President Collins.

334
00:54:12,944 --> 00:54:13,124
Sorry.

335
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:14,364
I don't want to cut you off.

336
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:14,945
That's it.

337
00:54:17,928 --> 00:54:22,612
Yeah, I think that that's one of those things that we, as a matter of practice, tend to put into ordinances.

338
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:26,115
And it also should go without saying, and does, even though we write it.

339
00:54:26,235 --> 00:54:33,742
So I don't think that it substantively changes the ordinance to leave it out.

340
00:54:33,762 --> 00:54:44,291
And I also don't think that we need to go out of our way to be reminding city agents to comply with federal laws that are increasingly in direct opposition to the well-being of people who live here.

341
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:50,642
There was a different point I was gonna make, but I forgot what it is.

342
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,263
You can make that one too.

343
00:54:52,303 --> 00:54:53,364
No, I forgot what it is, so.

344
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:56,286
If I could.

345
00:54:56,306 --> 00:54:58,847
Yes, please.

346
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:07,012
I agree with Councillor Callaghan here, that we should think about taking it out.

347
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:23,367
I think here's the situation, is I'm confident that the Constitution grants us the right to make this law and to have this law rule over other supposed federal laws that trample on states' rights.

348
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:31,975
But I think this creates almost like a inconsistency within the language of the statute.

349
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:46,852
to essentially, like, someone could point at that and say, well, they're not even trampling on states or, you know, your local rights to write your own ordinance because you've incorporated all federal law in this clause.

350
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:55,055
And so I, that's another question for council, but I would say we shouldn't adopt that.

351
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,182
because I think our loyalty to the Constitution is implied.

352
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:03,383
We all took oaths to that, right?

353
00:56:03,743 --> 00:56:05,584
And that should rule above anything else.

354
00:56:08,085 --> 00:56:15,348
Accidentally incorporating federal law, I worry that, I would just worry that that would nullify this ordinance.

355
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:16,518
Right.

356
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:19,300
I mean, that's basically what it would do.

357
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,100
Yeah.

358
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:28,366
That's the interesting thing about the Constitution and the rule of law is that it always is supposed to be the thing that you follow.

359
00:56:29,426 --> 00:56:33,509
Even if you don't say it all the time, you're supposed to follow those laws.

360
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:36,631
Anyway.

361
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:40,513
Great.

362
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:41,394
OK.

363
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:43,315
I think I would agree with that.

364
00:56:46,391 --> 00:57:02,236
there is another, there's a couple comments from council that we should review a few sections of the ordinance with the health department and the police department, which I am happy to do.

365
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:10,879
I did, I have an email out to the chief and I spoke with the board of health this week.

366
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:14,380
So that's in process.

367
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,361
And before this goes before the full council will That'll be done.

368
00:57:21,622 --> 00:57:25,003
I might have to, you know, knock down some doors, but it'll happen.

369
00:57:25,823 --> 00:57:33,145
Um, and in the meantime, I mean, I feel like we can check those boxes when we come to them.

370
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:43,808
But is there anything else that You'd like to Discuss before we Move forward.

371
00:57:43,848 --> 00:57:44,188
Any other

372
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:47,900
substantial adjustments.

373
00:57:58,245 --> 00:57:59,086
Councillor Collins.

374
00:58:00,332 --> 00:58:01,952
Um, not a suggested amendment.

375
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:04,453
Just I just want to make sure that we talked about it.

376
00:58:05,053 --> 00:58:12,594
I noticed that the legal counsel recommended that we take out the drafted section, um, which would have.

377
00:58:14,314 --> 00:58:27,477
Limited limited service and limited service pregnancy centers for like advertising their services in the city, and I know that that was because it was a potential like first amendment violation.

378
00:58:27,497 --> 00:58:27,537
Um,

379
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:36,491
So I just didn't want that to go unnoted for the reason for it to be deleted from the draft.

380
00:58:37,111 --> 00:58:50,941
I know that in a lot of other communities, there's been action taken to not prevent anybody's constitutionally protected right to free speech, including to spread misinformation about abortion and pregnancy.

381
00:58:54,063 --> 00:59:03,371
it's my understanding that where our ability stops is being able to say you're not allowed to talk about your business, even if your business is fraudulent, you still have a right to be able to advertise about it.

382
00:59:04,032 --> 00:59:08,836
Is that, am I correct in that being the motivation for taking that section out of the ordinance?

383
00:59:09,177 --> 00:59:10,438
That's my understanding.

384
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:20,126
I believe we can still, I mean, I believe you can still include information on

385
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:23,975
consumer protection.

386
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:28,600
So that element of it, I think is still fine.

387
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:38,170
And it's especially because the Attorney General's Office has like a database of these, like these organizations that are spreading misinformation.

388
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,031
Yeah, and that's allowed.

389
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:42,235
But you can't, you can't like, shut down

390
00:59:44,710 --> 01:00:02,144
That makes sense, and I was happy to hear that the legal counsel flagged that as, you know, we want to pass a strong ordinance that doesn't open us up to any unnecessary liability, and this still emphasizes the city's responsibility and intent to publish consumer protection information that can help empower people to know, like, what these are should they come into the community.

391
01:00:03,104 --> 01:00:07,568
We just wanted to, just wanted to clarify, just wanted to confirm that that was the intent behind that.

392
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:12,252
Is this what used to be number four?

393
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:13,472
That used to be...

394
01:00:14,983 --> 01:00:16,563
In the old draft.

395
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:17,523
In the old draft?

396
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:21,024
I'm just trying to follow.

397
01:00:21,044 --> 01:00:21,444
Sorry.

398
01:00:21,644 --> 01:00:22,124
Oh, yeah.

399
01:00:22,144 --> 01:00:22,324
Sorry.

400
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:22,964
I should have said that.

401
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:28,245
Oh, is the number?

402
01:00:28,265 --> 01:00:30,206
It used to be, like, I think it was G2.

403
01:00:30,506 --> 01:00:31,886
G2.

404
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:34,107
Yeah, G2.

405
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:34,987
Yeah, it's pulled out.

406
01:00:36,547 --> 01:00:39,328
It basically, that in our original draft, I'll show you.

407
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:41,608
Oh, yeah, it's right here on the screen, actually.

408
01:00:42,124 --> 01:00:48,726
It says no limited services pregnancy center shall make or disseminate before the public or cause to be made or disseminated before the public, et cetera, et cetera.

409
01:00:49,306 --> 01:00:59,428
They just, it said like, you can't advertise your company that you know to be reason, that you know to be, you know, spreading misinformation.

410
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:08,030
But that was removed, that was suggested to be removed, but still has, you know,

411
01:01:10,117 --> 01:01:18,882
something about the Attorney General's consumer protection resources, access to consumer protection resources.

412
01:01:20,183 --> 01:01:36,913
I do wonder, in an ordinance, those consumer protection resources may be available now, but it's something that's going on the books.

413
01:01:37,013 --> 01:01:37,994
Is that something that can be

414
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,511
to be updated easily.

415
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:42,252
How easily can we update?

416
01:01:44,253 --> 01:01:46,094
The language of that if that were to change.

417
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:47,955
Where is this?

418
01:01:48,295 --> 01:01:48,495
Yeah.

419
01:01:50,056 --> 01:01:50,837
And on the City Council.

420
01:01:51,617 --> 01:01:51,818
Yeah.

421
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:55,420
Just

422
01:02:03,118 --> 01:02:03,418
Thank you.

423
01:02:03,478 --> 01:02:04,199
Yeah.

424
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,001
I think this will be the last comment that I make.

425
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:09,863
Overall, I just want to say thank you so much to the sponsors.

426
01:02:09,903 --> 01:02:18,270
I think that this is started out strong, got stronger, both in that I think the intent is still really there, really protective.

427
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:26,596
I'm really proud that we're passing as strong of an ordinance as has been passed in any other Massachusetts community, maybe beyond.

428
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,079
And also, I think that part of that strength is making sure that we're not

429
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:41,973
We're not leaving anything in there that doesn't that potentially opens the city up to liability that doesn't also help us better protect residents because that is not useful to our cause.

430
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:47,600
I do think circling back to the definition section I do think that if you know subject to.

431
01:02:51,032 --> 01:02:52,793
you know, a vote by the committee.

432
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:59,639
I would, just for the purpose of what we report out of this committee, and if it changes before we take a vote to ordain it, that's fine.

433
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:12,069
I would make a motion to delete the part of the gender identity definition that comes after the first semicolon.

434
01:03:15,952 --> 01:03:18,374
I know that that's in alignment with state law.

435
01:03:21,904 --> 01:03:25,967
But I personally was surprised to see that language.

436
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:32,671
The first clause also aligns with state law, and then we're just like getting a little less descriptive.

437
01:03:34,452 --> 01:03:36,894
Again, if my fellow counselors don't agree, I won't take it personally.

438
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:37,994
I think that's fine.

439
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:41,537
I understand the motivation behind having it align perfectly with state law.

440
01:03:42,237 --> 01:03:43,798
But that part that I'm...

441
01:03:45,499 --> 01:04:04,345
suggesting that we take out would be the part that says, provided however that gender identity may be demonstrated through medical history, care or treatment of the gender identity, consistent and uniform assertion of the gender identity, or any other evidence that the gender identity is sincerely held as part of a person's core identity, and provided further

442
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:08,588
that gender identity shall not be asserted for any improper purpose.

443
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:30,568
And my motivation behind that is just especially in this environment, I think we're gonna see more people with gender identities other than like woman assigned female at birth and man assigned male at birth who don't have documentation that it's a core part of their identity because it's less and less safe to do that.

444
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:38,014
I just don't think that we need to uphold that premise in our definitions.

445
01:04:38,234 --> 01:04:43,859
If that's something that legal counsel insists we change before we take a vote to ordain this, that's fine, but I'd rather we delete it.

446
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:48,763
Councillor Callahan?

447
01:04:50,605 --> 01:04:56,670
I have something small, and I'm mostly just asking if this language means what I think it means.

448
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,943
under the role of the police department.

449
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:18,291
So the language changed from the police department of the city of Medford shall not to blah, blah, blah, no officer or employee of a law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth.

450
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:19,812
And

451
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:23,840
I'm not a lawyer, I'm more of a layperson in terms of legalese.

452
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:28,904
To me, a law enforcement agent of the Commonwealth is a state police.

453
01:05:29,905 --> 01:05:36,270
So I think what we're trying to say is the Medford Police Department, and the new language does not say that anymore.

454
01:05:50,371 --> 01:05:55,833
Um, uh, yes.

455
01:05:57,994 --> 01:05:58,774
Uh, hmm.

456
01:06:05,556 --> 01:06:07,637
Sorry, uh, Councilor Collins.

457
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:17,080
Um, my assumption perhaps is that

458
01:06:18,676 --> 01:06:27,963
Maybe the intent in this language is that local police counts as a law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth, but I think that we should, I think we should make it really clear.

459
01:06:28,803 --> 01:06:33,186
Yeah, why are we writing language for any random city in the Commonwealth?

460
01:06:33,226 --> 01:06:35,028
Like we're Medford, we should only be talking about Medford.

461
01:06:35,048 --> 01:06:36,028
We're talking about Medford, yeah.

462
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:37,169
No, I think that's a good point.

463
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:44,835
I think it was to align with the state law to just say, we're not doing anything

464
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:50,458
unusual or different from what Massachusetts has already done.

465
01:06:50,478 --> 01:06:52,662
We're just aligning.

466
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:55,866
But I think I would agree with you.

467
01:06:57,088 --> 01:06:58,170
Councillor Singh.

468
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:03,067
I just pulled up the state law definition that they cite too, so section 63.

469
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:05,649
It includes municipal police departments.

470
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:09,772
It also includes university, college university police departments as well.

471
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:09,973
Okay.

472
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,074
That would be useful.

473
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,375
We do have the Tufts police.

474
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:13,355
Wonderful.

475
01:07:13,436 --> 01:07:15,137
I just wanted to make sure.

476
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:16,818
No, it was a good flag.

477
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:16,979
Okay.

478
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:32,733
So there is a motion on the floor from Vice President Collins.

479
01:07:32,753 --> 01:07:36,695
Do we need a roll call for that?

480
01:07:36,715 --> 01:07:37,616
I'm sorry, could you repeat the motion?

481
01:07:37,656 --> 01:07:40,518
Or do we want to do public participation?

482
01:07:40,538 --> 01:07:42,279
I can also email it to you.

483
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:07,734
Yep.

484
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,282
there any other motions or do we need to?

485
01:08:22,382 --> 01:08:24,663
Would we like to vote on that motion?

486
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:29,586
Would we like to do or would we like to do public participation before we vote on any motions?

487
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:31,627
Maybe we do public participation first.

488
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:34,669
Um, actually, Councilor Sang has requested.

489
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:35,849
Do you still?

490
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:36,670
Is that still active?

491
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,710
Yes, Councilor Sang.

492
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:39,131
Thank you.

493
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:55,099
Um, I think my, my last kind of note, like, uh, flag is I think it could make sense to take out the definition for CD agent, but insert, um, or contractor after each like employee or official.

494
01:08:55,919 --> 01:09:04,203
Um, and we might want to, um, insert a definition of contractor in, um, in the definition section as well.

495
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:14,649
And I can do a quick search to make sure that there's nothing in the state law that defines contract or otherwise.

496
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:19,151
But I think what we have here is a decent definition of it.

497
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:21,012
So we can just kind of move it around.

498
01:09:23,753 --> 01:09:29,896
Yeah.

499
01:09:29,977 --> 01:09:31,157
Councillor Callahan.

500
01:09:31,217 --> 01:09:31,577
Thank you.

501
01:09:33,217 --> 01:09:39,579
So my only thing about that is, I think in the city agent definition, it's kind of a little bit more encompassing.

502
01:09:39,639 --> 01:09:47,561
It says employee of the city, whether full-time or part-time, regular or seasonal, any intern or volunteer when acting on behalf of the city of Medford.

503
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:49,341
And I kind of like that definition.

504
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:50,981
And I feel like it's a little bit more encompassing.

505
01:09:51,101 --> 01:09:53,242
Is there a reason to not go with that one?

506
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:53,822
No.

507
01:09:54,442 --> 01:09:56,483
I think actually that also makes a lot of sense.

508
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:57,103
Yeah.

509
01:09:58,385 --> 01:10:10,032
we can choose not to accept the instances where agent was taken out, and then just keep that.

510
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:13,534
But shorten that, shorten it to that, just the beginning part of that.

511
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:15,556
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
01:10:15,576 --> 01:10:22,640
So shorten it to basically the employee part, the volunteer part, and the contractor part.

513
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,507
Yeah, I'm of two minds of the contractor part.

514
01:10:27,888 --> 01:10:29,688
I think we might need to check.

515
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:39,090
I don't know what we need to check, but I'm sure that first part, and I think we're all agreed that not the grants and the award, people who got an award.

516
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,990
So I think we're just in the middle section of the contract.

517
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:52,272
And I might suggest also adding officials to the definition if we're doing that, because that's something that was put in that wasn't in a whole draft.

518
01:10:53,623 --> 01:10:54,484
And that could be helpful.

519
01:10:56,226 --> 01:10:59,871
So appointees and elected officials don't, you know.

520
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:02,775
Yeah.

521
01:11:13,547 --> 01:11:17,670
Okay, I would like to go to public participation.

522
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:23,034
If anybody would like to speak in person or on Zoom.

523
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,282
You can come up to the podium or you can raise your hand on Zoom.

524
01:11:36,304 --> 01:11:38,805
I see one hand on Zoom, but it's, yes, okay.

525
01:11:38,986 --> 01:11:40,867
Yes, I will go to Zoom.

526
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:46,483
Thanks.

527
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,889
Hi, sorry, I couldn't seem to get on.

528
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,253
Anyway, I want to thank you for all the hard work on this effort that you all made.

529
01:12:18,273 --> 01:12:27,399
It makes such a difference to know that Medford is going to in any way, shape or form be there for our friends and neighbors.

530
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,522
So I absolutely support this measure.

531
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,424
And once again, I have to thank you very much.

532
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:35,405
That's all.

533
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:37,487
Thank you, Marie.

534
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:40,328
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you, can you state your name and address for the record?

535
01:12:40,348 --> 01:12:44,169
Yes, Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

536
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,090
Thank you.

537
01:12:52,932 --> 01:12:56,093
Seeing no more hands, I will go to the podium.

538
01:12:56,854 --> 01:12:57,874
Let me just turn on your mic.

539
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:00,855
Which one is that?

540
01:13:13,308 --> 01:13:14,249
Okay, the mic is on.

541
01:13:14,409 --> 01:13:15,790
Please state your name and address for the record.

542
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:18,212
Kate Ryan, 34 Warren Street.

543
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:20,594
I am here in full support of this measure.

544
01:13:20,674 --> 01:13:25,258
We need to keep people safe in these challenging times and this will keep people safe.

545
01:13:25,879 --> 01:13:27,320
Thank you for your efforts on this matter.

546
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:30,423
Thank you very much.

547
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,886
I'm gonna go to Zoom.

548
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:41,132
Sam, please state your name and address for the record.

549
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:44,463
Hi, I'm Sam Cato.

550
01:13:44,763 --> 01:13:49,206
I live in 24 Commonwealth Road in Watertown.

551
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:53,489
And I was wondering, I'm in support of this ordinance to be clear.

552
01:13:54,210 --> 01:14:07,980
I was wondering if the, if this will be, where this will be put publicly, because I know that you had it on the screen, but like, I don't know where we can see the full text.

553
01:14:13,356 --> 01:14:14,097
That is a good question.

554
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:14,577
One second.

555
01:14:14,637 --> 01:14:17,738
I am just gonna go to Vice President Collins.

556
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:19,619
No, Vice President Collins, sorry.

557
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:22,440
Do you know the answer?

558
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,520
Sorry, I was just trying to sidebar you.

559
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:37,606
The meeting documents for this meeting, if they're not already uploaded, they'll be on the City Council's public portal website, which you can go to the City of Medford website and click on City Council and you'll find our public portal.

560
01:14:37,966 --> 01:14:41,047
If the documents for tonight's meeting aren't up yet, I'm sure they will be by tomorrow.

561
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:53,275
and after this is voted on, if it is approved, it will eventually be added to the city's muni code and search city of Medford muni code.

562
01:14:53,295 --> 01:15:02,481
I know there's a backlog on ordinances that still need to be uploaded there, but in the meantime, you can find them on the city council public portal from the date on which they were voted on.

563
01:15:03,762 --> 01:15:10,867
Yes, and to elaborate the MedfordMA.org is the city's website.

564
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,283
I will go to the podium.

565
01:15:16,469 --> 01:15:17,992
Please state your name and address for the record.

566
01:15:20,097 --> 01:15:20,298
It's on.

567
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:21,078
It's on.

568
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:21,838
Okay, thank you.

569
01:15:22,138 --> 01:15:23,299
My name is Jennifer Yanko.

570
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,039
I live at 16 Monument Street.

571
01:15:25,759 --> 01:15:32,141
And I just wanted to add my voice in real gratitude to all of you for taking the time.

572
01:15:32,181 --> 01:15:34,861
This is so comprehensive and thorough.

573
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:42,943
And it's so important right now that we really proactively protect all of our residents.

574
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:45,384
And this certainly serves to do that.

575
01:15:45,484 --> 01:15:46,584
And so I'm very grateful.

576
01:15:46,644 --> 01:15:50,565
And I just want you to know that there are a lot of us who are really thankful for this.

577
01:15:50,865 --> 01:15:52,206
I know this is a lot of work.

578
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:53,767
So thank you.

579
01:15:54,568 --> 01:15:54,908
Thank you.

580
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:56,849
I'm going to go to Zoom.

581
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:03,274
Mike, I'm sorry, I missed your hand before it because it blended in with the background on your screen.

582
01:16:03,374 --> 01:16:04,275
So I apologize.

583
01:16:06,196 --> 01:16:07,037
That's fine.

584
01:16:07,157 --> 01:16:09,437
Zoom and the hand situation is tricky.

585
01:16:11,278 --> 01:16:12,959
My name is Mike Denton.

586
01:16:12,979 --> 01:16:15,480
I live at Bellevue Terrace in Medford.

587
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:20,562
And first and foremost, thanks so much for doing this.

588
01:16:23,062 --> 01:16:28,945
I realized I said that in a friendly kind of a way that belies the incredible

589
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:36,212
seriousness and value of this whole effort.

590
01:16:36,932 --> 01:16:42,294
I will confess that I came here really hoping that it would be like, let's vote this out of committee tonight.

591
01:16:42,654 --> 01:16:50,478
But everything that I've heard so far suggests that this deserves more of the very thoughtful deliberation you've been giving it.

592
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:55,473
So I think I came here just to say thank you so much.

593
01:16:55,493 --> 01:16:57,434
I want you to know that there's so many people.

594
01:16:57,975 --> 01:17:17,910
And by so many people, I mean as a business owner in Medford who serves a population that is entirely covered by this ordinance that you're debating, I can tell you that there are a lot of people who are exceedingly grateful to know that this is the Medford that we live in.

595
01:17:20,325 --> 01:17:36,268
You did a wonderful job earlier of kind of dancing around, describing the current state of affairs in our country without making it sound too dire, because it's getting really scary.

596
01:17:36,388 --> 01:17:45,770
And I think entirely because nobody needs to live in a country where their government makes them scared for their lives.

597
01:17:46,982 --> 01:17:47,723
or their safety.

598
01:17:48,344 --> 01:17:56,872
So because this ordinance is here, because I can see that you're acknowledging that, I'm here to say thank you for that.

599
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:58,234
That's all.

600
01:18:01,297 --> 01:18:04,740
Thank you.

601
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:07,623
Yes, I'll go back to the podium.

602
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:09,065
Please state your name and address for the record.

603
01:18:10,092 --> 01:18:11,833
Sharon Hayes, Ripley Road in Medford.

604
01:18:12,173 --> 01:18:14,694
I'll just add my voice to those in support of these.

605
01:18:17,075 --> 01:18:30,100
I'll just add my voice in support of these ordinances and in thanks for all of you for doing this and making sure that everyone in Medford knows that our local government supports them and they will do everything they can to protect and keep them safe.

606
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:30,960
Thank you.

607
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:32,741
Thank you.

608
01:18:35,418 --> 01:18:36,499
Mary, your hands still up.

609
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:39,061
Is that a leftover hand up on zoom?

610
01:18:39,241 --> 01:18:40,521
Or would you like to speak again?

611
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:41,542
Oh, down it goes.

612
01:18:41,742 --> 01:18:42,002
Okay.

613
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:51,769
Um, so, uh, seeing no more public participation, I will go to counselor saying you're my son already.

614
01:18:52,329 --> 01:18:53,630
Thank you.

615
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:59,233
Um, I know Councilor Collins, the vice president Collins has her motion on the floor.

616
01:18:59,934 --> 01:19:01,415
Um, I just wanted to

617
01:19:02,423 --> 01:19:08,347
Oh, I guess I just wanted to take the definitions section edits all at once too.

618
01:19:09,428 --> 01:19:12,690
With the new edits and stuff, it's not alphabetized anymore.

619
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:19,454
So if Councillor Collins is amenable to re-alphabetizing it, adding that to your motion, that'd be helpful.

620
01:19:19,675 --> 01:19:19,955
Thank you.

621
01:19:29,802 --> 01:19:32,384
Okay, uh, so that's do you?

622
01:19:32,764 --> 01:19:37,026
Did you want to do the motion about the, um.

623
01:19:38,687 --> 01:19:39,308
City agent.

624
01:19:39,968 --> 01:19:40,689
Yes Yes.

625
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:44,751
I would also, you know, we can just put all on the floor right now.

626
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:47,132
I'll I'll make the motion to

627
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:17,862
The, oh, I guess the other thing I forgot about the definition section, to add, I'll motion to add the word, to add officials to the definition of city agent and then to take out the recipients of city grants and whatnot.

628
01:20:20,803 --> 01:20:21,823
Yes, thank you.

629
01:20:22,603 --> 01:20:23,683
I deleted it off the straps.

630
01:20:30,678 --> 01:20:37,700
Councilor Sangamon to keep the word agent where the original draft had it and to add officials to the definition of city agent.

631
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:50,183
And then it's to remove the last phrase in that section, which was any recipient of city funding grants, awards or appropriations.

632
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:56,105
Grants, awards or appropriations.

633
01:20:59,129 --> 01:21:01,611
And then I had one more motion.

634
01:21:02,853 --> 01:21:13,282
I know this committee discussed wanting to keep the second paragraph, the one in purpose, that was suggested to us to be deleted.

635
01:21:13,322 --> 01:21:16,205
So I would motion to remove that paragraph.

636
01:21:19,844 --> 01:21:26,145
to put it back in, but also to keep the reference to the state law in the purpose section.

637
01:21:26,265 --> 01:21:28,506
And I have some new language, which I can send to the clerk.

638
01:21:29,686 --> 01:21:34,147
I just wanted to make it a little bit more succinct, a bit more concise.

639
01:21:34,247 --> 01:21:35,127
I'll read it to you guys.

640
01:21:37,088 --> 01:21:46,510
So between the first paragraph and then the section about complying with provisions of state law,

641
01:21:48,231 --> 01:21:48,991
I propose this.

642
01:21:49,832 --> 01:22:03,601
Further, it is contrary to the city of Medford's public policy to participate in the enforcement of another state's civil or criminal law when that law seeks to deny an individual's right to bodily autonomy and criminalize a person's effort to live as their full authentic self.

643
01:22:04,102 --> 01:22:08,024
And thus, the city's resources should not be expended toward that end.

644
01:22:11,447 --> 01:22:11,707
Oh, yes.

645
01:22:18,743 --> 01:22:31,132
So that's my last motion to add that to after the first paragraph.

646
01:22:31,272 --> 01:22:35,855
And accept the rest of the edits from KP Law.

647
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:41,940
And you will email that to the clerk.

648
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:42,500
Yes, yeah.

649
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:42,961
Great.

650
01:22:47,565 --> 01:22:52,607
Okay, shall we do roll call votes on?

651
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:54,108
Oh, we need seconds on all of those.

652
01:22:55,368 --> 01:23:09,374
Okay, seconded on the vice president Collins motion to strike the language from the definition of gender identity.

653
01:23:10,254 --> 01:23:25,941
provided, however, that gender identity may be demonstrated through medical history, care or treatment of the gender identity, consistent and uniform assertion of the gender identity or any other evidence that gender identity is sincerely held as part of a person's core identity and provided further, the gender identity shall not be asserted for any improper purpose.

654
01:23:27,121 --> 01:23:27,922
Do we have a second?

655
01:23:28,122 --> 01:23:29,622
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

656
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:30,943
All in favor?

657
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:31,023
Aye.

658
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:32,324
Aye.

659
01:23:32,904 --> 01:23:33,364
All opposed?

660
01:23:34,004 --> 01:23:34,625
The motion passes.

661
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:41,956
on the motion of Councilor saying to keep the word agent where it was in the original draft.

662
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:49,262
Add officials to the definition of city agent and remove the last phrase, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

663
01:23:49,282 --> 01:23:50,564
All in favor?

664
01:23:50,584 --> 01:23:50,644
Aye.

665
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:52,505
All opposed?

666
01:23:52,745 --> 01:23:53,626
The motion passes.

667
01:23:54,787 --> 01:23:57,510
On the motion of Councilor saying to move

668
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:06,976
the suggested edit of KP law of the second paragraph in the purpose section.

669
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:12,701
To move it and add the paragraph that he read earlier.

670
01:24:14,162 --> 01:24:15,463
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

671
01:24:18,245 --> 01:24:20,467
And to accept the remaining edits.

672
01:24:22,068 --> 01:24:23,069
Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

673
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:24,010
All in favor?

674
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:24,590
Aye.

675
01:24:25,171 --> 01:24:25,731
All opposed?

676
01:24:26,432 --> 01:24:27,133
The motion passes.

677
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:29,176
I have one more motion.

678
01:24:29,216 --> 01:24:29,977
Yes.

679
01:24:30,277 --> 01:24:42,420
I think that the edits that we made today that are different from KP laws are not that big to warrant keeping this in committee for one more month when the circumstances nationally are so dire.

680
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:49,803
And so I and I both you and I are in really frequent communication with KP law about this.

681
01:24:49,823 --> 01:24:55,324
So I think if there are any additional comments, we can get them before our next regular city council meeting.

682
01:24:56,045 --> 01:24:56,825
Additionally, there's

683
01:24:57,361 --> 01:24:59,223
It's going to be three readings on top of that as well.

684
01:24:59,463 --> 01:25:02,166
So really, the process is quite drawn out.

685
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:09,613
And the remaining edits that we might make that we probably won't make to this ordinance are really technical.

686
01:25:10,754 --> 01:25:15,119
And so I would motion to refer this out of committee to our next regular meeting.

687
01:25:16,927 --> 01:25:24,634
on the motion of Councilor Singh to send this to the regular meeting on April 8th, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

688
01:25:25,054 --> 01:25:25,454
All in favor?

689
01:25:25,935 --> 01:25:26,195
Aye.

690
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,156
All opposed?

691
01:25:27,596 --> 01:25:28,397
The motion passes.

692
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:30,539
Great.

693
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:31,960
That's exciting.

694
01:25:34,823 --> 01:25:39,967
And excellent.

695
01:25:41,608 --> 01:25:44,511
We will move forward with this then.

696
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:46,496
Do we have any other motions?

697
01:25:49,222 --> 01:25:50,645
Motion to, well, Councillor Collins.

698
01:25:54,523 --> 01:26:08,728
I just wanted to thank you both for your hard work over many, many months to bring this draft forward and for making sure that this got a lot of attention right now so that we can get it on, get it up for a vote as expeditiously as possible.

699
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:19,752
And I've been really working very hard to make sure that this both captures the spirit of what Medford residents want this to be and also has the protections of being closely aligned with other communities ordinances and state law.

700
01:26:19,872 --> 01:26:20,752
So thank you for your hard work.

701
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:26,917
Thank you to all the community members who reached out to us to hold us to account for working on this.

702
01:26:26,937 --> 01:26:28,679
Appreciate it.

703
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:32,702
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

704
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:35,905
On the motion of Councilor Callahan to adjourn.

705
01:26:35,925 --> 01:26:37,446
Do we have a second?

706
01:26:38,087 --> 01:26:39,768
Seconded by Vice President Collins.

707
01:26:39,888 --> 01:26:40,289
All in favor?

708
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:41,730
All opposed?

709
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:44,632
The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

710
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:45,153
Thank you very much.
