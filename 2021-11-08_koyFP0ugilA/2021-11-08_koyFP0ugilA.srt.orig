[SPEAKER_03]: The time slots that are available are 9 to 1030am or 1030 to noon.

148
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:42,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Masks are required for ages two and up.

149
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:46,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So please take advantage of the Medford Family Network.

150
00:21:48,385 --> 00:22:03,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to wish our Hindu, Sikh, Jains, and Buddhist neighbors a happy Diwali, as the five-day Festival of Lights holiday comes to an end tonight.

151
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:11,698
[SPEAKER_03]: May the light of Diwali remind all of us that from darkness, there is knowledge, wisdom, and truth.

152
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:17,417
[SPEAKER_03]: from division, unity, and from despair, hope.

153
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Blessings to all.

154
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:22,738
[SPEAKER_03]: A few upcoming events and reminders.

155
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:41,223
[SPEAKER_03]: On Wednesday, November 10th, throughout the entire day, our high school humanities students will be listening to presentations from local veterans who will be discussing their experiences serving in the United States Armed Forces.

156
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We are pleased that this annual event is able to return to our classrooms.

157
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:52,163
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor and members of the school committee are welcome to attend.

158
00:22:53,948 --> 00:23:02,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, on Wednesday evening, school committee member Melanie McLaughlin will be the guest speaker for the November CPAC meeting.

159
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:08,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin will present how disability rights align with civil rights.

160
00:23:09,815 --> 00:23:13,437
[SPEAKER_03]: The meeting will be held via Zoom from 6 to 8 p.m.

161
00:23:14,597 --> 00:23:20,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, November is CPAC Awareness Month in Massachusetts.

162
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:30,501
[SPEAKER_03]: CPAC works collaboratively with the school district to help to outline the rights of our special education students and parents.

163
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:37,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to take this opportunity to thank the co-chairs, Ms.

164
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:45,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lorik and all the members of CPAC for their hard work and dedication to Medford CPAC.

165
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:55,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, there will be no school Thursday, November 11th in observance of Veterans Day.

166
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:04,594
[SPEAKER_03]: As my older brother, a career Army veteran often reminds me, Veterans Day is different from Memorial Day.

167
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:11,377
[SPEAKER_03]: While these holidays both honor the military, there is a significant difference between the two.

168
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:18,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Memorial Day honors the men and women who died while serving in the military.

169
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:24,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It honors those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.

170
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:29,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Veterans Day honors all who served in the armed forces.

171
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:41,188
[SPEAKER_03]: We thank all of our veterans, those serving, and those who have served for putting their personal lives on hold to protect the freedoms we all enjoy.

172
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

173
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, superintendent.

174
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:57,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Superintendent, could I ask that in the future when we do our agenda, that report of the superintendent, always that the first item be labeled comments from the superintendent or report, just so that it's clear.

175
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:08,346
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do want to take a minute to say I appreciate the fact that you were one of the panel speakers at our MASC conference.

176
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:10,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I was able to listen in virtually,

177
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:15,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And I must say, it made me feel very proud that we were so well represented.

178
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for being there.

179
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:26,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to thank member Rousseau and member Graham for being there and being part of the resolutions committee.

180
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,375
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks for going down.

181
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:36,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the first now, next order of business is our public health update.

182
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:44,927
[SPEAKER_11]: and we're going to hear from David Murphy and Ms.

183
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:45,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Hines.

184
00:25:48,968 --> 00:25:49,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome.

185
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, members of the committee.

186
00:25:52,329 --> 00:26:04,653
[SPEAKER_06]: When we presented before you a couple of weeks ago, we made reference to the eventual transition of the public health update ultimately being incorporated into the superintendent's report.

187
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:19,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And Miss Hines being available to answer questions when there were specific public health related changes that were occurring, rather than continuing to break our own record for having the head of health services available for all school committee meetings at all times.

188
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:37,519
[SPEAKER_06]: We also said that when there were specific issues that were coming up public health related we would make sure that everyone was present to be available and as it as it happens in this first meeting because of the addition of the vaccination clinics that the science is going to expand upon momentarily, and some of the other.

189
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:49,844
[SPEAKER_06]: the volume of questions that have come in related to some of the public health protocols, we thought it best to put off that transition until your next meeting, which I believe is next week.

190
00:26:49,944 --> 00:27:00,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to just open the public health update with that framing so that you didn't think we were walking back what we had said at the last meeting, but Ms.

191
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:05,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Hines has some new data and information to share with you, and then I'll be happy to take your questions at that point.

192
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:09,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

193
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:15,301
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of positive COVID cases in Medford does seem to be rising for November.

194
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:21,606
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first seven days of October there were 55 cases and already in the first seven days of November there have been 78.

195
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:31,516
[SPEAKER_00]: As has been mentioned, we do have vaccination clinics for the newly approved Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11.

196
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:39,323
[SPEAKER_00]: They're scheduled at the Andrews for this Wednesday from 3 to 7 and on November 20 from 9 to 1, which is a Saturday.

197
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:47,425
[SPEAKER_00]: There are appointments, but there are also 60 walk-in appointments available that don't need to be scheduled before showing up.

198
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have, if you aren't able to make an appointment, please come on in.

199
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:53,369
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 60 slots available both days.

200
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:06,057
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also actively working with the Medford Board of Health to provide additional vaccine clinics for the five to 11 year old population in order to meet the overwhelming interest that has been displayed since the original clinic registration began.

201
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:10,040
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really reassuring to see that so many young students want to get vaccinated.

202
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:25,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of our Medford Public School testing from November 1 to November 5, so last week, our Medford Public School nurses completed 3,815 COVID-19 tests during the first week of November.

203
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:36,305
[SPEAKER_00]: This included 315 pooled surveillance tests where one positive individual was identified for a percent positivity of 0.37% for our surveillance testing program.

204
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:44,812
[SPEAKER_00]: School nurses also saw 18 symptomatic students during the school day who were either able to be tested in the nursing office prior to their dismissal or referred to testing.

205
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:54,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of our surveillance testing program, Medford Public Schools had 13 positive cases among both staff and students for a percent positivity of 0.25% of our entire MPS population.

206
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:02,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Three positives were found in school through symptomatic testing in the nursing office.

207
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:06,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine positives were found outside of our school testing program.

208
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:09,977
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 of our positive individuals were under 12 years old.

209
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:13,978
[SPEAKER_00]: None of our positive individuals were vaccinated against COVID-19.

210
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven positive individuals had known exposure outside of the school setting.

211
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:22,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And six positive individuals came into school while symptomatic.

212
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:31,353
[SPEAKER_00]: The MedBurgh Public School Health Services Department continues to remind students, families, and staff to stay home from school if experienced illness symptoms.

213
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:36,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're fully vaccinated, it is important to stay home and seek PCR testing.

214
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:37,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

215
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:44,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

216
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:52,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved hearing all those numbers can we get them in a document, since I don't you just before the meeting we provided you with that going forward.

217
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,227
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to the transition with respect to the science in person appearance will also make sure that we provide the memo earlier.

218
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:16,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when I was looking at the dashboard today, and I think everybody here has heard from the community, it's from parents, but the number of students quarantining really needs to be on the dashboard.

219
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:20,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want a motion, I'll make a motion unless you will just do it.

220
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:29,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I don't see a reason why we couldn't provide that on the dashboard.

221
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:30,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than, I guess,

222
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:35,086
[SPEAKER_06]: there's more fluctuation.

223
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:51,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we try to keep it as up-to-date as possible, but the most accurate information you'll have is the amount, the volume of quarantining, looking back over the previous week, which I think will essentially achieve that objective of sharing that information, and we're happy to provide it.

224
00:30:52,633 --> 00:31:01,297
[SPEAKER_06]: But the quarantine number fluctuates by the day, and I don't think we could commit to a real-time update on that.

225
00:31:01,788 --> 00:31:19,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I certainly feel like, I mean, I did not visualize what it might look like, but like the number of student quarantine days per week, perhaps, per school, because then you can ignore the fact that a student might have been quarantining Monday, Tuesday, you know.

226
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:24,974
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever you work out, as long as, you know, you'll think it through, and I trust that you can get it to make sense.

227
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:28,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think the information would definitely be provided on a weekly basis.

228
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the only caveat I would put on it is that,

229
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:39,322
[SPEAKER_06]: where the quarantining is concentrated has an impact on what protocols are put in place to support those students.

230
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:45,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we had 80 students quarantine, this wouldn't necessarily be the case, but they were spread out across

231
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:54,748
[SPEAKER_06]: 12 plus grade levels and across eight schools and in all sorts of different areas of each building.

232
00:31:55,328 --> 00:32:12,580
[SPEAKER_06]: The response with respect to some of the provisions that we've said that we will provide to students who are in quarantine would vary significantly than if, you know, God forbid, there should be some type of like super spreader among that particular, excuse me, you know, class or grade level in the school.

233
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,642
[SPEAKER_06]: in which case students that are concentrated in the same area are all all of a sudden on quarantine together.

234
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:20,943
[SPEAKER_06]: That would necessitate a different type of response.

235
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:28,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So provided that we understand that the data can be provided, but there are different inferences that can be drawn or should not be drawn, I don't see that as a problem.

236
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:29,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

237
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:34,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have a question, Member McLaughlin?

238
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:35,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

239
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:35,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

240
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can see the light.

241
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:38,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll move that up.

242
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:42,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the report.

243
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:54,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if it's a question for you folks or for the superintendent to answer, but I know that I've been getting some information that on occasion, students are being quarantined more than once in the course of a month.

244
00:32:55,025 --> 00:33:05,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that we had discussed remote learning as an option, and I'm wondering what the status is on that and whether that's happening for families who are getting quarantined extensively.

245
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:13,056
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I, you're certainly it's certainly true that there have been some students who have been quarantined multiple times.

246
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of why we are addressing each suite of student supports that are provided on a case by case individual basis because

247
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:43,678
[SPEAKER_06]: what might be best for a student in the sort of the prongs of the analysis that we've told all administrators they should be looking at are what is the grade level, what is the content area, what is the particular lessons or instruction that is potentially being missed in contemporaneously because the student is on quarantine.

248
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:53,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And the types of supports that could be provided and when I say types of supports, I mean a live feed into the class some after school support via zoom.

249
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:03,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Additional supports that come in once the student returns those are three distinct types of types of supports that it may be in the best interest of the student.

250
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:13,649
[SPEAKER_06]: could vary depending on whether or not this is the one and only time the student is missing five days, or perhaps this is the second time in a 20 day period that the student is missing five days.

251
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:23,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we've advised principals to work with individual teachers to determine what is in the best interest of that student or group of students in that particular instance.

252
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:26,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't think there's a one size fits all solution to that.

253
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:29,800
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the fact pattern that you identify, Ms.

254
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,662
[SPEAKER_06]: McLaughlin, of a student that is

255
00:34:32,162 --> 00:34:43,352
[SPEAKER_06]: missing successive periods of time or potentially not consecutive, but additional time is something that would have to be taken into account when we determine what type and what level of support the students would receive.

256
00:34:44,854 --> 00:34:45,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

257
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:50,799
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and what is the parent or caregiver engagement on that basis?

258
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:57,606
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, how are the parent and caregiver engaging in that process to ensure that they're involved?

259
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:05,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with every, as with every situation that it has to be robust and it has to be effective communication.

260
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:11,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that that is another piece that we've, we've asked administrators to be cognizant of.

261
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:16,357
[SPEAKER_06]: As with any situation, there could be some variability as well.

262
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:29,064
[SPEAKER_06]: You could imagine a situation in which students at a higher grade level perhaps are having more direct communication with the teacher, with the adjustment counselor, with whoever is involved in providing those supports.

263
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:37,869
[SPEAKER_06]: But looking at each case on a case-by-case basis, the determination has to be made as to how best to engage the family caregiver.

264
00:35:38,784 --> 00:35:54,115
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess in summary, if a family is being quarantined or if a family has a student or child that is being quarantined multiple times and feels that perhaps there's a need for intervention from a remote learning process, or what have you.

265
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:56,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that you're saying it's a case by case basis but

266
00:35:57,712 --> 00:36:04,458
[SPEAKER_08]: To what end is the family pursue that so that they can engage in that process.

267
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:15,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I understand you're saying that the principal and the teacher sort of work together to decide, but how is the family being engaged so that certainly I've had family members that have approached me or written to me to express their concern.

268
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:23,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So, should they be writing to school committee members should they be writing to the principal should they be writing to the superintendent should they be like, what is the process for them.

269
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:27,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that the communication should be pre existing with the teacher.

270
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:33,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there has to be that ongoing dialogue between the teacher and the parent or caregiver.

271
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:47,710
[SPEAKER_06]: at any point, the parent or caregiver feels as though their child is not being provided the supports that they need in that instance, either whether it be their first time being quarantined or their third time being quarantined, they should absolutely reach out to the school principal.

272
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And the principals are prepared for those conversations.

273
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:59,832
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to prevent them to begin with by working with teachers again, but they will, our principals will be responsive if and when those concerns are raised.

274
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:02,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

275
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruscio.

276
00:37:05,046 --> 00:37:06,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

277
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:17,374
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was at the conference this past week, I never missed an opportunity to ask, how on earth are you getting this test and stay thing done?

278
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:33,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a question I asked that not one person could answer, perhaps because it's at a level that a school committee member doesn't typically have access to, but where are you getting your tests from?

279
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:39,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, every day there's another news story about there are no tests, the fact that we can't pump out enough tests.

280
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:46,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find a test when we need tests at home, and we don't have thousands of them laying around at the schools.

281
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:49,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Test and stay, the first word is test.

282
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,008
[SPEAKER_07]: That implies that you can test.

283
00:37:53,569 --> 00:38:02,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And no school committee member that I talked to, and I don't know how many people I asked, it was not two, it was not five, it was more than that,

284
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:03,582
[SPEAKER_07]: had a clue.

285
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:08,263
[SPEAKER_07]: They all trotted out the well, we're just getting it done.

286
00:38:08,283 --> 00:38:14,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And occasionally they would say, well, we're doing it only in the elementary school because we don't have enough.

287
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:24,326
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, if we had one classroom of unvaccinated kids, and we're going to test and stay for five days, we need 100 tests as 20 kids.

288
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:24,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And I

289
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:34,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not asking you to dig into your inventory for the whole district, but 100 tests is a lot of tests.

290
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:41,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just I'm very confused how all these districts say they can do it when nobody can buy tests.

291
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:53,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just I want to be clear that I am not in any way making assumptions about the veracity of assertions made by school committee members elsewhere in the Commonwealth.

292
00:38:54,803 --> 00:39:08,655
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think districts are, I'm very confident that districts are not engaged, generally speaking, in the level or frequency of testing that Medford is.

293
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:10,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a, I think it's a good thing.

294
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:15,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's something that the district has done well under first Ms.

295
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:15,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray and now Ms.

296
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:17,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Hines' leadership and with support of Ms.

297
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:18,824
[SPEAKER_06]: O'Connor and others.

298
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:37,310
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the first and I'll just give any one anecdote, while we're sharing I have conversations similar with administrators and we were, there was a district that was doing both the regular routine surveillance testing and the rapid testing.

299
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,122
[SPEAKER_06]: which most districts are not doing both.

300
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:51,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of the reason they were doing it is that they only had about a 50% participation rate in the regular testing and sporadic participation in the test and stay.

301
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:55,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the supply was not as much of an issue.

302
00:39:55,534 --> 00:40:01,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are districts that are sort of quote, unquote, doing test and stay.

303
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have done, frankly, there have been instances in which tests instead were implemented.

304
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:15,703
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, when we were not as confident as we wanted to be with regard to the identification of close contacts.

305
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:18,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we didn't have a basis to quarantine.

306
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:23,665
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point, it was early in the school year before the supply chain issues really sort of became exacerbated.

307
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:26,786
[SPEAKER_06]: We did test a full class for a full week.

308
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:46,412
[SPEAKER_06]: that was an instance of us practicing test and stay without adopting wholesale the strategy of test and stay, which we don't believe is as reliable, as sustainable, or as safe as the PCR testing that we do through our Tufts partnership.

309
00:40:46,472 --> 00:40:49,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the answer is it's not really happening.

310
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:53,797
[SPEAKER_06]: as commonly as media reports might suggest, number one.

311
00:40:54,617 --> 00:41:12,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as we've said, when we get to the place where the data fully supports that type of transition, if the supply chain issues are not continuing to plague us, then the practice of test and state might be something that would make more sense for Medford than it does right now.

312
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:13,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

313
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:16,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

314
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:16,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Graham?

315
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:19,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

316
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:41,610
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, I guess I would say the other variable that I heard at the conference was from districts that have very high vaccination rates, where then it is tenable to do things that we cannot do here because our vaccination rates just do not support that even at the upper levels where vaccines have been available for some amount of time.

317
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:42,831
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have

318
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:52,490
[SPEAKER_09]: 90% of your kids who just get to the stay part of test and stay, you don't have to test them so that they can stay.

319
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,691
[SPEAKER_09]: They just get to stay.

320
00:41:54,992 --> 00:42:00,075
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not approaching 90% anytime soon that I can see.

321
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:08,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very hopeful and thankful that you all have moved faster than my child's pediatrician's office in not only setting up a clinic, but

322
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:12,964
[SPEAKER_09]: getting shots in arms this week, so thank you for that.

323
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:31,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have a question about once kids are in this like in-between phase where they've received one but not a second vaccination dose, are they stay or are they quarantine if they are identified as close contact?

324
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:37,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you are considered fully vaccinated, which is the two doses and then two weeks after your second dose,

325
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:40,489
[SPEAKER_00]: you would still have to quarantine, unfortunately.

326
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:43,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just wanted to be clear about that.

327
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:56,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I guess the other question that I had for you all is, I've been watching the changes to protocols that you've been rolling out, and you can observe in the data that they are working everywhere but the Roberts.

328
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:06,120
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not seeing the same tick in the data when protocol changes are happening

329
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:13,694
[SPEAKER_09]: in that building, and I'm just wondering why they are not working there in the same way that they are in other buildings.

330
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:26,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would like some information, I think, for parents who are especially frustrated there, parents who are sharing that the things we are saying are happening are not actually happening in the classroom that they are hearing.

331
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,600
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just really confused as to what

332
00:43:29,347 --> 00:43:49,555
[SPEAKER_09]: is going on so uniquely in that building that is causing us to have to keep kids out of school in that building because that to me, it's about the kids being stuck at home without their peers, without their teachers, with their parents, you know, potentially, you know, these same kids could

333
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:52,810
[SPEAKER_09]: could face that in the next five weeks again?

334
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's a fair question.

335
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:56,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say a couple of things.

336
00:43:57,274 --> 00:44:07,141
[SPEAKER_06]: One, we're taking a long, hard look at ensuring that the protocols are being adhered to in every school community.

337
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:16,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we see clusters or concentrations of post contacts or positives, we're doubling down on that and making sure that

338
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:21,336
[SPEAKER_06]: those protocols are being followed and being fully implemented with fidelity.

339
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:22,377
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first point.

340
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:31,744
[SPEAKER_06]: The second point I would say is there are instances when the protocols are followed perfectly and you still get a cluster and a cluster of cases.

341
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:37,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is, you know, the nature of the virus.

342
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:45,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's sometimes there really isn't an explanation other than that's where it got to and it spreads very easily.

343
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some of that, frankly, at the Roberts that I don't think we should discount.

344
00:44:49,765 --> 00:44:53,066
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some just bad coincidences that have occurred.

345
00:44:53,946 --> 00:45:06,531
[SPEAKER_06]: But that doesn't in any way diminish our zealousness with which we will make sure that to go down and go through school by school and take a long, hard look at any places in which there is data that is not favorable.

346
00:45:06,611 --> 00:45:11,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that key in moving forward is

347
00:45:13,938 --> 00:45:25,442
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure that when there are problems, we have robust and effective communication, which will not eliminate all of the types of problems that you're articulating.

348
00:45:26,803 --> 00:45:32,885
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, you know, similar to the testing program, what has worked is instilling public confidence.

349
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:39,147
[SPEAKER_06]: So people feel as though the protocols are there and they know that they're keeping them safe.

350
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's another area that we have to double down on.

351
00:45:42,512 --> 00:45:43,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would agree with that.

352
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:47,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I ask my own kids on a daily basis, how was school?

353
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:49,194
[SPEAKER_09]: What was going on in school?

354
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:56,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And at some point, they can tell you, this is the thing that's happening in my classroom.

355
00:45:57,637 --> 00:46:06,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And often they don't say anything with any particular regard to whether it was the same or not the same as some rule that they don't know about.

356
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,922
[SPEAKER_09]: But my concern is when I hear about parents

357
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:24,223
[SPEAKER_09]: who are hearing from their students that they're doing things that sort of explicitly different than what we've outlined for the community that erodes the trust that I think we really need to have.

358
00:46:24,423 --> 00:46:38,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanna make sure we're not knowingly doing things that keep kids out of school and erode trust in the work that we're doing because I know that you all are working around the clock to keep kids safe

359
00:46:39,606 --> 00:46:52,715
[SPEAKER_09]: to deal with the like, you know, all we heard about at the school committee conference was how dysregulated everybody is parents, you know, adults in the community, kids who have never felt dysregulation before in a significant way.

360
00:46:52,735 --> 00:46:58,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, everyone is feeling this level of dysregulation and we can't fix that if the kids can't come to school.

361
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:07,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make sure that those, that that can start to happen so that we can see that recovery

362
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:10,530
[SPEAKER_09]: start to take hold, especially as vaccine rates rise.

363
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:20,216
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could, Mr. Graham, just to that point, and for purposes of ensuring that the community knows that we're trying to insulate each school community as much as possible.

364
00:47:20,636 --> 00:47:37,167
[SPEAKER_06]: We told the principals a week or so ago that some of the modifications to the lunchtime operations could be rolled back based on the positive data that we were seeing, based on the logistical and instructional detriments that the modified lunch operations

365
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:39,589
[SPEAKER_06]: are creating.

366
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:58,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And, but in doing that we said that the each school had to identify a plan for resuming normal lunch operations with specific criteria around assigned seats supervision of lunch, making sure that that lunch could operate in a way in which any risk was was minimized and.

367
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: All the schools, to my knowledge, have said that they're going to hold off themselves until they are ready to present a plan in which that.

368
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:15,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we expect that will happen in the coming weeks, but it won't happen without the central office signing off on the specific protocols that have been in place.

369
00:48:17,483 --> 00:48:21,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to know central office really wants to be dictating to an individual school how they run lunch.

370
00:48:22,445 --> 00:48:33,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is one of those unique situations in which we have to put that additional scaffolding around operations to make sure that we don't have outliers that could could create unnecessary risk.

371
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:39,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're hoping that those plans come in soon and we're hoping that they will be met with our approval so they can then

372
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:43,131
[SPEAKER_06]: to go back to having normal lunch and normal class and normal everything else.

373
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:49,614
[SPEAKER_06]: But until those protocols, until we know that the protocols are in place at each school, lunch will continue to look a little different.

374
00:48:53,156 --> 00:48:55,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other questions?

375
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:00,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just want to follow up on a member of McLaughlin.

376
00:49:01,261 --> 00:49:08,004
[SPEAKER_10]: She was asking about the supports while the students are quarantining, because this had come up in a few emails that we got.

377
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:16,542
[SPEAKER_10]: So are those supports in place right now, like where students can get the Zoom instruction while they're home?

378
00:49:17,543 --> 00:49:18,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's case by case.

379
00:49:18,725 --> 00:49:21,388
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've put out guidance across the district.

380
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:23,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just use an example from today.

381
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:31,558
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an elementary school in which a class with a significant number of students, I believe it was third grade, had to be quarantined because they were close contacts.

382
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:39,102
[SPEAKER_06]: The principal electronically convened a conversation with some central office administrators, health services administrators, and her own staff.

383
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:53,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And we walked through the steps that would be taken with respect to parent and family communication, with respect to if it made sense in the view of the teacher and the principal to provide a Zoom link for some concurrent instruction with those students.

384
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:59,249
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of cases you'll see just, it'll be a morning meeting, possibly math instruction.

385
00:49:59,949 --> 00:50:06,194
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll again, it'll depend on grade level, it'll depend on content, it'll depend on frankly what's happening in the classroom in that day.

386
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:21,708
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is in place in that we have criteria that we look at and recommendations that we make and an expectation that the principal and the teacher collaborate to make sure that whatever supports are gonna be best for that group of students are in fact afforded to them.

387
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:23,870
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will vary.

388
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:33,995
[SPEAKER_06]: intentionally, so that we don't have a one size fits all the sort of, I think the example we used when we discussed this last time is that last year we had 40% of students who are remote.

389
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:41,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we had to look at it at a very systemic level that the only way to ensure that that instruction was happening was to do it in a more uniform way.

390
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:46,562
[SPEAKER_06]: In this instance, that particular class of six or seven students being quarantined.

391
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:53,488
[SPEAKER_06]: What's best for that group might be different than what's best from a support perspective from the class across the hall.

392
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:58,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't want to in a situation which we're handling this on such a discreet basis.

393
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:07,180
[SPEAKER_06]: The sort of mandating a type of top down approach with respect to support at the same time unless I'll just finish on this.

394
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think we need to look at.

395
00:51:11,212 --> 00:51:39,082
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the strategies and see if there are other broader strategies that potentially using some of the extra funding we can employ for the remainder of the year to make sure that we're not just supporting students in real time when they are quarantined, but that we're building out supports to help students both due to the detriment to their education that the pandemic has caused over the last 18 months and any additional challenges that are posed by quarantines that happened this year.

396
00:51:39,582 --> 00:51:41,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the types of things that we're strategizing about right now.

397
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:43,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

398
00:51:43,746 --> 00:51:45,488
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just have one other question.

399
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:53,497
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to ask, are the students in all grades getting the frequent mass breaks?

400
00:51:53,657 --> 00:51:59,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And are they allowed to have water available to drink if they need to have some water?

401
00:52:00,444 --> 00:52:02,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And this goes for all grades.

402
00:52:02,692 --> 00:52:04,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the answer to that should be yes.

403
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:22,564
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone, if there's instances in which a child is being told that they can't have a bottle or have some water, that's something I would ask that the principal be notified about, because with a few exceptions, perhaps during a testing period, a very limited duration of time, something along those lines, I really can't imagine circumstances under which we wouldn't allow that.

404
00:52:22,584 --> 00:52:26,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a pretty basic public health expectation.

405
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:28,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And then yes to the mass breaks.

406
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:29,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Students are being given mass breaks.

407
00:52:31,137 --> 00:52:33,820
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of classes, a lot of schools.

408
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:42,668
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody, if something happens or something, there's a practice that seems off, that's something that people should raise with their principal's offices, because the principals know what the expectations are.

409
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:43,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

410
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:44,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

411
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Murphy and Ms.

412
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:49,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Hines.

413
00:52:49,412 --> 00:52:51,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Richards.

414
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:53,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we suspend the order of business?

415
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:58,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I was going to ask Mr. Richards whether you'd like to come up and give your presentation.

416
00:52:58,597 --> 00:53:00,779
[SPEAKER_11]: May I ask for a suspension motion, please?

417
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:02,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, motion to suspend the order.

418
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And may I have a second?

419
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:04,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

420
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:05,981
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

421
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:06,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

422
00:53:07,803 --> 00:53:08,323
[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

423
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

424
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:12,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you start, Mr. Richard, I need to read this.

425
00:53:14,183 --> 00:53:17,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Presentations of the public, not to begin before 7 p.m.

426
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:26,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

427
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,411
[SPEAKER_11]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

428
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:37,416
[SPEAKER_11]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for a dialogue with the committee.

429
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:45,844
[SPEAKER_11]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

430
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:55,674
[SPEAKER_11]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH public comments and presentations of the public, which Mr. Richard you clearly did.

431
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,297
[SPEAKER_11]: So, could you please introduce yourself?

432
00:53:58,957 --> 00:53:59,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Say that again.

433
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you please introduce yourself?

434
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:02,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Christopher Richard.

435
00:54:03,681 --> 00:54:04,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening and thank you.

436
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:07,744
[SPEAKER_11]: And your address, Mr. Richard?

437
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:08,284
[SPEAKER_05]: 17 Logan Ave.

438
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:10,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

439
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:14,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, superintendent and school committee members.

440
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:16,310
[SPEAKER_05]: May I pass around some photos?

441
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: There's enough, there's a pack.

442
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:30,940
[SPEAKER_05]: These photos were taken the day of October 27th with the McGlynn Elementary School at the kindergarten classrooms.

443
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a father of a kindergarten student.

444
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to discuss the maintenance issue of the school.

445
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:46,294
[SPEAKER_05]: In my professional life, I'm a superintendent of a large construction company, and I have a background in construction management and in maintenance buildings.

446
00:54:47,753 --> 00:54:59,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I had first learned about these leaks in the kindergarten classrooms when my wife took my son to his screening and there was rugs that were destroyed and ceiling tiles missing in the ceiling and barrels full of all the debris.

447
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:06,569
[SPEAKER_05]: After speaking with numerous people in the building, this has been going on for years now.

448
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:15,316
[SPEAKER_05]: On Wednesday, October 27th, the kindergarten classrooms at the McGlynn Elementary experienced a large amount of water leaking through the ceiling.

449
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:22,123
[SPEAKER_05]: The children actually could not attend their classrooms and all four kindergarten classrooms that morning.

450
00:55:23,644 --> 00:55:25,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that was a large storm.

451
00:55:25,825 --> 00:55:34,371
[SPEAKER_05]: But this has been happening for some time now, to my knowledge, I know of at least three occurrences, including this one that has happened this school year alone.

452
00:55:37,825 --> 00:55:48,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Later that day, when the children were allowed back into the classroom, there was one of the classrooms that actually had smoke coming from one of the light fixtures because the water was infiltrating the lights and smoke was coming out of it.

453
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:53,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So on top of a leak from a ceiling, now we also have a fire hazard now too in the classrooms.

454
00:55:55,757 --> 00:56:00,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very concerned when my son came home and told me that one of his friends had to leave his class because there was smoke in there.

455
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:03,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am assuming that any one of you would feel the same way.

456
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:10,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you're aware that I emailed the superintendents and that's how I got on the agenda to talk today.

457
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:15,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I was told that people are aware of this and dealing with it and I would get updated also.

458
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,816
[SPEAKER_05]: That was 11 days ago and I have not been updated about it at all.

459
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:27,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So I asked the McGlynn staff what has been done and what has been taken care of this issue.

460
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:32,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I was told that an electrician went around and checked all the lights to make sure that they were all still functioning right.

461
00:56:34,987 --> 00:56:43,251
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see from the pictures awful classrooms had damage and evidenced by the discoloration in the ceilings, this has been going on for some time.

462
00:56:45,272 --> 00:56:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing that surprised me and other parents, I spoke to is that the roof leak is not priority to address in these buildings.

463
00:56:54,065 --> 00:57:00,486
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see from photo 14 there, you can see there's black spots on there, which is telltale sign of mold.

464
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:07,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that is spread to the, and that is also spread to the walls if you look at the picture too.

465
00:57:08,188 --> 00:57:15,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of a lack of maintenance with the roof for years, we have a fire hazard and now we have a mold issue and a public health issue for the children.

466
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in Medford.

467
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:24,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I attended the old Medford Public Schools at the Kennedy and the Lincoln, and also to the high school.

468
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:26,598
[SPEAKER_05]: These are new buildings.

469
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,480
[SPEAKER_05]: These buildings are 20 years old.

470
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:40,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of neglect for years, we are creating a problem that will cost us, that will be very costly to fix, and not just slap a Band-Aid on it.

471
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more of a safety issue for the teachers and the students.

472
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,294
[SPEAKER_05]: and assure you that this winter, the problem is gonna persist.

473
00:57:50,816 --> 00:57:58,043
[SPEAKER_05]: My family just moved back to Medford, and in the first three months, I can say that I'm disappointed in the care and the upkeep of the McGlynn School.

474
00:57:59,164 --> 00:58:03,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always considered Medford to be a city of pride, integrity, and community.

475
00:58:04,629 --> 00:58:07,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ask, what is happening to resolve this issue?

476
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:12,216
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the proper chain of command to get these issues addressed?

477
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:16,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Who decides if these issues get resolved or they linger for years?

478
00:58:18,252 --> 00:58:33,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is the person that decides if a kindergarten student is able to learn in a safe and healthy classroom environment or has their day disrupted from its raining out and someone didn't consider fixing a root problem as a priority?

479
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,423
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the time to act now.

480
00:58:36,243 --> 00:58:42,547
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all about the children and the poor conditions that we are leaving our schools and making them unacceptable.

481
00:58:44,786 --> 00:58:45,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

482
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:45,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

483
00:58:45,766 --> 00:58:46,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr Richard.

484
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:58,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Given the concerns expressed by this parent, I'm going to ask that our administration follow up with a report back to the school committee at our next regular meeting, which is next Monday.

485
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:03,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize it's very short timetable, but clearly this is significant.

486
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:04,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

487
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So can we have a motion to have it on the agenda?

488
00:59:09,471 --> 00:59:10,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't make a motion.

489
00:59:10,251 --> 00:59:12,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know I know I'm what you want to make a motion.

490
00:59:12,995 --> 00:59:17,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we have a, I'm making a motion to have this item on the agenda for the next school committee meeting.

491
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

492
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:21,963
[SPEAKER_11]: So motion by Ms.

493

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Richard.

00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:29,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, can I have a motion to resort to the- Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

505
00:59:44,402 --> 00:59:53,573
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll resort to the regular order of business, which is the superintendent goals for school year 2021-2022.

506
00:59:53,933 --> 01:00:00,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Superintendent Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent will report now on her evaluation goals for this school year.

507
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:21,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, and as I report on my goals this evening, I will be reporting on the district improvement goal, our student learning goal, and our professional practice goal for the superintendent.

508
01:00:23,195 --> 01:00:32,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the district improvement goal, given the unprecedented hybrid learning environment during the school year of 2020-2021,

509
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:53,697
[SPEAKER_03]: MPS, Medford Public Schools, will utilize common systems and structures to accurately assess the learning and social emotional needs of students while addressing race, equity, diversity, and inclusion throughout the district.

510
01:00:54,783 --> 01:01:06,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, through professional development, observation and evaluation of staff, we will provide increased support to staff to better meet the needs of all learners.

511
01:01:10,395 --> 01:01:23,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Our key goal of maintaining a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity, and consistency, with the intention of developing a district-wide focus on instruction and assessment,

512
01:01:25,692 --> 01:01:53,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the key actions that are taking place this year have been the following professional development opportunities from social, emotional learning, professional development, implicit bias, professional development, responsive classroom, professional development, race, equity, diversity, and inclusion, professional development.

514
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:20,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Intended outcomes are to have improved cell practices by leadership and staff,

515
01:02:22,345 --> 01:02:36,036
[SPEAKER_03]: tailored instruction to improve student outcomes, targeted feedback for teachers to improve practice, school and district leaders learning and leading together.

516
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:46,244
[SPEAKER_03]: The student learning goal this year has taken a slight shift.

517
01:02:47,846 --> 01:02:48,967
[SPEAKER_03]: My first three years,

518
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a primary focus on elementary mathematics.

519
01:02:53,538 --> 01:03:05,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I am optimistic that with the adoption of a new curriculum, a new program coming at the end of the year, that we will begin to see the needle move in the area of mathematics.

520
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,093
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, we are focusing on early literacy.

521
01:03:12,795 --> 01:03:27,627
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be assessing early literacy skills and implementing interventions in literacy to improve outcomes by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of early literacy practices.

522
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:38,056
[SPEAKER_03]: The key actions, we will support the development and implementation of an effective early literacy program.

524
01:03:54,329 --> 01:04:05,198
[SPEAKER_03]: ECRI implementation will be taking place during tier one ELA blocks in all grades, kindergarten to second grade, district-wide.

525
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:13,086
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a continued partnership with Hill for Literacy throughout the 21-22 school year.

526
01:04:14,587 --> 01:04:25,513
[SPEAKER_03]: This embedded PD model will ensure teachers are getting sustained monthly training and coaching that will enhance and grow their instructional practice.

527
01:04:28,374 --> 01:04:28,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Outcomes.

528

530
01:04:42,899 --> 01:04:48,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Intentional analysis of literacy outcomes at middle of the year and end of year.

531
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:57,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Conduct early literacy learning walks district-wide with a modified protocol to include our five core actions.

532
01:05:00,315 --> 01:05:02,077
[SPEAKER_12]: The professional practice goal

533
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:11,853
[SPEAKER_03]: The new Superintendent Induction Program, NESAP, is now offering consultancy sessions.

534
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:27,440
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to NESAP, MASS, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, is providing a specialized professional development called Leading and Learning Ready Sessions.

535
01:05:30,053 --> 01:05:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: The intention is to further develop skills in strategy development, data analysis, instructional leadership through the use of consultancy protocols.

536
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:55,432
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, through participating in the MASS pioneer cohort of superintendents to lead district level work on racial equity, diversity, and inclusion ready practices.

537
01:05:58,685 --> 01:06:05,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be attending monthly affinity group and monthly equity, diversity and inclusion sessions via Zoom.

538
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:11,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Completing all assignments and or providing timely feedback during consultancy sessions.

539
01:06:12,696 --> 01:06:17,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And consulting with the assigned coaches and or mentors on an as needed basis.

540
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:25,467
[SPEAKER_03]: The outcomes would be to further leverage the expertise and collective knowledge of graduate NISAP superintendents.

541
01:06:27,407 --> 01:06:33,010
[SPEAKER_03]: leading and learning about race, racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion ready.

542
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:44,977
[SPEAKER_03]: A pilot superintendent leadership practice network to support DESE with future statewide initiatives that can be implemented in Medford.

543
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:48,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are my goals for this evening, this year.

544
01:06:49,059 --> 01:06:50,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, superintendent.

545
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any questions for the superintendent?

546
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:54,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

547
01:06:55,143 --> 01:06:55,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

548
01:06:57,062 --> 01:07:03,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you, Superintendent for defining these goals and for focusing on equity, diversity and inclusion.

549
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:05,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is really critical.

550
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:15,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering for the monthly meetings, do they include for the MASS, do they include particularly around the inclusion piece and diversity?

551
01:07:16,356 --> 01:07:20,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there diverse representation and for the inclusion aspect or have they started yet?

552
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know?

553
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:31,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I've attended already one session with the MSS ready group, and it is a pioneer cohort of 2425 superintendents, and it's actually.

554
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:47,599
[SPEAKER_03]: The 25 superintendents that are involved our superintendents and or equity directors or assistant superintendents across the state.

555
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:57,447
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 of them by Park superintendents, people that identify as people of color, and 12 are white superintendents that identify as allies.

556
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:05,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And the professional development is being led by Dr. Leigh Teitel and Dr. Darnisa Amante-Jackson.

557
01:08:06,113 --> 01:08:12,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they have the cohort together as a combined cohort, and then they break out.

558
01:08:12,717 --> 01:08:18,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are doing race, equity, diversity, and inclusion work during those sessions.

559
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:19,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

560
01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:25,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you, I took an equity session with Dr. Leigh Teitel and Dr. Darnisa Amante at the ed school three years ago.

561
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:27,127
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are the most fantastic

562
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:32,843
[SPEAKER_08]: group of people to be doing this so what an excellent opportunity for you and the other superintendents I'm super excited for you.

563
01:08:33,323 --> 01:08:34,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

564
01:08:34,104 --> 01:08:34,504
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

565
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:38,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say that it was a competitive process, and I was glad that I succeeded.

566
01:08:40,107 --> 01:08:40,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

567
01:08:40,808 --> 01:08:44,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to the learning that I will have that will happen this year.

568
01:08:48,348 --> 01:08:48,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

569
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:53,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really happy to see that early literacy is the student learning goal.

570
01:08:54,611 --> 01:08:58,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Had it been anything else, we would be here for a lot longer tonight.

571
01:08:59,933 --> 01:09:09,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the blue section at the top, there's by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of early literacy practices.

572
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any problem with the intent.

573
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, knowledge and practice are

574
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:32,476
[SPEAKER_07]: worlds apart in human nature, and knowing that our teachers and principals have the knowledge, to me just feels very baby steps, really.

575
01:09:33,497 --> 01:09:45,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of us have knowledge that we should be doing vigorous exercise three to four or five times a week, and we should be not eating all this other stuff, and like 99% of us are doing everything that we're not supposed to be doing.

576
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:46,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowledge isn't the problem.

577
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:52,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wonder if we can't find a more strong way of phrasing that to get beyond knowledge.

578
01:09:53,110 --> 01:10:00,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowledge obviously is really important, but I mean, knowledge, if knowledge is the goal, that doesn't help students.

579
01:10:01,355 --> 01:10:11,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know, I'm not suggesting an edit right now, but just some way to strengthen that sentence to be clear that them knowing doesn't mean it's a check mark.

580
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:16,050
[SPEAKER_07]: it's that the student literacy is impacted, so.

581
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:17,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Would knowledge and practice?

582
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:20,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

583
01:10:23,014 --> 01:10:26,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think that's, I like measurable things for sure.

584
01:10:26,637 --> 01:10:33,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I, I don't feel the need to edit this right now, because I don't feel like we're going to get this done tonight.

585
01:10:34,121 --> 01:10:35,242
[SPEAKER_07]: At least that's my preference.

586
01:10:38,724 --> 01:10:39,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a suggestion.

587
01:10:39,645 --> 01:10:41,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to work on wordsmithing.

588
01:10:42,707 --> 01:10:42,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

589
01:10:46,907 --> 01:10:48,228
[SPEAKER_12]: under student learning goal will.

590
01:10:50,049 --> 01:10:54,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So would you like to lay this on the table until you come back with new wording?

591
01:10:55,453 --> 01:10:57,234
[SPEAKER_11]: How would you like to do?

592
01:10:57,594 --> 01:11:03,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Can maybe we all talk about our comments before we do that?

593
01:11:03,398 --> 01:11:03,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

594
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:04,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

595
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:07,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Rousseau, did you have anything else?

596
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:10,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at the moment.

597
01:11:10,502 --> 01:11:10,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

598
01:11:12,389 --> 01:11:26,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had a couple of things and I think, overall, they all speak to what my desire to have the outcomes listed the observable or measurable in some way so.

599
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:39,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's especially difficult when we talk about the school committee evaluating you, which is what this is for, about things that we really are not supposed to know about.

600
01:11:39,655 --> 01:11:52,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, how you evaluate your teachers is not, or what evaluations you issue to your teachers, like beyond what is in the contract, by law, we're really not supposed to be involved in those day-to-day operations.

601
01:11:52,933 --> 01:12:01,117
[SPEAKER_09]: However, like those two things, you know, evaluating you is very connected to how you operate the district.

602
01:12:01,177 --> 01:12:16,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it would be helpful if we, if you just thought a little bit about the outcomes to make them a little bit more, I don't want to say tactical because I don't think it's a tactical thing, but a little bit more,

603
01:12:19,103 --> 01:12:23,385
[SPEAKER_09]: like actionable so that we can understand what those things are.

604
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:25,906
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can give you a couple of examples that jumped out at me.

605
01:12:27,007 --> 01:12:30,729
[SPEAKER_09]: When we say improved SEL practices under the district improvement goal,

606
01:12:32,218 --> 01:12:40,442
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, when you say you're gonna improve something, you know what it is today, and then you see some change for the better in the future.

607
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:49,306
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I were having to evaluate you on whether these practices improved, I don't know how to do that yet.

608
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:51,527
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think you do.

609
01:12:51,547 --> 01:13:00,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it needs to be made more clear when we talk about outcomes, what you mean by that, so that we all can be evaluating you fairly when the time comes.

610
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:07,835
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of other places where I thought there was opportunity for that targeted feedback for teachers to improve practice.

611
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:12,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I think feedback is critically important to the process.

612
01:13:12,599 --> 01:13:16,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And the question becomes, how do we know you've provided feedback?

613
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:21,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do we all know that the feedback was

614
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:26,369
[SPEAKER_09]: like internalized and put back into practice.

615
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,951
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't, you know, again, I don't have an answer and I don't think you need to answer tonight how we do that.

616
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:46,618
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's an important part of this conversation so that we can know then when it comes time to do your evaluation, this is what we said that would look like and it happened and we could see that and therefore this is how we feel about that piece.

617
01:13:47,138 --> 01:14:13,950
[SPEAKER_09]: The other place where I thought on the district improvement goal, two other suggestions that I had was with all of this map assessment happening, it's my impression that you will come back to us at multiple points in the year and tell us about the data at a subgroup level and that we sort of naturally would expect to see over the course of a school year that change over time.

618
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:15,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So the results change over time.

619
01:14:16,424 --> 01:14:26,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a really actionable way for us to say, yes, we expected to see an improvement from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, and we were able to see it in the data.

620
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:32,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that data looks like because we've never seen it before, but I think you do and your staff does.

621
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:34,789
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can just think about like, what would that look like?

622
01:14:34,829 --> 01:14:39,671
[SPEAKER_09]: What would that thing be that would help us say that this investment

623
01:14:40,396 --> 01:14:46,503
[SPEAKER_09]: in map is helping us drive student you know drive the student outcomes in the overall district improvement, I think would be great.

624
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:49,426
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that came to my mind as I listened.

625
01:14:50,926 --> 01:14:58,469
[SPEAKER_09]: on this particular topic was a few years back, you provided a list of all the assessments being done across the district.

626
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,730
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a huge list.

627
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:07,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember just feeling sort of overwhelmed at the number of assessments in addition to MCAS that are happening across the district.

628
01:15:08,594 --> 01:15:13,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we've added MAP in a really intensive way for many, many grades.

629
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:19,839
[SPEAKER_09]: A rationalization of our overall assessment protocol would be a really actionable way to say,

630
01:15:20,939 --> 01:15:49,750
[SPEAKER_09]: we have improved our practice here in the district around how we assess because I and I think you know one of the things that was striking about the MCAS presentation we just had was when you have a curriculum that works for you maybe you get to do less maybe you get the luxury of having to do less assessment to figure out where are you then then you did when you had a curriculum that didn't work for you so how do we take advantage of all of that and how do we really think about

631
01:15:50,710 --> 01:16:06,536
[SPEAKER_09]: what assessment is necessary in order to help give teachers the data that they need to do their work in the classroom without being a district that just does a different assessment flavor of the week constantly across time.

632
01:16:06,676 --> 01:16:10,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are a couple of suggestions I had on the district improvement side.

633
01:16:11,397 --> 01:16:18,080
[SPEAKER_09]: On the early literacy side, I think again, same kinds of comments, like what, when we talk about,

634
01:16:19,497 --> 01:16:21,259
[SPEAKER_09]: analysis of literacy outcome?

635
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:27,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we, you know, are we talking about some sort of like, percent of like progress that we've made?

636
01:16:27,143 --> 01:16:32,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like, what is it that will help us understand that we're made that we are achieving the goals?

637
01:16:34,129 --> 01:16:45,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the, you know, I think one of the things that's always been like, one of the more awesome things in my mind that that you all are doing now that did not used to happen in the district is the learning walks.

638
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:46,760
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think beyond

639
01:16:47,839 --> 01:16:58,621
[SPEAKER_09]: knowing that learning walks are happening or being able to attend one here or there, that we have the full appreciation for like the work you are doing to evaluate during the learning walks.

640
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:07,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there was a way for you to describe that, like, you know, I did learning walks at the beginning of the year and the end of the year, and this is what I saw that was different.

641
01:17:08,383 --> 01:17:14,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Those would all be things that to me would make this outcome section much easier to digest.

642
01:17:15,905 --> 01:17:23,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are just my thoughts, but I think it's going to take you some time to figure out how to shift that around, which is why I wanted to wait.

643
01:17:24,008 --> 01:17:24,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Graham.

644
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:27,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there anybody else who wanted to comment?

645
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,950
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to thank you.

646
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:36,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you to Member Graham for her comments, because there was one I wanted to make, and I have it on a different version of this.

647
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:40,008
[SPEAKER_07]: So I get very concerned about average.

648
01:17:40,528 --> 01:17:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: When we talk about averages, you don't have it in here, but around literacy, and again, I don't know how the metrics are laid out in the literacy area, but if we just look at averages, we can have

649
01:17:59,536 --> 01:18:03,697
[SPEAKER_07]: high-end numbers really skewing averages.

650
01:18:04,278 --> 01:18:22,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, if all the students were laid out in quartiles and their ability to read, you could make it all look rosy by moving those people at the top way up, but they're the least needy as far as reading instruction.

651
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:25,386
[SPEAKER_07]: because they were the ones that were already gonna get a lot better.

652
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:34,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just make, to make sure that like the kids in the bottom 20%, those are the ones that need to move the most.

653
01:18:35,612 --> 01:18:38,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's my concern around averages.

654
01:18:38,874 --> 01:18:52,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, finding a way to include that in the outcome so that we know that we really focused on the students with the greatest need, not that the average just moved in a good direction.

655
01:18:53,461 --> 01:19:00,747
[SPEAKER_07]: which could mean that, but it also could mean that those that were above average in reading just got really good.

656
01:19:02,188 --> 01:19:07,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just my comment around trying to find some way to word that into outcomes before we approve these.

657
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:24,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to respond to say that with some of the data, when it comes to the evaluation time, I will do the same thing as attaching multiple hyperlinks that actually show proof or evidence of it.

658
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:30,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, because we just made this significant investment in the NWEA map.

659
01:19:30,377 --> 01:19:38,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like year one, where we just were in the process of getting baseline preliminary data.

660
01:19:38,543 --> 01:19:58,771
[SPEAKER_03]: which was why I had said that I would be including middle of year and end of year not knowing what that data is going to look like but with the expectation with all of the enhanced and added intentional moves that are happening right now in the area of early literacy that I would love to see the work

661
01:19:59,651 --> 01:20:09,359
[SPEAKER_03]: The professional developments that's taking place, and then looking at the assessment data, the in house assessment data to say, are we seeing the needle move in the right direction.

662
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,921
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're definitely.

663
01:20:12,022 --> 01:20:23,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not want to go and say, it's going to be 10% when it could be 5% across the board, it could be 25%, because we've never had an internal system before.

664
01:20:24,392 --> 01:20:42,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I've been here, we've always dealt with the MCAS, so I'm actually very excited about that investment to finally have internal data to look at to help further guide and point us in the direction to achieve increased outcomes for all of our learners.

665
01:20:43,513 --> 01:21:01,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And in light of the way we were doing the learning walks before, I've been talking with the administrators and directors about how will the walks look this year, where we had much larger groups observing instruction.

666
01:21:02,379 --> 01:21:09,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're gonna think about it and do the work where we're not having five people potentially walk into a classroom,

667
01:21:10,342 --> 01:21:34,557
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, how could we still go through the experience of a walk, but with a much smaller group of people, while we're still in this, you know, almost post pandemic era, but that so that is something that we haven't formally started doing the walks but how we can go in to look at what it is that we expect to see.

668
01:21:35,058 --> 01:21:36,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be.

669
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:53,703
[SPEAKER_03]: actively out there in classrooms and looking at all of these things and documenting what we see, and I will definitely have data by the end of the year to really share to say these, this is what the data says and be able to say okay, now we have

670
01:21:54,653 --> 01:22:06,318
[SPEAKER_03]: one year of implementation, what our data looks like, so that I think moving into next year, we'd be able to say, oh, we made this percentage of growth over the course of one year.

671
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:16,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how much more growth we can make the following year and give a more measurable goal based on the data that's in front of us.

672
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, member Graham.

673
01:22:19,761 --> 01:22:36,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think when I think that's really fair given that it's a new tool so what I would suggest that the outcome is twofold then to me in my mind, it is that we are going to spend this year creating a baseline, and that we would expect to see.

674
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:48,142
[SPEAKER_09]: a reasonable improvement in student performance from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, knowing that we don't know what that number can be.

675
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:51,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're also still in the middle of a global pandemic.

676
01:22:51,523 --> 01:23:05,686
[SPEAKER_09]: So to say, like, I'm personally fine with there not being a number associated with it, but an overall expectation that we are going to see progress, I think is important to write down on paper so that we all know that that's what we're looking for.

677
01:23:05,706 --> 01:23:08,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, totally fine with

678
01:23:09,648 --> 01:23:24,880
[SPEAKER_09]: explicitly stating that part of what we're doing this year is creating an actual baseline that we can then use as we go forward because that's a really important implementation step and if we skip that, we'll always be in this like, did we move forward?

679
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we not?

680
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Which number are we operating against?

681
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:31,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would like to avoid that if we can.

682
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:37,850
[SPEAKER_09]: So doing those two things in terms of outcomes, I think makes it much more actionable for us to evaluate you at the end of the year.

683
01:23:39,263 --> 01:23:55,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'm hearing is that the committee strongly supports the direction that the superintendent has laid out for us and that with the constructive feedback that was given tonight, we'd like you to bring it back to us with some refinements.

684
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:56,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that so?

685
01:23:56,969 --> 01:23:57,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

686
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:58,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that agreeable?

687
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to table?

688
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:00,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to lay on the table.

689
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:01,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

690
01:24:02,251 --> 01:24:02,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

691
01:24:03,552 --> 01:24:04,152
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

692
01:24:04,612 --> 01:24:04,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

693
01:24:04,852 --> 01:24:04,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

694
01:24:06,193 --> 01:24:06,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

695
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:11,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I should say, all opposed.

696
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:16,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, okay, thank you very much, Superintendent.

697
01:24:17,283 --> 01:24:24,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the next order of business is a school year 21-22 MPS priority capital projects.

698
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:38,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, David Murphy, will report on specific capital repair projects queued for SY21-22 throughout the district, completed, currently underway, or forthcoming.

699
01:24:45,045 --> 01:24:46,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

700
01:24:47,427 --> 01:24:59,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So as the agenda suggests, this report is frankly a very high level summary of our capital repair projects in the 21-22 school year.

701
01:24:59,976 --> 01:25:09,724
[SPEAKER_06]: In the document that was provided to you today and is available as a handout for this meeting, there are essentially three columns and I'll, I think they'll be on the screen momentarily.

702
01:25:11,668 --> 01:25:27,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Those three columns are projects that have been completed starting from the right, projects that are in progress as we speak, and projects that are at various stages of planning or development, or frankly, prioritization.

703
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:38,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that was the key point that I wanted to make tonight, that this is not a list of things that I would anticipate will with certainty be completed in the course of this year.

704
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:55,128
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you remember in September, I came before you with a request for the use of funding from the previously allocated capital repair budget for the virtual network repairs that needed to be completed.

705
01:25:57,229 --> 01:26:03,292
[SPEAKER_06]: That project is in process right now, but we anticipate it will be somewhere in the vicinity of $160,000.

706
01:26:03,353 --> 01:26:04,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And it got on the agenda in September,

707
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:15,583
[SPEAKER_06]: because we had a planned power outage in order to repair the transformer, which is referenced in the column on the far right.

708
01:26:16,303 --> 01:26:24,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the course of rebooting the system, there was a period of time in which it was not clear that the system was going to fully reboot.

709
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:37,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our IT staff and our external engineers advised us that this repair project, which had been forecasted in multiple budget cycles previously, needed to be

710
01:26:38,775 --> 01:26:43,180
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially executed immediately so as to avoid that type of risk.

711
01:26:44,581 --> 01:27:01,779
[SPEAKER_06]: In light of that, and I think just as a good practice, even though most of these bullet points are things that you have seen before that we've discussed either at the Buildings and Grants Subcommittee or most of them here before the Full School Committee, I did just want to detail all of these to make sure that everyone is aware of

712
01:27:02,701 --> 01:27:11,707
[SPEAKER_06]: the capital repair projects that we know about and that we are prioritizing and that we need to address in the near future for the most part.

713
01:27:12,768 --> 01:27:17,411
[SPEAKER_06]: In the event, there are issues that do have to come up again urgently.

714
01:27:17,431 --> 01:27:30,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't wanna be before you asking to spend $160,000 for something that we have not had the opportunity to discuss, at least to some extent beyond just the normal budgetary process when we list out all of our

715
01:27:30,784 --> 01:27:31,445
[SPEAKER_06]: our priorities.

716
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:40,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, in the column on the far left, which is the obviously the longest list and the one that are issues that we need to get into in the coming weeks and months.

717
01:27:41,352 --> 01:27:46,196
[SPEAKER_06]: There is not a specific prioritization list provided right now.

718
01:27:47,057 --> 01:27:54,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because frankly as we've had conversations and for myself in this role just a little over a year, and looking back at some of the previous conversations.

719
01:27:56,356 --> 01:28:07,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And how we're going to prioritize this I think really does have to be incorporated into the broader context of our capital repair projects in the future of some of our infrastructure, including our flagship school.

720
01:28:08,111 --> 01:28:12,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that is a maybe slightly verbose way of saying that.

721
01:28:14,749 --> 01:28:32,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unlikely we are going to recommend major investments in infrastructure that we think may have a short shelf life, but that requires obviously a broader discussion, both here with the school committee and with the community at large so that is the context in which we're presenting this.

722
01:28:33,869 --> 01:28:35,270
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some items on this list.

723
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:43,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that members of the community spoke earlier this evening about some of the leaking problems on the elementary side at the McGlynn School.

724
01:28:43,092 --> 01:28:46,214
[SPEAKER_06]: That is certainly something that we are actively looking at right now.

725
01:28:46,234 --> 01:29:00,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some engineering tests that are being conducted to ensure that what happened as a result of the Nor'easter, and as I understand it happened in previous storms, doesn't happen again.

726
01:29:01,366 --> 01:29:15,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that it goes without saying that what the students being moved out of those rooms, students being moved out of any rooms is completely unacceptable and infrastructure should never serve as a deterrent or a disruption to students' education.

727
01:29:15,696 --> 01:29:20,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is one of several items that is being prioritized here.

728
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:24,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Other items, as you know, because we've had some lengthy discussions about,

729
01:29:25,123 --> 01:29:29,969
[SPEAKER_06]: There are strategic considerations that have to take be taken into account over the course of the next year.

730
01:29:30,529 --> 01:29:39,900
[SPEAKER_06]: That's certainly true with the McLean play school issue as well as the locker room issue at the high school that I know a number of community members and members of the committee have expressed.

731
01:29:40,445 --> 01:29:56,183
[SPEAKER_06]: concerns about if I were to look at this list and say, what are the things that are most likely to come before you with a request for authorization in the very near future, I would say, the high school electrical generator.

732
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:02,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also say I should have put check marks next to them because I knew I was going to get to this point in the presentation.

733
01:30:03,223 --> 01:30:19,717
[SPEAKER_06]: The NutriKids point of sale devices, the server replacements at Brooks, Mississippi, and Roberts, and most likely the security enhancements at the high school and some other places will be things that I think are unavoidable with respect to this year.

734
01:30:20,117 --> 01:30:25,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not to say there won't be other items that are addressed, but there's some of them that we just need a little more information before we can

735
01:30:25,922 --> 01:30:42,735
[SPEAKER_06]: incorporate them into a broader strategic plan with respect to infrastructure, which, as we said in the budget process last year, is a key goal for this year to be able to identify a timeline and a cycle that we can work with the procurement office of the city to ensure that these issues are being addressed in a systemic way.

736
01:30:44,316 --> 01:30:45,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to take any questions.

737
01:30:46,578 --> 01:30:49,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

738
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:49,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Berkshaw?

739
01:30:50,081 --> 01:30:50,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

740
01:30:51,462 --> 01:30:52,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that we have a list.

741
01:30:52,943 --> 01:30:54,284
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good to see.

742
01:30:56,228 --> 01:31:02,299
[SPEAKER_07]: What is MHS security enhancements is actually it was it's one of those things you can't tell me unless we're an executive session, more or less.

743
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I won't ask more on that.

744
01:31:08,165 --> 01:31:10,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I will make my obligatory statement as I do when it comes up.

745
01:31:10,606 --> 01:31:12,966
[SPEAKER_06]: The building is secure, students are safe, staff are safe.

746
01:31:13,346 --> 01:31:24,349
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there are some specific enhancements that we'd like to consider, like you would consider, that is a permissible purpose under Massachusetts law for an executive session that would be my recommendation.

747
01:31:24,809 --> 01:31:25,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

748
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:28,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a little, oh, this is McGlynn, I'm sorry.

749
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:35,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I was misreading and thought it was a suggestion we were gonna do AC at the high school, which isn't on this list and shouldn't be on this list right now.

750
01:31:35,592 --> 01:31:36,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at this high school.

751
01:31:37,118 --> 01:31:38,139
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my point, yes.

752
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:39,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I misread that.

753
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,642
[SPEAKER_07]: But a high school might be something.

754
01:31:40,742 --> 01:31:42,864
[SPEAKER_07]: A high school, yes.

755
01:31:43,344 --> 01:31:46,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have any other questions then, because the rest is explanatory.

756
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:52,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham?

757
01:31:55,076 --> 01:32:00,162
[SPEAKER_09]: A few years back now, the committee went through this process

758
01:32:01,065 --> 01:32:04,166
[SPEAKER_09]: that was the first time I had seen them do it.

759
01:32:04,186 --> 01:32:05,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually predated me.

760
01:32:05,387 --> 01:32:15,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's definitely a few years back that they outlined like over the course of five years, what were the projects and when did they think that they would happen?

761
01:32:16,011 --> 01:32:19,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And what was the estimated cost?

762
01:32:19,992 --> 01:32:25,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that document, I think the intention was that we might look at it on an annual basis.

763
01:32:25,914 --> 01:32:27,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And we really haven't since.

764
01:32:28,432 --> 01:32:29,194
[SPEAKER_09]: for lots of reasons.

765
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:33,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to see us do that again, maybe in January.

766
01:32:35,901 --> 01:32:43,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think, February, I'm this is this is step one of that but I agree, we need a timeline, we need estimated costs.

767
01:32:43,589 --> 01:32:52,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and we need to be very clear and communicating with the community that these issues are on our radar, and what we think is realistic in terms of eventually presenting them.

768
01:32:52,378 --> 01:32:55,901
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I would add is there will always be competing priorities.

769
01:32:56,061 --> 01:32:59,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So, while I think getting back to that process is imperative.

770
01:32:59,985 --> 01:33:12,940
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have to take into account that it's not static and that you as a committee and we as an administration will have to continue that constructive dialogue, similar to what we did when the virtual infrastructure move move very rapidly to the front of the list.

771
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,724
[SPEAKER_06]: My hope is that we can do it in a more thoughtful way so we minimize the times where that happens.

772
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:17,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, agree.

773
01:33:17,906 --> 01:33:18,386
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think

774
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:26,732
[SPEAKER_09]: From a timing perspective, I would like to see us do this early enough in the year that it predates budget season.

775
01:33:28,253 --> 01:33:36,760
[SPEAKER_09]: For many reasons what you know, especially right now there's all these different funding sources in play that are not normally in play.

776
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:55,929
[SPEAKER_09]: through whether it's ARP or ESSER and they all have rules but I think it's also critically important for the mayor to have that information at her fingertips as she thinks about how the budget will support schools this year and all of the other priorities she has to balance.

777
01:33:55,949 --> 01:34:03,232
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I just wanna make sure in this particular regard when we talk about capital funds, we're ahead of the budget cycle.

778
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:07,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna see us do the budget much sooner than we ever have before.

779
01:34:08,019 --> 01:34:08,379
[SPEAKER_09]: as well.

780
01:34:08,419 --> 01:34:26,871
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think in this regard, I think having that plan and committing to that on an annual basis will get us out of the habit of having to do the emergency things that we find ourselves doing because we have not, I think to the residents point earlier tonight, have not maintained our buildings the way they should.

781
01:34:27,632 --> 01:34:29,933
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is to me a step in that direction.

782
01:34:30,033 --> 01:34:35,857
[SPEAKER_09]: The other step being appropriating enough money to the maintenance budget that we can actually do those things proactively instead of

783
01:34:36,467 --> 01:34:38,108
[SPEAKER_09]: costing more money to react to them.

784
01:34:38,168 --> 01:34:45,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to see us do this in January because then that clearly gets us out of the way of the budget season, I think.

785
01:34:46,392 --> 01:34:47,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with that.

786
01:34:47,593 --> 01:34:51,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just add two sort of minor points that I don't think in any way contradict your statement, Ms.

787
01:34:51,335 --> 01:34:51,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Graham.

788
01:34:51,695 --> 01:35:04,581
[SPEAKER_06]: One, community members should know that generally speaking, these priorities are addressed in a separate lane than our operating budget.

789
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:05,362
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the sort of-

790
01:35:05,822 --> 01:35:13,085
[SPEAKER_06]: the most fundamental distinction that I know members of the committee are very familiar with is between maintenance and capital.

791
01:35:13,385 --> 01:35:15,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has to do with the duration of time.

792
01:35:15,786 --> 01:35:16,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the investment.

793
01:35:16,926 --> 01:35:18,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the source of funding.

794
01:35:18,586 --> 01:35:24,028
[SPEAKER_06]: These are capital priorities, generally speaking, not operating budget priorities.

795
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:34,072
[SPEAKER_06]: The second thing I would just say is that to that point about maintenance, we have a maintenance staff that works diligently to do everything they can with what they're given.

796
01:35:34,773 --> 01:35:46,835
[SPEAKER_06]: to make sure that the buildings are maintained as properly as possible, but we are talking about a different level of prioritization that has to happen with the committee

797
01:35:47,334 --> 01:36:05,039
[SPEAKER_06]: and with the community and with the leadership to make sure that we're investing in a way that positions those responsible for maintaining the buildings to keep them running and operating the way that they should, which to the point earlier, should not include students being moved out of the classroom because of a leak.

798
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,560
[SPEAKER_06]: It's completely unacceptable.

799
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:07,560
[SPEAKER_06]: We recognize that.

800
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:11,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something that we're trying to improve on.

801
01:36:12,122 --> 01:36:12,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

802
01:36:12,802 --> 01:36:13,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

803
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:15,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

804
01:36:17,823 --> 01:36:27,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I go on, I just asked, neither the superintendent nor I received copies of the pictures that Mr. Richard, if one of you could let us have those.

805
01:36:28,876 --> 01:36:29,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

806
01:36:29,496 --> 01:36:29,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

807
01:36:34,368 --> 01:36:46,574
[SPEAKER_11]: The next order of business is Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Family School Partnership Initiative, FSPI.

808
01:36:46,674 --> 01:36:57,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford School Committee will entertain a summary and discussion of the themes and findings of the audit report on family and community engagement through the FSPI that was issued in the spring of 2021.

809
01:36:57,559 --> 01:36:58,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And our committee member.

810
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:06,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

811
01:37:06,599 --> 01:37:25,673
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a report that is from an initiative that was created last year in partnership with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as a family school partnership initiative, spring of 2021 so partnership with several school districts met for was chosen after we applied to the process.

812
01:37:27,702 --> 01:37:33,144
[SPEAKER_08]: And they worked with a consultant to give us some feedback on family and community engagement.

813
01:37:33,164 --> 01:37:38,787
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna be reading from my phone just because it's easier than the small print on this PowerPoint.

814
01:37:39,487 --> 01:37:51,972
[SPEAKER_08]: But the initiative was again, in June, 2021, an opportunity for districts to look at the family school and community partnership fundamentals, which are available on the DESE website.

815
01:37:52,332 --> 01:37:54,393
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about building family and community engagement

816
01:37:55,075 --> 01:38:00,737
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's some guiding practices that they have around family and community engagement using that partnership fundamental.

817
01:38:01,357 --> 01:38:10,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And through the process, they created several groups in order to get some feedback on family and community engagement in Medford.

818
01:38:11,121 --> 01:38:18,184
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had four focus groups specifically that they worked with, which were number one was family members slash caregivers.

819
01:38:18,284 --> 01:38:20,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two was students grades eight to 12.

820
01:38:21,792 --> 01:38:25,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Three was teachers and frontline staff, and four was school and district leadership.

821
01:38:26,056 --> 01:38:28,257
[SPEAKER_08]: And they wanted to identify three priorities.

822
01:38:28,358 --> 01:38:30,820
[SPEAKER_08]: What was working well in family and community engagement?

823
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,842
[SPEAKER_08]: What innovations did we have during the pandemic period?

824
01:38:34,303 --> 01:38:38,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And what opportunities did we have to build upon family and community engagement?

825
01:38:39,861 --> 01:38:56,995
[SPEAKER_08]: So the family member caregiver feedback group said that the pandemic really highlighted teamwork among teachers and family members caregivers, because of I imagine remote learning among other things, but that that dropped off substantially after the return to school.

826
01:38:57,836 --> 01:39:01,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Family caregivers felt there was a huge benefit in knowing what their child was working on.

827
01:39:02,379 --> 01:39:10,344
[SPEAKER_08]: They felt listened to they felt like they were partners in the process and would like to see a better approach to orienting parents to the districts initially.

828
01:39:10,364 --> 01:39:15,388
[SPEAKER_08]: They also parent and family caregivers have strong ideas about professional development.

829
01:39:17,168 --> 01:39:28,698
[SPEAKER_08]: and they felt that they were asked for feedback on a regular basis last year, particularly, but then felt that their feedback was dismissed and they wanted more acknowledgement of diversity in the community.

830
01:39:29,358 --> 01:39:40,367
[SPEAKER_08]: The second subgroup, eight through 12 grade students, their feedback generally from the focus group was that they did not feel like there were positive relationships for the students.

831
01:39:40,448 --> 01:39:41,528
[SPEAKER_08]: The students felt left out.

832
01:39:42,441 --> 01:39:46,082
[SPEAKER_08]: They said multicultural backgrounds were not included from their perspective.

833
01:39:47,822 --> 01:39:53,864
[SPEAKER_08]: They want teachers to reach out to their families to say when things are going well, not just when things aren't.

834
01:39:54,464 --> 01:40:04,706
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted to see family training on technology and they felt language translation was an issue because of the overuse of Google for a translation tool.

835
01:40:05,326 --> 01:40:11,988
[SPEAKER_08]: They also felt there was a lack of responsiveness from feedback among family and caregivers and students.

836
01:40:12,515 --> 01:40:12,644
you.

837
01:40:12,985 --> 01:40:22,550
[SPEAKER_08]: From the teacher group, the teachers said they felt connected with families through tools like Zoom, and they wanted more time to build relationships with families.

838
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:32,734
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted to see a district-wide effort for family engagement, not through forms, but through a district-wide effort to truly engage families meaningfully.

839
01:40:33,795 --> 01:40:40,438
[SPEAKER_08]: And they mentioned that they were actually shocked by how few families had access to computers in this past year.

840
01:40:40,578 --> 01:40:42,299
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was something that was an innovation

841
01:40:43,005 --> 01:40:47,767
[SPEAKER_08]: through the pandemic that they were able to learn that and develop compassion around that.

842
01:40:48,287 --> 01:40:51,609
[SPEAKER_08]: From the leadership group, the school district leadership.

843
01:40:51,689 --> 01:40:56,711
[SPEAKER_08]: School district leadership felt too much, there was a lot of information going out, but that it was one way information.

844
01:40:57,391 --> 01:40:59,612
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted relationships and two way communication.

845
01:41:00,733 --> 01:41:05,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, because of competing priorities, family partnerships often falls to the bottom of the list.

846
01:41:07,245 --> 01:41:23,434
[SPEAKER_08]: General observation from the consultant through dusty their sort of general observation summaries was there was a lot of info going out in communication for family and community engagement, but the information is not a two way communication it's a one way communication families engage

847
01:41:24,534 --> 01:41:25,715
[SPEAKER_08]: regarding recreation.

848
01:41:26,976 --> 01:41:30,319
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a vocal community but limited set of voices in the community.

849
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:36,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Families view things with a partnership lens while schools tend to view things with an information lens.

850
01:41:38,165 --> 01:41:47,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Data on family and community engagement is not generally shared with families and note there were not any non-English speaking family subgroups that were created.

851
01:41:47,172 --> 01:41:52,597
[SPEAKER_08]: We had intended to do that and it did not work out in terms of scheduling and so

852
01:41:53,259 --> 01:41:59,303
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to make sure that there was a note that that was not part of the engagement, which I think also speaks volumes.

853
01:42:00,824 --> 01:42:09,070
[SPEAKER_08]: They recommended consider focusing on deepening staff district readiness and capacity for family school partnerships, especially around Fundamental Five.

854
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:19,117
[SPEAKER_08]: This partnership fundamentals that's available on DESE has five fundamentals and Fundamental Five is building capacity

855
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:21,507
[SPEAKER_08]: of staff.

856
01:42:22,027 --> 01:42:32,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So they said they recommend that Medford Public Schools consider focusing on deepening staff slash district readiness and capacity for family school partnerships.

857
01:42:33,553 --> 01:42:48,322
[SPEAKER_08]: They think that Fundamental Five is seeing family engagement as a core practice, not a program or an individual or one job, valuing families as assets, a culture that welcomes and responds to constructive criticism,

858
01:42:49,689 --> 01:43:00,271
[SPEAKER_08]: providing family voice data through transparency, collaborative data use surveys, et cetera, and more systemic approaches for building partnerships with non-English speaking families.

859
01:43:01,911 --> 01:43:03,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were the recommendations for the report.

860
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:10,413
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a really unique opportunity to partner again with DESE and this outside family and community engagement audit.

861
01:43:10,853 --> 01:43:18,134
[SPEAKER_08]: The work can continue this year if the committee is interested in terms of moving those particularly fundamental five

862
01:43:18,794 --> 01:43:32,496
[SPEAKER_08]: forward which was considering focusing on deepening staff district readiness and capacity for family and school partnerships, they did say that if we're not going to work on fundamental five really nothing else we do around family and community engagement is going to be effective.

863
01:43:35,525 --> 01:43:50,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that said, I would like to make a motion that we continue the relationship with DESE on the family school partnership initiative so that we can do the next year's work and looking at how to really increase that capacity for staff district readiness.

864
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:51,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

865
01:43:56,490 --> 01:43:56,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Ms.

866
01:43:56,890 --> 01:43:57,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Graham.

867
01:43:58,991 --> 01:44:04,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I would actually like to offer a friendly amendment that

868
01:44:05,235 --> 01:44:09,138
[SPEAKER_09]: this be referred to the communication engagement and strategic planning subcommittee.

869
01:44:09,158 --> 01:44:17,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little taken aback to be honest with you that as the chair of the committee I didn't even know that this work started much less completed.

870
01:44:17,805 --> 01:44:23,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also shocked that they talked to parents because I don't ever remember hearing or seeing any

871
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:26,691
[SPEAKER_09]: thing about how families might get involved in that.

872
01:44:26,771 --> 01:44:29,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't I think there's just still I have a lot of questions.

873
01:44:31,012 --> 01:44:32,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important work.

874
01:44:32,893 --> 01:44:34,293
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a subcommittee for it.

875
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:44,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to see us move this to the subcommittee where we can have a more in depth discussion about how this fits in with our strategic plan, among other things.

876
01:44:46,798 --> 01:44:47,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you amenable?

877
01:44:48,219 --> 01:44:54,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, part of the issue is that this is a grant-funded opportunity that was created last year.

878
01:44:54,301 --> 01:44:57,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So when it was published in DESE, it was applied for.

879
01:44:57,822 --> 01:45:05,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So they had to act quickly through reaching out to the community and working with the school administration to have this happen.

880
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:07,426
[SPEAKER_08]: The second part of this is available this year.

881
01:45:07,446 --> 01:45:11,307
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't last for the next year.

882
01:45:11,327 --> 01:45:13,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what phase three of the project would be.

883
01:45:13,748 --> 01:45:14,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly think that the family

884
01:45:16,129 --> 01:45:20,012
[SPEAKER_08]: that the community engagement subcommittee should and could be involved.

885
01:45:20,453 --> 01:45:30,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that there was reach out from Siemens school in Maine to different subgroups some during a pandemic obviously did not respond but some did and there were certainly groups

886
01:45:31,182 --> 01:45:34,243
[SPEAKER_08]: and engagement that were involved.

887
01:45:34,303 --> 01:45:39,644
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would love to see the community engagement committee involved in this.

888
01:45:40,144 --> 01:45:51,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that moving it to the committee is going to be effective in terms of moving the process forward because School in Maine and DESE are offering the opportunity this year.

889
01:45:51,847 --> 01:45:58,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that there could be a collaborative effort with DESE and School in Maine and the communications subcommittee for sure.

890
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:17,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to weigh in to say that last year, in light of everything that was happening with the pandemic, it was incredibly difficult, even for myself to be able to attend all of the sessions, the timing was very, very difficult.

891
01:46:18,523 --> 01:46:26,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And I too would prefer to have it go through the communication subcommittee to be able to just think about the

892
01:46:26,885 --> 01:46:30,006
[SPEAKER_03]: strategic plan that we have in place and the work that we are doing.

893
01:46:30,186 --> 01:46:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that the intention behind this initiative was a very good and it's a strong intention but the timing just it was overwhelming with everything that we were trying to do moving from hybrid to fully in person and trying to fully commit to what was happening during those specific points in time.

894
01:46:56,713 --> 01:47:17,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't think we participated in the initiative, but I don't really feel like we were able to get 1000% out of it just because there were too many competing interests and trying to juggle all of the balls that were being juggled last year was just too much at that point in time.

895
01:47:20,612 --> 01:47:21,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

896
01:47:21,333 --> 01:47:23,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a deadline that we have to

897
01:47:24,961 --> 01:47:27,982
[SPEAKER_09]: respond to Desi to participate this year.

898
01:47:29,747 --> 01:47:32,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I can check with Desi to confirm.

899
01:47:33,269 --> 01:47:57,622
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been pretty open-ended so far, so I appreciate the flexibility, but I would also say that to the superintendent's point, and I can completely appreciate how stressed out we all were in this past term and during the pandemic, but I also feel that as was stated in the report, that there are so many competing priorities all the time, that family and community engagement

900
01:47:58,258 --> 01:48:09,042
[SPEAKER_08]: is always one of the last priorities, because it's one that is often pushed back for, you know, more immediate needs, such as leaking roofs, which I can understand.

901
01:48:09,102 --> 01:48:18,865
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, until we have a district-wide sort of hearts and minds around this issue, I think that it will continue to be pushed back.

902
01:48:18,905 --> 01:48:20,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we didn't see

903
01:48:21,247 --> 01:48:25,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I think last year was real evidence of the importance of family and community engagement.

904
01:48:26,051 --> 01:48:33,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And I felt like there were some real steps forward through the pandemic, as we talked about some of the innovation and teachers and families building relationships.

905
01:48:33,657 --> 01:48:36,779
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just hate to see that put on pause.

906
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:49,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can check on the DESE deadline and I can make a, I can revise my motion or withdraw my motion and make a motion to table until I get the deadline, if that's, if that is amenable.

907
01:48:50,598 --> 01:48:51,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo.

908
01:48:52,019 --> 01:48:52,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

909
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:54,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Who applied for this?

910
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:59,962
[SPEAKER_11]: We voted to apply for this?

911
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:04,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry.

912
01:49:05,471 --> 01:49:14,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's not like we've done anything for a couple years here so I guess I just don't remember but you know, okay, that's good to know that we did to apply for it.

913
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:21,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we all certainly appreciated that we were going to get an opportunity to only promise it as I read this.

914
01:49:21,947 --> 01:49:36,194
[SPEAKER_11]: There are one or two things that, you know, I read one, the district is putting out tons of communication, too dense, not too way, need to find balance and simplicity, coordinating communication, different methods, platforms can be difficult for administrators.

915
01:49:36,554 --> 01:49:44,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Is anybody remember that we were in the middle of a pandemic and that we were sending out tons of information because there needed to be tons of information sent out?

916
01:49:44,618 --> 01:49:57,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, so there's a couple of these comments that I would, I would step back from and say, let's think about the timing and what are our expectations, and what was the need at the time that need at the time was to get a lot of information out.

917
01:49:57,427 --> 01:50:03,412
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very dense, it was difficult it was so if you think about the number of meetings that we all went to in March alone.

918
01:50:04,853 --> 01:50:07,975
[SPEAKER_11]: with, which was just overwhelming.

919
01:50:08,735 --> 01:50:10,677
[SPEAKER_11]: As one member could say, I can.

920
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:20,503
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the, we, you know, I think that there was very many positive things about this, I actually think that member grams.

921
01:50:22,024 --> 01:50:26,566
[SPEAKER_11]: request to send it to the subcommittee so that the two now become working together makes sense.

922
01:50:27,426 --> 01:50:33,188
[SPEAKER_11]: But most importantly, Member McLaughlin, if you were willing to check out the date and let us know.

923
01:50:33,228 --> 01:50:39,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Luckily, our next school committee meeting is only just next week, and then we could understand what our date is.

924
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:41,511
[SPEAKER_11]: So would that be amenable to you?

925
01:50:42,151 --> 01:50:44,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's a motion to table on the floor.

926
01:50:44,412 --> 01:50:45,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a question.

927
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:52,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to table till next week, seconded by, sorry, Member Russo.

928
01:50:53,295 --> 01:50:57,797
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is, I mean, I shouldn't be talking because we have a motion to table.

929
01:50:57,817 --> 01:50:59,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually haven't been seconded yet.

930
01:50:59,277 --> 01:51:08,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I need, I mean, aside from the date, I need to know how much work is expected of our district regardless of the date.

931
01:51:09,141 --> 01:51:12,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, I need to know that.

932
01:51:13,185 --> 01:51:17,508
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't even approve a simple ad hoc report without getting an answer to how much work is involved.

933
01:51:18,669 --> 01:51:29,198
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, are we talking an hour a month of an administrator or are we talking, you know, five people committing to multiple hours a week?

934
01:51:29,258 --> 01:51:38,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I need to know that to agree to any additional work when I feel like our district is short-staffed and burning.

935
01:51:38,865 --> 01:51:40,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't say burning out, they're just literally burning.

936
01:51:43,099 --> 01:51:47,200
[SPEAKER_07]: for me that's critical information if you can get that when we find out the date.

937
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously the date's critical too.

938
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:51,481
[SPEAKER_11]: So I heard a motion to lay on the table.

939
01:51:52,941 --> 01:51:58,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess maybe procedurally we need to lay this on the table.

940
01:51:58,302 --> 01:51:58,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

941
01:51:58,903 --> 01:52:08,885
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the more important thing is that there's too much to do and it also is past time for us to do this work.

942
01:52:08,985 --> 01:52:09,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So

943
01:52:11,190 --> 01:52:20,314
[SPEAKER_09]: The pandemic made it plainly clear that we lack structures to communicate effectively in this district.

944
01:52:21,075 --> 01:52:28,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we made a lot of progress, but those structures didn't exist.

945
01:52:28,558 --> 01:52:37,582
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were like building the plane, flying the plane, repairing the plane, and trying to do it all perfectly, which is just like not even reasonable.

946
01:52:38,062 --> 01:52:39,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So to remember McLaughlin's point,

947
01:52:41,305 --> 01:52:46,068
[SPEAKER_09]: we were in a worse position than we could have been had we had these structures in place.

948
01:52:46,128 --> 01:52:47,949
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's important work.

949
01:52:48,910 --> 01:53:01,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it should go to the communication subcommittee rather than to be tabled so that we can have a more in-depth discussion about the time commitment, what our objectives are, do they line up, how does it match?

950
01:53:01,837 --> 01:53:10,203
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we can do all of that and we can schedule a meeting next week to do it, which I'm fine with, to have this conversation.

951
01:53:11,143 --> 01:53:16,707
[SPEAKER_09]: and in the meanwhile, like we can get a an answer from Desi about like what the timeline is that we need.

952
01:53:17,127 --> 01:53:18,788
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't, I don't think we need to table it.

953
01:53:18,808 --> 01:53:22,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we just need to send it to the communication subcommittee and I'll get something scheduled.

954
01:53:23,131 --> 01:53:23,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

955
01:53:23,611 --> 01:53:38,360
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in summary, I will revise the motion to send it to the communication subcommittee with information on deadline and and what's involved and then we can talk next week about scheduling a time for

956
01:53:41,348 --> 01:53:42,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and it- Second.

957
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:44,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, you're seconding the motion.

958
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:47,351
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion, all in favor?

959
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:48,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

960
01:53:48,712 --> 01:53:49,292
[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

961
01:53:50,553 --> 01:53:52,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Hearing none, the motion is approved.

962
01:53:53,394 --> 01:54:02,919
[SPEAKER_11]: And Member McLaughlin, I do want to express our appreciation for the work that you did on this and for being persistent and bringing it back to us.

963
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:03,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

964
01:54:06,154 --> 01:54:10,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the next order of business is the condolences.

965
01:54:11,079 --> 01:54:23,112
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Diane De La Russo Guida, daughter of the late Mayor Arthur De La Russo and cousin to former Mayor Frederick De La Russo Sr.

966
01:54:24,315 --> 01:54:36,921
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Maddie McPahn, a Tufts University student and lacrosse player who had a tragic accident and passed away.

967
01:54:37,442 --> 01:54:44,245
[SPEAKER_11]: As Tufts President Anthony Monaco stated, in the face of this painful loss, our hearts go out to Maddie's family and friends.

968
01:54:45,473 --> 01:54:54,970
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Jane McDevitt, wife of former Medford High School teacher, James Jack McDevitt.

969
01:54:56,172 --> 01:55:06,801
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Chris K. Kuyate, parent of two Medford High School students.

970
01:55:07,382 --> 01:55:15,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I think we mentioned last week at our last meeting, many of us had interacted with this remarkable woman.

971
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:21,474
[SPEAKER_11]: She had, in her very last weeks of life, was busy working on

972
01:55:21,974 --> 01:55:27,979
[SPEAKER_11]: a project with her Girl Scouts and showing them leadership and making them into the next generation of leaders.

973
01:55:29,581 --> 01:55:34,345
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Luis Gomez.

974
01:55:34,805 --> 01:55:40,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Gomez was a special education paraprofessional in project transition program at Medford High School.

975
01:55:41,371 --> 01:55:46,776
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could all stand for a minute of silence.

976
01:55:59,611 --> 01:55:59,951
[SPEAKER_11]: last.

977
01:56:01,172 --> 01:56:03,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, the next meeting is Monday, November 15.

978
01:56:05,115 --> 01:56:06,476
