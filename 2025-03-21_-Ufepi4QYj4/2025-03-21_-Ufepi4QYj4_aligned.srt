Flying for the permit.

27
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:47,401
Very good.

28
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:48,582
So you're in favor of this matter.

29
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,536
Yes, very good, thank you.

30
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:52,197
Anybody else in favor?

31
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:54,359
Anybody else in favor?

32
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:01,304
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the public hearing closed and open it up to anybody in opposition.

33
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:07,228
Is there anybody present in opposition to this matter before us?

34
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:17,195
Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting closed and turn it over to Councilor Caviello of licensing for recommendation.

35
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,573
Thank you, Mr. President.

36
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:25,156
Mr. President, I have reviewed the papers, and I find them in order, and I recommend approval.

37
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:29,237
Seconded by Councilor Camuso.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,761
On that motion, Councilor Penta.

39
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,841
Judge, what's at 11 Hall Street right now?

40
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,022
It was the old method breaking wheel.

41
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:43,723
Bobby Maloney's on the building.

42
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,432
Are you renting or buying?

43
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:46,233
We bought it.

44
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:46,633
You bought it?

45
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:46,953
Yeah.

46
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:49,674
So we're just going to continue the same uses as they did.

47
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,035
So this is nothing more than a change in name?

48
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:52,615
Correct.

49
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,196
Change in name to the same location, right Mr. Park?

50
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:55,537
Right.

51
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,737
The license is on transferral, so.

52
00:02:58,218 --> 00:02:58,418
Okay.

53
00:02:59,678 --> 00:02:59,978
Very good.

54
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:03,740
So on the motion of Councilor Kerrio-Viello, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,500
All those in favor?

56
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:04,840
Aye.

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,721
All those opposed?

58
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:07,461
Congratulations.

59
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:08,042
Appreciate it.

60
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,282
Thank you.

61
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:08,502
Good luck.

62
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:18,602
On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take items out of order, petitions, all those in favor?

63
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:19,583
All those opposed?

64
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,206
To take petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

65
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:39,718
Petition by 15488, petition by Eversource Energy to address City Council on a brief presentation on Mystic Station 250 to Woburn Station number 221, KV transmission line project, questions and answers.

66
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:43,909
Folks, please come forward from Eversource.

67
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,953
Folks, just so you know, we discussed this through Councilor Marks last week.

68
00:03:51,214 --> 00:04:04,483
Before Councilor Marks had an opportunity to address the matter with us, I had received a communication from Mr. Zamparelli of Eversource to address the council.

69
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,545
And so I asked him to place a petition before us.

70
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:10,487
And he has done so, so they're here to do this.

71
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:17,549
Also, I should have announced at the beginning of this meeting, and I apologize, we are not broadcasting on Comcast right now.

72
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,030
We are, however, broadcasting on Fios.

73
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:28,273
A request for work to repair the matter has been submitted to Comcast, and they need to get out here.

74
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:32,154
I suppose, as we all know, waiting for the cable guy can be a challenge at times.

75
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:35,855
So it is being recorded for rebroadcast.

76
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,483
and it is broadcasting on the Fios channel.

77
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,943
So please state your name and address for the record.

78
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,984
Yes, my name is Bill Zamparelli.

79
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:49,086
I'm the Community Relations Representative with Eversource, and I actually represent the gas company.

80
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:55,348
We do have a number of gas customers in Medford, but I also represent this project.

81
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,169
Let me introduce my counterparts.

82
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,249
This is Jack Lopes.

83
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,490
Jack Lopes, also with Community Relations on a project.

84
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,491
Very good, Jack.

85
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,791
And David Velez.

86
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,272
David Velez, lead project manager with Eversource.

87
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:12,873
I'm the project manager for the project we'll be discussing tonight.

88
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:13,653
Great.

89
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:18,015
Well, if you could just give us a brief presentation on the project.

90
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:29,659
And I know the councilors by way of motion last week presented a number of questions and I'm sure Councilor Marks, he'll be first to speak and he'll be able to

91
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:35,126
make those questions known to you so we can address them once you've made your preliminary presentation.

92
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:41,932
Our project manager, David Velez, will actually make the presentation and then we'll handle questions afterwards.

93
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:42,293
Great.

94
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:44,675
Any time during, if there's questions that arise.

95
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,037
Members of the Council, thank you very much.

96
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:52,726
speak quickly and briefly on this, but please do feel free to interrupt and pull out any questions.

97
00:05:53,927 --> 00:06:01,531
This project is a new 115 kilovolt underground transmission line project that we are proposing.

98
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:10,926
To give you some background on it, the need for the project comes from a study done by the independent system operator of New England, or the ISO.

99
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:15,409
The way I refer to them, they're sort of the air traffic control of the electric system.

100
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:22,394
They say where the power comes from, where it's needed, and how the system is behaving, essentially.

101
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:31,600
And looking out into the future, when they assess load growth, new customers, businesses, et cetera, what they see is that there are deficiencies in the overall

102
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:46,505
New England system, particularly in the greater Boston area, where there could be situations where if one line were to go down and perhaps another line were to go down, we could be in a situation where many customers would be out.

103
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:59,406
I need to stress here that this is not a distribution line where we're talking about one or two houses or businesses or a street, but we're talking about regional impacts, multi-thousand customers per line, which is why the ISO gets involved in that.

104
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:07,291
So they put out there that there is this need that needs to be addressed, and then various entities come forward with solutions to that need.

105
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:12,475
Eversource, formerly NSTAR, your local utility in the region,

106
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:17,679
came up with one package, or another entity from New Hampshire came up with another package.

107
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:23,023
In the end, they were weighed and judged, and the ISO determined ours was the preferred solution.

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:29,288
That allows us to take a forward, do more work, and eventually submit a petition through the permitting process.

109
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,050
So that brings us to this project.

110
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,393
I should say this particular one is part of a suite of projects.

111
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,575
When you go to page three, you'll see that.

112
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,817
The Mystic to Woburn Line project is a 115 underground line

113
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:47,482
going through the cities and towns of Everett, Boston, Somerville, Medford, Winchester, and Woburn.

114
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:57,348
In addition to that, it's complemented by other projects like the Woburn to Wakefield project, and also a Merrimack Valley project that goes from New Hampshire into Mass.

115
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:04,092
Altogether, these multiple projects comprise the Greater Boston Solution we're referring to.

116
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:07,635
But today, we're talking about the one specific piece that goes through Medford.

117
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,151
Moving on to page four.

118
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:17,674
Underground line going from the Mystic station we're all familiar with to our station 211 at Woburn by Pond Street.

119
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:23,097
The project is approximately eight miles going through the towns I mentioned.

120
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:29,960
What's interesting to note is that we actually have an existing underground transmission line along the route we're proposing.

121
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,323
So while it's a new piece of infrastructure we're talking about, we actually intend and propose to build a new line

122
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:41,898
parallel to the existing, approximately 10 feet away from it, the whole length of the route.

123
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:48,700
The idea being that we'll have two lines side by side, the ends will be tied together, if you will, we call that bifurcating.

124
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,182
They go to their breaker terminations at the same point, and you have a line that is doubly strong as the original.

125
00:08:55,982 --> 00:09:01,444
Page five, you'll see the project map from end to end from Everett Station to Ruburn.

126
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:23,069
And on the next page, we have a zoom-in of just Medford, where you'll see that we're coming in from Somerville on Route 38, going down the length of it up to South Street, down South Street, across the Mystic River, up Winthrop Street to the Rotary, and again, 38, the whole way down to Winchester.

127
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:28,732
Again, this is paralleling an existing line that is already there the whole way through the route.

128
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,422
The next page, page seven, talks about the project schedule, which I think is a key point to address based on some of the questions we saw.

129
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,703
We are just in the beginning stages of this project.

130
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:48,126
We did hold a series of open houses over the last couple weeks, including one in Medford at the high school on the 11th.

131
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:57,829
The next step for us is to take our petition and file it with the Department of Public Utilities, specifically their Energy Facilities Siting Board.

132
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,470
We hope to do that very soon this month, actually.

133
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:10,482
That will kick off a long public process with the EFSB that we think can go at least 18 months.

134
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:17,947
Part of that will be public participation from members of the public, from various cities and any other stakeholder group.

135
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:28,371
There will be notifications sent to abutters and those within 300 feet, notifications sent to all the various municipal entities, and any other stakeholder wants to be informed.

136
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,153
That comes directly from the DPU, not from us.

137
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:37,418
But as you see, we're doing a lot of outreach efforts on our own, and we're glad to push out that information on our own as well.

138
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:44,304
So with that 18-month period of review as a minimum, we're thinking construction starting as early as 2017.

139
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:53,315
And the entire eight-mile project would last roughly until the end of 2018 when we could put it in service.

140
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:58,881
That wouldn't be the entire eight miles construction the entire two years, but bit by bit, section by section.

141
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:07,190
Next steps, as you mentioned, we have been, for the last several months, collecting input from the towns.

142
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,492
We've met with the mayor's office.

143
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:12,548
We've met with the DPW here in Medford, as well as all the other towns.

144
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,449
We've conducted open houses.

145
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:20,353
The third step is filing that petition, again, which we hope to do soon, and then the DPU process.

146
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:35,645
The proactive project outreach, talking about the various stakeholders involved here from municipal officials, planners, property owners, residents, all are going to have an opportunity to

147
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:42,710
reach out, learn more about the project from us, provide their input either directly to us, to the DPU directly.

148
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:52,158
They will hold their own public hearings as part of their stakeholder process, and then that all goes through the hearings through the state agency in Boston.

149
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,161
And last, we have contact information.

150
00:11:56,181 --> 00:12:03,707
There's a public hotline, 1-800 number, where we are collecting any questions and input that might come, also an email.

151
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:10,459
Also, a website right now that gives some general information, not just about this one specific project, but the entire Mass.

152
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,702
New Hampshire solution, as the website implies.

153
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:18,785
You have all of our contact information for city officials to use as well.

154
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,928
I'll leave it at that and take any questions.

155
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:23,168
Very good.

156
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:24,029
Councilor Marks.

157
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,351
Thank you, Mr. President.

158
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:33,696
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in having Eversource come down on this very important issue.

159
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,572
And I'd like to thank the gentleman for coming tonight.

160
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:47,416
You just mentioned the project itself, 18 months, I guess, which is going to start now of public involvement.

161
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:51,138
And the actual project is two years.

162
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:52,098
Did I hear that correct?

163
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:54,479
We anticipate construction lasting roughly two years.

164
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,039
Two years.

165
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,903
So, if it's an eight-mile route and Method is 3.2 miles of that eight-mile route, can we figure out roughly how long

166
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,968
You will be doing construction in the city by that, or is that not a good estimate?

167
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,389
It's an excellent question.

168
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:18,672
I can't give you a reliable answer to that right now, because what we are in the process of doing today is the engineering, specifically the underground engineering.

169
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,654
We've figured out our route, which was easy because we're following an existing line.

170
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:30,016
What we need to figure out is all the underground infrastructure, whether that be our own electric lines, water, sewer, gas.

171
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,337
We all know there's a lot of that in the area.

172
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:33,658
We have engineers.

173
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:47,645
going through records, actually lifting manholes to collect inverts, figuring out what is in the street, and their job is, as we call it, threading the needle to find a way to place our pipe and also the various manholes that will be required to do this.

174
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:53,218
If it was smooth sailing and we had no interruptions, I would say construction would go very quickly through Medford.

175
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:59,842
If we encounter a lot of utilities that need to be relocated, a lot of conflicts, then it would take longer.

176
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:06,487
I can give you a much better answer to that question once I've seen the engineering, which I expect to be in the middle to late July.

177
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:07,627
Okay.

178
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:13,251
And I assume from what I understand of the project, it's going to be a 24 inch wide trench.

179
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,027
Six feet deep?

180
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:18,588
Five feet deep.

181
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:27,415
And if you were going to install a manhole cover, we are able to, I guess, monitor this line and so forth.

182
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,978
What size of trench is a manhole cover, roughly?

183
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,641
The manhole is much larger than the trench itself.

184
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:43,084
The manholes are roughly 18 feet long by, I believe, 10, 12 feet wide.

185
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:44,085
I can get back to you on that.

186
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:45,485
10 wide.

187
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,247
They're quite larger, so they're not built as part of the trench.

188
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:53,068
They are their own excavation that interrupts the trench, as it were.

189
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:57,973
Typically we like to do a precast manhole where the area is excavated.

190
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:04,200
The manhole gets dropped right into place and gets built into the duct system.

191
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,467
If for some reason we can't do that because of other conflicts, we can form and pour it in place.

192
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,521
The purpose of those manholes is not just to monitor and to do maintenance, but actually for the splicing.

193
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,063
Again, this is an eight-mile stretch.

194
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:23,766
The cable itself that will go inside the pipe only comes and reels about 2,800 feet long.

195
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:29,008
So roughly every 2,800 feet, you have to do a splice, which is where the manholes come in.

196
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,789
That's where the splicing operation takes place.

197
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:31,530
Okay.

198
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,732
And according to the website, it said the manholes

199
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:40,629
We're going to be placed approximately 2,000 to 2,400 linear feet.

200
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:43,330
That's a very rough estimate.

201
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,670
Again, that's in a perfect world.

202
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,631
If you take these, it's a little bit more, I'd say it's more like 24 to 28 hundred feet.

203
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:56,113
Again, in a perfect world, if the line were going straight, you would stretch out that 2,800 foot cable and put a splice at every one.

204
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,913
As we know, it's not a perfect world.

205
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:59,354
There's going to be bends and turns.

206
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:05,115
We may have utilities that are blocking and we may have to move the manholes closer together.

207
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:10,359
That's why there's really no way to give an accurate number of the manholes today until we see the engineer.

208
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,700
Not accurate, but we should be able to get a ballpark.

209
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,802
I can tell you that roughly we're anticipating in the neighborhood of 17 manholes throughout the 8-mile project.

210
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,202
And method, roughly?

211
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:23,744
I haven't even seen that to count that, to be honest.

212
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:24,584
I would hate to.

213
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:26,625
You should be able to give somewhat of a ballpark.

214
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:33,788
I mean, if you're going to put them 2,000 to 2,400, and I realize it's not a perfect world, but based on 3.2 miles

215
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:39,990
roughly out of the 17, are we talking maybe seven, eight?

216
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:49,055
We could take, no, we could take the eight mile route, you know, the 17 manholes divide by eight, but don't ask a communication major to do that math on the fly.

217
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,738
But, you know, you could do it that way, but I would not say that's an accurate assumption.

218
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,079
We have to do the engineering first.

219
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:59,120
It really depends on where the turns are, I think.

220
00:16:59,141 --> 00:16:59,341
Right.

221
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:03,543
So they may need an interim manhole at some location.

222
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:06,146
Right, but you understand the concern.

223
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:22,517
The concern is that it's one thing to dig a two foot wide, six foot deep, five foot deep trench, and then to have an 18 foot by 10 foot manhole, which to me is a pretty sizable project, which leads to my second question.

224
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:26,680
I know you said it's gonna be in the proximity of the existing line.

225
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,462
Whereabouts does this fall on the street?

226
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,491
Again, that's the question that the engineering will have to answer.

227
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:38,093
I can't tell you right now if we're on the sidewalk, on the side of the road, on the middle of the road.

228
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:40,974
That's huge.

229
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:44,115
That's why the engineers are getting paid a lot of money.

230
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:48,937
They have a big job to do to figure out where that's going to go for the entire model.

231
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:49,837
And it won't be consistent.

232
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,058
It might be on the sidewalk in some parts.

233
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,879
It might shift to the middle of the road here.

234
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:57,140
We're trying to avoid impacts to existing utilities.

235
00:17:57,557 --> 00:18:01,039
So if we have to snake and move around, if that's... Have you brought an engineer on board?

236
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:02,540
Yes, we have power engineers.

237
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,160
And is there a reason why they're not here tonight?

238
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,662
They're based out of Minneapolis.

239
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:11,944
It's their home office, although they do have a team working in South Attleboro.

240
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:17,487
But frankly, they just look up plans and records and pull manholes.

241
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:18,608
Right.

242
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:22,850
This can't be the first project of this nature that's being done in the area, correct?

243
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,190
No.

244
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,871
So there must be other...

245
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:39,084
I mean, the towns that have had this done, would you say in your best estimate that, and I realize you're not an engineer, but are we looking at disruption to the roadway?

246
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:49,286
Certainly, this project will be in the roadway, so the excavation we're talking about, whether it be the trench or the manhole, the majority of it will be in the public roadway.

247
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:51,826
Including the sidewalk?

248
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:52,846
Potentially.

249
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,207
Okay.

250
00:18:56,623 --> 00:19:01,304
My next question, and I'd like to have those questions answered, Mr. President.

251
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:12,748
I'm sure maybe you can fire off an email to the engineer to find out exactly where this falls on the street as this project gets a little closer.

252
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:17,269
I think that's very important from a public safety standpoint in the community.

253
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:26,152
And if you're familiar with our city, our city in the morning and at night turns into a cutthroat from everyone leaving and going into Boston, vice versa.

254
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,378
and our streets are packed in the morning.

255
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:29,599
I'm very familiar.

256
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:31,561
I'm one of those people that's driving through them.

257
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:32,361
You're probably right.

258
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,883
So you can imagine.

259
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:37,325
Now, you mentioned that this project will be phased in.

260
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:48,233
Will the project 3.2 miles in the city of Method, will we be doing a quarter mile and then filling up the area and moving on?

261
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,876
Or are we going to dig 3.2 miles and then go back and fill?

262
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,138
Maybe if you could just explain how

263
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:58,635
We want to do it in the most efficient and least impactful way.

264
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:07,380
And what I mean by that is, again, once we get the engineering and we see where we're going to be, we don't have to build this from point A to point B. We can do it in phases.

265
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,683
So for instance, the line goes right in front of a high school.

266
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,364
We might decide it's a good idea to not do construction.

267
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,283
during the school year and save that for the summer.

268
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:19,985
We could save that piece to a point that's less impactful.

269
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:27,630
We can likewise solicit input from the towns that, hey, we really do not want you here in the middle of the summer.

270
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,751
We'd rather you go into the winter.

271
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:35,095
We can take all that input and phase the project as there is a lot of work to do in different parts.

272
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:38,837
For instance, one of the things we have to do is cross the Mystic River.

273
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:44,381
We have a solution that we're working on for that involving a HDD, a horizontal directional drill.

274
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,045
It might make sense to do that in the winter months as opposed to the peak parkland use in the summer.

275
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:59,437
These are all the considerations that we'll take into account when we make our construction and traffic management plan, but I'd say we're at least a year off from that.

276
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:03,882
Is it anticipated construction will take place during the day?

277
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,761
I don't think that's the case at all.

278
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:15,607
I think we would look at the, if it's a business area, we may want to do it from, you know, 7 or 8 at night to 6 in the morning.

279
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,729
Something that wouldn't affect their business operations.

280
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,592
If it's residential, we'll probably be moving it to daytime.

281
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:28,913
because we wouldn't want to affect anybody's sleeping habits.

282
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:29,214
Okay.

283
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:30,834
Speak a little on the construction.

284
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:36,515
Typically we work, we have an open trench of 200 to 400 feet maximum.

285
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:42,137
And it's kind of a revolving trench.

286
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:47,398
So where someone is digging it up, the crews are behind putting the conduit in and they're right behind paving.

287
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,379
So it's a continuous, we don't go in,

288
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,933
do a 3.2-mile trench.

289
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:57,836
And so we work on a specific area, and we move right along.

290
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:03,800
And then at night, for the areas, we'll plate them for the night, come back the next morning, and just continue picking up.

291
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,045
So the impact on a certain area should be one to two days outside of the manhole installations, just on the duct tank.

292
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:20,270
Now, with all this digging, I realize the trench is not that much, but the manhole may be some considerable digging, especially within neighborhoods.

293
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:29,335
Do you go into homes and surrounding areas to see if there's any possible damage done by the construction work?

294
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:36,381
To what extent do you ensure the safety of area residents and their property?

295
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:45,209
As far as surveying of foundations and properties, that's typically not done unless we're doing blasting, which is not anticipated here.

296
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:55,091
While this is a big impact to anyone who sees this from the outside world, this is relatively straightforward utility construction.

297
00:22:55,692 --> 00:23:00,414
And we employ, you know, very experienced contractors who do this every day, day in and day out.

298
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:07,457
So we don't anticipate any ancillary damage or impacts to residences outside of the construction zone.

299
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:09,918
Obviously, in terms of safety for the construction zone,

300
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:14,362
We employ best practices, OSHA standards, we keep our sites very safe.

301
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:25,756
As far as alerting residents, that's where Community Relations comes in and they have a robust program from speaking with folks like you to advertising and local media to hanging door hangers.

302
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:30,538
We'll have a community relations program to address all of that.

303
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,659
We'll advise them when we're coming through.

304
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,760
They'll understand our schedule.

305
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,661
We'll have it on our website, and we'll have contact numbers available to the community.

306
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:43,982
If anybody has concerns, we want to hear it so that we can address it.

307
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:48,143
It's our intention to try to be proactive and address any concerns.

308
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:49,844
So you mentioned you have a hotline.

309
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:53,105
Will that be manned by someone, or is that where you just leave a phone message?

310
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:59,456
Right now it's, I believe it's a phone message, but we do have, we follow up the following day.

311
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:10,464
I mean, that's typically the process that we've used at this point, but as we get more into construction, I think you'll find that this becomes much more engaging.

312
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:13,166
You'll find that there'll be a conversation going on.

313
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:14,587
Okay.

314
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:22,933
And, and as many method residents are aware with the fast 14 project that took place right out here in front of city hall with the

315
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:29,219
the bridge construction, the City of Medford entered into a comprehensive mitigation program.

316
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:41,585
And has there been any discussion about mitigation and what the impact may be on this community and how we may be able to benefit from mitigation?

317
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:50,492
I think we've had some discussions with Ma'am McGlynn, not specifically, because it's pretty early in the process.

318
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:54,174
Typically, once we have it engineered, we'll have a better idea.

319
00:24:54,194 --> 00:25:00,538
As we start to move toward permitting, we will be seeking grants of locations.

320
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:06,542
We will actually have a host agreement with the community, and we'll address all of that at that point.

321
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:09,383
That will probably be sometime in the fall of this year.

322
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:11,785
And will equipment be left on the street?

323
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:15,337
or will equipment, will you have a place to house your equipment?

324
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:17,299
I don't know.

325
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,741
That's something that we have not developed yet.

326
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:24,885
We're very early in the stage of construction plan will be developed, but not developed yet.

327
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:28,007
That's something I think we'll have to address community to community.

328
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:35,133
Obviously, if we're in the middle of a trenching operation on the street, we would not want to demote that every night if we can't avoid it.

329
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:41,238
But if we were, say, in the middle of a town center, or if we were in a highly congested area,

330
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:44,499
We're not going to leave our equipment there, clogging it up further when we're not working.

331
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:53,060
We would try to find a staging area and we would arrange a leasing arrangement or something to ensure that that's addressed.

332
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:10,923
Mr. President, just if I could, if we could make part of the committee report also that we get responses back from the engineering department and also from the city administration regarding any dialogue that has taken place regarding potential mitigation with this project.

333
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,080
And I appreciate the gentleman for coming tonight.

334
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,680
Thank you.

335
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,662
Yes, and the clerk is taking those down to make those part of a ongoing resolution.

336
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:30,406
If I may, from the chair, there's an extensive ongoing construction project going on now in the Winthrop Street area between Mystic Valley Parkway.

337
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:33,067
You may have seen it in some of your preliminary work.

338
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,569
They've run into a lot of obstacles there with relation to

339
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:48,463
It's also been a tremendous burden on the community and people who traverse that area, both local people and just people who make their way periodically through Metfit.

340
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:54,387
It's been impactful and it's gone on a long time.

341
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:05,633
Although it's going to result in a great improvement on the aggressive wastewater and runoff, nonetheless,

342
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,272
the impact of the project has been hard on people.

343
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:20,941
My sense is that you're going through that neck of the woods, which will perhaps be repaved and pristine once you start digging again, and that's gonna be a tremendous concern for people.

344
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,702
Can you address that at all for us?

345
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:33,190
Well, we'll leave it in better condition than we find it, I can assure you, and if these are all new streets, we will address that, we'll pave it curb to curb if that's the case.

346
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,071
Well, thank you, thank you.

347
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,992
So next is Vice President Lungo Kern.

348
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:38,893
Madam Vice President.

349
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:40,955
Thank you, President De La Russo.

350
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,317
Thank you for coming, gentlemen.

351
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:49,804
I think Councilman Marks asked a majority of the questions, but I just had a question with regards to your public open house on May 11th.

352
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:52,447
Was that for the administration?

353
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,429
And what type of meeting was that?

354
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:55,810
Just because I was unaware of it.

355
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:08,098
We had a series of tables set up with different aspects of the project, and we had subject matter experts that were available that evening.

356
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:25,592
We had actually invited people from Medford to join any one of those open houses.

357
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:30,535
And I actually spoke with a couple of Medford residents at the Winchester open house when we did hold it.

358
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:38,300
But I think that process was available so they could see a demonstration of the project.

359
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,301
It was actually a taped video.

360
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,568
We had a video.

361
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:48,110
A video and a tape message actually drove the entire route.

362
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,311
And so we could see what the extent of the project.

363
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:57,553
We had photographs of what the trenching and manhole excavation looks like.

364
00:28:57,593 --> 00:29:02,295
We had video explaining the horizontal directional drill technology.

365
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,936
We had a layout of a timeline for the public process.

366
00:29:06,936 --> 00:29:10,997
And we had basically people stationed at each one of those tables to speak to those matters.

367
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:12,438
Who was invited?

368
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:21,596
Everyone who was on either the preferred route or the alternate route, anyone who lived on those routes, 300 feet on either side.

369
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:28,919
So we had something in the vicinity of about 4,000 attendees that were invited.

370
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:29,499
4,000 people invited.

371
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,220
We did not have a large turnout at the Memphis event.

372
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,860
I think it was about 17 or 18.

373
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:44,291
But I think the point was that they did attend some of our other venues.

374
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:50,095
And we understood that- Notified via local newspapers.

375
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,537
Oh, but you sent out 4,000 letters?

376
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:53,278
That's what- Oh, wow.

377
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,419
Okay.

378
00:29:55,439 --> 00:30:00,843
I believe we sent the entire council an invitation via email.

379
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:01,864
Oh, via email.

380
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:02,565
Okay.

381
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:08,580
as well as other city officials.

382
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:15,146
And I think our intent was to widely advertise this as much as possible.

383
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:17,107
Thank you.

384
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:20,270
Yeah, no, I'm glad you invited so many people, especially the people on the route.

385
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:26,395
I grew up on South Street, so I know a lot of my neighbors would be concerned, prior neighbors.

386
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:30,358
With regards to when you start the project, will you be

387
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:39,412
leafleting, you know, the sections as you do them with contact information, if people had questions or concerns or, okay.

388
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,694
So we're leaving something at everybody's door.

389
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:45,056
We're going to be working near your home in the next week.

390
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:46,257
Okay.

391
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:54,102
And we'll have an active website that will advise people of what the schedule is and what the most recent activities will be.

392
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:55,483
Thank you.

393
00:30:56,364 --> 00:31:12,452
ask that that definitely take place, that residents know, you know, a week in advance of when work will be, where and when work will be scheduled, because those will be the brux of the calls we get from concerned residents, what is going on and what's being done up in front of my house right now.

394
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:17,515
So it would be good if they can have a contact information, your contact information with any questions they have.

395
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:19,656
Thank you.

396
00:31:20,076 --> 00:31:21,357
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

397
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:23,017
Councilor Caviello.

398
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:23,918
Thank you, Mr. President.

399
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:33,388
My glasses kind of aren't strong enough to read your picture, but can you detail where the project will be starting and the main road that's going down?

400
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:34,228
It looks like.

401
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,812
In Everett?

402
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,253
Where you're starting, in Medford.

403
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:41,235
In Medford, okay.

404
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:43,357
Basically on Mystic Avenue.

405
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:43,937
Okay.

406
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:45,839
You're heading from Mystic.

407
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,762
Mystic Avenue down to Route 16 and then.

408
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:50,873
or into Meffitt Square?

409
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:51,474
To South Street.

410
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:52,194
To South Street.

411
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,115
And then we go under the river.

412
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,936
So it's going to go Mystic Avenue.

413
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:01,418
Mystic to Main.

414
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:01,838
Correct.

415
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:03,038
To South.

416
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:04,879
And then up 38.

417
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,720
Under the river.

418
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,601
Under the river and through the woods.

419
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:11,702
Up Winthrop Street.

420
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:13,543
And all the way into Winchester.

421
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,564
Yeah, and then 38 all the way to Winchester.

422
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:19,145
And like the President said, that's going to be all newly paved road.

423
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:24,338
and Councilor Night won't be sleeping for a few more nights because he lives at that corner there.

424
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:38,429
We're aware of all the work that's going on and if we had the flexibility to get on this quicker and to go ahead and say install while that was being opened up, whether that be next week, next month, we would.

425
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,751
We are bound by the DPU process.

426
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:43,914
We are not allowed.

427
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:48,157
That route is a major route in the morning and the afternoon during the rush hour time.

428
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:58,070
I mean, even with the traffic that's there from the projects that's ongoing now, it's been a disaster for the last two years.

429
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,112
And especially when they closed it on a Saturday, that's been bad.

430
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:07,653
So do you have a timeline?

431
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:09,314
Do you have a date you're looking to start in Medford?

432
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:17,695
We're talking about starting construction in the first quarter of 2017, assuming that we receive approvals from the FSB.

433
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:26,181
And then we would have an 18 to 20-month, 24-month construction period, all of which wouldn't be in Memphis.

434
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,222
The 18 to 24 months would be the entire project.

435
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:32,165
So there would be phases going on.

436
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:35,868
Now, will the bridge project that's going on in Memphis impact you also?

437
00:33:36,668 --> 00:33:37,589
Credit bridge project?

438
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:37,869
Yeah.

439
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,350
No, we're not on that.

440
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,743
We just also looked at the construction phase on the beginning of the 24 month.

441
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:50,067
The first phase is the civil work, where we'll install the duct bank and the conduits.

442
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:53,490
Then we'll have to come back later on, which is still part of the construction.

443
00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:59,656
But that's when we will need just access to the manholes to pull the cable and to displace it.

444
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:01,942
That's actually a good point.

445
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:08,425
So of those two years, it's not a two-year civil construction project with excavation and such.

446
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:13,486
It is half civil excavation, half electrical wire pulling and splicing.

447
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:23,810
And like I said, a good part of that does encompass the route that the buses take to the school in both ways.

448
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:26,271
Thank you.

449
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:28,132
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

450
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:28,812
Councilor Penta.

451
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:39,440
Could you explain what a kilovolt is as compared to what's there now?

452
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,365
So a kilovolt is 1,000 volts.

453
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:52,610
So the usage in your own house is a 120, 240 volt system.

454
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,914
And so it's a very low voltage compared to these systems.

455
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:57,875
This is the system.

456
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,703
the regional system that delivers the majority of the power into the area is at a much higher voltage, which is 115,000 volts.

457
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:14,786
So when we compare that, then from that point, the electricity is transferred down to what we call street level.

458
00:35:15,307 --> 00:35:19,548
It goes from 115,000 volts to 13,800 volts.

459
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:25,051
And that's what you see on the street at the very top of the poles if it's an overhead system.

460
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:28,292
And then you will see the transformers on the poles.

461
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:39,696
And those transformers then will reduce it even lower to the 120, 240 for your home, or 120, 208, 277, 480 for the commercial or industrial customers.

462
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:47,221
So by having this upgrade, you're improving what?

463
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:57,897
What we're doing is what was mentioned earlier that the ISO New England did some studies, and they noticed that there was some deficiencies in the area.

464
00:35:57,977 --> 00:36:09,826
So when there's faults, when there's a fault in the system, they came out that the existing line that's there right now would overload, and it could cause additional problems.

465
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:14,630
If a line is overloaded, it could trip out, and when that trips out, it causes further

466
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:21,971
out problems, and they could escalate the issue and cause kind of a domino effect.

467
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:24,172
So what they're trying to do is to alleviate that.

468
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:38,682
So if you lose what we call an N minus 1 minus 1 condition, where you lose two pieces of equipment at the very high level, at the high voltage, we can still maintain the whole region running up and running without any deficiencies.

469
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:40,903
What's the cost of the project?

470
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:53,341
The cost that we've estimated right now, and I will stress that the way that the ISO petition process goes is in this early stage, we're in what we call the conceptual phase of the project.

471
00:36:54,561 --> 00:37:00,903
And so the level of accuracy they ask for us is a plus or minus 50% budget.

472
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:04,383
And we are estimating the project at $75 million.

473
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:06,524
That's what we put forward to the ISO.

474
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:09,413
And again, that is before engineering happens.

475
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:21,041
The next level from the ISO process is to go from the conceptual level to the planned level, where we go to a plus or minus 25 percent.

476
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:23,302
And we expect to be doing that in the fall.

477
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:29,907
We'll have a better accuracy of estimate with the benefit of engineering and having done more study with it.

478
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:33,129
But the estimate that is out there today is $75 million.

479
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,692
So if it's $75 million and whatever the cost is going to be in the future,

480
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:41,386
What portion of that $75 million is coming into the city of Medford?

481
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,506
Do you have that broken down yet?

482
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:44,308
We do not.

483
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:56,856
If the question is in regards to personal property tax, et cetera, that's something that could... I think that would be something that we would have to calculate once we know what the real numbers are.

484
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:06,703
We typically file a form of list with the city, which is a list of all of the personal property that is in service in the community.

485
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:13,368
And they would calculate the value of that, and that would be the basis for the property taxes.

486
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:17,031
If I understand this correctly, National Grid is part of Eversource, correct?

487
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:20,894
National Grid is part of the other two projects that we have.

488
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:24,356
There's three projects associated with the Greater Boston Solution.

489
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:27,819
They are actively involved in both of those.

490
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:29,460
We have a project that runs from

491
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:39,344
from the Rubin station, which is an Eversource station, to Wakefield station, which is a 345 national grid station.

492
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,346
They're partnered on that particular project.

493
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:54,136
But on this particular project, this is a solely Eversource project, which is formerly NSTAR, so not involved with national grid on this particular component of the overall solution.

494
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:58,099
So during this past winter, the electric rates went up approximately 39%.

495
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:03,579
because supposedly they can't find the energy, or the energy costs more, or whatever.

496
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,042
What's this going to cost the city of Medford?

497
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:07,284
Because somebody's going to have to pay for this.

498
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:11,368
I think I can speak to the cost issues.

499
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:17,895
The cost issues are really a pipeline issue, a capacity issue coming up from the Gulf for available gas.

500
00:39:20,222 --> 00:39:27,228
I think what people need to understand is that the power generators have to buy gas on the spot market.

501
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:30,371
They cannot buy secure pipeline capacity.

502
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:33,974
If you're a heating customer, you do have secure pipeline capacity.

503
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:38,258
But if you're a generator, you have to buy available pipeline.

504
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:42,265
and this winter was very difficult for them.

505
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:48,447
That's why we saw such spikes in the cost of electricity this year.

506
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:57,250
I have heard, and I can't say this for sure, but I do know that we will see a significant reduction as of July 1.

507
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:07,113
They're expecting that the cost of a kilowatt hour may come down to the 10 cent range.

508
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:18,874
But to address the question specifically of this project and who bears the cost, it's important to note this is not strictly an Eversource project going through the five or so particular towns here.

509
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:29,266
Because this is a regional grid reliability project, the cost gets regionalized not just to Eversource customers, but to all New England rate bearers.

510
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,820
But method will bear a cost, right?

511
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,341
Method rate payers will bear a cost.

512
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,101
As everyone in Oman, yes.

513
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:37,861
But you're already paying those costs.

514
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:44,823
Out of your bill, there's a transmission charge, and that charge is for these types of projects to be built.

515
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:46,423
But it's going to go up now.

516
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:47,403
No, no.

517
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:51,644
There will not be any change on the rate on the tariff.

518
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:54,685
He just said the cost is going to go up.

519
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:56,585
That specific element.

520
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:02,180
Well, I don't want anyone to think that this is going to be, you know, we're getting a freebie here because we're not.

521
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:09,184
So is there any way that maybe you can figure out approximately what the cost can be once you get going?

522
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,826
Yeah, for Medford.

523
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:15,508
If I could suggest, I don't mean to interrupt,

524
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:47,851
Why don't we make that part of the ongoing resolutions, is that your office get back to me to, in the overall scope of the project, what would be the community per community expectation or the customer's expectation of the cost to the average rate payer for their electricity?

525
00:41:49,832 --> 00:41:53,235
The issue that I have with that, Mr. President, is this.

526
00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:01,212
You just said $6 to $9 million per mile, and we had approximately 3.2 miles, you said, in the city of Medford.

527
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:10,295
But I think is that going to be fair enough to say that the entire community pays the cost, or is it just the location that it's going to serve?

528
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:13,016
I mean, is this going to serve the entire city?

529
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:15,017
I think this is a regional issue.

530
00:42:18,547 --> 00:42:28,169
project, and it's intended to actually address the New England region, ISO New England's regional requirements.

531
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:32,329
So this will be a charge that will be spread across the region.

532
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,250
It won't be just the community of Medford or Winchester or some of them.

533
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:46,712
It will be the entire rate base in the system that will bear the cost of this project, as well as the other two projects that are associated with the Greater Boston

534
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:50,013
But somewhere along the line, you're going to have some kind of an estimate of what this is going to be.

535
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:50,854
Yes, it will be.

536
00:42:51,054 --> 00:42:58,757
And again, I think it's a little preliminary for us to come up with an answer right now, but we'll be certainly happy to respond to that.

537
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:08,201
And the last question, Mr. President, is you have this section from here to here that you're going to be resolving because you're trying to make it regionalized and all of that.

538
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:09,002
Right.

539
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:11,743
What about the points getting to it from both ends?

540
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:14,344
Are they all regionalized or are they going to have to be done?

541
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:16,486
I don't know.

542
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:27,210
Well, no, that to the point that I was making earlier, this one particular eight-mile route is one of three unique solutions to this project.

543
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,691
Again, there was a one from Wakefield to Woburn.

544
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:34,592
There's a one from New Hampshire to Tewksbury.

545
00:43:35,352 --> 00:43:38,053
And that's just the three unique ones for Eversource.

546
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:43,015
To address all the needs that were brought up by the ISO, there's actually something I think 42

547
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:52,020
various projects that could go from a very simple, small line reconductor to new transformers and substations.

548
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,743
Throughout the entire New England region, various utilities will be doing various projects.

549
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:59,445
They all come together to solve this problem.

550
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:17,552
I mean, you know, again, using that air traffic analogy, I don't know why that works for me, but I would just say that this is to solve, you know, air traffic on the East Coast, and we are looking at specific airports and specific routes, but it affects the entire region.

551
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,828
But to your question, I think we can provide you a better answer.

552
00:44:23,088 --> 00:44:23,848
And I think we will.

553
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:28,429
I don't know whether we're there yet to have that information.

554
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,589
Yeah, whenever you do.

555
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:34,610
When I was talking about the $69 million per mile, that's a cost for us to install.

556
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,251
It's not a cost that residents will pay.

557
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:45,032
That's the cost that we'll be using to come up with the personal properties for the town.

558
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,360
Thank you.

559
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,701
Thank you, councillor Penta.

560
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:53,522
And councillor Knight.

561
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,523
Mr. President, thank you very much.

562
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:58,666
And thank you to the folks from Eversource for being here this evening.

563
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:02,088
I think this is a great opportunity for us to get some questions answered.

564
00:45:02,128 --> 00:45:06,952
But more importantly, this is the beginning of a long relationship from the way things look.

565
00:45:07,012 --> 00:45:10,494
So, you know, thank you very much for taking the time to be here for us this evening.

566
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:15,638
It looks like we had an open house in May of 2015.

567
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:17,660
Now there's going to be a filing in the second quarter of 2015.

568
00:45:21,215 --> 00:45:21,775
a public hearing.

569
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,156
When do you anticipate that public hearing would occur?

570
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:29,357
I know that you guys aren't the ones that control it or that are going to hold it, but I know that you also have experience in this.

571
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:30,418
I believe it will be this fall.

572
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:31,018
This fall.

573
00:45:31,098 --> 00:45:40,260
But again, that's a public utilities energy facility siting board decision, and they will control that process.

574
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:49,243
We will certainly be available and work with them, but it's really their process, but we'll be involved all the way through.

575
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:53,676
So in terms of a timeline, we're looking at a filing in the second quarter of 2015.

576
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,658
In the fall of 2016, there'll be a public hearing.

577
00:45:57,098 --> 00:45:59,319
And then we won't see construction start until the fall of 2017?

578
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,260
That's right.

579
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,702
In the fall of 15 for the first.

580
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:08,064
In a couple months this fall, we would see potentially the first open house from DPU.

581
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:09,305
The first open house in the fall.

582
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:11,843
and public hearings.

583
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:12,763
Public hearing.

584
00:46:13,383 --> 00:46:14,643
You guys do the public house, right?

585
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:14,803
Right.

586
00:46:15,044 --> 00:46:18,645
I've seen them where they do them when they're from three to four months after the petition is filed.

587
00:46:18,905 --> 00:46:20,725
Three to four months after the petition is filed.

588
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:20,925
Right.

589
00:46:21,305 --> 00:46:28,088
I think the issue is simply that the agenda for the Energy Facilities Signing Board is pretty packed.

590
00:46:28,408 --> 00:46:30,308
They have a number of projects that are pending.

591
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:34,610
And so we don't know where we'll fall in that schedule.

592
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,311
So that's my concern is that we have a public hearing on the issue and then

593
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:48,023
six, 12, 18 months pass and then construction starts and the residents forget about the public hearing that we had and what was discussed.

594
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:15,261
And also I would point out that a butters list that we use to notify everybody that's 4,000 plus invitees, that is the same list that the EP will use for their hearing.

595
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:18,842
So there will be proactive reaching out to all those people.

596
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:26,004
This public hearing, when it's conducted, is this a public hearing that's exclusively for Medford or is this a regional public hearing for the entire pipeline project?

597
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:29,432
The public hearing, I believe, will be regional, but we don't know that yet.

598
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:32,212
We'll have to wait to see what the EFSB decides.

599
00:47:32,713 --> 00:47:52,497
But I think what is important to note is that all of the abutters that have been notified as certified by each city and town, we provide a full list, and they tell us who, if properties have passed hands in the interim, they'll tell us if there's new residents, and they will have been addressed in that process.

600
00:47:53,357 --> 00:47:55,258
Mr. President, I'd like the committee to report reflect

601
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:59,438
the council requests that the public hearing be held in the city of Memphis.

602
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:00,578
Very good.

603
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:04,379
So that will be an amendment to the ongoing resolution.

604
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,080
And again, gentlemen, thank you very much for your time.

605
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,441
And I appreciate you coming down here.

606
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:11,742
Like I said, I think it's important that we start this project off on the wrong foot.

607
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:17,363
Councilor Caviello alluded to the fact that I reside right there in the neighborhood where the pipeline is going through.

608
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:22,245
And if you repair the streets in better condition that they're in now, we still might need some work.

609
00:48:22,285 --> 00:48:23,305
The way that things are right now.

610
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:26,951
So I can certainly appreciate you guys taking the time down here, and I thank you for that.

611
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:30,153
I think this is going to be the first of many discussions that we have.

612
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:32,695
So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest.

613
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:34,697
Thank you very much, Councilor Anais.

614
00:48:34,777 --> 00:48:35,657
Councilor Caviello.

615
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:37,399
Thank you, Mr. President.

616
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,545
I was going to ask the same question that Councilor Pantera asked, where does the consumer fit into this project here?

617
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:47,727
But I think you've answered that.

618
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:52,651
My only other concern is I would hope that you'd be coordinating with the city

619
00:48:53,543 --> 00:49:04,285
especially when you get down to that South Street, Main Street area, that you're not going to be working at the same time that we're working on the bridge, because the city is going to be all constructioned out for a bit, for the next four years.

620
00:49:04,485 --> 00:49:14,247
Well, we've been in touch with the city engineer and the EW director, and we'll be working with them closely to try to work out the traffic management plan.

621
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:21,449
Well, I mean, not so much traffic management, but that South and Main Street area is going to be bogged down with

622
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,162
the bridge project that's going to be happening there for the next two and a half years.

623
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:28,863
So, yeah.

624
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,104
Yeah.

625
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:32,725
Will we affect that?

626
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:40,088
Well, I mean, you're going to be working, you know, like 50 yards from it, you know, at some point when you make that turn there.

627
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:40,989
Okay.

628
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:43,270
On main to south.

629
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,370
When you turn on the south there.

630
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:45,831
So, like I said.

631
00:49:45,871 --> 00:49:47,432
We'll certainly work with them closely.

632
00:49:47,812 --> 00:49:49,632
It's not our intention to.

633
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,733
No, I know it's not your intention to do it.

634
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:56,612
But I say that would be a major concern because now you'd affect the traffic going in.

635
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:59,493
Bad enough where we're affecting the traffic that's in the square now.

636
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:11,576
But Route 16 right now is a horrible road to ride on for the people that are going to be in.

637
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:17,917
At some point when you cross over and you're going to continue up, I really feel bad for the people

638
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:22,445
They've been living in that section for the last two years, construction.

639
00:50:22,505 --> 00:50:26,328
Now they're going to have to put up another year or two of construction.

640
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:34,414
Again, I want to stress that our construction in any one specific area is not going to be a year or two years.

641
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:39,197
I know, but you're going to be back in front of the house again where they've been the last two years.

642
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:41,399
They've been jackhammering and

643
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:46,654
I mean, their yards are ruined, their cars are ruined, their roads are ruined.

644
00:50:46,694 --> 00:50:51,096
Now they're going to get a nice new street for about a year, and then they're going to come up and dig it up again.

645
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:58,858
Well, I guess the only thing I can say is that we will leave it in better condition than we found it.

646
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,219
Well, you'd have to go curb to curb.

647
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:04,000
If it's a brand new street, we will go curb to curb.

648
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,761
Mr. President, can you make sure that's in the paper, that they will go curb to curb?

649
00:51:08,122 --> 00:51:09,362
Duly noted, Mr. Councilor.

650
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:12,990
Councilor Camuso.

651
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:18,713
Thank you very much, and I want to thank you guys for coming here this evening for this presentation.

652
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:22,496
And I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward last week.

653
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:34,644
I realize that it's a few years away from actually putting the shovel into the ground, but the City Council wants to make sure that the citizens know what's going on and what the timeline is.

654
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:40,988
So I want to thank you, Councilor Marks, and also President De La Russo for getting them here so quickly.

655
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:51,895
Within seven days, we're here with a great presentation, so look forward to the additional communication over the coming years, and we'll see where we go.

656
00:51:52,095 --> 00:52:03,918
And I do agree with Councillor Knight that we should have a public hearing here in the City of Medford, even if it's on top of other ones that may be mandated throughout the region that the project is taking place in.

657
00:52:04,531 --> 00:52:12,334
even if it's separate and distinct, at least for our residents, to get the opportunity to be heard on this critical matter.

658
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,716
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

659
00:52:14,956 --> 00:52:16,456
Motion to receive and place on file.

660
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:19,538
So on the motion, we'll require some action.

661
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:20,718
Oh, I'm sorry.

662
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:25,981
So on the main motion of Councilor Marks as amended by the several councilors, all those in favor?

663
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:26,801
Aye.

664
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:27,221
Opposed?

665
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:28,862
So done.

666
00:52:29,202 --> 00:52:31,443
Thank you very much for your presence here, all of you.

667
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:32,523
Mr. President?

668
00:52:33,044 --> 00:52:33,264
Thank you.

669
00:52:38,418 --> 00:52:46,121
We look forward to that.

670
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:47,762
Thank you very much.

671
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:48,242
Mr. President.

672
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:50,523
While we're on suspension, Councillor Camuso.

673
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:59,227
I move to take paper 15-486 for the young lady in the audience from the Mystic Valley that is here on a paper.

674
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:00,247
Very good.

675
00:53:00,788 --> 00:53:02,648
So, paper number 1586.

676
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:05,210
To the honourable President.

677
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:32,131
May 13, 2015, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve of the following amendment, the revised ordinances entitled Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel.

678
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:38,204
City of Medford amendment to revised ordinances, compensation plan and leave ordinances.

679
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:49,493
Chapter 66 personnel, be it ordained by the city council of the city of Medford in chapter 66 entitled personnel article two entitled classification and compensation plans.

680
00:53:49,974 --> 00:54:00,322
Section 66 dash 33, uh, adding the following after director of veteran services grade C a F 12 title outreach abuse

681
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:05,145
Outreach Agent Substance Abuse.

682
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:14,190
This ordinance is in response to City Council Resolution 15-294 and is funded in the fiscal year 16 budget.

683
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,012
Very truly yours, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

684
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,513
Mr. President, if I may.

685
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:21,894
Councillor, please do.

686
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:25,115
If I may, real quick on this particular matter.

687
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,977
Mayor McGlynn actually gave me a call this afternoon.

688
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:39,365
This is the paper that initiated here at the Medford City Council, and it's in direct correlation to the other stuff that Brooke and Penny are working on.

689
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:52,330
We will be one of the first communities in the area to have a full-time Office of Substance Abuse and Treatment Opportunity slash education, I'd like to assume.

690
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,893
This is a full-time position, I believe Boston, under the leadership of Mayor Walsh.

691
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:14,739
has a full-time position as well, but the mayor clearly worked with the council on this, and it is coming to fruition, so I wanna move approval on this, and it's a department head position for this particular matter before us, so I'd like to move approval.

692
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:25,467
So on the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, and I spoke with the mayor also this afternoon, and he'd like me to

693
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:42,804
uh, inform you all that, uh, he's moving forward on this, uh, and, uh, at our request and that, uh, just a couple pieces of the job description of being tidied up before it's, uh, uh, being, uh, advertised.

694
00:55:43,184 --> 00:55:45,967
So we're, um, uh, grateful for this measure.

695
00:55:46,587 --> 00:55:51,432
And, uh, I think, uh, the council, uh, can congratulate itself.

696
00:55:51,888 --> 00:55:54,890
And I'd like to motion to waive the three readings on this where it's.

697
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,711
With a motion to waive the three readings.

698
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:58,212
Ma'am, do you wish to address us?

699
00:55:58,432 --> 00:55:59,853
Please state your name and address for the record.

700
00:56:00,813 --> 00:56:01,294
Good evening.

701
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:07,237
My name is Brooke Hoyt, 120 Brookings Street, and I'm also a city employee through the Board of Health.

702
00:56:08,117 --> 00:56:10,359
I just want to just give support for the position.

703
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:11,760
It's a much needed position.

704
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,723
Substance abuse in the city of Medford and throughout the country is an ongoing issue.

705
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:20,985
So establishing this type of position will just

706
00:56:21,332 --> 00:56:24,714
continue primary prevention outreach and recovery efforts.

707
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:26,375
And again, it is much needed.

708
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:28,537
We have the data to support it.

709
00:56:28,957 --> 00:56:31,959
It'll be a position that we can continue to monitor the data.

710
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:41,886
I have not seen the job description, so I'm anxious to read the job description and know that the mayor and yourselves will provide the best opportunity for our community.

711
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,168
And thank you for your good work on this matter.

712
00:56:45,828 --> 00:56:46,228
Thank you.

713
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:47,409
Madam Vice President.

714
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,930
President de la Rousseau.

715
00:56:50,303 --> 00:56:54,266
The mayor or mayor's office state when the job description will be ready?

716
00:56:56,047 --> 00:56:57,488
They did not state when it would be ready.

717
00:56:57,528 --> 00:57:02,131
The personnel director can speak more about the position, but I know she's away on vacation at the moment.

718
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:14,118
The mayor does want to have conversations with families and other people within the community about the job description before putting it into motion.

719
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:16,219
And this will be 40 hours a week?

720
00:57:18,624 --> 00:57:25,207
Did he say how much this was going to be funded for?

721
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:30,010
It would be between $75,000 and $79,000.

722
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:30,330
CAF 12.

723
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,170
How much?

724
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:31,590
$75,000 and $79,000.

725
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,010
Yeah.

726
00:57:32,071 --> 00:57:35,472
CAF 12, step one, and then right through step five, I believe.

727
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:36,573
Department head level.

728
00:57:36,713 --> 00:57:37,473
Department head level.

729
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:39,634
Same as the Director of Veterans Affairs.

730
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:47,418
And do we have any idea of when

731
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,380
when the job will be advertised?

732
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:56,242
I assume once it's approved that it would be advertised immediately.

733
00:57:56,562 --> 00:58:02,544
I mean, I would give a couple weeks to put the description together and then it would start as soon as possible.

734
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:04,524
Thank you.

735
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:05,004
Thanks.

736
00:58:05,204 --> 00:58:06,645
Thank you so much for coming, Brooke.

737
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:08,285
Thank you, Councillor DelaRusso.

738
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,746
My only concern would be waiving the readings.

739
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:12,046
I would like to have some sort of

740
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:25,772
reason for the administration to come back and maybe discuss job description with us, you know, maybe discuss when it goes out for advertisement, maybe possibly find out who's applying.

741
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:28,914
I would like the council to be involved in the process.

742
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:36,401
I mean, it's a concern that each one of us have discussed week after week, month after month, especially, you know, going through this epidemic.

743
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:41,245
So my only concern would be waiving the three readings and giving up full control.

744
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:49,444
and allowing the administration to just do whatever they want.

745
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:54,648
We've discussed it, whether it be school committee meetings or city council meetings or here at the floor.

746
00:58:55,388 --> 00:59:10,499
There are so many prongs to the problem, whether it be prevention in our schools, lack of treatment, helping families get through what they're going through, helping the police and giving them

747
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:12,428
the help they need.

748
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,929
I mean, there's so many different things.

749
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:18,892
So I don't want to get lost on one or two of the probably 10 prongs that there are.

750
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:20,613
I want to make sure that we have a say.

751
00:59:20,753 --> 00:59:27,457
So I would say move approval tonight, but let it come back before us so that we can hopefully.

752
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:39,485
And with that, if we could get the job description when it's complete, if we could make an amendment that we get the job description so we can review it and make our recommendations and be able to help with that.

753
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,564
I think that's probably the best avenue.

754
00:59:41,984 --> 00:59:56,754
Mr. President, I will withdraw my motion, but just to be fair and full disclosure for the viewing public, this is only to put the title in the personnel ordinance.

755
00:59:57,915 --> 01:00:01,477
Without us doing our job and approving this, there is no job.

756
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,980
So, I mean, the description may not even be done until

757
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:11,600
after the mayor knows that there's full support of this council, but I'll withdraw the three readings and see where it goes.

758
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,722
Point of information, Mr. President?

759
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:16,564
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

760
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:21,807
So if it's only for a description, is it safe to say that the money is already appropriated in this year's budget?

761
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,208
It says it right at the last line.

762
01:00:23,748 --> 01:00:26,650
The money is funded in the fiscal year 2016 budget.

763
01:00:27,071 --> 01:00:30,813
Right, so once we approve it, then the money's there to fund it, so.

764
01:00:31,093 --> 01:00:32,434
Yeah, according to what the mayor says.

765
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:35,656
Right, so I would agree with Councilor Longo.

766
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:36,337
I withdrew it.

767
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:42,082
Councilor Penta, you were all set, Madam Vice President.

768
01:00:42,122 --> 01:00:43,323
Yes, I apologize.

769
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:49,107
During today, I don't know if you've read in today's globe in the city and the town of Plymouth, huge epidemic down there.

770
01:00:49,268 --> 01:00:52,630
They've had over 101 people I think have passed on.

771
01:00:52,670 --> 01:01:01,398
I think the governor was down there and I believe there's something that's going down there with the sheriff of that particular County and it's, it's, it's vastly spreading throughout the Commonwealth.

772
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:04,340
You just made an indication that who is the personnel director?

773
01:01:07,535 --> 01:01:08,316
Yeah, it was Mila.

774
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:09,338
No, she said she wasn't.

775
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:12,683
Then I'm not aware.

776
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,287
Yeah, because when I spoke to her, she said she wasn't.

777
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:16,669
So we don't know.

778
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:19,914
Can we get Mr. Quirk on this as a side note?

779
01:01:19,934 --> 01:01:21,577
Can we find out who the personnel director is?

780
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:25,147
Who is the new personnel director?

781
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,348
At this point, it would be Louise Miller.

782
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:30,210
No, in my conversation with her, she did not get that title.

783
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,291
She told me that she was too, personally.

784
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,992
She told me she was the director of personnel.

785
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:35,974
So can we just find out officially if she is?

786
01:01:35,994 --> 01:01:38,175
And her salary was commensurate with that position.

787
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:40,957
Also- Just to let you know- Pardon me?

788
01:01:41,515 --> 01:01:42,615
You withdrew the three readings.

789
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:43,576
Okay.

790
01:01:43,876 --> 01:01:47,998
All I'm really doing from here is you're passing you to take the first reading, right?

791
01:01:48,198 --> 01:01:48,338
Yeah.

792
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:50,199
So you're going to have to find out all this other stuff.

793
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:54,160
I mean, you can amend, you know, you're going to amend the first reading.

794
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:55,601
Is that what you're doing?

795
01:01:56,361 --> 01:02:00,963
So you can ask, you can ask, you can ask some other questions, but that's just, you know, that's all you're doing for Mike.

796
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:01,623
Cause I have to go.

797
01:02:01,724 --> 01:02:03,844
I'm advertising the first reading.

798
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:08,326
If we can get the information that also comes back and if it is a CAF 12, um,

799
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:14,153
as we usually normally get in our budget, it puts the dollar amount next to it.

800
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:15,514
So I agree with council Lungo.

801
01:02:15,974 --> 01:02:20,755
And I think we have never passed having an audience without knowing what the description is for.

802
01:02:20,795 --> 01:02:22,056
So I just think it makes sense.

803
01:02:22,756 --> 01:02:26,997
And no, no, on this one here, we have its first reading.

804
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:35,100
And when it comes back to the next reading, they can put the salary, what the salary is going to be in the description, salary description.

805
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,581
I'm just saying you've got to, you've got to create your separate resolution because this is,

806
01:02:39,135 --> 01:02:40,716
I'm advertising the first reading.

807
01:02:41,376 --> 01:02:42,117
That's what I'm doing.

808
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:43,617
You know what I mean?

809
01:02:43,637 --> 01:02:54,363
So create just, you want a salary, you want a, you want a personal director, you just make the resolution that, uh, you know, that we request the salary and the job description for this position.

810
01:02:54,423 --> 01:03:01,287
You want the personal scope of responsibilities and, uh, for the information of the council when and timeframe for that.

811
01:03:01,387 --> 01:03:04,248
And also on the D paper, who was this personnel director?

812
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:04,668
Yeah.

813
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:07,850
And secondly, on the B paper, who is the acting personnel director?

814
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:10,240
approval for the first reading.

815
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:19,404
On the seconded, we have counselor knight next.

816
01:03:20,605 --> 01:03:22,325
Mr. President, thank you very much.

817
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,067
Thank you very much for your work.

818
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:27,828
I'm very happy today.

819
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:29,609
I feel like this is very rewarding.

820
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:32,690
This council came together and we all agreed on an issue.

821
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,671
We worked together on it.

822
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:37,273
We petitioned the mayor for

823
01:03:38,662 --> 01:03:41,643
The mayor was in agreement that there is a problem in the city.

824
01:03:41,803 --> 01:03:46,105
The mayor is in agreement that this problem is a crisis and the mayor acted promptly.

825
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:50,746
So with that being said, Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the paper.

826
01:03:51,907 --> 01:03:55,168
I feel as though this is a step in the right direction and it just shows what this council can do.

827
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:59,029
We work together and we work with the administration to move towards positive results, Mr. President.

828
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:04,451
So with that being said, you know, I support this wholeheartedly and I too move for approval.

829
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:06,131
Very good, Councilor Knight.

830
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:07,512
So on the motion approved by Council,

831
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:10,730
seconded by Councillor Pinter, Councillor Max.

832
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:14,253
If I could, and thank you, Brooke, for coming up on all your work on this.

833
01:04:15,754 --> 01:04:19,616
Is there going to be a dedicated space within City Hall for this new position?

834
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:22,378
And if so, where will it be?

835
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:31,145
I'm not aware of a dedicated space at this point, but... Would you say the nature of this type of position would call for an area that... Absolutely.

836
01:04:31,885 --> 01:04:35,348
You know, that provides some privacy and confidentiality and so forth?

837
01:04:35,588 --> 01:04:35,908
Correct.

838
01:04:35,928 --> 01:04:36,769
Okay.

839
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:39,885
If we could make that part of the paper, too, Mr. President.

840
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:43,627
Just where this office will be located.

841
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:51,631
I assume there will be an office, if there will be privacy and so forth, because of the nature of what's involved, Mr. President.

842
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:52,031
Very good.

843
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:59,554
So as an amendment to the B paper, where will the office be located within the structure of City Hall?

844
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:00,114
City Hall.

845
01:05:00,975 --> 01:05:04,716
So on the motion of approval, seconded by Councillor

846
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:12,819
Mr. Penta, Mr. Clerk, this requires a roll call as a matter of ordinance, no?

847
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:13,400
No.

848
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,500
No?

849
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:15,300
Very good.

850
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,601
So all those in favor?

851
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:18,261
All those opposed?

852
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:20,402
That carries.

853
01:05:20,422 --> 01:05:32,027
The paper, which was amended by the paper on the final council along with the current, which requests a job description.

854
01:05:41,662 --> 01:05:45,023
And I suspect a time frame for hiring.

855
01:05:45,544 --> 01:05:54,607
And also, amended by Councilor Max, a request for the location of the office in City Hall.

856
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,768
So that motion is one more thing that the Vice President.

857
01:05:58,628 --> 01:06:09,172
Quickly, what qualifications the administration is looking for, you know, degree of education, courses that, you know, this position will be required to have taken.

858
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:18,746
just so we get an idea of... Every city job description that goes on has that.

859
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:20,367
Scope of requirements.

860
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:20,687
Okay.

861
01:06:20,707 --> 01:06:21,027
Thank you.

862
01:06:21,588 --> 01:06:22,608
I did, Mr. President.

863
01:06:22,668 --> 01:06:23,688
Thank you very much.

864
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:28,010
Based on the timing of the release of this paper,

865
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:39,719
I do have concerns about the matter being held up because of the summer schedule of the council.

866
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:46,563
So I'd ask that if in fact when the paper becomes ready and available for us to vote on, then we hold a special meeting immediately to take care of it.

867
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:48,244
If in fact it falls during the summer schedule.

868
01:06:48,664 --> 01:06:50,985
And we make that as an amendment to the B paper as well.

869
01:06:51,786 --> 01:06:53,647
A call for a special meeting to vote on it.

870
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,851
The paper will be back before us in three weeks.

871
01:07:02,872 --> 01:07:03,192
Very good.

872
01:07:03,212 --> 01:07:05,013
So we'll still be in a normal session.

873
01:07:06,345 --> 01:07:09,007
If we have such a thing, Councilor Marks, you're all set.

874
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:13,171
So on the motion of approval, all those in favor, uh, Councilor Penta, I'm sorry.

875
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:14,692
I passed the chief of question.

876
01:07:20,257 --> 01:07:21,438
Are you aware of this position?

877
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:28,343
I am as of today, or actually a couple of days ago, I did, did understand this would be on the agenda for this evening.

878
01:07:28,964 --> 01:07:33,668
Is this particular individual, whoever he or she might be going to have access to

879
01:07:34,765 --> 01:07:38,967
police files and vice versa, because apparently this is going to be part of it.

880
01:07:39,927 --> 01:07:50,551
We expect to work very closely with whoever is in that position, as we do right now with the substance abuse agents here at City Hall, Brooke and Penta.

881
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:54,993
So they will provide them all the access that we can legally.

882
01:07:57,914 --> 01:07:58,214
That's it.

883
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:00,095
Thank you, Councilor Penta.

884
01:08:00,355 --> 01:08:02,076
So on the motion of approval, all those in favor?

885
01:08:02,216 --> 01:08:02,336
Aye.

886
01:08:02,676 --> 01:08:03,236
All those opposed?

887
01:08:04,088 --> 01:08:04,848
Motion carries.

888
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:07,409
Mr. Councilor Knight.

889
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:09,349
While we're into suspension, can we take paper 15485?

890
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:09,349
15485.

891
01:08:10,189 --> 01:08:29,474
On the motion of Councilor Knight, while under suspension, we're going to take all these communications from the mayor.

892
01:08:30,494 --> 01:08:33,115
So on that motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor, all those opposed?

893
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:35,919
The motion carries 15-485.

894
01:08:36,459 --> 01:09:00,154
To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve of the following amendments to revised ordinances entitled Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel, City of Medford, Amendment to Revised Ordinances, Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter

895
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:07,604
On a motion of Councilor Camuso to waive the reading, and if I could offer a synopsis.

896
01:09:07,884 --> 01:09:24,794
This was regarding a compensation plan for our library employees, and it was, is requested due to the recently negotiated agreement with the Medford Library Staff Association, Local 4928, MLSA, AFT, MAF, AFL,

897
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:55,852
The contract will expire on June 30, 2018, and this is a routine result of contract negotiations with this particular body, and it tidies up, I think, this year's raise and then is effective for the next three years at 2%.

898
01:09:56,876 --> 01:09:59,137
equally each year for all those.

899
01:09:59,377 --> 01:10:00,717
Mr. President.

900
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,018
Mr. Councillor.

901
01:10:04,759 --> 01:10:08,040
On this particular paper, you know what it shows?

902
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,822
It shows something that seems to be pretty consistent here for the next three years.

903
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,603
There's a 2% raise, 2% and 2%.

904
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:22,245
And from my understanding, as it relates to contracts that are forthcoming, I believe there's a whole host of them.

905
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,606
I think it bodes well for the community to know that

906
01:10:26,364 --> 01:10:31,047
If employees all working for the same government, they all work for the city of Medford, they all work for the taxpayers.

907
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:34,228
And I think we had this conversation many years ago.

908
01:10:34,248 --> 01:10:38,331
It would be nice if we could all step in line to the same amount on the percentages.

909
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:41,112
The other entitlements, the other benefits is a different story.

910
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:49,977
But at least it puts the house in a much better financial order to know that every employee is going to wind up getting the same amount of money by percentage because that's all the city can afford.

911
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:51,438
That's number one.

912
01:10:51,950 --> 01:11:04,054
Number two, I believe there was a lady here a few weeks ago and she was talking about the Method Public Library and the possibility, because they haven't reached a certain dollar amount, that a waiver could be attainable.

913
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:16,358
I believe that they just received their waiver from the Commonwealth of Mass, and they are one of 75 libraries that did receive that, and we're also in the Minuteman category.

914
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:21,560
So with that being said, Mr. President, not only do I move approval,

915
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:47,627
but I think it's a good step forward, and I think it's a step that we really need to sit down, and knowing the fact that we had to get a waiver to get into that category, I think we need to talk about that, and maybe, Mr. Clerk, put that as part of the resolution of approval when the budget time comes, as it relates to the waiver that the Memphis Public Library has now gotten, because they've been trying to get this for a few years, and they now got it.

916
01:11:48,647 --> 01:11:51,588
What is the situation that dictates the waiver

917
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:59,485
and what needs to be done so we can maybe go on the road, so to speak, without having to apply for a waiver.

918
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:02,627
I mean, what's the necessary ingredients to stay out of the waiver category?

919
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,309
So this is the waiver for the accreditation, you're saying?

920
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:11,494
No, the waiver to, there is a dollar amount that's a criteria that they have to be in.

921
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:15,137
And I don't know if the proper word is certification or qualification.

922
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:17,880
But that we did, wasn't that last week's resolution?

923
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,000
That was a few weeks ago.

924
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:20,902
Point of information, we did ask for that last week.

925
01:12:21,246 --> 01:12:21,766
But they got it.

926
01:12:22,026 --> 01:12:24,307
They got certified with the waiver.

927
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:25,848
No, we asked for the dollar amount.

928
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:27,049
I specifically asked for it.

929
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:28,229
No, no, I understand that.

930
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:29,530
But that's what I want to find out.

931
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:32,251
When they come in here to do the budget, let them come in to explain this.

932
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:35,433
So a lot of people ask the question, why does the library need a waiver?

933
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:36,913
What do they need the waiver for?

934
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:38,474
What's the dollar amount involved?

935
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:42,336
And how do we stay away from going into the waiver if something needs to be done?

936
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:44,917
Is it because of the building that's in desperate need of help?

937
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:55,814
between the roof leaking and the bathrooms that are desplicable and the books and some of the books, I don't know, but I think we need to discuss this.

938
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:59,216
Mr. President, you never shut my microphone off from when you took the paper out of order.

939
01:13:00,117 --> 01:13:01,038
I move for approval.

940
01:13:01,058 --> 01:13:01,998
Mr. President.

941
01:13:02,318 --> 01:13:02,819
Seconded.

942
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:04,139
Councillor Camuso.

943
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:09,363
Yes, I would just like to go on record that although Councillor Pentlander's

944
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:16,921
our motion, our thoughts regarding the same exact increases across the board.

945
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:18,161
It sounds good.

946
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:19,842
I think it's unrealistic.

947
01:13:20,242 --> 01:13:29,386
We have lunch mothers, we have paraprofessionals that are making $11,000 a year, and then we also have other unions that are across the board that are making $100,000 a year.

948
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:38,810
So to say that there should be parity amongst every single union, I just think that at this point, that's what the unions do, as well as

949
01:13:39,397 --> 01:13:43,120
the other side of management sitting at the table, and that is called negotiations.

950
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:57,131
If you just look at the past several years, too, there's been situations where the city has gotten back language from contracts that were put in in 1980s and 1970s, taken six days back, or personal days, and things of that nature.

951
01:13:57,772 --> 01:14:04,657
And when that happens, usually the other side gets something back.

952
01:14:05,704 --> 01:14:22,013
It's called negotiation, so although I agree with Councillor Penter, it sounds great, I just think that it's a little bit unrealistic where you can't compare the maxed out city worker and the maxed out lunch mother.

953
01:14:23,054 --> 01:14:24,635
There's no equity when it comes to that.

954
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:31,539
The 3% raise on $11,000 is not paying the gas bill increase each month.

955
01:14:32,095 --> 01:14:34,897
But with that being said, I'd like to waive the three readings on this paper, too.

956
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:39,059
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Penta is seconded by Councilor Knight.

957
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:44,123
And the motion to move the three readings by Councilor Camuso.

958
01:14:44,423 --> 01:14:44,883
On that motion.

959
01:14:44,903 --> 01:14:46,384
Councilor Penta, on that motion.

960
01:14:46,944 --> 01:14:48,686
I hear what Councilor Camuso was alluding to.

961
01:14:48,726 --> 01:14:54,889
But you just mentioned somebody, a group, that hasn't received a raise in, I think, eight years, if not more.

962
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,190
That's the lunch mothers.

963
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:56,671
Correct.

964
01:14:56,851 --> 01:14:57,151
OK.

965
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:58,572
They haven't received anything.

966
01:14:58,692 --> 01:15:01,894
They're like the forgotten school and the whole school department budget.

967
01:15:03,052 --> 01:15:10,273
And when you talk about percentages, whether it's 1%, 2%, or 3%, my idea was just looking at it from the point of view, what would the dollar cost be?

968
01:15:10,313 --> 01:15:14,654
A lot of these contracts go from zero to six months, and six months to 12 months.

969
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:16,894
So it's a barometer.

970
01:15:16,914 --> 01:15:17,755
It's a starting point.

971
01:15:18,115 --> 01:15:24,696
For those that don't remember, many years ago, I think John Golony, when he was the city manager, had indicated that that would probably be a pretty good way to start.

972
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:29,236
So you'd have an idea where your money would be going on an annual basis rather than every six months.

973
01:15:29,797 --> 01:15:32,137
But if we're going to get into that, I would hope,

974
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:48,239
The city administration this year recognizes loudly the lunch mothers in the method of public school system who have dedicated themselves for year in and year out for the measly, um, dollars that they make per hour for which they love it because they're around the kids, but they've been the forgotten souls.

975
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:54,102
And it becomes very tough as council along alluded to, and we've just got a $2 million increase this past year.

976
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,932
to hire seven new individuals making an excessive $90,000 a year.

977
01:15:58,892 --> 01:15:59,533
That's not right.

978
01:15:59,713 --> 01:16:05,336
So you need to take care of the people that are there that have paid their dues year in and year out, instead of hiring people at $90,000.

979
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:07,797
We don't even know if we can sustain them this year in the budget.

980
01:16:09,362 --> 01:16:12,084
The politics will certainly go around this budget.

981
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:17,167
Mrs. Jufri, Mrs. Diciara, Mrs. Szymanski, Mrs. Cermia.

982
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:18,108
Mrs. Gargold.

983
01:16:18,148 --> 01:16:19,228
Mrs. Basinati.

984
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:21,910
All my lunch mothers, I loved every one of them.

985
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:24,612
So on the motions for approval, Councilor Camuso.

986
01:16:24,692 --> 01:16:29,875
Just to follow up with that, I think Councilor Penta just proved the point that I was trying to make.

987
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:37,140
If you have a bargaining unit that hasn't got raises in eight years, like the lunch mothers, then the, uh,

988
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:45,169
raises should be commensurate with the length of time that surpassed since the last raise.

989
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:51,892
So I want to thank the councilor because I think we agree that my way is better on this particular matter.

990
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:52,592
Thank you.

991
01:16:52,632 --> 01:16:53,652
Councilor Knight, we're all set.

992
01:16:53,992 --> 01:16:54,993
Move for approval, Mr. Mayor.

993
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:55,693
On the motion.

994
01:16:56,173 --> 01:16:57,413
All those in favor?

995
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:57,934
Aye.

996
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,334
All those opposed?

997
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:00,995
And we waive the three readings.

998
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:07,677
So the matter is approved.

999
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:15,231
15483, communication from the Mayor to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

1000
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:29,263
Dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve of the following amendment to revised ordinances entitled, Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel.

1001
01:17:29,723 --> 01:17:36,009
City of Medford amendment to revised ordinances, Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances.

1002
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:43,486
Chapter 66, personnel be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford in Chapter 66, entitled Personnel.

1003
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:54,095
Article 2, entitled Classification and Compensation Plans, Section 66.40, entitled Public Safety Personnel, is hereby amended by adding the following.

1004
01:17:54,655 --> 01:17:59,239
Grade PS1A, title Student Officer, Step 1, $40,000 effective upon passage.

1005
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:08,202
The purpose of this ordinance change is to create a new classification for candidates attending the police academy.

1006
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:18,336
Upon graduation of approved police academies, the student officer will have successfully completed the prescribed course of study for basic police training.

1007
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:26,932
and to exercise police powers as mandated by Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 41, Section 96B.

1008
01:18:27,873 --> 01:18:31,194
Very truly yours, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

1009
01:18:31,634 --> 01:18:35,915
And with us tonight is the Chief to address this.

1010
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:41,097
And we have a motion for approval with the waiver of three readings for Councilor Camuso.

1011
01:18:41,737 --> 01:18:42,217
Mr. Chief.

1012
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:47,581
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Leo Sacco, police chief.

1013
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:50,002
I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford.

1014
01:18:51,062 --> 01:18:55,224
I want to thank you for hearing this this evening, and hopefully we have your support.

1015
01:18:55,244 --> 01:19:09,388
This is something the state had made an amendment to the law back in around 1995, so it's about 20 years ago, where they mandated, in addition to a number of things, primarily,

1016
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:17,364
Before an officer could exercise police powers on the street, they had to attend and successfully complete a police academy first.

1017
01:19:19,265 --> 01:19:28,009
Back in the day, it was a thing where they could put officers to work and then wait for an academy to open up and then schedule them for an academy at that point.

1018
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:35,633
So when that change was made, the state also recommended that communities adopt a student officer category.

1019
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:40,632
because they really do not have police powers until they successfully complete the academy.

1020
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:48,414
And right now, the academy, basic recruit academy, is somewhere in excess of 800 hours of curriculum.

1021
01:19:49,194 --> 01:19:54,156
So it only makes sense that they be appointed as a student officer first.

1022
01:19:55,136 --> 01:20:01,679
Right now, we appoint them as police officers or patrolmen, as they are called in the ordinance.

1023
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:04,500
And they were appointed as police officers.

1024
01:20:06,206 --> 01:20:13,554
the day that they're sworn in, that their police powers do not begin until they successfully complete the academy.

1025
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:21,463
It could be a problem that hasn't presented itself as a problem for us, but it could potentially be a problem with someone's attitude.

1026
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:29,004
actually go out and affect an arrest because they felt as though they were sworn in as a police officer.

1027
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,345
That's the category that they're sworn in as.

1028
01:20:31,925 --> 01:20:35,388
So it's safer for us to have them sworn in as student officers.

1029
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:40,251
And during that six month period that they're in the academy, they are student officers.

1030
01:20:40,311 --> 01:20:46,134
When they complete and graduate, they'd be the badge pinning in their full uniform here at City Hall.

1031
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:53,839
It'd be an actual swearing in ceremony at that point as police officers once they successfully complete the academy.

1032
01:20:57,297 --> 01:20:57,937
Thank you, Chief.

1033
01:20:59,258 --> 01:20:59,778
Counselor Knight.

1034
01:21:00,518 --> 01:21:03,659
Chief, what's the step one patrolman receive at this point in time?

1035
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:04,980
Right now, it's significantly higher.

1036
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:05,740
It's between $56,000 and $57,000.

1037
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,321
There's a 2% pay raise on June 30th.

1038
01:21:07,341 --> 01:21:13,823
So I believe it's $57,000 and change as of June 30th this year is the step one for patrol officer.

1039
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:34,331
And presently, the individuals that have been selected as officers but have not completed the academy would be compensated at a rate based upon the $56,000?

1040
01:21:34,631 --> 01:21:38,934
If they are sworn in as police officers, yes.

1041
01:21:40,335 --> 01:21:42,977
But they can't be seen as a police officer until?

1042
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:45,839
Until they graduate the academy successfully.

1043
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:51,243
So at this point in time, there are no student officers and an individual that was going through the academy wouldn't be compensated at all?

1044
01:21:52,344 --> 01:21:53,505
Or would be compensated at a rate of $56,000?

1045
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:54,863
at the $56,000.

1046
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,965
They would be compensated at the higher rate right now.

1047
01:21:58,046 --> 01:21:58,846
While they're in the academy.

1048
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:07,134
While they're in the academy, but if the ordinance were to pass, the ordinance change, the title would be student officer and it would be significantly lower.

1049
01:22:07,814 --> 01:22:11,277
And they are considered employees of the city of Medford while they are in the academy?

1050
01:22:11,778 --> 01:22:15,521
They are, but they are not covered by civil service.

1051
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:18,144
They are not covered by the unions.

1052
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,531
until they successfully complete.

1053
01:22:20,951 --> 01:22:22,451
They do not earn sick time.

1054
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,612
They do not earn injury.

1055
01:22:25,072 --> 01:22:30,494
In the line of duty, they'd have to be on worker's comp if they were injured while attending the academy.

1056
01:22:31,174 --> 01:22:32,655
So they are a different category.

1057
01:22:32,675 --> 01:22:35,496
If they wouldn't be considered a police officer, they'd fall under the civilian status?

1058
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:36,276
Right.

1059
01:22:39,077 --> 01:22:40,258
Mr. President, I move for approval.

1060
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:42,178
And I'd ask that the three readings be waived.

1061
01:22:42,898 --> 01:22:43,239
Very good.

1062
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:46,020
Thank you, President Diller.

1063
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:46,960
Madam Vice President.

1064
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:49,206
I think you answered one of my questions.

1065
01:22:49,266 --> 01:22:57,970
So currently, or in the past, those attending the police academy have been paid, but they've been paid at this rate.

1066
01:22:58,931 --> 01:22:59,411
That's correct.

1067
01:23:00,912 --> 01:23:05,874
And you mentioned something about in 1995, there was an amendment by the state at that time.

1068
01:23:05,894 --> 01:23:07,975
It was when we should have accepted this.

1069
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:11,377
Well, I know there was some discussion at the time.

1070
01:23:11,437 --> 01:23:16,560
And almost any time there's something going on, there's always another issue that takes your eye off of the prize.

1071
01:23:18,836 --> 01:23:21,357
It was sidetracked at the earlier date.

1072
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:24,820
It didn't seem to be that important at that point in time.

1073
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,921
Okay, so do we have anybody in the academy currently?

1074
01:23:28,162 --> 01:23:40,049
No, we do not, but we are in the process of screening candidates to place on the reserve list, and it is hoped that before the end of the year, we're supposed to be screening seven candidates for the reserve list.

1075
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:46,953
We're hoping that with the new fiscal budget in July, that we'd be able to maybe appoint four of those as

1076
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:51,169
permanent offices, but starting out as a student officer for an academy.

1077
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:54,411
And how many retirees do we have this year, do you know?

1078
01:23:56,232 --> 01:23:56,532
Four.

1079
01:24:02,556 --> 01:24:03,376
I know that was off topic.

1080
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:06,998
I just figured that was a question that I wanted to get answered.

1081
01:24:07,138 --> 01:24:12,341
I agree that this is something that probably should have been done a while ago.

1082
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:15,083
So I think it's definitely time to do it.

1083
01:24:15,534 --> 01:24:21,336
And I think a separate category for those that are in the academy is probably necessary.

1084
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,017
So you have my approval.

1085
01:24:23,677 --> 01:24:25,298
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1086
01:24:25,338 --> 01:24:25,998
Counselor Penta.

1087
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,900
Chief, you said this came out in 1995.

1088
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,080
That's almost 20 years ago.

1089
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,321
Well, there was a lot of change.

1090
01:24:32,481 --> 01:24:40,064
And at that time it was a recommended practice and many communities over the course of the past 20 years did change their ordinance to reflect that.

1091
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,225
Um, we were just,

1092
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:45,584
a little later than others in getting this to the table.

1093
01:24:46,825 --> 01:24:53,769
Now, this title of student officer, since we didn't have this before, what were these trainees called?

1094
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:54,650
Policemen.

1095
01:24:55,531 --> 01:24:56,611
Patrolmen, actually.

1096
01:24:56,631 --> 01:24:57,772
That was the title, patrolmen.

1097
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:04,297
We tried to call them patrol officers, but the title in the city charter says patrolmen.

1098
01:25:05,237 --> 01:25:06,718
So you're going to be going from the $56,000 or $57,000 range down to $40,000.

1099
01:25:06,758 --> 01:25:07,839
That's the recommended figure.

1100
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:34,356
And the benefit for that would be, depending on where we are in the fiscal year and where our budget is during the fiscal year, it may mean that we could appoint maybe one or two additional because of the lower starting rate, which would allow us to budget appropriately at graduation time for bringing them up to step one.

1101
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:37,939
Then let me ask you the next question.

1102
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:39,040
I don't know if you can answer this.

1103
01:25:40,278 --> 01:25:41,699
You're calling it student officer.

1104
01:25:42,059 --> 01:25:45,602
Is this going to have the same implication for the fire department?

1105
01:25:45,802 --> 01:25:46,342
I don't think so.

1106
01:25:46,362 --> 01:25:50,085
They're not covered under the same regulation.

1107
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,766
But do they have a law similar to this?

1108
01:25:52,627 --> 01:25:54,988
I don't want to speak for the fire chief, and I could be totally wrong.

1109
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:57,070
And I'm probably going down the wrong road on this.

1110
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:05,255
But my understanding is that the fire department city could hire a firefighter and wait for an academy to open.

1111
01:26:06,136 --> 01:26:07,457
And I believe they end up

1112
01:26:08,133 --> 01:26:14,235
probably dispatching or working in the firehouse with some training at the initial step.

1113
01:26:14,735 --> 01:26:18,956
I could be totally wrong on that, but I believe the law is somewhat different for firefighters.

1114
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:28,278
Police officers are not allowed to exert or exercise any police authority until they successfully complete the academy.

1115
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:30,919
Right now, we swear them in as patrolmen.

1116
01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:34,180
God forbid we could have a problem, someone stops a motor vehicle,

1117
01:26:35,077 --> 01:26:36,717
and tries to affect an arrest.

1118
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:39,098
And they really don't have that power.

1119
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:41,539
But we're swearing them in as police officers.

1120
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:44,459
So in essence, they're only trainees, correct?

1121
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:45,820
That's it, student officer.

1122
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,341
That's why we're saying the language, so it'd be consistent with the statute, Chapter 49.

1123
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:53,722
But an officer doesn't give the same implication as a trainee.

1124
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:54,902
There's a difference.

1125
01:26:55,222 --> 01:27:01,384
No, once they're sworn in as a police officer upon graduation from the academy, they have full police powers.

1126
01:27:04,003 --> 01:27:08,804
So what's the period of time from the time somebody, you bring them on and they graduate the academy?

1127
01:27:08,984 --> 01:27:09,584
What's the time period?

1128
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:11,165
It's approximately six months.

1129
01:27:11,725 --> 01:27:13,665
So that's what these people are, student officers?

1130
01:27:13,825 --> 01:27:14,605
Student officers.

1131
01:27:14,845 --> 01:27:17,746
So why don't they call them student trainees, student police trainees?

1132
01:27:18,046 --> 01:27:18,286
I mean.

1133
01:27:18,326 --> 01:27:19,106
Well, no, officer.

1134
01:27:19,126 --> 01:27:22,507
I mean, the term officer, they're student officers, not police officers.

1135
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:24,967
That happens upon graduation.

1136
01:27:25,668 --> 01:27:27,508
Yeah, but couldn't a student officer mean anything

1137
01:27:28,337 --> 01:27:31,037
Student officer, we're going with the language that's in the statute, 4196B.

1138
01:27:31,258 --> 01:27:32,358
That's the statute?

1139
01:27:32,598 --> 01:27:34,158
That's the general law statute?

1140
01:27:34,598 --> 01:27:38,059
Chapter 41, section 96B refers to them as student officers.

1141
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:39,319
OK.

1142
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:41,239
Thank you, Counselor Penta.

1143
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:42,259
Counselor Marks.

1144
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:43,980
Thank you, Mr. President.

1145
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:51,641
Chief, you could potentially have an academy-trained officer on the reserve list, correct?

1146
01:27:52,201 --> 01:27:52,401
Yes.

1147
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:57,102
And if, I know you said in the past you would not call upon them for any

1148
01:27:57,724 --> 01:28:01,947
duties, but if you, I guess under the general laws, you're allowed to.

1149
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:08,873
But we'd have to provide them some degree of training locally before we could do that.

1150
01:28:09,533 --> 01:28:10,974
Believe me, it's not my goal.

1151
01:28:11,235 --> 01:28:12,295
It hasn't been my goal.

1152
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,518
If they're on a reserve list, we're not going to work them.

1153
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:34,975
If we have the opportunity to have an academy-trained person on the list that gets screened for the police department, I would be pleading with the mayor to appoint the person as a police officer, not place them on the reserve list, because we get the automatic benefit of being able to put them right to work.

1154
01:28:36,095 --> 01:28:39,896
Maybe an eight-week field training program, and they'd be able to go right to work.

1155
01:28:40,577 --> 01:28:46,058
So let's just say you had a call upon someone that was a trained past the academy.

1156
01:28:46,591 --> 01:28:52,654
They had some training, and they were on the reserve list, and you had to call upon them for whatever emergency circumstance.

1157
01:28:53,915 --> 01:29:01,318
Would they get the starting salary of the $40,000, or would they get a police officer's starting salary?

1158
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,100
I wouldn't be calling upon them.

1159
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:08,081
Just say you did, Chief.

1160
01:29:08,141 --> 01:29:13,224
Because there isn't a category for payment for anyone that's on the reserve list right now.

1161
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,901
Right, and that's my question.

1162
01:29:14,921 --> 01:29:17,523
They're not police officers until they're appointed as such.

1163
01:29:18,003 --> 01:29:20,024
If they're appointed to the reserve list.

1164
01:29:20,045 --> 01:29:22,506
But the law allows you to use them, Chief.

1165
01:29:22,586 --> 01:29:26,409
My understanding is if they're on the list, you could use them.

1166
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,811
I could use them if I put them through a training program.

1167
01:29:30,872 --> 01:29:40,939
If I have an academy-trained individual that's already passed the 800-hour curriculum and is sitting on the reserve list, I would just repeat what I just said.

1168
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:45,118
I'd be pleading for him to fill an open void we have in the department right now.

1169
01:29:45,178 --> 01:29:47,559
So you don't know what salary they would get if you did use them?

1170
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,620
I think the chief answered that, that it's not going to be.

1171
01:29:52,640 --> 01:30:01,323
You know, if I, if I had to use them, I just thinking of this chief, this chief, you know, you've been around for a while, chief, and you may not be the chief in 10 years from now.

1172
01:30:01,343 --> 01:30:03,303
And I'm just the worst situation.

1173
01:30:03,343 --> 01:30:09,285
If we had a natural disaster or something, we had to put people to work as a,

1174
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:18,440
you know, watching for, you know, down wires, helping, you know, people evacuate a building, get them, get them onto a bus.

1175
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:25,465
Uh, if we had a call upon them to bring them in for something like that, they'd probably be getting the starting rate of a police officer.

1176
01:30:26,146 --> 01:30:26,306
Okay.

1177
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:28,528
So, so they wouldn't fall into the student office.

1178
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,270
They wouldn't, they wouldn't, unless they're attending the Academy.

1179
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:35,914
I'm specifically speaking about Academy trained.

1180
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:38,736
But if they're already, if they're already Academy trained,

1181
01:30:39,305 --> 01:30:56,050
You know, the goal would be to appoint them as police officers, not on the reserve list, but police officers, and put them through the field training program, which lasts for approximately eight weeks, maybe sometimes 10 weeks, depending on how quickly they grasp what goes on in the city.

1182
01:30:56,810 --> 01:31:01,091
But if we had that benefit, you know, in a couple of cases, we've had that.

1183
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:06,653
You know, we've had academy-trained people appear on our list, and that's a benefit to the city.

1184
01:31:11,115 --> 01:31:12,156
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1185
01:31:12,236 --> 01:31:12,976
Councilor Caviello.

1186
01:31:14,277 --> 01:31:22,261
Chief, with all the construction projects going around, would these gentlemen be, these offices be available for details or?

1187
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:26,263
Not based on the ordinance change that's here tonight, no.

1188
01:31:26,623 --> 01:31:30,225
And the reserve offices, we would not be utilizing them for details.

1189
01:31:31,025 --> 01:31:31,705
Absolutely not.

1190
01:31:33,146 --> 01:31:37,608
Now, we've talked about miles of construction going on in the city.

1191
01:31:38,009 --> 01:31:40,430
Where are we going to get all the offices to cover all these details?

1192
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:47,272
Well, if we're able to hire more people, we'll be able to cover everything.

1193
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:52,134
But we have good working agreements with the surrounding communities, state police.

1194
01:31:53,115 --> 01:31:54,555
We'll try to fill as many as we can.

1195
01:31:54,836 --> 01:31:55,796
We can never guarantee.

1196
01:31:55,816 --> 01:32:02,259
I mean, I think we've been very fortunate with the number of details that have been out there in the office's response to crimes in progress.

1197
01:32:02,779 --> 01:32:06,481
It's really been a benefit to us with the work that's been going on.

1198
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:12,044
I see the officers every day, but, you know, they say now you're going to have another three-mile project.

1199
01:32:12,317 --> 01:32:14,618
You can have the British project going on at the same time.

1200
01:32:14,638 --> 01:32:16,740
You're going to cut yourself thin?

1201
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:22,103
And I'm sure these other cities must be thin on opposites too.

1202
01:32:22,964 --> 01:32:25,085
Every community around us are calling every day.

1203
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:30,148
So everyone's exhausting their list pretty early in the day for detail work that's out there.

1204
01:32:30,168 --> 01:32:33,790
But so far we've been able to manage pretty well.

1205
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:38,073
There've been some details that have gone uncovered, but it's done on a priority list.

1206
01:32:38,457 --> 01:32:42,878
what's a low priority, what's a higher priority, and the higher priority details are filled first.

1207
01:32:42,898 --> 01:32:44,678
I mean, there's a lot of work going on.

1208
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:46,879
There's work on Mystic Avenue that's going on now.

1209
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:57,842
The ramps have been done on Route 16, and Route 16's been resurfaced on the overnight, so it's fluctuated daytime work and nighttime work, so that's been a benefit there.

1210
01:33:01,018 --> 01:33:01,278
Thank you.

1211
01:33:01,298 --> 01:33:11,708
So on the motion of approval by council and night with the, uh, request to waive three readings, all those in favor of those pose carries.

1212
01:33:12,028 --> 01:33:12,729
Congratulations.

1213
01:33:12,889 --> 01:33:13,570
Thank you, chief.

1214
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:14,290
Thank you very much.

1215
01:33:18,514 --> 01:33:20,696
Uh, we're going to do that right now.

1216
01:33:21,136 --> 01:33:25,921
Uh, 15 four 84 dear Mr. President and counselors, I respectfully request and recommend

1217
01:33:27,213 --> 01:33:53,345
that your honorable body approve of the following amendments to revised ordinances entitled compensation plan and leave ordinances chapter 66 personnel city of medford amendment to revised ordinances compensation plan and leave ordinances chapter 66 personnel be it ordained by the city council of the city of medford in chapter 66 entitled personnel article 2 entitled classification and compensation plans sections 66 and

1218
01:33:55,859 --> 01:34:02,003
.32 miscellaneous personnel section be amended to add the following lines.

1219
01:34:02,844 --> 01:34:05,226
Title traffic supervisors.

1220
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:13,331
And this is over consecutive years at June 30th, 2016, 17 and 18 2% increase to the monthly payment, bringing it up to 916.44.

1221
01:34:24,175 --> 01:34:24,435
934-77, 953-46.

1222
01:34:24,475 --> 01:34:40,039
This amendment is requested due to the recently negotiated agreement with the Medford School Traffic Patrol Supervisors Union, Local 1599 AFSCME.

1223
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:43,320
The contract will expire on June 30, 2018.

1224
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,040
Counselor Caviello?

1225
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,521
Thank you, Mr. President.

1226
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:58,460
Sorry.

1227
01:35:01,843 --> 01:35:03,784
Chief, if you would explain this to us, please.

1228
01:35:04,785 --> 01:35:09,288
As you can see, the traffic supervisors recently negotiated their contract with the city.

1229
01:35:10,649 --> 01:35:16,834
They're entitled to a 2% pay increase on the last day of each of the fiscal years.

1230
01:35:18,275 --> 01:35:21,458
As you know, we have 25 posts that are staffed every day.

1231
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:23,199
We have 20 or 21

1232
01:35:25,377 --> 01:35:27,238
full-time traffic supervisors.

1233
01:35:27,678 --> 01:35:48,489
We have four that have been pretty much permanent reserves who soon will be moved up to permanent to fill the vacancies, but they have been working posts on a consistent, steady basis pretty much since the start of the school year, and then some of them began almost full-time after the December vacation.

1234
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:52,812
So I think this council has supported them

1235
01:35:53,909 --> 01:35:54,950
forever in the past.

1236
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:56,710
They're a good group.

1237
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:58,371
They work hard.

1238
01:35:58,691 --> 01:35:59,812
Very little problem.

1239
01:35:59,992 --> 01:36:02,874
And I can tell you right now, the parents and the children love them.

1240
01:36:03,434 --> 01:36:05,735
And they perform a great service for the city.

1241
01:36:06,615 --> 01:36:06,936
Thank you.

1242
01:36:06,976 --> 01:36:07,496
Councilor Knight.

1243
01:36:08,176 --> 01:36:09,377
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1244
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:15,600
Chief, could you elaborate a little bit on the training programs that a traffic supervisor has to go through before they're appointed?

1245
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,381
Well, it starts out with the application process.

1246
01:36:18,401 --> 01:36:21,203
They fill out an application for the position here at City Hall.

1247
01:36:21,223 --> 01:36:21,843
I believe it's room 204.

1248
01:36:24,835 --> 01:36:29,077
The application is then forwarded to the police station to my attention.

1249
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:32,359
We do a form.

1250
01:36:33,059 --> 01:36:54,131
Once we know that we have to appoint some people, we send out a letter to each of them asking if they're still interested in applying for the position, and if so, we have a waiver of rights so that they'll sign off so that we can actually do a query check on them, do a thorough background check on them, check with employers, check with neighbors, and then beyond that,

1251
01:36:54,888 --> 01:37:02,592
Once they respond, those that successfully pass that portion of it, the names are passed off to our traffic unit.

1252
01:37:03,092 --> 01:37:05,193
Sergeant Carroll calls them in for an interview.

1253
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:08,735
He does that in conjunction with Officer Brooks.

1254
01:37:09,635 --> 01:37:14,398
And those that pass the interview level, their names get sent back up to me.

1255
01:37:14,858 --> 01:37:23,262
And then I send a letter over to the mayor requesting that they be appointed as reserve part-time traffic supervisors to fill vacancies that occur.

1256
01:37:24,373 --> 01:37:27,736
on a day-to-day, monthly, or for the year basis.

1257
01:37:28,596 --> 01:37:42,407
And once they serve well in that capacity, and if a permanent vacancy becomes available, then again, I'll send the letter to the mayor requesting the most senior reserve be appointed to that vacancy.

1258
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:52,735
And one of the good things in this contract that was negotiated, and actually was brought forward by the traffic supervisors themselves, which is a benefit to the city,

1259
01:37:53,303 --> 01:38:02,611
If someone is appointed as a permanent traffic supervisor for that first six month period, if they do not perform properly or do not perform well, they can be removed.

1260
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:04,672
And that came from the body.

1261
01:38:06,734 --> 01:38:10,357
So once they get appointed, is there any training in terms of best practices?

1262
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:11,698
What's the safest?

1263
01:38:11,858 --> 01:38:14,000
Ten kids on the corner before you cross?

1264
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:16,262
Members of his traffic unit take them out.

1265
01:38:16,581 --> 01:38:21,922
give them some actual hands-on training, work them with a senior traffic supervisor.

1266
01:38:22,362 --> 01:38:26,003
The president of the Traffic Supervisors Union works with them as well.

1267
01:38:26,763 --> 01:38:28,124
So there is some training.

1268
01:38:28,184 --> 01:38:35,626
It's not a great deal, but it depends on their level when they're monitored out there on the street, how well they're doing.

1269
01:38:35,646 --> 01:38:41,547
And if it looks like someone needs more assistance, that's provided to them so that they can feel comfortable about it.

1270
01:38:42,498 --> 01:38:53,106
And lastly, Chief, have there been any incidents of any accidents, any type of traffic supervisor being hit by a vehicle, or a child being hit by a vehicle, or a traffic supervisor?

1271
01:38:53,126 --> 01:38:53,846
Not recently.

1272
01:38:53,906 --> 01:38:55,528
There's been a lot of close calls.

1273
01:38:56,308 --> 01:39:03,093
I think sometimes what they face the most of is some abuse by the motorists.

1274
01:39:03,373 --> 01:39:07,296
People going by and giving them a lot of grief, but no one wants to be stopped.

1275
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:14,283
You know, they're the ones that stand out in front, and they make sure the cars are stopped before they allow the children to cross.

1276
01:39:17,344 --> 01:39:21,106
So the actual line of reporting is straight up the ladder, that's Sergeant Carroll?

1277
01:39:21,546 --> 01:39:22,286
Right, that's correct.

1278
01:39:22,306 --> 01:39:24,987
They're considered part of the traffic unit.

1279
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:26,388
Okay, excellent.

1280
01:39:26,408 --> 01:39:27,248
Move for approval, Mr. President.

1281
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:29,069
Move approved by Councilor Knight.

1282
01:39:29,209 --> 01:39:29,870
Councilor Marks.

1283
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:31,630
Thanks, Chief.

1284
01:39:32,471 --> 01:39:34,732
What are the current numbers in the reserves right now?

1285
01:39:35,995 --> 01:39:38,957
Well, we have four that are actually working full-time posts.

1286
01:39:38,977 --> 01:39:44,520
So they're reserves, but they're not available for other assignments because they're filling right now open assignments.

1287
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:47,402
There's one long-term.

1288
01:39:48,162 --> 01:39:52,424
And they hopefully shortly will be appointed permanent in that post.

1289
01:39:53,065 --> 01:40:02,250
We have one traffic supervisor, reserve traffic supervisor right now that bounces around to the openings, the day-to-day openings.

1290
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:04,391
Other times, and the majority of

1291
01:40:05,107 --> 01:40:09,109
If we go beyond that one, it's all police officers filling them during those time frames.

1292
01:40:10,049 --> 01:40:17,132
But we have right now a list of about eight people that are being screened, and they're all recent applicants, so that's good.

1293
01:40:17,632 --> 01:40:27,277
Many times in the past, we were screening applicants that had applied maybe a year and a half prior, and they already found other jobs, so we're kind of spinning our wheels.

1294
01:40:27,317 --> 01:40:34,940
But right now, we're pretty much up to date with the most recent applicants, so hopefully they'll screen out well and they'll be appointed.

1295
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,040
Okay.

1296
01:40:36,621 --> 01:40:43,225
And we've had this discussion before and just leading to council and Knight's point about any incidences that happen.

1297
01:40:43,765 --> 01:40:52,671
And I've talked to a number of the traffic crossing guides and a road rage is throughout the community and they're our first line of defense.

1298
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:57,294
And I've, I've witnessed it when cars actually will not stop for them.

1299
01:40:57,594 --> 01:40:58,314
Right.

1300
01:40:58,334 --> 01:41:02,157
And I mentioned to you chief that I know most people carry cells now,

1301
01:41:02,783 --> 01:41:18,729
But it would be great for them to have a direct line of communication via the walkie-talkie, like the police have on a dialed station, that they can report something immediately, report a license plate, or something happened, go off a bit, a child gets struck.

1302
01:41:18,749 --> 01:41:22,671
You know, that may be the best and quickest line of communication.

1303
01:41:23,131 --> 01:41:27,773
And I don't understand, you know, why we can't arm these traffic

1304
01:41:28,435 --> 01:41:35,139
Talk about having another set of eyes, like you mentioned, about details, having police on the street and God forbid something happens, they're right there.

1305
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:42,502
Why not arm another 15 or 16 people with a walkie talkie that's directly right to the station that can report things?

1306
01:41:43,123 --> 01:41:53,548
Well, we're looking at that right now and actually the radios that were replaced probably close to two years ago now, we still have those radios.

1307
01:41:54,603 --> 01:41:55,364
They've been tested.

1308
01:41:55,604 --> 01:41:56,384
They still work.

1309
01:41:56,745 --> 01:42:08,214
We just have to modify the channels, the number of channels that are on there, and probably just keep it local on the Medford channel, wipe out the other channels, and then provide some training on how to use the radio.

1310
01:42:09,014 --> 01:42:15,539
So the hope would be, I know it's probably not soon enough, but the hope would be that we'd have these in the field by September when school opens.

1311
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,500
That's great, Chief.

1312
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,781
That's good news.

1313
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:19,602
We just want to make sure that these radios work.

1314
01:42:19,642 --> 01:42:20,943
Right now, they're sitting in the blocks.

1315
01:42:22,124 --> 01:42:22,705
They still work.

1316
01:42:24,151 --> 01:42:32,835
they're not really good enough to be used on, you know, 24 hour day to day patrol, but it should serve a purpose to fill that void.

1317
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:35,516
And that's something I know that you've mentioned numerous times in the past.

1318
01:42:36,076 --> 01:42:41,418
So only because they only because they've mentioned it to me, chief saying they'd like to have a direct line of communication.

1319
01:42:41,718 --> 01:42:44,579
And it's not just to say, Hey, how's, you know, what's the weather down there.

1320
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:47,421
It's to report stuff at a time of emergency.

1321
01:42:47,441 --> 01:42:49,501
I think we're in total agreement on that.

1322
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:50,082
Thanks chief.

1323
01:42:50,302 --> 01:42:50,842
That's good news.

1324
01:42:51,548 --> 01:42:55,909
So on the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1325
01:42:56,809 --> 01:42:57,689
All those in favor?

1326
01:42:58,069 --> 01:42:58,169
Aye.

1327
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:04,810
And so motioned to waive the three readings in addition.

1328
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,031
All those in favor?

1329
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:06,931
Aye.

1330
01:43:06,951 --> 01:43:07,651
All those opposed?

1331
01:43:08,631 --> 01:43:10,211
Congratulations to the traffic supervisors.

1332
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:10,991
Thank you very much.

1333
01:43:11,091 --> 01:43:14,912
And Chief, thank you for your presence here tonight and for your leadership.

1334
01:43:15,512 --> 01:43:16,252
I appreciate that.

1335
01:43:16,652 --> 01:43:17,933
I will stay.

1336
01:43:18,773 --> 01:43:19,153
Thank you.

1337
01:43:19,253 --> 01:43:19,533
Thank you.

1338
01:43:28,808 --> 01:43:34,771
So, on the motion of Councilor Camuso to resort back to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

1339
01:43:36,451 --> 01:43:37,132
All those opposed?

1340
01:43:37,152 --> 01:43:38,552
I think the chief was waiting around.

1341
01:43:40,533 --> 01:43:43,514
Can we take it out of order, one of the papers?

1342
01:43:44,915 --> 01:43:45,715
What paper do you want?

1343
01:43:47,636 --> 01:43:49,197
We're back in the regular order of business.

1344
01:43:54,097 --> 01:44:19,615
So motion by councillor Penta to take item number 15 of 478 Out of order all those in favor aye all those opposed Offered by councillor Penta be resolved that the ongoing parking ticket actions of the out-of-state Republic parking company be discussed councillor

1345
01:44:22,515 --> 01:44:22,815
Penta.

1346
01:44:23,015 --> 01:44:23,335
Thank you.

1347
01:44:24,036 --> 01:44:31,459
Um, chief, I'm, I'm glad that you're here because the first thing I want to talk about is something that I believe it came up at your March meeting.

1348
01:44:32,179 --> 01:44:33,900
Um, we'll start with this group of people.

1349
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:41,724
You have folks that have purchased permit stickers to park in the governor's app parking lot who are business merchants.

1350
01:44:42,724 --> 01:44:43,064
Okay.

1351
01:44:43,504 --> 01:44:48,947
And these merchants, um, two in particular on,

1352
01:44:49,443 --> 01:44:55,185
any particular day have been unable to go into the Governor's Air parking lot to find a spot.

1353
01:44:56,505 --> 01:45:07,408
And by not being able to find a spot, the gentleman who supposedly is in the parking lot over there turned around and told them it's okay for them to park on the street on Governor's Avenue.

1354
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:13,130
Now, this one particular person has received four tickets since Saturday in the amount of $100, four $25 tickets.

1355
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:13,650
That's number one.

1356
01:45:16,265 --> 01:45:33,072
I believe at the March meeting they come up to you and they asked you about this as it relates to, and I believe that you indicated to them, paraphrasing, that you would be okay to park on Governor's Avenue if there were no spots because you have a permit parking sticker and the cars should be able to pick it up.

1357
01:45:34,273 --> 01:45:35,033
That's number one.

1358
01:45:35,834 --> 01:45:40,976
Number two, there's a gentleman who parked his car, put the money in the meter,

1359
01:45:43,186 --> 01:45:45,388
And the expiration of the media was at 144.

1360
01:45:48,411 --> 01:45:55,096
He got a ticket, chief, at 104, for which the expiration wasn't even anywhere near it.

1361
01:45:57,258 --> 01:46:01,262
The gentleman who gave him the ticket turned around and says, if you don't like it, you know what to do.

1362
01:46:01,362 --> 01:46:01,642
Appeal.

1363
01:46:03,804 --> 01:46:09,929
The next issue is, is a resident who lives on Governor's Avenue, a resident who lives on Governor's Avenue.

1364
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:20,356
And this resident got a ticket after 10 o'clock at night by the bounty hunters that the city has hired to go out there and give tickets to.

1365
01:46:22,558 --> 01:46:23,919
Absolutely wrong, chief.

1366
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:31,145
Question then was asked on this particular individual, parking on the street, resident parking.

1367
01:46:32,727 --> 01:46:35,029
They told her she had to move her car every two hours.

1368
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:38,772
And by moving her car every two hours brings it up to midnight.

1369
01:46:40,025 --> 01:46:41,965
And this woman is just upset.

1370
01:46:44,526 --> 01:46:49,187
Next one is in Medford Square, behind the UPS store.

1371
01:46:50,587 --> 01:46:54,288
Lady goes out there, puts money in the meter, which is good until 10.22.

1372
01:46:55,028 --> 01:47:02,430
The gentleman comes up to her at 10.11, starts to give her a ticket, and she says to him, what are you doing?

1373
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:07,071
He says, well, listen, don't worry about it.

1374
01:47:07,151 --> 01:47:09,251
I can take it back if you get a ticket.

1375
01:47:09,513 --> 01:47:13,196
He didn't give her the ticket because she said to him, what are you doing?

1376
01:47:14,677 --> 01:47:25,705
Chief, you have a lady in Medford Square who is a registered hairdresser who has in excess of 250 signatures because this is killing her business in the square.

1377
01:47:26,045 --> 01:47:28,287
This is not Elsie, but the other end of the square.

1378
01:47:28,327 --> 01:47:29,408
This is on Salem Street.

1379
01:47:30,348 --> 01:47:32,330
This thing with the Republic has not gotten any better.

1380
01:47:33,891 --> 01:47:39,175
Two complaints from individuals who have out-of-state plates that come into Medford Square

1381
01:47:39,832 --> 01:47:42,353
They try to put their plate number in, and it doesn't take.

1382
01:47:42,953 --> 01:47:43,833
They don't know what to do.

1383
01:47:43,873 --> 01:47:46,654
They go into the store, and they come out, and they get a ticket.

1384
01:47:49,894 --> 01:47:51,135
This is not making any sense.

1385
01:47:51,855 --> 01:47:53,275
These things are supposed to be resolved.

1386
01:47:54,175 --> 01:47:56,356
On High Street, you and I had this conversation.

1387
01:47:56,396 --> 01:47:56,976
I have the tickets.

1388
01:47:56,996 --> 01:47:58,016
I have the pictures in my bag.

1389
01:47:58,696 --> 01:48:05,098
They still have the kiosk in front of a two-family residential house for which people still try to put money in the meter.

1390
01:48:05,522 --> 01:48:09,965
thinking that they're supposed to, which McCulloch paid to park there.

1391
01:48:10,766 --> 01:48:15,969
That was one of the very first ones they said they were going to remove as soon as the weather got better, as soon as the snowstorm ended.

1392
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:22,233
And we could just go on and on with the telephone calls relative to the people saying they try to put money into the machine.

1393
01:48:22,654 --> 01:48:23,774
One lady put a quarter in the machine.

1394
01:48:23,794 --> 01:48:24,855
She got four quarters back.

1395
01:48:25,736 --> 01:48:26,716
But she didn't get her ticket.

1396
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:30,459
She got a ticket that had a different license plate number on it.

1397
01:48:31,262 --> 01:48:36,643
So unfortunately, or good for her, she didn't get a ticket because she didn't get the right receipt that went to her number plate.

1398
01:48:38,364 --> 01:48:39,744
This craziness has got to stop.

1399
01:48:40,744 --> 01:48:44,965
I mean, these people that are giving out the tickets, it's a combination of them not knowing what they're doing.

1400
01:48:45,005 --> 01:48:46,926
You can't tell someone if you don't like it, appeal it.

1401
01:48:47,286 --> 01:48:55,388
You can't go up to somebody, and I think it even reflects upon Councilor Caviello, on one particular day near CVS, they were just waiting to put a ticket in his car.

1402
01:48:55,968 --> 01:48:57,668
I mean, they're all here.

1403
01:48:57,688 --> 01:48:58,769
I'm not making this stuff up.

1404
01:48:59,549 --> 01:49:00,549
And I think it's just wrong.

1405
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:09,367
But when it's so blatant, giving a guy a ticket, when he has until 144, and they give him a ticket 104, well, if you don't like it, appeal it.

1406
01:49:09,407 --> 01:49:10,608
I mean, how do you do this?

1407
01:49:11,428 --> 01:49:12,669
How do you say it's OK?

1408
01:49:12,789 --> 01:49:13,029
I don't.

1409
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:14,230
I certainly don't agree with that.

1410
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:14,851
No, I didn't.

1411
01:49:14,891 --> 01:49:15,932
How do you say, how do you do this?

1412
01:49:15,952 --> 01:49:17,113
You had two of those that were similar.

1413
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:22,237
You had the 1011 in the UPS store, and you had the 104 on a meter.

1414
01:49:22,257 --> 01:49:23,778
Then you have the one on Governor's Avenue.

1415
01:49:24,599 --> 01:49:29,322
At 10.07 AM, she put a quarter in the meter at 10.07 AM.

1416
01:49:30,487 --> 01:49:34,951
She ran into the UPS store, came out at 1011, and the guy was sitting there waiting to give her a ticket.

1417
01:49:35,211 --> 01:49:36,512
And the ticket expires at 1022.

1418
01:49:40,014 --> 01:49:40,475
It's wrong.

1419
01:49:40,895 --> 01:49:41,756
This is wrong, chief.

1420
01:49:41,816 --> 01:49:43,477
This is not what the people asked for.

1421
01:49:43,837 --> 01:49:45,959
This is not what the city expected from it.

1422
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,801
They've had more than enough time to get their act together.

1423
01:49:48,821 --> 01:49:50,603
I just think it's wrong.

1424
01:49:50,643 --> 01:49:52,304
Can I address a few of these?

1425
01:49:52,384 --> 01:49:53,285
Sure, go ahead.

1426
01:49:53,725 --> 01:49:55,847
OK, the first one, the governor's av lot.

1427
01:49:57,768 --> 01:49:59,750
Everyone has been told in the lot

1428
01:50:00,474 --> 01:50:05,598
If you have a business permit, park against the wall, which abuts 15 Governor's Ave.

1429
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:08,360
That's the only spot for business permits.

1430
01:50:09,321 --> 01:50:13,064
I never told anyone that if you have a business permit, you can park on Governor's Ave.

1431
01:50:13,484 --> 01:50:20,830
I have told them they can park on Governor's Ave up by Terrace Road, which allows for a business permit for two hours.

1432
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:21,591
But that's Governor's Ave.

1433
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:24,293
But not in the lower end of Governor's Ave.

1434
01:50:24,313 --> 01:50:24,894
No, that's Governor's Ave.

1435
01:50:24,914 --> 01:50:25,414
That's where they park.

1436
01:50:25,434 --> 01:50:27,756
But if they go up there by the wall, by the Terrace Road wall,

1437
01:50:28,082 --> 01:50:31,063
They can park up there as long as they're registered with the business permit.

1438
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,725
I think part of the bigger problem that we have, too, is we're not using permits.

1439
01:50:36,145 --> 01:50:45,709
The virtual permit, their plate number is registered with the company, and there's no decal being given to the person who purchases.

1440
01:50:45,749 --> 01:50:47,630
They register their vehicle, their plate number.

1441
01:50:48,095 --> 01:50:49,455
So that's a problem.

1442
01:50:49,855 --> 01:51:05,260
It should be a problem, because the fact of the matter is, if the city is giving out too many tickets or too many permits, and there's more permits that are allowed in the parking lot, how do you blame the person that bought the permit, believing that they could use the parking lot, but now have to go up on Governor's Avenue to find a spot?

1443
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:09,141
Everyone was told that they could only use the back wall for business permits.

1444
01:51:09,161 --> 01:51:10,221
But you know yourself.

1445
01:51:10,281 --> 01:51:11,801
The middle section is three hours.

1446
01:51:11,961 --> 01:51:14,642
But the more- The parallel parking behind the stores

1447
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:19,303
It ranges from 15 minutes, I believe, 30 minutes, and an hour.

1448
01:51:19,323 --> 01:51:20,324
15, 30, one hour, and then two hours.

1449
01:51:20,524 --> 01:51:23,266
But these people pay the $100 for their parking permit, OK?

1450
01:51:23,586 --> 01:51:24,407
They shouldn't be getting a ticket.

1451
01:51:24,427 --> 01:51:25,688
It doesn't guarantee them a spot, though.

1452
01:51:25,808 --> 01:51:29,611
It doesn't have to, but they shouldn't be guaranteed getting a ticket either if they can't find a spot.

1453
01:51:29,631 --> 01:51:31,632
As long as they're not in violation.

1454
01:51:31,652 --> 01:51:32,633
There are spots, though.

1455
01:51:32,813 --> 01:51:33,714
There are spots.

1456
01:51:33,734 --> 01:51:35,756
They may have to hike a bit, but there are spots.

1457
01:51:36,096 --> 01:51:41,480
If they're going to be in a business all day long, they should park the furthest point away.

1458
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,421
Because they don't need their car all day long.

1459
01:51:44,542 --> 01:51:45,983
They shouldn't be parked right there.

1460
01:51:46,543 --> 01:51:49,205
So I'm agreeable with the wall.

1461
01:51:49,265 --> 01:51:50,766
That's historic.

1462
01:51:50,806 --> 01:51:52,548
They have the business permit along that wall.

1463
01:51:53,168 --> 01:51:56,331
We have the governor's terrace road wall for the business permits.

1464
01:51:56,771 --> 01:52:00,274
We have business permits in this end of the square as well.

1465
01:52:00,934 --> 01:52:03,356
They can use the shell parking lot during the daytime.

1466
01:52:04,559 --> 01:52:07,200
Chief, what do you do if somebody's handicapped, they have a business permit parking?

1467
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,540
They have to go out and then they come back.

1468
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:13,302
If they're handicapped and they want to display their handicapped placard, they could park all day on any spot.

1469
01:52:13,322 --> 01:52:17,543
Well, you know as well as I that they've given out tickets to people that have a handicapped placard, OK?

1470
01:52:17,763 --> 01:52:19,784
These people are pretty rude as to what they're doing.

1471
01:52:19,984 --> 01:52:21,365
And they're only out there to make money.

1472
01:52:21,665 --> 01:52:29,387
They don't care about the simple little guy who's just trying to negotiate his day's life, trying to spend $0.25 or $0.50 in a parking lot to do their business.

1473
01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:30,428
That's wrong.

1474
01:52:30,448 --> 01:52:31,208
OK.

1475
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:32,981
Can I go down this list?

1476
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:34,001
Yeah, go ahead, keep going.

1477
01:52:34,021 --> 01:52:37,223
Okay, the meters that we talked about, the 1.44 p.m.

1478
01:52:37,243 --> 01:52:39,065
and then 1.04, there's no excuse for that.

1479
01:52:39,105 --> 01:52:40,746
That's been a problem.

1480
01:52:41,026 --> 01:52:42,126
People haven't received tickets.

1481
01:52:42,186 --> 01:52:51,932
I believe Councilor Camuso even received, or his wife, received a ticket early on in the program when she still had time on the meter, and that's not right, and that should have been corrected.

1482
01:52:52,293 --> 01:52:55,955
And I am told by Republic that WestCore, the company who

1483
01:52:57,462 --> 01:53:02,604
installed these machines, came out and tested every single machine, every single kiosk.

1484
01:53:02,744 --> 01:53:05,325
There's 85 of them that they tested them for accuracy.

1485
01:53:05,705 --> 01:53:09,347
Supposedly they modified some of them that they found having a problem.

1486
01:53:09,387 --> 01:53:11,428
So they've done some preventive maintenance.

1487
01:53:11,828 --> 01:53:13,489
It's probably time for them to come out again.

1488
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:18,391
How can they test them for accuracy if I put money in a machine and I get somebody else's receipt?

1489
01:53:19,937 --> 01:53:20,357
How does that work?

1490
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:22,538
You might've got the receipt from the person before you.

1491
01:53:22,658 --> 01:53:25,720
I know that there was some difficulty getting the receipt out of the slot.

1492
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:29,562
So I, you know, I, I'm only making an assumption that that's the case.

1493
01:53:30,262 --> 01:53:37,346
The resident on governor's Avenue, she was at our traffic commission meeting last, last month, uh, earlier this month, I should say.

1494
01:53:37,926 --> 01:53:49,672
And that ticket was taken care of right there because we had a representative from Republic at the meeting and he was told in no uncertain terms that the parking restriction, even though it says two hour parking,

1495
01:53:50,908 --> 01:53:53,230
It's like all the other on street parking.

1496
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:54,711
It's only until 6 p.m.

1497
01:53:55,171 --> 01:53:56,772
So they could pack from 6 p.m.

1498
01:53:57,153 --> 01:53:58,013
until 8 a.m.

1499
01:53:58,033 --> 01:54:00,595
The next morning and not be subject to ticketing.

1500
01:54:00,855 --> 01:54:01,696
And she got a ticket.

1501
01:54:01,776 --> 01:54:03,437
It was not a permit parking street.

1502
01:54:03,818 --> 01:54:05,139
And she got a ticket at 10 p.m.

1503
01:54:05,519 --> 01:54:05,719
Right.

1504
01:54:05,739 --> 01:54:07,540
So what are they doing out at 10 o'clock?

1505
01:54:07,801 --> 01:54:10,182
They took that ticket away.

1506
01:54:10,222 --> 01:54:11,824
But what are they doing out at 10 o'clock at night?

1507
01:54:12,484 --> 01:54:17,808
Given people hot attacks over stupid tickets, the signs on governor's Avenue did not have a time limit on them.

1508
01:54:18,543 --> 01:54:21,944
They said two hours, but didn't say a beginning time and an end time.

1509
01:54:21,964 --> 01:54:23,705
Do you know what the contract says about all of this?

1510
01:54:24,205 --> 01:54:30,927
These people are supposed to be trained, they're supposed to know the streets that they give the tickets on, and they were supposed to have a course in this, okay?

1511
01:54:31,687 --> 01:54:35,188
And they acknowledged, Mr. Nash, when he acknowledged that they hadn't done it, okay?

1512
01:54:35,248 --> 01:54:39,630
And we're still dealing with the same problems from a contract signed on October 10th, 2014.

1513
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:42,051
This makes no sense at all.

1514
01:54:42,491 --> 01:54:43,071
This is wrong.

1515
01:54:43,755 --> 01:54:46,376
People should not even have to go and have a ticket waived.

1516
01:54:46,576 --> 01:54:48,357
They shouldn't even have to go to give you a call.

1517
01:54:48,517 --> 01:54:49,557
They shouldn't have to go to a travel.

1518
01:54:49,698 --> 01:54:52,799
They shouldn't have to be inconvenienced for this, because these people should know what they're doing.

1519
01:54:53,699 --> 01:54:54,239
And they're not.

1520
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,160
They're causing a hardship to people.

1521
01:54:58,341 --> 01:54:59,762
We spoke about the UPS store.

1522
01:54:59,782 --> 01:55:04,084
That's the same thing with the, they still had time on the meter, and they were about to get a ticket.

1523
01:55:04,604 --> 01:55:07,845
The hairdresser on the square, I know she had generated a petition.

1524
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:09,086
She has over 200 of them.

1525
01:55:09,306 --> 01:55:11,927
But quite honestly, she sandwiched in

1526
01:55:12,797 --> 01:55:21,218
between the 15-minute spots that are in front of Martin Pastry and pretty much the restricted spots at Dunkin' Donuts.

1527
01:55:22,559 --> 01:55:30,060
I would think that, and I know, and I've spoken with the lady, I know that she's having problems with patrons because now there's enforcement.

1528
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:36,841
Even if we enforce the time limits on the signs without even the meters, she would have a problem with her clientele.

1529
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:41,762
I don't know what she did before because there was never a spot to park on Salem Street.

1530
01:55:42,038 --> 01:55:44,120
from Ashland Street to the center of the square.

1531
01:55:44,501 --> 01:55:46,583
Never, absolutely never a spot.

1532
01:55:46,863 --> 01:55:49,165
They were full at 8 o'clock in the morning.

1533
01:55:49,626 --> 01:55:54,271
So I don't know where her customers parked before this, but Salem Street is open now.

1534
01:55:54,351 --> 01:56:00,177
The only thing I will grant you is that many of the patrons probably need more than two hours in the hairdressing shop.

1535
01:56:00,657 --> 01:56:03,601
But I have to say that there's much more parking available.

1536
01:56:03,921 --> 01:56:05,002
They have to cross the street.

1537
01:56:05,517 --> 01:56:08,460
She is in between all the 15-minute spots right there.

1538
01:56:08,521 --> 01:56:11,564
She never was able to have anyone park right in front of her shot.

1539
01:56:11,744 --> 01:56:19,113
But the difference between what you're talking about, the patrons that she had before, before these crazy kiosk stuff came in, maybe she got a two- or three-hour person.

1540
01:56:19,456 --> 01:56:23,297
And she wasn't losing these one or two customers, whatever they might be.

1541
01:56:23,677 --> 01:56:29,898
This past week, I was in West Medford, and I saw a lady walk out of the hairdresser across the street with the curls in her hair.

1542
01:56:29,938 --> 01:56:36,099
She was having a foil, just to run out to go in there and to put the money in the meter, which made no sense at all.

1543
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,260
Because I thought the parking lots were going to be three hours.

1544
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,060
The signs still have not been changed.

1545
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:41,921
What are they waiting for?

1546
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:44,601
The West Medford lot is supposed to be reconfigured.

1547
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:46,101
All the lots are supposed to be three hours.

1548
01:56:46,121 --> 01:56:46,701
Yes, they are.

1549
01:56:47,322 --> 01:56:48,862
So how do they turn around and give people tickets?

1550
01:56:48,922 --> 01:56:49,182
Tell me.

1551
01:56:50,174 --> 01:56:55,275
The kiosk, well, whatever meters are in the lots right now, supposedly have been programmed for a few hours.

1552
01:56:55,295 --> 01:56:55,735
This is wrong.

1553
01:56:56,776 --> 01:57:00,316
I'm going to just say, if I were the mayor, you know this would be the second thing in this building to go.

1554
01:57:00,696 --> 01:57:02,757
That would be the second contract of the city to go.

1555
01:57:03,397 --> 01:57:06,038
I won't tell you what the first one is, but that's the second one.

1556
01:57:06,498 --> 01:57:07,418
It's probably mine, right?

1557
01:57:07,678 --> 01:57:08,338
Councilor Knight.

1558
01:57:10,018 --> 01:57:11,199
Madam President, thank you very much.

1559
01:57:11,499 --> 01:57:16,320
Chief, now that the snow is gone, all 10 feet of it,

1560
01:57:17,891 --> 01:57:23,774
We had a program that Republic was willing to participate in, and I believe they called it their ambassador program.

1561
01:57:24,534 --> 01:57:34,919
And I think it might make sense to get them out there now that people are actually walking around in the streets as opposed to running to their car, running from their car, and trying to get into the stores as fast as they can to keep out of the elements.

1562
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:40,482
So I'm wondering, Chief, if that's something that the Traffic Commission would be interested in maybe requesting.

1563
01:57:41,312 --> 01:57:48,075
That has been mentioned to them several times since the snow has gone, and we're hoping that they will do that.

1564
01:57:48,515 --> 01:57:50,676
They're being told, basically, that they have to do that.

1565
01:57:51,356 --> 01:57:56,759
We have to reacquaint people with the kiosks, and they need to be testing the machines to make sure that they're working.

1566
01:57:57,279 --> 01:58:00,820
I think, by and large, though, I have to say the office staff up there have been very good.

1567
01:58:01,381 --> 01:58:04,522
Any times that we've had any problems, we've been able to call.

1568
01:58:05,023 --> 01:58:07,425
PM in the office, and she's been very receptive.

1569
01:58:08,105 --> 01:58:13,509
Patrick, who is the local person in charge of the operation, he has been good.

1570
01:58:13,769 --> 01:58:22,055
I know that, you know, we need to reach Dan Nash or maybe people above him to take them to task for some of these things that are just continuous, that are ongoing.

1571
01:58:23,456 --> 01:58:28,320
Chief, when you said from Ashland Street down to, you know, the foot of

1572
01:58:29,174 --> 01:58:31,415
the square, you'd never find a parking spot over there.

1573
01:58:31,475 --> 01:58:34,536
And before, before the meeting, right.

1574
01:58:34,556 --> 01:58:45,719
You know, the only time that I think I could ever find a spot was when, when Maddie and Sonya was working the shift before he retired down there, because he was very vigilant, um, in his efforts to ensure that the parking regulations were, were, were abided by.

1575
01:58:46,219 --> 01:58:57,522
And, um, we're having a lot of problems with, uh, the current officers working for a public in their unfamiliarity with what spots should be enforced in what fashion.

1576
01:58:57,906 --> 01:59:11,616
Has there been any consideration given to maybe giving some retired officers who work in the traffic division the opportunity to maybe come forward and assist in showing these people the ropes and how it's done, maybe for a per diem or something like that, to get the program off the ground and running smoothly?

1577
01:59:11,676 --> 01:59:14,198
Because I think we can all agree that there have been a lot of bumps in the road.

1578
01:59:14,778 --> 01:59:19,081
And maybe this is just one of the ways that we can solve some of the problems that we're facing.

1579
01:59:20,182 --> 01:59:21,463
It's something worth looking at.

1580
01:59:21,503 --> 01:59:25,025
That would be a call that someone else will have to make.

1581
01:59:25,086 --> 01:59:27,067
But I know that once school is out,

1582
01:59:28,372 --> 01:59:38,195
We plan on having the day shift traffic officers work with them a little closer and pretty much itemize where the problems are and see if we can correct them.

1583
01:59:38,855 --> 01:59:42,456
I'm hoping that people have been hearing an improvement on permit parking streets.

1584
01:59:42,736 --> 01:59:54,000
I'm not sure, but I'm hoping that you're hearing from the constituents that there has been some improvement on the enforcement there and the consideration for the neighborhood as opposed to just street by street.

1585
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:58,622
that at least giving, if someone's on Burwick, they could park on Yale.

1586
01:59:59,322 --> 02:00:01,763
It's been very helpful from the constituents.

1587
02:00:01,883 --> 02:00:08,406
I think that from the police department end, I think some of the calls that we used to get have dropped off for the permit parking.

1588
02:00:09,406 --> 02:00:19,350
I'm just not sure if they've dropped off because people are just totally frustrated or whatever, but I still believe that we have to go forward with the actual decal on the vehicle.

1589
02:00:19,817 --> 02:00:20,418
for the permits.

1590
02:00:20,678 --> 02:00:33,330
Another thing, Chief, if Republic isn't so interested in doing their ambassador program, and when school gets out, we are going to have some of our traffic division officers helping out, maybe it might make sense to allow our traffic supervisors to maybe participate in the ambassadorship program as well.

1591
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:34,491
They're already city employees.

1592
02:00:34,511 --> 02:00:36,132
They're already working for the traffic division.

1593
02:00:36,493 --> 02:00:43,119
So maybe it makes sense to train them on the machines as well and give them an opportunity to maybe help out and make this work a little smoother.

1594
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:45,021
Thank you.

1595
02:00:46,868 --> 02:00:49,169
President council Pender chief.

1596
02:00:49,569 --> 02:00:49,850
Yes, sir.

1597
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:58,874
Page and their operator employees standards on page 13 of the contract.

1598
02:00:59,415 --> 02:01:09,620
It says the operator shall be solely responsible for the complete training of all its parking enforcement personnel and will maintain training records as prescribed by law or policy as appropriate.

1599
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,043
This training will include, but not be limited to customer service, conflict management,

1600
02:01:15,445 --> 02:01:25,318
civil rights law, disability and accessibility laws and procedures, municipal ordinances pertaining to parking enforcement, job safety included but not limited to OSHA standards.

1601
02:01:28,009 --> 02:01:30,551
Can you tell me, did they follow this contract proviso?

1602
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:40,758
I know that about a month ago, maybe a little more than a month ago, they did have someone from their human relations unit, the corporate office, come in and do a training for the personnel.

1603
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:45,442
This was supposed to be in October before this contract.

1604
02:01:45,662 --> 02:01:46,863
This is what the contract says.

1605
02:01:47,163 --> 02:01:48,344
And this is now what, May?

1606
02:01:48,364 --> 02:01:48,904
I don't know.

1607
02:01:49,004 --> 02:01:52,327
Well, I know there's been some changes in staff since the beginning.

1608
02:01:52,643 --> 02:01:54,405
But before you hire someone, don't you train them?

1609
02:01:54,866 --> 02:01:58,390
Before you get a police officer, we just had a student school for them tonight, didn't we?

1610
02:01:59,431 --> 02:02:06,620
You didn't hire them off the street to come in here and aggravate the people and be bounty hunter number one or two or three because you collect the most amount of money.

1611
02:02:07,665 --> 02:02:08,986
This is wrong, dead wrong.

1612
02:02:09,226 --> 02:02:11,847
And again, as I said to you before, I like you, you're my friend.

1613
02:02:12,168 --> 02:02:13,468
This is not your job.

1614
02:02:13,488 --> 02:02:14,589
This was the mayor's job.

1615
02:02:15,409 --> 02:02:16,610
You should not be doing this.

1616
02:02:17,371 --> 02:02:18,471
I'm here to answer the questions.

1617
02:02:18,491 --> 02:02:19,392
I understand that.

1618
02:02:19,532 --> 02:02:20,873
And I appreciate it, okay?

1619
02:02:20,973 --> 02:02:22,273
It's all under the same umbrella.

1620
02:02:22,313 --> 02:02:25,895
I mean, it's all about public safety, parking, and traffic calls to the police department.

1621
02:02:25,915 --> 02:02:37,362
Well, maybe we should just abolish it, like I said, and have a nice little, like it was before, start off with a small revenue enforcement program, see how it works, see if that leads into maybe meters if you want to put

1622
02:02:37,602 --> 02:02:41,145
the court is in in the future, which people can understand, not this craziness.

1623
02:02:41,485 --> 02:02:42,226
And tell me something.

1624
02:02:42,266 --> 02:02:48,370
If I'm out of the state, and I put money in the meter, and it doesn't take my receipt, it doesn't take my license, why should I be subject to a ticket?

1625
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:49,131
Because I'm out of state.

1626
02:02:50,011 --> 02:02:50,692
How does this work?

1627
02:02:51,553 --> 02:02:52,293
I have to check that.

1628
02:02:52,573 --> 02:02:53,674
I don't have an answer to that.

1629
02:02:53,894 --> 02:02:55,556
Well, that's the problem here.

1630
02:02:55,576 --> 02:02:57,757
And that's another way to juice somebody out of $25.

1631
02:02:57,837 --> 02:03:00,279
Thank you.

1632
02:03:02,601 --> 02:03:05,083
We do have a motion by counsel.

1633
02:03:05,764 --> 02:03:06,384
Is it an amendment?

1634
02:03:07,387 --> 02:03:08,148
by Councillor Knight.

1635
02:03:09,688 --> 02:03:10,449
Okay, no amendment.

1636
02:03:11,849 --> 02:03:12,409
Councillor Marks.

1637
02:03:12,429 --> 02:03:12,970
Thank you.

1638
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:25,335
Chief, a few weeks ago I put something on the agenda for the Traffic Commission, I don't know if you got it yet, but Placeted Road, I think you're familiar, from Irving Street all the way up to Century Street, on the right-hand side.

1639
02:03:26,175 --> 02:03:26,776
In front of the homes.

1640
02:03:27,096 --> 02:03:27,756
In front of the homes.

1641
02:03:28,596 --> 02:03:31,558
That permit parking doesn't take effect until 10 or 11?

1642
02:03:31,838 --> 02:03:34,179
No, it's permit parking all day.

1643
02:03:35,287 --> 02:03:36,067
Are you sure?

1644
02:03:36,368 --> 02:03:41,290
Place that road from Irving Street all the way up to just about Century.

1645
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:43,451
If you could check into that.

1646
02:03:43,611 --> 02:03:44,771
I did right after that.

1647
02:03:45,092 --> 02:03:46,212
That is, it's all day.

1648
02:03:46,912 --> 02:03:49,574
There used to be permit parking from 11 p.m.

1649
02:03:49,614 --> 02:03:50,554
to 7 a.m.

1650
02:03:50,594 --> 02:03:51,334
on the park side.

1651
02:03:53,087 --> 02:03:56,308
and also on Century Street Extension going way back.

1652
02:03:56,368 --> 02:03:57,928
That was something passed in the 70s.

1653
02:03:58,388 --> 02:03:59,829
That had been rescinded a while ago.

1654
02:03:59,889 --> 02:04:01,209
I mean, that a long time ago.

1655
02:04:01,289 --> 02:04:03,210
So nothing on Placelift Road then on the house side?

1656
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:05,890
On the house side, it's permit parking all day.

1657
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:07,491
All day.

1658
02:04:07,511 --> 02:04:07,731
24-7.

1659
02:04:08,511 --> 02:04:08,791
OK.

1660
02:04:09,991 --> 02:04:10,752
I'll check it again.

1661
02:04:10,912 --> 02:04:12,812
Check it again.

1662
02:04:13,132 --> 02:04:18,554
But I believe it stops at Century, from Irving Street up to Century.

1663
02:04:18,594 --> 02:04:19,914
And after Century, there's no

1664
02:04:20,407 --> 02:04:24,591
No, no, I am talking from Irving Street up to Century, that area on the house side.

1665
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:26,253
But I believe it's 24-7.

1666
02:04:26,293 --> 02:04:29,616
Okay, thank you.

1667
02:04:29,716 --> 02:04:30,597
Not just 11 to 7.

1668
02:04:31,078 --> 02:04:31,258
Okay.

1669
02:04:31,478 --> 02:04:37,845
But we used to, all over the city, around all of the parks and playgrounds, it used to be 11 p.m.

1670
02:04:37,865 --> 02:04:38,545
to 7 a.m.

1671
02:04:38,565 --> 02:04:42,529
because back in the day when we had a large number of

1672
02:04:43,732 --> 02:04:50,377
Children congregating at night, that was a tool to be able to tag their vehicles that were parked there when they were in the wooded part of the parks.

1673
02:04:51,138 --> 02:04:53,559
But that's been rescinded years ago when I heard that.

1674
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:57,462
There might be a stray sign still out there, but I'm not sure.

1675
02:04:57,482 --> 02:05:02,266
Do you know if they're enforcing the lot behind the cleaners in the hillside?

1676
02:05:02,726 --> 02:05:03,567
I don't believe they are.

1677
02:05:03,587 --> 02:05:05,088
I haven't seen any tickets issued there.

1678
02:05:05,108 --> 02:05:09,451
I mean, I frequent that quite a bit, and I have yet to see any enforcement there.

1679
02:05:09,511 --> 02:05:11,973
You see a lot of out of state plates there for hours on end.

1680
02:05:12,433 --> 02:05:14,074
So you may want to check that out, too.

1681
02:05:14,114 --> 02:05:16,875
Thank you.

1682
02:05:16,995 --> 02:05:17,355
Thank you.

1683
02:05:18,395 --> 02:05:24,817
If I may, through the chair, I, too, received calls with regards to the Medford Square business permit issue.

1684
02:05:26,018 --> 02:05:28,459
The businesses feel that there's not enough spots.

1685
02:05:28,519 --> 02:05:29,359
I know you say there are.

1686
02:05:30,419 --> 02:05:32,660
Condon Shell, you're saying, should be the backup?

1687
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,441
Yes, depending on the location and the square.

1688
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:38,282
I mean, if they can figure it out.

1689
02:05:39,332 --> 02:05:48,016
This little lot over here by 64 Salem Street, the electric company, it's amazing how full that is at 7 o'clock, 7.30, 8 o'clock in the morning now.

1690
02:05:48,036 --> 02:05:49,296
And that used to be empty.

1691
02:05:50,937 --> 02:05:59,721
And one question on that, the business permit, if somebody needs to change a car, can they swap plates for a day, call the office?

1692
02:05:59,861 --> 02:06:03,583
I guess that's the benefit for them to register their plate number with the company.

1693
02:06:03,623 --> 02:06:06,164
It's easier before if you have just the decal.

1694
02:06:06,551 --> 02:06:11,532
You know, if your car was in the shop and you had a rental for the day, you faced a problem.

1695
02:06:11,832 --> 02:06:15,813
Now, they can just call up and say, I'm using this car today, and give them the plate number.

1696
02:06:15,853 --> 02:06:18,053
Hopefully, everything jives on that end, and they can do it.

1697
02:06:18,593 --> 02:06:26,275
I've had two complaints from business owners that they've called the office, Republic office, tried to switch the plate numbers for the day because they had to switch cars.

1698
02:06:26,875 --> 02:06:29,056
And they say they're unable to do that.

1699
02:06:29,836 --> 02:06:32,996
So if we could just check with Republic on that.

1700
02:06:33,697 --> 02:06:35,477
One was today, and one was last week.

1701
02:06:36,403 --> 02:06:36,683
Okay.

1702
02:06:36,923 --> 02:06:41,925
And the business owners are being told that they can't, they can't swap plates on the business permit.

1703
02:06:42,365 --> 02:06:52,288
So I know that that was one of the selling points in the, in the beginning, because many times something happens and you can't take the guy that's registered and you have to use a rental or something.

1704
02:06:52,308 --> 02:07:02,371
And if you could ask that question, cause I know tissue tickets were issued in those two instances, even though the business owner called Republic asked to switch the plate, they said she couldn't.

1705
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:03,872
And then she got tickets.

1706
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,481
So I can talk to you afterwards.

1707
02:07:07,501 --> 02:07:07,861
Thanks.

1708
02:07:08,101 --> 02:07:09,022
Councilor Camuso.

1709
02:07:09,582 --> 02:07:09,942
Thank you.

1710
02:07:10,102 --> 02:07:15,984
Um, you know, with the parking complaints, um, and businesses claiming that, um, there's not enough spots.

1711
02:07:16,565 --> 02:07:21,667
I mean, this is probably an appropriate time to start looking at the garage again in Medford square.

1712
02:07:22,387 --> 02:07:23,768
Um, the money is set aside.

1713
02:07:24,028 --> 02:07:26,389
State representative has it in the bond bill.

1714
02:07:27,129 --> 02:07:31,271
And, um, I think that this is the appropriate time to actually start talking about it again.

1715
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:32,311
Um,

1716
02:07:33,994 --> 02:07:38,435
There is a need for longer-term business parking within the square.

1717
02:07:39,296 --> 02:07:58,482
So, I think the administration should take it under consideration, at least at this point, because the business owners that are complaining about not having spots, if there are additional spots that are allocated for long-term parking, and as I said in the past, the administration, it was another one of those issues that they just never brought forward.

1718
02:07:59,002 --> 02:08:01,983
They talked about it, and this and that, and the council talked about it,

1719
02:08:02,307 --> 02:08:07,750
But there has not been a proposal for the garage that's been before us for a vote for funding.

1720
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:19,275
And as I said, State Rep Donato has worked tirelessly to get funding in the transportation bond bill for that specific purpose, as well as other money that was set aside by, I believe, the previous administration.

1721
02:08:19,295 --> 02:08:20,096
Point of clarification.

1722
02:08:20,116 --> 02:08:20,636
Point of clarification.

1723
02:08:20,656 --> 02:08:20,936
Council Penta.

1724
02:08:20,956 --> 02:08:30,721
The reason that money got into the bond bill is when the mayor knew that three members of the council weren't going to vote for it, he went to Representative Donato, who never came to us, to explain that they were putting that money into the bond bill.

1725
02:08:31,418 --> 02:08:36,662
So there was no understanding of that money going in by any vote of this council one way or the other.

1726
02:08:36,682 --> 02:08:37,643
Did I say that?

1727
02:08:39,144 --> 02:08:40,145
Yes, you didn't say that.

1728
02:08:40,365 --> 02:08:41,045
I did not say that.

1729
02:08:41,426 --> 02:08:45,809
All I said was in the transportation bond bill, there's $3 million set aside.

1730
02:08:45,829 --> 02:08:50,412
$8 million, Councilor Caviello said.

1731
02:08:50,432 --> 02:09:00,460
I'm not exactly sure on the figure, but the bottom line is I think as one member of this council, there is a need for it.

1732
02:09:01,014 --> 02:09:05,296
And we haven't had the opportunity to take a formal vote, whether we're for or against it.

1733
02:09:05,796 --> 02:09:23,262
And as I said, I'm urging the administration to bring it forward and finally give the people of Medford Square, the neighbors, the business owners, an opportunity to come down here and be heard, as people were given the opportunity to come down in the Brooks Estates, the new science labs, and the list goes on and on and on.

1734
02:09:23,802 --> 02:09:27,303
Jot the Course, which was brought forward by the McGlynn administration.

1735
02:09:28,183 --> 02:09:29,724
This was part of it originally, I believe.

1736
02:09:30,165 --> 02:09:31,365
And it just never came to a vote.

1737
02:09:31,565 --> 02:09:37,507
So I think that we owe it at least to the business owners to take a long, serious look at it.

1738
02:09:38,047 --> 02:09:48,030
And unfortunately, the people out there, the farmer garage was built under the old farmer government, where it was the city council and the city managers back in, I want to say the 80s.

1739
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:55,172
And I'm sure Mayor McGlynn still has the plaque from the garage when it fell down with the names on it.

1740
02:09:55,632 --> 02:09:58,173
But with that being said, it's

1741
02:09:59,842 --> 02:10:01,243
I think it's long overdue.

1742
02:10:01,744 --> 02:10:03,666
And I, as one member of this council do support it.

1743
02:10:03,826 --> 02:10:07,790
And I would hope that it at least entertain it and give the people the opportunity to be heard.

1744
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:08,691
Thank you.

1745
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:11,033
Um, thank you chief for answering our questions.

1746
02:10:11,073 --> 02:10:14,636
Again, some questions resolved council Penta chief.

1747
02:10:14,756 --> 02:10:15,457
One last question.

1748
02:10:15,637 --> 02:10:19,941
And, um, the hours of operation have now been changed from eight to six.

1749
02:10:20,242 --> 02:10:20,722
That's correct.

1750
02:10:20,862 --> 02:10:21,783
Monday through Saturday.

1751
02:10:22,003 --> 02:10:22,304
Correct.

1752
02:10:22,424 --> 02:10:24,646
Can you tell me why the office is not open on a Saturday?

1753
02:10:27,307 --> 02:10:27,707
I don't know.

1754
02:10:28,428 --> 02:10:31,270
I think they try to follow city hall hours.

1755
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:33,411
City hall is not the parking clerk.

1756
02:10:33,771 --> 02:10:37,094
They're open late on Wednesday night.

1757
02:10:37,154 --> 02:10:37,894
It doesn't work that way.

1758
02:10:37,914 --> 02:10:41,917
There are people that on Saturday is the only day they can make this appointment or see them or whatever it might be.

1759
02:10:42,818 --> 02:10:43,538
This is not fair.

1760
02:10:43,558 --> 02:10:44,399
It's another issue.

1761
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:50,483
If you can make a notation, ask them to be open on Saturday from 8 to 6, just like they are every other day.

1762
02:10:51,648 --> 02:10:57,496
You know, if they're good enough to give out the tickets, they should be good enough to hear their complaints on the same days that they give out their tickets.

1763
02:10:58,718 --> 02:10:59,318
Madam President.

1764
02:11:00,921 --> 02:11:03,004
If I may too, I'd just like to go on record.

1765
02:11:04,749 --> 02:11:21,970
I know there is some frustration by some of the members of the Ticket Enforcement Unit, but there are several members of working for that company that are good, long-standing Medford families, Medford residents, and I think they're doing a fine and admirable job.

1766
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:26,192
You call that office, we all know who works up in the office.

1767
02:11:26,912 --> 02:11:31,474
A Medford gal and very friendly, two Medford gals, I didn't know the other one.

1768
02:11:31,934 --> 02:11:39,396
And then one of the enforcement officers is a Medford young man that grew up here in our community.

1769
02:11:39,857 --> 02:11:43,538
So the ones that at least live in this community are taking pride in their work.

1770
02:11:44,298 --> 02:11:46,379
And I just want the record to reflect that.

1771
02:11:51,668 --> 02:11:58,374
Motion to receive in place on file and hopefully chief will get us, you know, ask those questions for us, get us those answers.

1772
02:11:59,155 --> 02:11:59,795
All those in favor.

1773
02:12:00,296 --> 02:12:00,896
All those opposed.

1774
02:12:01,397 --> 02:12:01,997
It passes.

1775
02:12:02,918 --> 02:12:03,278
Thank you.

1776
02:12:03,819 --> 02:12:05,120
Motion to revert back to regular.

1777
02:12:05,140 --> 02:12:06,381
Could I just ask one question?

1778
02:12:06,421 --> 02:12:06,942
I'm sorry.

1779
02:12:07,122 --> 02:12:08,483
I just, I'm just curious.

1780
02:12:09,304 --> 02:12:17,271
I know you have the year for the public concerns and all the complaints, but I'm not hearing all the complaints.

1781
02:12:17,908 --> 02:12:19,929
on the parking that I did in the very beginning.

1782
02:12:20,169 --> 02:12:24,031
I'm wondering, are you hearing anything positive?

1783
02:12:24,511 --> 02:12:28,193
Because I've been hearing from some merchants that this is beginning to work.

1784
02:12:29,394 --> 02:12:30,575
I've been hearing some positives.

1785
02:12:31,755 --> 02:12:32,536
I hear some positives.

1786
02:12:33,356 --> 02:12:41,100
It's obvious that we need to round off the rough edges, but I just want to know, are you hearing any of the good things?

1787
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:44,002
Because sometimes I think the silent majority is out there.

1788
02:12:44,042 --> 02:12:46,783
No one likes someone to come up and put a ticket on their windshield.

1789
02:12:47,332 --> 02:12:52,794
whether you're a sworn police officer or you're a civilian, they don't want the tickets so they're going to complain.

1790
02:12:55,434 --> 02:12:56,115
Councillor Camuso.

1791
02:12:56,515 --> 02:13:01,676
The one thing that's been unanimous amongst the people that I talk to is they all look forward to Sunday.

1792
02:13:03,497 --> 02:13:04,337
The day of rest.

1793
02:13:04,777 --> 02:13:14,360
I think, on a serious note though, we brought it up a few weeks ago, the holiday has to be straightened out and it has to be a lot of public output because

1794
02:13:15,088 --> 02:13:18,910
There were people on Patriots Day, and you weren't here for the meeting, but people on Patriots Day were getting tickets.

1795
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:24,853
Now, I know the company did write by it, but it has to be unison.

1796
02:13:24,893 --> 02:13:27,394
Is it the federal calendar, or is it the state calendar?

1797
02:13:27,814 --> 02:13:35,178
I think it should be the state calendar, because how can you justify having City Hall closed and the schools closed, but still be able to get a ticket?

1798
02:13:35,678 --> 02:13:38,240
And rubbish delivery doesn't get picked up, like Councilor Pender said.

1799
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:40,481
It should be all holidays on both schedules.

1800
02:13:40,661 --> 02:13:41,681
I think it was corrected.

1801
02:13:43,124 --> 02:13:43,304
Ms.

1802
02:13:43,324 --> 02:13:46,907
Burke gave them the list of holidays, and I think it was all of them.

1803
02:13:48,168 --> 02:13:53,012
I'm not sure if Bunker Hill Day fit in that category, but all the others did.

1804
02:13:53,372 --> 02:13:56,315
Bunker Hill Day, though, City Hall is closed, so it should be closed.

1805
02:13:57,395 --> 02:13:57,656
I agree.

1806
02:13:57,676 --> 02:13:58,516
All right.

1807
02:13:58,757 --> 02:13:59,117
Thank you.

1808
02:13:59,277 --> 02:13:59,597
Thank you.

1809
02:13:59,737 --> 02:14:00,378
Thanks, Chief.

1810
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:03,600
Yes.

1811
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:11,727
Motions, orders, and resolutions 15-470 offered by Councilor Caviello be resolved with the Medford City Council, discuss the proposed

1812
02:14:12,157 --> 02:14:23,321
Proposed appeal of 198202 Harvard Street to change from a three-family to a non-conforming five-family in an already congested area with insufficient off-street parking.

1813
02:14:23,381 --> 02:14:24,221
Counselor Carviello.

1814
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:25,321
Thank you, Madam President.

1815
02:14:25,722 --> 02:14:42,027
You know, Madam President, as the Ball Square station is getting closer to us, completion, people in that neighborhood are going to start seeing more and more of these conversions that are going to want to happen.

1816
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:45,611
Property is selling at record prices up there right now.

1817
02:14:45,951 --> 02:14:49,033
South Memphis and the real estate market is on fire.

1818
02:14:49,653 --> 02:14:51,394
And people are starting to cash out now.

1819
02:14:52,314 --> 02:15:01,278
But I think the time has come where I think we need to sit down, maybe with the appeals board or somebody, to discuss all these that are going to come in.

1820
02:15:01,298 --> 02:15:05,760
I mean, here's somebody that wants to go from a three to a five on Harvard Street.

1821
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:08,681
I mean, did the chief already leave?

1822
02:15:09,661 --> 02:15:10,322
Chief left already.

1823
02:15:12,427 --> 02:15:16,888
I mean, there's barely enough parking for the three-family there.

1824
02:15:17,108 --> 02:15:28,971
Never mind, you're going to add four more people, which might be four more cars, five more cars in an area that just cannot handle any more cars or any more people.

1825
02:15:29,951 --> 02:15:35,692
And I say, as these two families continue to sell, people are going to want to take the two, make it a three.

1826
02:15:36,072 --> 02:15:37,272
Three is going to want to go to a four.

1827
02:15:37,732 --> 02:15:40,013
I mean, Stern's Ave just sold for $8.90, a two-family.

1828
02:15:42,642 --> 02:15:45,484
to a person who works up at Tufts.

1829
02:15:45,564 --> 02:15:54,428
It's only a matter of time before the gentleman's on it, before the appeals board, that's going to want to tear that down, or make that a fire family.

1830
02:15:55,789 --> 02:16:06,174
So I say, I think the time has come where we need to send a message to the appeal boards that next week, you better look hard and fast on these,

1831
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:13,181
As they say, as fast as they start coming, as the train gets closer, they're going to come further.

1832
02:16:13,521 --> 02:16:16,202
And once it gets over the college, you're going to see the hillside.

1833
02:16:16,242 --> 02:16:18,382
I mean, can you fit a little car on the hillside?

1834
02:16:18,402 --> 02:16:19,923
Or can you fit another apartment on the hillside?

1835
02:16:20,623 --> 02:16:22,463
I mean, these people, I mean, listen, it's good.

1836
02:16:23,023 --> 02:16:25,624
It's good for the, you know, if you want to cash out, it's good.

1837
02:16:25,664 --> 02:16:28,125
But we're fast losing our neighborhoods.

1838
02:16:28,825 --> 02:16:29,825
There'll be no more neighborhoods.

1839
02:16:30,225 --> 02:16:32,826
There'll be just, we'll be a city of transients.

1840
02:16:33,026 --> 02:16:36,347
That's why people come in, students, and I say, I mean,

1841
02:16:37,923 --> 02:16:41,785
There's five generations of my family that have been in this city.

1842
02:16:43,866 --> 02:16:47,548
That won't be happening much if this continues at this pace.

1843
02:16:48,468 --> 02:16:51,169
Would you like to make a recommendation to the Board of Appeals?

1844
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:54,251
Yes, I plan on going to this meeting next week also during that one.

1845
02:16:54,271 --> 02:16:56,372
You want to make a recommendation?

1846
02:16:56,392 --> 02:17:07,497
I want to make a recommendation that they either maybe look at maybe some type of moratorium or some type of, before they approve,

1847
02:17:08,863 --> 02:17:14,546
Any more of these, maybe we should be kept more in the loop in this.

1848
02:17:15,006 --> 02:17:22,350
Recommend that the Board of Appeals put a moratorium until the matter is discussed with the City Council?

1849
02:17:22,710 --> 02:17:22,910
Yes.

1850
02:17:26,712 --> 02:17:27,433
Councilor Camuso.

1851
02:17:27,573 --> 02:17:27,913
Thank you.

1852
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:40,218
I agree with a lot of the sentiments of Councillor Caviello, but I also know there are a lot of two and three families that have significant amount of parking right on their own property.

1853
02:17:40,859 --> 02:17:44,462
And this is a new way of life.

1854
02:17:44,902 --> 02:17:46,363
People don't want the big homes anymore.

1855
02:17:46,403 --> 02:17:48,605
They want to buy a smaller condominium.

1856
02:17:49,786 --> 02:17:52,668
So I just think the Board of Appeals has to look at each individual cases.

1857
02:17:53,489 --> 02:17:57,892
Similar to a few years ago when the Meadow Glen Mall sign came up, and I'm not far of those big signs.

1858
02:17:58,234 --> 02:18:01,816
But in certain areas, I think they're actually good and they bring business.

1859
02:18:02,497 --> 02:18:11,843
But to tell someone that there's a moratorium in place, and if they have 7,500 square feet and they can fit the appropriate parking and-.

1860
02:18:12,743 --> 02:18:21,089
Maybe moratorium might be the wrong word, but at least we look at the rules that go with the granting of these

1861
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:24,190
changes.

1862
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:29,492
But a lot of times the conversions, I think the conversions and the board of appeals are two separate things.

1863
02:18:30,292 --> 02:18:39,796
Um, a lot of times you don't even have to go to the board of appeals to convert to a, if you already own a two family, it's more or less just going to the building department and condo eyes in it.

1864
02:18:39,936 --> 02:18:43,357
And you have to have converting two to two, two to five.

1865
02:18:43,637 --> 02:18:47,118
I mean, two is going to go to three, three is going to go to four.

1866
02:18:47,438 --> 02:18:52,920
I mean, but some of them, a three family is going to could have six cars in there.

1867
02:18:53,182 --> 02:18:53,942
But I understand that.

1868
02:18:54,002 --> 02:19:03,345
But also, there are some buildings throughout our community that are currently zoned for more than the units that they have.

1869
02:19:03,425 --> 02:19:05,585
They may have a zoning for a six-family.

1870
02:19:05,945 --> 02:19:10,927
At the end of Irving Street, at the corner of Irving and Placestead, you've got six or seven units in that building.

1871
02:19:11,527 --> 02:19:12,427
Now, is it appropriate?

1872
02:19:13,707 --> 02:19:14,948
But it's conforming use.

1873
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:16,208
It's a conforming use.

1874
02:19:16,837 --> 02:19:26,303
And I agree with you that we have to actually take a long, hard look at it, but I think we have to leave it in the Board of Appeals hands, and they have to look at it individually.

1875
02:19:26,723 --> 02:19:34,949
Because there are certain lots and properties within the community that take a blighted area, for instance.

1876
02:19:35,949 --> 02:19:45,596
You'd rather have maybe a three or four family than the one family that's run as a rental place.

1877
02:19:46,547 --> 02:20:00,635
It's, I think, I just think the Board of Appeals right now is in a total, it's a good, it's a good, not it's a good, it's the only avenue where they can go and look at it realistically, too.

1878
02:20:01,656 --> 02:20:10,521
They are very, I'd say that they deny more than they approve developments and conversions in the city.

1879
02:20:11,061 --> 02:20:12,722
I mean, I'd like to know the statistics on it, too,

1880
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:17,552
How many of these properties have actually made it to the Board of Appeals and were approved?

1881
02:20:17,572 --> 02:20:18,972
I don't know, sir.

1882
02:20:19,593 --> 02:20:21,173
I mean, that's something that I'd like to know.

1883
02:20:23,374 --> 02:20:24,375
Councillor Penta.

1884
02:20:25,535 --> 02:20:32,739
I agree somewhat with Councillor Camuso, but, you know, the Board of Appeals has a statutory autonomy, so to speak, to make their own decisions.

1885
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:40,323
But the council has a right to interject what its concerns might be in a particular neighbourhood or a particular section.

1886
02:20:41,343 --> 02:20:43,104
We can jump over to another location

1887
02:20:43,835 --> 02:20:51,717
It's on Winthrop Street, right opposite the gas station, where across the street they want to put 11 houses into a four-home unit area over there.

1888
02:20:51,737 --> 02:20:53,798
I mean, I don't know how they're going to do it, whatever it might be.

1889
02:20:54,518 --> 02:20:57,319
So that's a true encroachment in a particular neighborhood.

1890
02:20:57,339 --> 02:21:02,220
And if the residents don't want it, or they're not even aware of it because

1891
02:21:03,586 --> 02:21:08,730
They just don't either have the time to be bothered with it or to be involved with it.

1892
02:21:08,930 --> 02:21:14,335
I mean, you know, we do have a responsibility if something we feel needs to be communicated to any particular board.

1893
02:21:15,155 --> 02:21:20,439
You know, one of the benefits of getting all these notices when these board meetings are, we see what the agendas might be.

1894
02:21:20,499 --> 02:21:27,565
And some of these agendas have worked out for the purposes of having a council go to them and find out what's going on or express their interest.

1895
02:21:28,085 --> 02:21:31,788
Now, I know Councilor Caviello, this won't be the first time,

1896
02:21:32,468 --> 02:21:46,775
that he would have an interest at the Board of Appeals because, and rightfully so, he had an interest in a piece of property in the West Medford area where the legitimacy of why the building was being sold and what was going to be proposed to be put there was not one and the same.

1897
02:21:47,735 --> 02:21:52,698
And because of his interaction at the board and with the neighborhood, it helped resolve the problem.

1898
02:21:52,778 --> 02:21:59,421
So what was going to originally go up and what became after the fact did not really come to fruition.

1899
02:21:59,781 --> 02:22:02,062
And this might be a combination of the same thing.

1900
02:22:02,998 --> 02:22:05,681
I don't think anybody should be dissuaded from going to any meeting.

1901
02:22:06,081 --> 02:22:14,588
City Council, Board of Appeals, Public Health, Water and Soil Commission meeting, whatever it might be, because if you have your opinion, what difference does it make if you're an elected official or not?

1902
02:22:14,888 --> 02:22:26,658
And if you're going as an elected official expressing your opinion, but more importantly, people have expressed their concern to you, and that's the reason why you're going, well, to some degree, that adds some weight, I would assume, in any particular meeting.

1903
02:22:27,179 --> 02:22:30,942
That's what the board members are there for, to listen to all the opinions that people might have.

1904
02:22:31,528 --> 02:22:37,351
While they might be autonomous to make their own decision, they're not precluded from listening to other people's decisions.

1905
02:22:37,691 --> 02:22:38,252
I'll strike that.

1906
02:22:38,492 --> 02:22:41,654
They should not be precluded from listening to other people's decisions.

1907
02:22:42,054 --> 02:22:48,837
And that's the reason why we're elected, to listen to the people, hear what they have to say, go to a meeting if we want to go, and express our concerns.

1908
02:22:49,438 --> 02:22:51,239
So I agree with you, Councilor Caviello.

1909
02:22:51,699 --> 02:22:57,182
I don't think there's anything wrong with going to the meeting, expressing your opinion, even if it's contrary to all three members of the board.

1910
02:22:57,582 --> 02:22:59,003
At least you were there to say what you felt.

1911
02:23:01,295 --> 02:23:02,876
Councilor Caviello.

1912
02:23:03,417 --> 02:23:09,742
I just think it's time that we start protecting the integrity of our neighborhoods because otherwise they're going to cease to become neighborhoods.

1913
02:23:10,583 --> 02:23:13,605
Just going to become landing spots that people just move in and out.

1914
02:23:14,546 --> 02:23:15,026
Councilor Knight.

1915
02:23:15,767 --> 02:23:17,048
Madam President, thank you very much.

1916
02:23:17,108 --> 02:23:19,390
And thank you, Councilor Caviello for bringing this matter forward.

1917
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:26,816
Although I understand your concerns, I do feel as though we need to really respect the autonomy of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1918
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:30,542
and their process should be undue from political interference and influence.

1919
02:23:31,622 --> 02:23:37,005
With that being said, I think that Councilor Caviello raises some great concerns about the situation that's going on there.

1920
02:23:37,805 --> 02:23:54,153
However, I think the proper course of action for this council to take would be to take a look at the current zoning ordinances and then maybe make recommendations to revise the current existing zoning ordinances that governs their operations as opposed to making recommendations to them that fall well within their scope and purview, Madam President.

1921
02:24:03,430 --> 02:24:04,651
Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1922
02:24:04,691 --> 02:24:05,011
Thank you.

1923
02:24:05,051 --> 02:24:07,292
And I'd like to agree with Mr. Carviello.

1924
02:24:08,633 --> 02:24:29,824
I mean, if you go to South Medford, they are crowded and maybe the answer is what Mr. Knight is saying is maybe I don't understand the process, but I do agree with Mr. Carviello's line of thought, which is that the crowded, the more crowded you become, the more cars on the street, the more stress it puts on the fire department, on the teachers, on the schools, you have more people.

1925
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:33,227
more people that aren't related.

1926
02:24:34,129 --> 02:24:39,682
These two family houses that are getting rented have three non-relatives living in three different bedrooms.

1927
02:24:40,453 --> 02:24:42,254
They have three different cars per unit.

1928
02:24:43,795 --> 02:24:46,577
It just causes a lot of congestion, and I absolutely agree.

1929
02:24:46,597 --> 02:24:51,499
But maybe the right way to approach it is what Mr. Knight is saying, is to go in.

1930
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:56,262
But the federal laws came in under 40B, and they get away with stuff anyway.

1931
02:24:56,362 --> 02:25:01,485
So, you know, the towers, domestic valley towers came in under 40B.

1932
02:25:01,525 --> 02:25:02,866
You had the 40B over there.

1933
02:25:03,426 --> 02:25:07,788
And when 40B came in, the towers, it was regulated very strongly for 30 years.

1934
02:25:08,909 --> 02:25:13,772
Once they got through their contract, now it's open to the general public.

1935
02:25:13,853 --> 02:25:17,795
And they have three, often three non-related people living in the same apartment.

1936
02:25:18,215 --> 02:25:22,078
And so, you know, you have a lot of, and they do, they're like roommates to each other.

1937
02:25:22,398 --> 02:25:23,319
They're not families.

1938
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:26,561
In some areas that's okay, they can absorb it.

1939
02:25:27,742 --> 02:25:34,447
But certainly in certain parts of the city, there's a saturation point at which it becomes a problem.

1940
02:25:34,907 --> 02:25:36,448
And so I just want to make people aware of that.

1941
02:25:36,785 --> 02:25:42,271
If you're living in North Medford and you have a couple of houses that, you know, are party central, that's okay because it can be absorbed.

1942
02:25:42,571 --> 02:25:49,318
But if you have a couple of houses that are party central in South Medford, it's not going to be absorbed because there's already enough congestion.

1943
02:25:49,792 --> 02:25:50,973
The roads are more congested.

1944
02:25:50,993 --> 02:25:52,694
The cars make an impact.

1945
02:25:53,134 --> 02:25:58,677
And I'd just like to say that it puts a stress on the city, so it is a city issue.

1946
02:25:59,037 --> 02:26:06,202
And also, every week, I get a letter in the mail from a retailer, a real estate person, ready to sell my house.

1947
02:26:06,862 --> 02:26:07,662
I mean, it is hot.

1948
02:26:07,803 --> 02:26:08,623
The market is hot.

1949
02:26:09,063 --> 02:26:11,985
And I know that some people would love for me to move out of the city, but that's another story.

1950
02:26:12,465 --> 02:26:14,747
I'm just kidding.

1951
02:26:15,687 --> 02:26:16,208
Oh, thank you.

1952
02:26:16,948 --> 02:26:18,590
Keeping you guys as honest as I can.

1953
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:26,736
But anyway, no, seriously, the market is hot, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have some kind of cap.

1954
02:26:27,197 --> 02:26:34,403
How we come about that, how we come to that conclusion on how to put controls on that is up for debate.

1955
02:26:34,883 --> 02:26:38,686
But the sentiment that he's talking about, I'm absolutely positive with.

1956
02:26:39,127 --> 02:26:39,387
Thank you.

1957
02:26:44,178 --> 02:26:45,639
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1958
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:55,706
As someone who lives in close proximity to the property in question, I have grave concerns for that as well.

1959
02:26:56,427 --> 02:27:02,591
And I'm intimately associated with the congestion we experience in South Medford.

1960
02:27:03,091 --> 02:27:12,538
I'm also intimately aware of so much of the change that's happened there and the changing real estate market there.

1961
02:27:13,352 --> 02:27:25,420
and the possibility that people of moderate to low income will find it difficult to live in that neighborhood, those people who are most in need of use of public transportation.

1962
02:27:27,101 --> 02:27:38,328
That being said, I'm unclear as to what obligation or restrictions are upon us as councillors when we speak before these boards.

1963
02:27:39,060 --> 02:27:43,703
And I know that we have to be clear to it and clear about it before we do that.

1964
02:27:44,724 --> 02:28:04,376
Furthermore, I would want to be very respectful towards the autonomy of that board in particular, which prides itself and by its constitution ought to be free from inappropriate influence and encumbrance.

1965
02:28:05,298 --> 02:28:29,618
I'm not saying that your motion, Councilor Caviello, is in any way an encumbrance, but until I am clear on what it is, because for some reason I have in the back of my head from doing those tedious ethics examinations we have to do,

1966
02:28:30,307 --> 02:28:39,150
that really the examples that they give us, the case studies that they give us to complete really aren't all that clear either.

1967
02:28:42,191 --> 02:28:50,694
There seems to be something there that when we appear before a board, that there's something attached to that.

1968
02:28:50,714 --> 02:28:53,195
That's right.

1969
02:28:53,536 --> 02:28:55,576
As an elected official, I can go to any meeting.

1970
02:28:55,836 --> 02:28:57,157
I can go there as a regular citizen.

1971
02:28:58,279 --> 02:29:01,200
I don't think I'm putting any undue influence on them.

1972
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:06,481
I mean, it's my right to protect the integrity of that neighborhood.

1973
02:29:06,841 --> 02:29:14,163
I mean, the term affordable housing over there is going to be nonexistent.

1974
02:29:14,383 --> 02:29:19,784
I don't think I'm going to say anything, no one's threatening the board.

1975
02:29:20,364 --> 02:29:24,825
I'm entitled to my opinion as an elected official of the city.

1976
02:29:29,328 --> 02:29:36,530
I mean, I've gone to those meetings before, and I have the right to speak my opinion as an ordinary citizen.

1977
02:29:38,331 --> 02:29:39,791
I've gone to many board meetings.

1978
02:29:41,312 --> 02:29:42,712
That's right, give my name and address to the record.

1979
02:29:45,393 --> 02:29:46,174
Thank you very much.

1980
02:29:49,195 --> 02:29:49,995
Thank you, Mr. President.

1981
02:29:50,035 --> 02:29:53,076
I want to thank Councilor Caviello for offering this resolution.

1982
02:29:55,391 --> 02:30:03,897
The council is stating, and I won't speak for him, is he sees the neighborhoods in the very fabric of what makes up our individual neighborhoods being changed.

1983
02:30:04,718 --> 02:30:10,622
And clearly, the market in the city of Meffitt has changed over the last several years.

1984
02:30:10,742 --> 02:30:14,344
And I think we as a council have to get ahead of the curve.

1985
02:30:15,105 --> 02:30:20,308
And we are the legislative body in this community and in charge of zoning.

1986
02:30:21,269 --> 02:30:23,871
That may be the appropriate place for this to appear.

1987
02:30:25,228 --> 02:30:27,669
So, I support this wholeheartedly.

1988
02:30:28,549 --> 02:30:36,792
I also think we have to take one step further and look at illegal apartments, illegal apartments in the community.

1989
02:30:37,272 --> 02:30:42,233
I think there are more illegal apartments in this city than what we realize.

1990
02:30:42,974 --> 02:30:53,517
And if you want to talk about having more cars on the street and so forth, and people living in situations that may be dangerous because they fall under the radar of

1991
02:30:53,973 --> 02:30:56,335
certain ordinances and state laws and so forth.

1992
02:30:57,036 --> 02:31:00,679
Um, that to me is an issue that has to be examined also.

1993
02:31:00,779 --> 02:31:11,248
So I think it's about time that the zoning board, uh, actually not the zoning board, the, uh, zoning subcommittee get together and start discussing some of these issues, Madam President.

1994
02:31:11,288 --> 02:31:21,877
So, uh, if my council colleague wouldn't mind, I think that may be the appropriate first step of this, uh, to refer this to the zoning subcommittee for further action, Madam President.

1995
02:31:25,658 --> 02:31:37,984
Madam President, a few weeks ago, we had a little bit of a discussion on the council floor, but firstly, I want to get back to Councilor Caviello's resolution as it relates to the fabric of the neighborhood, as Councilor Marks has alluded to.

1996
02:31:38,825 --> 02:31:41,186
I don't think there's anything wrong with going to any board of appeals.

1997
02:31:41,806 --> 02:31:43,347
I've been there many times through the years.

1998
02:31:43,367 --> 02:31:46,168
I've been to many boards during the courses of the year.

1999
02:31:46,508 --> 02:31:54,172
I've gone and spoken as a citizen and as an elected official, and 90% of the time when I've gone, I've been recognized as an elected official in the city.

2000
02:31:54,590 --> 02:31:57,231
but coming to speak on the matter whether I was pro or con.

2001
02:31:57,972 --> 02:32:01,213
So what makes that any different than a few weeks ago before this council?

2002
02:32:01,894 --> 02:32:14,720
We were asked to vote and participate on a private outside contractor who works at Tufts University, their custodial staff, we were asked to take a vote to support them.

2003
02:32:15,446 --> 02:32:17,927
as it relates to them not losing their jobs.

2004
02:32:18,307 --> 02:32:19,887
Something entirely different.

2005
02:32:20,287 --> 02:32:23,508
It's got nothing to do with the Memphis City Council.

2006
02:32:23,548 --> 02:32:26,568
We were led to believe they were Tufts University employees.

2007
02:32:26,608 --> 02:32:28,869
They were outside paid contractors.

2008
02:32:28,949 --> 02:32:33,030
And by being outside paid contractors, further removed from the whole issue.

2009
02:32:33,290 --> 02:32:34,010
And what did we do?

2010
02:32:34,330 --> 02:32:35,610
We took a vote to support them.

2011
02:32:36,130 --> 02:32:45,172
And something right here in our own building, something that represents the heartbeat of this community where people live, we're going to be precluded from going to any board

2012
02:32:45,528 --> 02:32:51,113
or any meeting and talking to them because we're doing something wrong, we're strong-arming them, you're not.

2013
02:32:51,454 --> 02:32:52,254
What is your opinion?

2014
02:32:52,675 --> 02:32:53,696
What does an opinion mean?

2015
02:32:53,756 --> 02:32:58,881
It means to offer what you think in your mind, what the situation might be and what you might want it to be.

2016
02:32:59,281 --> 02:33:03,865
You want to look at the zoning ordinances and look at the criteria and the priority that it needs to take.

2017
02:33:04,146 --> 02:33:05,607
If you need some revision, so be it.

2018
02:33:06,749 --> 02:33:10,073
But to say we're gonna check the zoning first before we even go forward?

2019
02:33:10,533 --> 02:33:12,576
Absolutely, absolutely ridiculous.

2020
02:33:13,217 --> 02:33:15,360
It's the most ridiculous thing that I could hear of.

2021
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:23,790
You're making it sound like we have to just stay in this particular room and we can't go to before any board, any meeting, any commission because it's undue influence.

2022
02:33:23,811 --> 02:33:24,692
Well, that's absurd.

2023
02:33:25,362 --> 02:33:26,363
absolutely absurd.

2024
02:33:26,823 --> 02:33:42,114
It's just as absurd as the vote we took that night to go out of our way to protect outside employees contracted by Tufts University, not even their own employees who we thought that was happening, and we took a vote to make sure to try to protect them to keep their jobs.

2025
02:33:46,888 --> 02:33:49,370
That evening, I believe the company was, was it DTZ?

2026
02:33:50,030 --> 02:33:52,232
We were well aware that it was a contracted company.

2027
02:33:52,752 --> 02:33:59,978
They got up here and represented themselves as a contracted company and members of SEIU, Service Employees International United.

2028
02:34:01,079 --> 02:34:04,321
No, I understand they're not employees at Tufts Universities, but it doesn't matter.

2029
02:34:04,541 --> 02:34:06,623
We would try to, we would try to, no it doesn't.

2030
02:34:06,723 --> 02:34:13,328
So what, if they were Tufts University employees, we don't want them getting laid off, but because they have to work, because they happen to work for an outside entity, we, okay, let them go.

2031
02:34:13,764 --> 02:34:16,745
I mean, I don't see any difference in that at all.

2032
02:34:18,805 --> 02:34:26,367
President, should we be aware of the fact that in our sheriff's department, they may want to lay off employees, and we should take a vote to make sure that the sheriff keeps all the employees?

2033
02:34:26,687 --> 02:34:28,787
Should we do that in every agency that's going out there?

2034
02:34:29,387 --> 02:34:31,508
I'm not going to discuss it because that's my place of employment.

2035
02:34:31,528 --> 02:34:32,648
Well, that's your place of employment.

2036
02:34:32,788 --> 02:34:36,129
So if you were going to get laid off, you'd like to have somebody be there to support you, wouldn't you?

2037
02:34:37,055 --> 02:34:42,340
Once again, once again, the more Councilor Pinto talks, he backs up what I'm trying to say.

2038
02:34:42,620 --> 02:34:45,042
It's twice this evening you've done what I've tried to say.

2039
02:34:45,602 --> 02:34:51,107
Earlier in the evening, you contradicted me, and then in the end, you end up agreeing with me.

2040
02:34:52,909 --> 02:34:55,251
So it's kind of, I find it kind of comical.

2041
02:34:55,571 --> 02:35:03,738
But with that being said, Madam President, with this particular issue, I would like to, the motion before us is to discuss it.

2042
02:35:04,223 --> 02:35:05,864
So there's been plenty of discussion.

2043
02:35:05,884 --> 02:35:09,006
I don't know if the council is going to bring forward a motion other than this.

2044
02:35:09,427 --> 02:35:27,639
But to go one step further, I know firsthand from going to the Board of Appeals over the years and following the rulings and stuff, and I'm sure you know this as well as a congratulations being one of the top female attorneys in the area, by the way.

2045
02:35:27,919 --> 02:35:29,320
Vice President Councillor Lungo-Kern.

2046
02:35:29,823 --> 02:35:37,306
But with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I'd like to find out how many of these were approved over the years.

2047
02:35:37,967 --> 02:35:38,847
I would say it's less than 12.

2048
02:35:39,607 --> 02:35:51,633
So for us to sit here and say it's changing the fabric of our entire community, matter of fact, we had someone, and I'm not going to use the name, but was going for one of these who worked for the United States Senator's office.

2049
02:35:51,673 --> 02:35:53,154
At the time, it was a congressman's office.

2050
02:35:53,634 --> 02:35:54,394
And it was denied.

2051
02:35:55,155 --> 02:35:55,835
And it was denied.

2052
02:35:57,565 --> 02:35:59,627
So this is not a major problem.

2053
02:35:59,888 --> 02:36:03,251
Now, this particular one, I don't know where 198 and 202 Harvard Street is.

2054
02:36:03,271 --> 02:36:04,152
I'm not going to get into that.

2055
02:36:04,172 --> 02:36:08,597
I'm not going to discuss it prior to going down and maybe looking at the property and everything else.

2056
02:36:09,358 --> 02:36:12,381
But with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I think it's incumbent upon us.

2057
02:36:13,424 --> 02:36:38,540
Rather than to sit here and say it's changing the fact the the character of all our neighborhoods I think we have to ask the question How many of these were approved over say the last 10 years and if it's more than a dozen, I will be shocked shocked in a city of our size I'm pretty sure it's less than a dozen because they are very very strict and anyone that knows anything about the Board of Appeals There's only a few criteria

2058
02:36:39,058 --> 02:36:41,059
that they can actually approve something.

2059
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:44,142
One is when it's created a hardship, I believe.

2060
02:36:44,762 --> 02:36:46,323
And what's the other one, Mr. Clerk?

2061
02:36:46,343 --> 02:36:47,204
Do you know off the top of your head?

2062
02:36:47,744 --> 02:36:49,586
It's if there's a financial hardship.

2063
02:36:51,567 --> 02:36:52,247
That's the main one.

2064
02:36:56,167 --> 02:37:02,152
I just think we spent 45 minutes on an issue that Councillor Carviello is probably right.

2065
02:37:02,312 --> 02:37:03,574
I know he does his due diligence.

2066
02:37:03,594 --> 02:37:06,356
He drives around more than any councillors that sit here.

2067
02:37:07,137 --> 02:37:09,999
And he checks out all the properties that he brings up and stuff.

2068
02:37:10,499 --> 02:37:15,283
So as I said, I'd like to reserve my judgment on that particular matter.

2069
02:37:15,804 --> 02:37:22,770
But with that being said, I'd like to make a motion, if you don't mind, on how many of these were actually approved in the last 10 fiscal years.

2070
02:37:24,008 --> 02:37:31,794
And then we can actually tell if there's a major problem in the community, and we should be putting in some sort of zoning ordinance or zoning law.

2071
02:37:32,695 --> 02:37:36,597
But knowing that board, I will be shocked, like I said, if it's more than a dozen.

2072
02:37:36,938 --> 02:37:40,380
Because I get more phone calls of the projects that get denied.

2073
02:37:41,421 --> 02:37:48,006
And sometimes they're legitimate reasons, but just the hardship or whatever criteria that needs to be met is not met.

2074
02:37:48,586 --> 02:37:53,370
And I know Attorney Arena, he is so tight when it comes to ethical standards.

2075
02:37:55,362 --> 02:37:57,163
It's amazing, so.

2076
02:38:11,967 --> 02:38:13,087
By address, Madam President.

2077
02:38:13,628 --> 02:38:20,590
If we're going to get a listing from the last 10 years, we want to get them by address so we can see what pockets of the city these changes are happening in as well.

2078
02:38:20,610 --> 02:38:22,010
I have no problem requesting the information,

2079
02:38:22,873 --> 02:38:26,355
My concern is the fact that we're the legislative body that actually makes the zoning ordinances.

2080
02:38:26,435 --> 02:38:30,077
We have a zoning ordinance that gives the Zoning Board of Appeals this power.

2081
02:38:30,417 --> 02:38:32,438
Now we're telling them, don't exercise that power because we said so?

2082
02:38:33,039 --> 02:38:33,779
We gave them the power.

2083
02:38:33,859 --> 02:38:36,400
If we want to take it away, we can take it away, but there's a process to do that.

2084
02:38:36,741 --> 02:38:38,902
I'm not saying that Councilor Caviello is doing something wrong.

2085
02:38:38,942 --> 02:38:39,582
He's doing his job.

2086
02:38:39,602 --> 02:38:42,544
He's going out there and he's exercising his due diligence, which he does every day.

2087
02:38:42,924 --> 02:38:44,665
And I understand exactly where he's coming from.

2088
02:38:44,685 --> 02:38:46,766
And I certainly have concerns for the fabric of the neighborhood, too.

2089
02:38:47,547 --> 02:38:49,369
I certainly have concerns for the fabric of the neighborhood.

2090
02:38:49,729 --> 02:38:52,031
But I think that there's a proper process that's in place.

2091
02:38:52,071 --> 02:38:53,692
And I don't want to run rush out over the process.

2092
02:38:54,153 --> 02:39:02,880
And I certainly don't want to make any steps that are going to put us in a position to be politicizing an issue that shouldn't be politicizing, or politicizing a process that shouldn't be politicized.

2093
02:39:03,321 --> 02:39:05,122
So that's where I'm coming from, Madam President.

2094
02:39:05,162 --> 02:39:06,884
Insofar as the Tufts University situation,

2095
02:39:07,147 --> 02:39:09,067
The Tufts University is a resident of the city of Bedford.

2096
02:39:09,707 --> 02:39:12,848
We don't have any oversight control or dictation over their operations.

2097
02:39:13,048 --> 02:39:21,129
We can make recommendations and we can make suggestions, but the zoning board of appeals and the rules and regulations that they fall under and that they are there to enforce are created by us.

2098
02:39:21,730 --> 02:39:22,290
We make them up.

2099
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:23,610
We're the ones that make them.

2100
02:39:23,870 --> 02:39:25,050
We make the zoning ordinances.

2101
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:27,691
We're the body that creates the zoning ordinances.

2102
02:39:28,111 --> 02:39:31,411
And now we're going to tell them which ordinances to pay attention to and which ones not to?

2103
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:33,372
I have some concern about that.

2104
02:39:33,472 --> 02:39:36,052
And I certainly do question whether or not it's undue political influence.

2105
02:39:36,672 --> 02:39:40,114
With that being said, Madam President, it's no criticism of Councilor Caviello or his efforts.

2106
02:39:40,174 --> 02:39:43,196
I think that he's raised a good issue and it's a good issue to discuss.

2107
02:39:43,576 --> 02:39:53,741
I think we as a body have a duty now to sit down and figure out what course of action we want to take in order to ensure that the fabric of the neighborhood is protected and that the process remains a process that's free from undue influence.

2108
02:39:57,784 --> 02:40:05,968
Why would you want to sit down and discuss the ordinances now after Councilor Caviello brought up something that's a concern if you don't think it's a concern until the Board of Appeals?

2109
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:09,732
I'm going to disagree with all of you except with this particular issue.

2110
02:40:09,892 --> 02:40:11,393
One house can tear down a neighborhood.

2111
02:40:11,773 --> 02:40:12,994
There was a house on Forest Street.

2112
02:40:14,134 --> 02:40:16,175
I'm going to leave the number and the location nameless.

2113
02:40:16,856 --> 02:40:18,797
And that house turned out to be a crack house.

2114
02:40:19,297 --> 02:40:22,159
And that was causing a tremendous amount of problem.

2115
02:40:22,599 --> 02:40:27,222
So to say that one house or any house, you don't need a quantitative number.

2116
02:40:27,242 --> 02:40:28,782
It doesn't have to be 12, 15, or 20.

2117
02:40:28,942 --> 02:40:31,904
It can take just one house to bring down a neighborhood.

2118
02:40:32,264 --> 02:40:33,345
And this house almost did it.

2119
02:40:39,034 --> 02:40:50,946
I requested the addresses of the homes because I wanted to see if there was any type of trend or any type of cluster in a certain neighborhood or a certain area where these requests have been made and then later issued.

2120
02:40:51,346 --> 02:40:55,069
So that was why I asked that the address should be there, so that we can see and we can track it.

2121
02:40:55,875 --> 02:40:58,016
Yeah, five requests came in, we approved two of them, and that's it.

2122
02:40:58,096 --> 02:40:59,236
We still don't know where these houses were.

2123
02:40:59,256 --> 02:41:00,256
We still don't know where it happened.

2124
02:41:00,616 --> 02:41:02,377
We still don't know if it happened in a blighted area.

2125
02:41:02,437 --> 02:41:04,878
We don't know if it happened in an area that was suitable for it.

2126
02:41:05,038 --> 02:41:12,220
I mean, one area that I think of is right off of High Street, across from Essex Street, where they knocked down a dentist office and they built seven homes.

2127
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:13,380
You know what I mean?

2128
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:15,541
Seven $600,000 homes, all on the tax rolls.

2129
02:41:16,241 --> 02:41:18,142
So it's just something to look at.

2130
02:41:18,182 --> 02:41:19,302
That's all I'm saying, Madam President.

2131
02:41:32,834 --> 02:41:46,201
Obviously, about a month or two ago, we had a detective from the Medford Police Department here, and to say a crack house can pop up, we have these problems in every single neighborhood in this city.

2132
02:41:47,202 --> 02:41:52,244
Every single neighborhood in this city, we have problems when it comes to people selling drugs out of a certain house.

2133
02:41:52,865 --> 02:41:54,886
So to say it's as a result of these or that,

2134
02:41:58,328 --> 02:42:03,549
what's the word, not when they condoize it, when it goes from a two to three, conversion, exactly, I'm sorry.

2135
02:42:04,849 --> 02:42:18,772
To say that it's as a result of conversion, Forest Street may have been one particular case, but we've had a drug bust on Wareham Street, $40,000, a gun, heroin, and everything else within the last seven days.

2136
02:42:19,192 --> 02:42:22,552
We have other drug busts within the last three or four months up in North Medford.

2137
02:42:24,033 --> 02:42:25,713
The detective that was here a few weeks ago,

2138
02:42:26,244 --> 02:42:34,147
talked about how each and every councillor, and he knows where all of us live, within walking distance of all of our own houses, there's been drug arrests from residents.

2139
02:42:37,668 --> 02:42:40,589
You missed the point, because you say I'm following you, so maybe you should follow me.

2140
02:42:40,649 --> 02:42:45,570
I'm talking about applications that go before the board, not houses that had nothing to do with the board.

2141
02:42:45,870 --> 02:42:47,631
You just said they turn into crack houses.

2142
02:42:48,231 --> 02:42:50,132
Well, the application had to go before the board.

2143
02:42:50,832 --> 02:42:53,033
Talking about applications that went before the board.

2144
02:42:53,053 --> 02:42:53,853
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

2145
02:42:54,510 --> 02:43:13,600
If I had a situation near my house where my family's growing up and it is a crack house and there was a potential for development to come in and make it maybe a two-family house or something else, I would go to the Board of Appeals and I would support the conversion with the hopes of having the crack house vacated.

2146
02:43:14,161 --> 02:43:18,343
So in some cases, this is actually good.

2147
02:43:18,363 --> 02:43:19,183
Look at Boynton Road.

2148
02:43:19,584 --> 02:43:22,085
We've been talking about Boynton Road, number 56 Boynton Road.

2149
02:43:22,812 --> 02:43:31,476
If there was a conversion that could take place that would be good in that neighborhood, I'm sure Mr. Crowley would be here and his neighbors to speak on behalf of it.

2150
02:43:32,276 --> 02:43:37,679
But there is particular cases where you're better off taking a conversion than dealing with some of the nonsense that goes on.

2151
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:44,142
I know in Councilor Caviello's neighborhood, there's a house that there's overdoses in weekly, weekly.

2152
02:43:44,322 --> 02:43:45,322
People going in and out.

2153
02:43:45,342 --> 02:43:48,864
I mean, Councilor Caviello, what was it, two deaths or one death there?

2154
02:43:49,564 --> 02:43:50,005
Two deaths.

2155
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:55,842
I'm sure the neighbors would want that to be converted if someone came in and wanted to clean up the property.

2156
02:43:57,502 --> 02:43:57,942
Exactly.

2157
02:43:59,303 --> 02:44:07,905
So there is cases that the Board of Appeals should take into consideration, and they have.

2158
02:44:08,665 --> 02:44:19,989
So I'd like to get that number, though, because I think we're all going to be surprised by the small, small amount of approvals for conversions from a single family or a two family or a three family.

2159
02:44:20,232 --> 02:44:22,793
So any conversion higher, what's the question?

2160
02:44:22,813 --> 02:44:24,893
We got to ask the actual question rather than get it back.

2161
02:44:24,913 --> 02:44:25,953
We didn't understand the question.

2162
02:44:26,693 --> 02:44:36,596
Any conversion that added a different, an additional unit, a single to a, a single to a two, a two to a three, a three to a four.

2163
02:44:37,256 --> 02:44:37,436
So.

2164
02:44:37,456 --> 02:44:46,378
I, you know, I, I think we, I think this sort of, uh, it's been a little out of control.

2165
02:44:46,658 --> 02:44:47,578
No one is saying that we,

2166
02:44:48,169 --> 02:44:50,990
influence and the undue influence over the Appeal Board.

2167
02:44:52,111 --> 02:44:56,573
Ten years ago, there wasn't two train stations coming in that neighborhood.

2168
02:44:57,013 --> 02:45:03,697
Now, in the next five years or next few years, there's going to be a train station and there's going to be more people there.

2169
02:45:04,317 --> 02:45:09,299
And as you can see, the properties are selling and you're going to see more people.

2170
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:11,921
They're paying record prices.

2171
02:45:12,601 --> 02:45:16,463
You can't charge enough money to support the record prices that they're paying.

2172
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:18,591
And like I said, before the other one gets there.

2173
02:45:18,631 --> 02:45:24,495
But again, there was no intent of undue influence on the Appeal Board.

2174
02:45:24,975 --> 02:45:32,360
It was a matter of that there's going to be more and more of these coming forward in the next year or the next couple of years.

2175
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:34,662
And I think we need to keep our eye on it.

2176
02:45:35,582 --> 02:45:39,085
That was the intent of this, not to influence the Appeal Board.

2177
02:45:40,365 --> 02:45:40,706
Thank you.

2178
02:45:40,806 --> 02:45:41,906
Counselor Knight.

2179
02:45:42,667 --> 02:45:44,888
Madam President, in proposing in

2180
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:57,602
Putting this question together, I think it would be very important that we clarify that it would be asking the Zoning Board of Appeals how many of those conversions occurred by way of approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

2181
02:45:59,484 --> 02:46:00,725
So matters that were before them.

2182
02:46:01,726 --> 02:46:02,947
By way of approval, correct.

2183
02:46:03,268 --> 02:46:03,508
Okay.

2184
02:46:06,918 --> 02:46:08,499
Name and address for the record, sorry.

2185
02:46:08,519 --> 02:46:08,939
Thank you.

2186
02:46:08,999 --> 02:46:10,860
Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.

2187
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:16,122
I just wanted to provide some information about the upcoming Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.

2188
02:46:16,162 --> 02:46:19,124
It was referenced as potentially next week.

2189
02:46:19,164 --> 02:46:26,347
It originally was scheduled for next week, the 26th of May, but it has been rescheduled for June 10th.

2190
02:46:26,367 --> 02:46:29,149
That's 7 p.m.

2191
02:46:29,309 --> 02:46:30,229
here in City Hall.

2192
02:46:30,849 --> 02:46:35,392
And in addition to the Harvard Street project that was

2193
02:46:36,335 --> 02:46:40,937
mentioned there are four other projects on the agenda just for anybody who might be interested.

2194
02:46:41,718 --> 02:47:04,350
Um, the same actually Harvard street, uh, owner has a petition to, um, do some work at the 23 forest street, uh, building, which is across the street from the post office to, uh, convert that, uh, property from, uh, three residential dwellings, I think apartments and offices into, um, five condos and a retail space.

2195
02:47:05,182 --> 02:47:18,132
There's a proposal to add two residential units to the building at 241 Boston Avenue, which is a commercial building near North Street.

2196
02:47:19,113 --> 02:47:30,061
There's a petition to add a undersized parking space to 16 Dunbar Avenue, which is in the Haines Square area.

2197
02:47:30,702 --> 02:47:34,745
And there's a petition to operate a kennel

2198
02:47:35,884 --> 02:47:38,185
on 168 Mystic Avenue.

2199
02:47:39,266 --> 02:47:46,369
So again, that's June 10th at seven o'clock here at City Hall for anybody that's interested in any of those projects.

2200
02:47:46,589 --> 02:47:47,129
Thank you, Ken.

2201
02:47:50,031 --> 02:47:59,775
The meeting for the Winthrop Street development is before the Community Development Board tomorrow, the 20th here at 6.30.

2202
02:47:59,915 --> 02:48:00,495
Thank you, Ken.

2203
02:48:08,336 --> 02:48:09,256
Name and address of the record.

2204
02:48:09,897 --> 02:48:11,578
Mario Martin, 18 Benton Road.

2205
02:48:12,639 --> 02:48:17,202
I actually live pretty close to Harvard, so it's actually right on the corner.

2206
02:48:17,222 --> 02:48:24,747
I wanted to thank, by the way, Councilor Gavriello for bringing up this important issue as a resident of Benton Road and Harvard Street.

2207
02:48:25,607 --> 02:48:26,408
This does affect me.

2208
02:48:27,268 --> 02:48:32,312
The question I have for the Council is actually if it's, as Councilor Camuso mentioned earlier,

2209
02:48:34,814 --> 02:48:42,560
essentially difficult for zoning boards to approve conversions or additions, in this case, especially to a non-conforming home.

2210
02:48:44,381 --> 02:48:48,123
How do we know that compliance is actually being enforced?

2211
02:48:48,644 --> 02:48:57,690
Meaning, how do we know landlords aren't actually going out and if they know they can't get it approved, how do we know that they're not doing it behind the back of the city?

2212
02:48:58,491 --> 02:48:59,531
And how are we enforcing it?

2213
02:49:00,012 --> 02:49:00,212
Thank you.

2214
02:49:00,592 --> 02:49:00,932
Thank you.

2215
02:49:01,153 --> 02:49:01,913
Councilor Camuso.

2216
02:49:03,034 --> 02:49:04,495
I think that that's a good question.

2217
02:49:04,913 --> 02:49:06,354
And we have a code enforcement department.

2218
02:49:06,374 --> 02:49:12,357
A lot of times, most of the complaints come from actual neighbors that will see additional vehicles and things of that nature.

2219
02:49:12,938 --> 02:49:29,907
Unfortunately, as we all know, as city councilors, we don't find out all the time about these illegal units until it goes to sell or they're doing a home inspection or doing the appraisal for the taxes, which we're going through right now.

2220
02:49:31,115 --> 02:49:43,084
City actually sends someone in the house and they're looking for stoves in the basement and stuff in the basement that would indicate that it's... But I'd say 90% of them, and we've heard this from our building department, comes from neighbors' complaints.

2221
02:49:44,766 --> 02:49:50,310
So they do take them very serious when it does come up, but if they don't know, they can't do anything about it.

2222
02:49:50,330 --> 02:49:52,692
Thank you, ma'am.

2223
02:49:52,952 --> 02:49:53,252
Thank you.

2224
02:49:53,272 --> 02:49:55,614
Mr. Cassidy.

2225
02:49:59,377 --> 02:49:59,657
Thank you.

2226
02:50:00,771 --> 02:50:02,872
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford, Mass.

2227
02:50:04,092 --> 02:50:05,473
I'll make it brief as possible.

2228
02:50:06,153 --> 02:50:10,294
Our city is getting more congested and it's getting worse.

2229
02:50:10,314 --> 02:50:11,575
Mr. Caviello, you're right.

2230
02:50:13,836 --> 02:50:20,038
By right, a real estate owner, the way I understand it, can go do whatever they please and build out within the zoning rights.

2231
02:50:21,398 --> 02:50:28,341
I believe it's through a Board of Appeals, through a hardship that they would have to prove hardship.

2232
02:50:29,702 --> 02:50:39,770
and do arrests of some sort that they could get a variance in order to go from a three-family to a five or whatever if it's not allowed in that area.

2233
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:45,794
So I guess, Mr. Caviello, you should go to the meeting and express your concern.

2234
02:50:45,814 --> 02:50:48,637
And other people should also if they have some issues with that.

2235
02:50:50,178 --> 02:50:53,600
But most importantly, I would worry about Tufts University.

2236
02:50:53,620 --> 02:50:59,385
I would make sure that Tufts University is buying all their real estate.

2237
02:51:01,002 --> 02:51:14,366
through Wild Night Hill Properties to keep the real estate tax bill in place, or else it becomes a non-profit and we lose more and more of our real estate tax base, or some other entity that will pay a real estate tax.

2238
02:51:15,926 --> 02:51:18,687
I don't care if it's commercial or residential.

2239
02:51:19,727 --> 02:51:19,987
Thank you.

2240
02:51:20,027 --> 02:51:20,387
Thank you.

2241
02:51:21,988 --> 02:51:22,628
On the motion.

2242
02:51:26,669 --> 02:51:29,490
Do you want them to request a moratorium, or do you want to

2243
02:51:43,390 --> 02:51:53,973
So we'll ask for how many conversions in the last 10 years, and then the last year by address, and also how many are coming forward within the next two to four months.

2244
02:51:55,613 --> 02:51:57,194
OK, we'll take off the moratorium.

2245
02:52:02,805 --> 02:52:04,687
So we'll be notified when they come forward?

2246
02:52:04,887 --> 02:52:07,929
Can we be notified?

2247
02:52:15,175 --> 02:52:22,321
I think the neighbors should know there's going to be more, they expect more, and people should be aware of what's going to be coming down the line.

2248
02:52:23,982 --> 02:52:28,546
So by resolution by councillor Carviello, amended by councillor

2249
02:52:31,432 --> 02:52:31,872
Kamuso.

2250
02:52:33,753 --> 02:52:34,434
Motion for approval.

2251
02:52:37,435 --> 02:52:38,095
All those in favor?

2252
02:52:38,796 --> 02:52:46,560
All those passed.

2253
02:52:46,580 --> 02:52:47,660
15471 offered by Councillor Knight.

2254
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:51,382
Be resolved that motion to withdraw.

2255
02:52:51,422 --> 02:52:52,123
All those in favor?

2256
02:52:52,543 --> 02:52:53,203
All those opposed?

2257
02:52:54,764 --> 02:52:55,484
Paper is withdrawn.

2258
02:52:56,045 --> 02:52:57,545
Paper 15-472 offered by Councillor Knight.

2259
02:52:59,357 --> 02:53:10,163
be resolved the contractors performing the construction work on Winthrop Street between Route 16 and Route 60 remove all construction equipment, materials and debris at the conclusion of each day.

2260
02:53:10,303 --> 02:53:10,803
Councillor Knight.

2261
02:53:14,025 --> 02:53:17,787
Madam President, thank you very much and thank you for indulging me once again on this topic.

2262
02:53:19,148 --> 02:53:26,512
I've gotten a number of complaints, Madam President, from the residents of the area, many of whom are my neighbours, relative to the closure of

2263
02:53:27,781 --> 02:53:38,487
one lane of traffic going down Winthrop Street and one lane of traffic going up Winthrop Street so that these contractors can store their materials during the day and after the work hours.

2264
02:53:38,627 --> 02:53:50,753
Now, I can understand blocking off lanes of traffic to ensure their safety and to allow them to have access to their equipment and materials when construction's going on, but at this point in time, with this mini big dig that's been going on for the past two years now,

2265
02:53:52,135 --> 02:53:53,996
The area is just looking blighted and terrible.

2266
02:53:54,337 --> 02:53:56,339
And this is a gateway to the city.

2267
02:53:56,379 --> 02:54:06,467
As someone gets off the highway and they go down Route 16 and take a right onto Route 38 to go up to Winthrop Circle, they're going to drive through an area that's just blighted at this point in time.

2268
02:54:06,828 --> 02:54:14,955
There's a generator, there's cones, there's curbs, there's piles of dirt, there's old rusted pipes, there's new pipes, there's plastic.

2269
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:18,939
There's a port-a-party on the sidewalk at the corner of Winthrop Street and High Street.

2270
02:54:18,999 --> 02:54:21,682
I mean, it can't get any worse at this point in time, Madam President.

2271
02:54:22,203 --> 02:54:28,690
I think that we have an opportunity to request that these materials be removed at the end of the day.

2272
02:54:29,030 --> 02:54:30,612
And I don't think that that's too much to ask.

2273
02:54:31,393 --> 02:54:36,258
There's ample space for the contractor at their yard.

2274
02:54:36,695 --> 02:54:38,375
They're keeping two bulldozers out there.

2275
02:54:38,415 --> 02:54:39,436
They can move the bulldozers.

2276
02:54:39,476 --> 02:54:41,336
They can put the bulldozers in a parking lot.

2277
02:54:41,356 --> 02:54:42,936
They can put the bulldozers at the condom shelf.

2278
02:54:43,176 --> 02:54:54,698
They can put it in a number of places, Madam President, but one of the places that it shouldn't be is sitting in a lane of traffic, blocking a lane of traffic and creating congestion and creating traffic hardships, especially with the current condition of the roadway that it's in.

2279
02:54:55,258 --> 02:55:04,180
So Madam President, I'd ask for my council colleagues to support this resolution and to make the request that at the end of each workday, the area is cleaned out of all construction materials, debris and equipment.

2280
02:55:04,882 --> 02:55:09,184
in the interest of public safety and in the interest of, you know, egress into the city.

2281
02:55:09,244 --> 02:55:11,905
I think it's just a beautification issue at this point in time, Madam President.

2282
02:55:11,925 --> 02:55:14,586
The residents have been very patient in dealing with this issue.

2283
02:55:16,006 --> 02:55:22,088
Earlier in the meeting tonight, we had a very long discussion about what these residents are going to have to face again in 18 short months.

2284
02:55:22,589 --> 02:55:27,850
So I think at this point in time, they need a little bit of relief, Madam President, and I think that this will do it for a short period of time.

2285
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:32,152
But, you know, I'd also like to see when this construction project is going to end two months ago.

2286
02:55:32,613 --> 02:55:37,095
When we made the request of the DPW, they said that there were 18 more connections that needed to take place.

2287
02:55:37,716 --> 02:55:45,820
And that led me to believe that how many of them had been done, led me to question how many have actually been done if they need 18 more to do.

2288
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:49,121
So this project's been taking an extremely long time.

2289
02:55:50,282 --> 02:55:51,883
I can only imagine what the budget looks like.

2290
02:55:52,363 --> 02:55:56,025
I think this was something that was supposed to be wrapped up in short order, and it hasn't been, Madam President.

2291
02:55:56,065 --> 02:56:00,487
So in the interest of mitigation, I'd make this request, and I'd ask my colleagues to support it.

2292
02:56:00,952 --> 02:56:02,692
Absolutely, motion for approval.

2293
02:56:02,712 --> 02:56:03,233
Second.

2294
02:56:03,653 --> 02:56:05,633
Seconded by Council President De La Russo.

2295
02:56:05,673 --> 02:56:06,373
All those in favor?

2296
02:56:06,393 --> 02:56:06,714
Aye.

2297
02:56:06,894 --> 02:56:07,534
All those opposed?

2298
02:56:07,614 --> 02:56:08,294
Paper passes.

2299
02:56:09,134 --> 02:56:12,075
Paper 15-473, offered by Councilor Knight.

2300
02:56:12,175 --> 02:56:21,037
Be it resolved the City Clerk provide a listing of all requests for budget appropriations made by the Council for review in concert with the City Council budget hearings.

2301
02:56:21,297 --> 02:56:21,837
Councilor Knight.

2302
02:56:22,278 --> 02:56:23,798
Madam President, again, thank you very much.

2303
02:56:25,458 --> 02:56:27,579
We're going to have budget hearings coming up in June.

2304
02:56:28,489 --> 02:56:29,550
to go over the state budget.

2305
02:56:29,810 --> 02:56:36,573
I think for the past year, this council has been very active and involved in lobbying for issues and matters that are important to it.

2306
02:56:37,154 --> 02:56:45,238
And I think that now is the right time for us to take a look at these materials, go through them all, and to develop our position as we go forward to set the budget for the next fiscal year, Madam President.

2307
02:56:46,059 --> 02:56:52,102
I think that it's very important for us to maybe take a look at what we've requested, prioritize them, and bring those issues to the administration.

2308
02:56:52,796 --> 02:56:55,057
and make sure that they're included in the budget process, Madam President.

2309
02:56:55,077 --> 02:56:58,639
So I'd ask that my colleagues support this resolution in order for us to prepare for council budget hearings.

2310
02:56:59,619 --> 02:57:01,100
Motion for approval by Council of the Night.

2311
02:57:01,140 --> 02:57:01,841
All those in favor?

2312
02:57:02,341 --> 02:57:04,142
Seconded by Council President Del Rosso.

2313
02:57:04,482 --> 02:57:05,122
All those opposed?

2314
02:57:05,162 --> 02:57:05,843
Paper passes.

2315
02:57:06,623 --> 02:57:06,783
Paper 15-4.

2316
02:57:06,803 --> 02:57:08,964
I'd like to withdraw at this point in time, Madam President.

2317
02:57:09,985 --> 02:57:10,705
Motion to withdraw.

2318
02:57:10,745 --> 02:57:11,365
Paper 15-474.

2319
02:57:12,166 --> 02:57:12,906
All those in favor?

2320
02:57:13,366 --> 02:57:14,027
All those opposed?

2321
02:57:14,087 --> 02:57:14,887
Paper is withdrawn.

2322
02:57:15,550 --> 02:57:18,953
Paper 15-475 offered by Councillor Knight.

2323
02:57:19,073 --> 02:57:32,044
Be it resolved the harbour master and project manager for the Craddock Bridge renovation project conduct an information session for boat owners to determine what waterway restrictions will be implemented during the renovations of the Craddock Bridge.

2324
02:57:32,964 --> 02:57:33,825
Councillor Knight.

2325
02:57:33,865 --> 02:57:35,166
Madam President, thank you very much.

2326
02:57:35,186 --> 02:57:38,209
I was contacted by a number of avid fishermen who

2327
02:57:39,246 --> 02:57:47,289
during previous construction projects had loaded up their boat with their bait and their friends and their barbecue and their food.

2328
02:57:47,389 --> 02:57:53,751
And they got on the river at 4 o'clock in the morning and tried to make their way out to the harbor to go fishing for the day.

2329
02:57:53,911 --> 02:57:58,673
And they were met with a roadblock, no access, no access to the harbor.

2330
02:57:59,271 --> 02:58:05,032
And these same individuals purchase a slip every year to house their boat in the upper lake.

2331
02:58:05,732 --> 02:58:08,033
And it's a significant expense for them.

2332
02:58:08,093 --> 02:58:17,755
So in discussions that we've had, one of the issues that was raised was whether or not there were going to be restrictions for these individuals to take their boats downriver to get into the harbor.

2333
02:58:18,395 --> 02:58:23,216
I've had some discussions with our Office of Community Development and the project manager, and there will be some restrictions.

2334
02:58:23,556 --> 02:58:26,177
The project manager has changed on the project at this point in time.

2335
02:58:26,897 --> 02:58:31,119
So I'm requesting that the Harbormaster and the new project manager sit down and develop a schedule.

2336
02:58:31,639 --> 02:58:44,124
And the schedule can be posted and shared with boat owners, and an information session be conducted so that people that have concerns about this can sit down and can actually speak to the individuals that are making the decisions in the Harbormaster to figure out what best course of action will be.

2337
02:58:45,384 --> 02:58:47,305
Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

2338
02:58:47,345 --> 02:58:48,145
All those in favor?

2339
02:58:48,165 --> 02:58:48,605
Aye.

2340
02:58:48,665 --> 02:58:49,326
All those opposed?

2341
02:58:49,366 --> 02:58:50,066
Paper passes.

2342
02:58:50,866 --> 02:58:54,308
Paper 15-476, offered by Councilor Knight.

2343
02:58:54,328 --> 02:58:55,008
Madam President, I withdraw.

2344
02:58:56,010 --> 02:58:56,750
Motion to withdraw.

2345
02:58:56,770 --> 02:58:57,571
All those in favor?

2346
02:58:57,871 --> 02:58:58,612
All those opposed?

2347
02:58:58,652 --> 02:58:59,472
Motion is withdrawn.

2348
02:59:02,074 --> 02:59:05,416
Paper 15-477, offered by Councilor Knight.

2349
02:59:05,496 --> 02:59:14,402
Be it resolved the administration provide the council with a listing of all vacant board and commission positions that are established by way of ordinance, statute, or state law.

2350
02:59:14,522 --> 02:59:15,062
Councilor Knight.

2351
02:59:15,562 --> 02:59:16,903
Madam President, thank you very much.

2352
02:59:18,104 --> 02:59:21,826
Early last month I had my office hours and an individual came before me.

2353
02:59:23,390 --> 02:59:34,855
some concern relative to vacancies in certain boards and commissions and the lack of meeting in a frequency that would be established by statute ordinance or by way of law.

2354
02:59:35,456 --> 02:59:44,980
So with that being said, Madam President, I took a look at the listing of boards and commissions and noticed that there are a variety of vacancies that exist in those boards and commissions.

2355
02:59:45,460 --> 02:59:50,923
And I think with the change of administration coming, it would be very important for us to see what positions are vacant at this point in time.

2356
02:59:51,858 --> 02:59:58,704
what's filled, what's not filled, and then take a look at why they're not filled and maybe make a recommendation to fill certain positions, Madam President.

2357
03:00:01,066 --> 03:00:02,807
I have no problem with that.

2358
03:00:02,847 --> 03:00:05,169
Madam President, I'd like to amend the paper to request what the salaries are.

2359
03:00:06,270 --> 03:00:06,610
Very good.

2360
03:00:06,670 --> 03:00:10,173
On the amendment, motion of Council of the Night for approval as amended.

2361
03:00:10,213 --> 03:00:10,954
All those in favor?

2362
03:00:10,974 --> 03:00:11,414
Aye.

2363
03:00:11,834 --> 03:00:12,575
All those opposed?

2364
03:00:13,696 --> 03:00:14,477
Motion passes.

2365
03:00:18,780 --> 03:00:21,002
Offered by Councilor Penta.

2366
03:00:21,452 --> 03:00:24,514
be it resolved that the future of Lawrence Memorial Hospital be discussed.

2367
03:00:24,934 --> 03:00:25,655
Councillor Penta.

2368
03:00:28,557 --> 03:00:32,480
I'd like to refer this to next Tuesday's meeting, please.

2369
03:00:32,920 --> 03:00:37,043
On the motion of Councillor Penta to table this, to take it up next Tuesday.

2370
03:00:37,083 --> 03:00:38,024
All those in favour?

2371
03:00:38,424 --> 03:00:39,064
All those opposed?

2372
03:00:39,184 --> 03:00:39,865
Motion is tabled.

2373
03:00:40,898 --> 03:00:52,284
Offered by Councilor Caravello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer our sincere condolences to the family of Warren Ramirez, who is very active in the Grace Episcopal Church and St.

2374
03:00:52,304 --> 03:00:53,044
Joseph Choir.

2375
03:00:53,465 --> 03:00:56,246
His presence in our community will be sorely missed.

2376
03:00:56,326 --> 03:01:09,213
Also, 15-481, if I may, offered by Councilor Pinto, be it resolved that an expression of sympathy be forwarded to the family of Warren Ramirez, a former bank official at the Brookline Bank,

2377
03:01:09,838 --> 03:01:24,242
former Arlington Savings Bank, on his passing, a special expression of recognition be extended to Kathleen Beebe, his special love in his life, and the most wonderful woman who dedicated herself to Warren and his family.

2378
03:01:25,082 --> 03:01:38,585
Also, if we could, one more condolence offered by Councilor Penta, 15 of 482, be resolved that an expression of sympathy be forwarded to the family of Joseph Callahan, the former city auditor

2379
03:01:39,035 --> 03:01:39,935
upon his passing.

2380
03:01:40,415 --> 03:01:47,317
Mr. Callahan was a gentle and caring person who always performed his job with courtesy and professionalism.

2381
03:01:48,077 --> 03:01:48,758
Councilor Pinto.

2382
03:01:49,938 --> 03:01:56,940
Mr. President, this past week, I can't say you had the opportunity.

2383
03:01:56,980 --> 03:02:02,621
This past week you haven't been part of the funeral services for Juan Ramirez.

2384
03:02:02,761 --> 03:02:05,182
And it took place at the Grace Episcopal Church.

2385
03:02:06,335 --> 03:02:10,337
And what was very different about it was the fact that the choir from St.

2386
03:02:10,357 --> 03:02:20,623
Joseph's Church on High Street, as well as the choir from the Grace Episcopal Church joined together for this particular mass service, so to speak.

2387
03:02:21,284 --> 03:02:24,966
Warren, as everyone knows, sang at both churches, St.

2388
03:02:25,006 --> 03:02:26,587
Joe's and Sacred Heart.

2389
03:02:27,347 --> 03:02:33,251
And very dedicated to both the churches and very dedicated to the people in both those churches.

2390
03:02:34,385 --> 03:02:35,365
fine representative.

2391
03:02:35,425 --> 03:02:38,367
It was an outstanding funeral performance.

2392
03:02:38,507 --> 03:02:58,115
And Kathleen Beebe, who was the love of his life, there participating with this family, an extremely wonderful lady, strong, who took care of Warren and his mother for many, many years, and just a fine and wonderful lady to be recognized as well.

2393
03:02:58,955 --> 03:03:03,537
Lastly, anyone who knew Joseph Callahan, who was our former city auditor,

2394
03:03:04,070 --> 03:03:06,392
He was a very gentle and caring individual.

2395
03:03:06,952 --> 03:03:13,656
He did his job quietly and with professionalism, and he truly personified a true public employee.

2396
03:03:13,736 --> 03:03:18,860
So to his family, we offer likewise this expression of sympathy.

2397
03:03:21,001 --> 03:03:21,261
Thank you.

2398
03:03:21,542 --> 03:03:22,042
Yes.

2399
03:03:22,722 --> 03:03:27,886
Again, I want to convey my condolences to the Warren Ramirez and Kathleen.

2400
03:03:28,542 --> 03:03:37,572
I mean, I've known Warren for many years, and you see him in the square all the time, and always there for you whenever you need a good man, good family.

2401
03:03:37,612 --> 03:03:40,495
He's going to be missed in the area.

2402
03:03:40,515 --> 03:03:40,915
Yes, yes, yes.

2403
03:04:05,262 --> 03:04:17,348
15487 offered by President DelaRusso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the retirees of 2014-15 of the Medford Fire Department for the years of service and protection of the citizens of Medford.

2404
03:04:18,368 --> 03:04:28,253
The four retirees are firefighter Matthew T. Jewett, retired May 2, 2014, after five years of service.

2405
03:04:28,914 --> 03:04:31,115
Lieutenant Timothy A. Beckwith, retired

2406
03:04:31,627 --> 03:04:35,489
June 2nd, 2014, after 31 years of service.

2407
03:04:35,589 --> 03:04:42,112
Firefighter Timothy M. Powers retired October 5th, 2014, after 34 years of service.

2408
03:04:42,672 --> 03:04:51,356
And firefighter Michael E. Greer retired February 1st, 2015, after 32 years of service.

2409
03:04:51,816 --> 03:04:58,279
The retired firefighters will be honored at the annual retirement banquet on Friday, May 29th at 7 p.m.

2410
03:05:00,101 --> 03:05:02,942
at the Firefighters Hall at 340 Salem Street here in Medford.

2411
03:05:03,702 --> 03:05:15,047
And the council president will be on hand along with any of the other councilors who are present to present the certificates of achievement and congratulation.

2412
03:05:16,447 --> 03:05:17,868
Congratulation to the retirees.

2413

Motion be received and placed on file, move approval.

2414
03:05:22,410 --> 03:05:24,150
Councilor Knight, all those in favor, all those opposed?

2415
03:05:24,730 --> 03:05:25,911
Motion approved.

2416
03:05:27,898 --> 03:05:30,280
I think we've achieved everything we came to do tonight.

2417
03:05:31,681 --> 03:05:32,321
Mr. President.

2418
03:05:32,962 --> 03:05:33,422
Mr. President.

2419
03:05:33,962 --> 03:05:34,703
Councilor Caravello.

2420
03:05:34,923 --> 03:05:35,783
Thank you, Mr. President.

2421
03:05:35,844 --> 03:05:40,567
If I can remind, tomorrow is the annual veterans luncheon here.

2422
03:05:42,608 --> 03:05:47,111
So anybody who doesn't know or wants to attend, all veterans are free.

2423
03:05:47,131 --> 03:05:49,413
12 o'clock here, there's going to be a couple of speakers.

2424
03:05:50,113 --> 03:05:56,218
Our own John Galeen will be one of our speakers, just returned from Vietnam a couple of weeks ago.

2425
03:05:57,360 --> 03:06:02,541
For any veteran or anybody in the community who wants to come, 12 o'clock here tomorrow in the Council Chambers.

2426
03:06:02,921 --> 03:06:03,242
Awesome.

2427
03:06:03,482 --> 03:06:04,422
Not too late to get a ticket.

2428
03:06:05,162 --> 03:06:05,402
Sorry?

2429
03:06:05,442 --> 03:06:07,083
Not too late to get a ticket.

2430
03:06:07,283 --> 03:06:08,663
If you're a veteran, you're free.

2431
03:06:09,563 --> 03:06:10,543
Never too late for you.

2432
03:06:10,563 --> 03:06:12,764
You can come tomorrow and get a ticket.

2433
03:06:13,244 --> 03:06:13,584
Very good.

2434
03:06:14,344 --> 03:06:15,765
Councilor Pinto, you had something for us.

2435
03:06:16,565 --> 03:06:19,506
Next Monday, forthcoming Monday, is going to be Memorial Day.

2436
03:06:20,286 --> 03:06:22,667
And I just want to remind everyone that you're all invited.

2437
03:06:22,727 --> 03:06:24,167
I believe it's 10 o'clock in the morning.

2438
03:06:24,979 --> 03:06:28,220
at Oak Grove Cemetery for the services that will be partaking.

2439
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:37,942
And it should be a fine day remembering all our veterans, and at the same time, it's a nice way for the community to get out and see each other and say hello.

2440
03:06:38,382 --> 03:06:39,742
It's always a beautiful moment there.

2441
03:06:40,003 --> 03:06:40,823
Always a beautiful moment.

2442
03:06:40,843 --> 03:06:41,043
It is.

2443
03:06:41,383 --> 03:06:42,103
Thank you, Counselor.

2444
03:06:42,543 --> 03:06:47,404
The records of the May 12, 2015 Council meeting were passed to Counselor Knight.

2445
03:06:47,444 --> 03:06:48,825
Mr. Counselor, how did you find those?

2446
03:06:49,105 --> 03:06:51,205
In order, Mr. President.

2447
03:06:51,225 --> 03:06:51,485
Move approval.

2448
03:06:51,505 --> 03:06:53,006
Mr. President, I have a problem.

2449
03:06:55,926 --> 03:06:58,967
So, Councillor Pinto, would you like to discuss that with Councillor Knight?

2450
03:06:58,987 --> 03:07:02,668
I'll discuss it with the maker of the motion and resolve it.

2451
03:07:03,188 --> 03:07:06,809
So, we'll resolve it and have the proper amendation made.

2452
03:07:07,269 --> 03:07:08,730
So, on that motion, all those in favour?

2453
03:07:09,810 --> 03:07:10,650
All those opposed?

2454
03:07:11,531 --> 03:07:12,391
Motion carries.

2455
03:07:13,391 --> 03:07:15,832
Motion to adjourn by Councillor Caviello.

2456
03:07:15,872 --> 03:07:16,712
All those in favour?

2457
03:07:17,112 --> 03:07:17,913
All those opposed?

2458
03:07:17,933 --> 03:07:19,093
Motion to adjourn.
