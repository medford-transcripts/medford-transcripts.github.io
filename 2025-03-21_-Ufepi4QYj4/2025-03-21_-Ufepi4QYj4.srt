[SPEAKER_21]: Seconded by Councilor Camuso.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,761
[SPEAKER_17]: On that motion, Councilor Penta.

39
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Judge, what's at 11 Hall Street right now?

40
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,022
[SPEAKER_24]: It was the old method breaking wheel.

41
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:43,723
[SPEAKER_24]: Bobby Maloney's on the building.

42
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you renting or buying?

43
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:46,233
[SPEAKER_24]: We bought it.

44
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:46,633
[SPEAKER_24]: You bought it?

45
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:46,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

46
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:49,674
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're just going to continue the same uses as they did.

47
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,035
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is nothing more than a change in name?

48
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:52,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

49
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Change in name to the same location, right Mr. Park?

50
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:55,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

51
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,737
[SPEAKER_08]: The license is on transferral, so.

52
00:02:58,218 --> 00:02:58,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

53
00:02:59,678 --> 00:02:59,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

54
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:03,740
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello-Viello, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,500
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

56
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:04,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,721
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

58
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:07,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

59
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:08,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

60
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

61
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:08,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck.

62
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:18,602
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take items out of order, petitions, all those in favor?

63
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:19,583
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

64
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,206
[SPEAKER_14]: To take petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

65
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:39,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Petition by 15488, petition by Eversource Energy to address City Council on a brief presentation on Mystic Station 250 to Woburn Station number 221, KV transmission line project, questions and answers.

66
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:43,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Folks, please come forward from Eversource.

67
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Folks, just so you know, we discussed this through Councilor Marks last week.

68
00:03:51,214 --> 00:04:04,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Before Councilor Marks had an opportunity to address the matter with us, I had received a communication from Mr. Zamparelli of Eversource to address the council.

69
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I asked him to place a petition before us.

70
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:10,487
[SPEAKER_14]: And he has done so, so they're here to do this.

71
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:17,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I should have announced at the beginning of this meeting, and I apologize, we are not broadcasting on Comcast right now.

72
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,030
[SPEAKER_14]: We are, however, broadcasting on Fios.

73
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:28,273
[SPEAKER_14]: A request for work to repair the matter has been submitted to Comcast, and they need to get out here.

74
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:32,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I suppose, as we all know, waiting for the cable guy can be a challenge at times.

75
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:35,855
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is being recorded for rebroadcast.

76
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,483
[SPEAKER_14]: and it is broadcasting on the Fios channel.

77
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So please state your name and address for the record.

78
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, my name is Bill Zamparelli.

79
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:49,086
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the Community Relations Representative with Eversource, and I actually represent the gas company.

80
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:55,348
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have a number of gas customers in Medford, but I also represent this project.

81
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me introduce my counterparts.

82
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,249
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Jack Lopes.

83
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack Lopes, also with Community Relations on a project.

84
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, Jack.

85
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,791
[SPEAKER_18]: And David Velez.

86
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,272
[SPEAKER_18]: David Velez, lead project manager with Eversource.

87
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:12,873
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm the project manager for the project we'll be discussing tonight.

88
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:13,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

89
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:18,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you could just give us a brief presentation on the project.

90
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:29,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know the councilors by way of motion last week presented a number of questions and I'm sure Councilor Marks, he'll be first to speak and he'll be able to

91
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:35,126
[SPEAKER_14]: make those questions known to you so we can address them once you've made your preliminary presentation.

92
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:41,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Our project manager, David Velez, will actually make the presentation and then we'll handle questions afterwards.

93
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:42,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

94
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:44,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Any time during, if there's questions that arise.

95
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Members of the Council, thank you very much.

96
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:52,726
[SPEAKER_18]: speak quickly and briefly on this, but please do feel free to interrupt and pull out any questions.

97
00:05:53,927 --> 00:06:01,531
[SPEAKER_18]: This project is a new 115 kilovolt underground transmission line project that we are proposing.

98
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:10,926
[SPEAKER_18]: To give you some background on it, the need for the project comes from a study done by the independent system operator of New England, or the ISO.

99
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:15,409
[SPEAKER_18]: The way I refer to them, they're sort of the air traffic control of the electric system.

100
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:22,394
[SPEAKER_18]: They say where the power comes from, where it's needed, and how the system is behaving, essentially.

101
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:31,600
[SPEAKER_18]: And looking out into the future, when they assess load growth, new customers, businesses, et cetera, what they see is that there are deficiencies in the overall

102
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:46,505
[SPEAKER_18]: New England system, particularly in the greater Boston area, where there could be situations where if one line were to go down and perhaps another line were to go down, we could be in a situation where many customers would be out.

103
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:59,406
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to stress here that this is not a distribution line where we're talking about one or two houses or businesses or a street, but we're talking about regional impacts, multi-thousand customers per line, which is why the ISO gets involved in that.

104
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:07,291
[SPEAKER_18]: So they put out there that there is this need that needs to be addressed, and then various entities come forward with solutions to that need.

105
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:12,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Eversource, formerly NSTAR, your local utility in the region,

106
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:17,679
[SPEAKER_18]: came up with one package, or another entity from New Hampshire came up with another package.

107
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:23,023
[SPEAKER_18]: In the end, they were weighed and judged, and the ISO determined ours was the preferred solution.

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:29,288
[SPEAKER_18]: That allows us to take a forward, do more work, and eventually submit a petition through the permitting process.

109
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,050
[SPEAKER_18]: So that brings us to this project.

110
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,393
[SPEAKER_18]: I should say this particular one is part of a suite of projects.

111
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,575
[SPEAKER_18]: When you go to page three, you'll see that.

112
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,817
[SPEAKER_18]: The Mystic to Woburn Line project is a 115 underground line

113
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:47,482
[SPEAKER_18]: going through the cities and towns of Everett, Boston, Somerville, Medford, Winchester, and Woburn.

114
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:57,348
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to that, it's complemented by other projects like the Woburn to Wakefield project, and also a Merrimack Valley project that goes from New Hampshire into Mass.

115
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:04,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Altogether, these multiple projects comprise the Greater Boston Solution we're referring to.

116
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:07,635
[SPEAKER_18]: But today, we're talking about the one specific piece that goes through Medford.

117
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,151
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on to page four.

118
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:17,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Underground line going from the Mystic station we're all familiar with to our station 211 at Woburn by Pond Street.

119
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:23,097
[SPEAKER_18]: The project is approximately eight miles going through the towns I mentioned.

120
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:29,960
[SPEAKER_18]: What's interesting to note is that we actually have an existing underground transmission line along the route we're proposing.

121
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,323
[SPEAKER_18]: So while it's a new piece of infrastructure we're talking about, we actually intend and propose to build a new line

122
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:41,898
[SPEAKER_18]: parallel to the existing, approximately 10 feet away from it, the whole length of the route.

123
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:48,700
[SPEAKER_18]: The idea being that we'll have two lines side by side, the ends will be tied together, if you will, we call that bifurcating.

124
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,182
[SPEAKER_18]: They go to their breaker terminations at the same point, and you have a line that is doubly strong as the original.

125
00:08:55,982 --> 00:09:01,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Page five, you'll see the project map from end to end from Everett Station to Ruburn.

126
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:23,069
[SPEAKER_18]: And on the next page, we have a zoom-in of just Medford, where you'll see that we're coming in from Somerville on Route 38, going down the length of it up to South Street, down South Street, across the Mystic River, up Winthrop Street to the Rotary, and again, 38, the whole way down to Winchester.

127
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:28,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, this is paralleling an existing line that is already there the whole way through the route.

128
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,422
[SPEAKER_18]: The next page, page seven, talks about the project schedule, which I think is a key point to address based on some of the questions we saw.

129
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,703
[SPEAKER_18]: We are just in the beginning stages of this project.

130
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:48,126
[SPEAKER_18]: We did hold a series of open houses over the last couple weeks, including one in Medford at the high school on the 11th.

131
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:57,829
[SPEAKER_18]: The next step for us is to take our petition and file it with the Department of Public Utilities, specifically their Energy Facilities Siting Board.

132
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,470
[SPEAKER_18]: We hope to do that very soon this month, actually.

133
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:10,482
[SPEAKER_18]: That will kick off a long public process with the EFSB that we think can go at least 18 months.

134
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:17,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Part of that will be public participation from members of the public, from various cities and any other stakeholder group.

135
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:28,371
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be notifications sent to abutters and those within 300 feet, notifications sent to all the various municipal entities, and any other stakeholder wants to be informed.

136
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,153
[SPEAKER_18]: That comes directly from the DPU, not from us.

137
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:37,418
[SPEAKER_18]: But as you see, we're doing a lot of outreach efforts on our own, and we're glad to push out that information on our own as well.

138
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:44,304
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that 18-month period of review as a minimum, we're thinking construction starting as early as 2017.

139
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:53,315
[SPEAKER_18]: And the entire eight-mile project would last roughly until the end of 2018 when we could put it in service.

140
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:58,881
[SPEAKER_18]: That wouldn't be the entire eight miles construction the entire two years, but bit by bit, section by section.

141
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:07,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Next steps, as you mentioned, we have been, for the last several months, collecting input from the towns.

142
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,492
[SPEAKER_18]: We've met with the mayor's office.

143
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:12,548
[SPEAKER_18]: We've met with the DPW here in Medford, as well as all the other towns.

144
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,449
[SPEAKER_18]: We've conducted open houses.

145
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:20,353
[SPEAKER_18]: The third step is filing that petition, again, which we hope to do soon, and then the DPU process.

146
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:35,645
[SPEAKER_18]: The proactive project outreach, talking about the various stakeholders involved here from municipal officials, planners, property owners, residents, all are going to have an opportunity to

147
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:42,710
[SPEAKER_18]: reach out, learn more about the project from us, provide their input either directly to us, to the DPU directly.

148
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:52,158
[SPEAKER_18]: They will hold their own public hearings as part of their stakeholder process, and then that all goes through the hearings through the state agency in Boston.

149
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,161
[SPEAKER_18]: And last, we have contact information.

150
00:11:56,181 --> 00:12:03,707
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a public hotline, 1-800 number, where we are collecting any questions and input that might come, also an email.

151
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:10,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, a website right now that gives some general information, not just about this one specific project, but the entire Mass.

152
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,702
[SPEAKER_18]: New Hampshire solution, as the website implies.

153
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:18,785
[SPEAKER_18]: You have all of our contact information for city officials to use as well.

154
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll leave it at that and take any questions.

155
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:23,168
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

156
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:24,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

157
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,351
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

158
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:33,696
[SPEAKER_23]: And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in having Eversource come down on this very important issue.

159
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,572
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'd like to thank the gentleman for coming tonight.

160
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:47,416
[SPEAKER_23]: You just mentioned the project itself, 18 months, I guess, which is going to start now of public involvement.

161
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:51,138
[SPEAKER_23]: And the actual project is two years.

162
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:52,098
[SPEAKER_23]: Did I hear that correct?

163
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:54,479
[SPEAKER_23]: We anticipate construction lasting roughly two years.

164
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,039
[SPEAKER_23]: Two years.

165
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,903
[SPEAKER_23]: So, if it's an eight-mile route and Method is 3.2 miles of that eight-mile route, can we figure out roughly how long

166
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,968
[SPEAKER_23]: You will be doing construction in the city by that, or is that not a good estimate?

167
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,389
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an excellent question.

168
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:18,672
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't give you a reliable answer to that right now, because what we are in the process of doing today is the engineering, specifically the underground engineering.

169
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,654
[SPEAKER_18]: We've figured out our route, which was easy because we're following an existing line.

170
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:30,016
[SPEAKER_18]: What we need to figure out is all the underground infrastructure, whether that be our own electric lines, water, sewer, gas.

171
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,337
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know there's a lot of that in the area.

172
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:33,658
[SPEAKER_18]: We have engineers.

173
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:47,645
[SPEAKER_18]: going through records, actually lifting manholes to collect inverts, figuring out what is in the street, and their job is, as we call it, threading the needle to find a way to place our pipe and also the various manholes that will be required to do this.

174
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:53,218
[SPEAKER_18]: If it was smooth sailing and we had no interruptions, I would say construction would go very quickly through Medford.

175
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:59,842
[SPEAKER_18]: If we encounter a lot of utilities that need to be relocated, a lot of conflicts, then it would take longer.

176
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:06,487
[SPEAKER_18]: I can give you a much better answer to that question once I've seen the engineering, which I expect to be in the middle to late July.

177
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:07,627
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

178
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:13,251
[SPEAKER_23]: And I assume from what I understand of the project, it's going to be a 24 inch wide trench.

179
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,027
[SPEAKER_23]: Six feet deep?

180
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:18,588
[SPEAKER_23]: Five feet deep.

181
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:27,415
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you were going to install a manhole cover, we are able to, I guess, monitor this line and so forth.

182
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,978
[SPEAKER_23]: What size of trench is a manhole cover, roughly?

183
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,641
[SPEAKER_18]: The manhole is much larger than the trench itself.

184
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:43,084
[SPEAKER_18]: The manholes are roughly 18 feet long by, I believe, 10, 12 feet wide.

185
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:44,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I can get back to you on that.

186
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:45,485
[SPEAKER_18]: 10 wide.

187
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,247
[SPEAKER_18]: They're quite larger, so they're not built as part of the trench.

188
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:53,068
[SPEAKER_18]: They are their own excavation that interrupts the trench, as it were.

189
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:57,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Typically we like to do a precast manhole where the area is excavated.

190
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:04,200
[SPEAKER_18]: The manhole gets dropped right into place and gets built into the duct system.

191
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,467
[SPEAKER_18]: If for some reason we can't do that because of other conflicts, we can form and pour it in place.

192
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,521
[SPEAKER_18]: The purpose of those manholes is not just to monitor and to do maintenance, but actually for the splicing.

193
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, this is an eight-mile stretch.

194
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:23,766
[SPEAKER_18]: The cable itself that will go inside the pipe only comes and reels about 2,800 feet long.

195
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:29,008
[SPEAKER_18]: So roughly every 2,800 feet, you have to do a splice, which is where the manholes come in.

196
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,789
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where the splicing operation takes place.

197
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:31,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

198
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,732
[SPEAKER_23]: And according to the website, it said the manholes

199
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:40,629
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to be placed approximately 2,000 to 2,400 linear feet.

200
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:43,330
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a very rough estimate.

201
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, that's in a perfect world.

202
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,631
[SPEAKER_18]: If you take these, it's a little bit more, I'd say it's more like 24 to 28 hundred feet.

203
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:56,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, in a perfect world, if the line were going straight, you would stretch out that 2,800 foot cable and put a splice at every one.

204
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,913
[SPEAKER_18]: As we know, it's not a perfect world.

205
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:59,354
[SPEAKER_18]: There's going to be bends and turns.

206
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:05,115
[SPEAKER_18]: We may have utilities that are blocking and we may have to move the manholes closer together.

207
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:10,359
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why there's really no way to give an accurate number of the manholes today until we see the engineer.

208
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,700
[SPEAKER_23]: Not accurate, but we should be able to get a ballpark.

209
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,802
[SPEAKER_18]: I can tell you that roughly we're anticipating in the neighborhood of 17 manholes throughout the 8-mile project.

210
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,202
[SPEAKER_23]: And method, roughly?

211
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:23,744
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't even seen that to count that, to be honest.

212
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:24,584
[SPEAKER_18]: I would hate to.

213
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:26,625
[SPEAKER_23]: You should be able to give somewhat of a ballpark.

214
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:33,788
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, if you're going to put them 2,000 to 2,400, and I realize it's not a perfect world, but based on 3.2 miles

215
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:39,990
[SPEAKER_23]: roughly out of the 17, are we talking maybe seven, eight?

216
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:49,055
[SPEAKER_18]: We could take, no, we could take the eight mile route, you know, the 17 manholes divide by eight, but don't ask a communication major to do that math on the fly.

217
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,738
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, you could do it that way, but I would not say that's an accurate assumption.

218
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,079
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to do the engineering first.

219
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:59,120
[SPEAKER_15]: It really depends on where the turns are, I think.

220
00:16:59,141 --> 00:16:59,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

221
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:03,543
[SPEAKER_15]: So they may need an interim manhole at some location.

222
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:06,146
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, but you understand the concern.

223
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:22,517
[SPEAKER_23]: The concern is that it's one thing to dig a two foot wide, six foot deep, five foot deep trench, and then to have an 18 foot by 10 foot manhole, which to me is a pretty sizable project, which leads to my second question.

224
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:26,680
[SPEAKER_23]: I know you said it's gonna be in the proximity of the existing line.

225
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,462
[SPEAKER_23]: Whereabouts does this fall on the street?

226
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, that's the question that the engineering will have to answer.

227
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:38,093
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't tell you right now if we're on the sidewalk, on the side of the road, on the middle of the road.

228
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:40,974
[SPEAKER_23]: That's huge.

229
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:44,115
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why the engineers are getting paid a lot of money.

230
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:48,937
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a big job to do to figure out where that's going to go for the entire model.

231
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:49,837
[SPEAKER_18]: And it won't be consistent.

232
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,058
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be on the sidewalk in some parts.

233
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,879
[SPEAKER_18]: It might shift to the middle of the road here.

234
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:57,140
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to avoid impacts to existing utilities.

235
00:17:57,557 --> 00:18:01,039
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we have to snake and move around, if that's... Have you brought an engineer on board?

236
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:02,540
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, we have power engineers.

237
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,160
[SPEAKER_18]: And is there a reason why they're not here tonight?

238
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,662
[SPEAKER_18]: They're based out of Minneapolis.

239
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:11,944
[SPEAKER_18]: It's their home office, although they do have a team working in South Attleboro.

240
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:17,487
[SPEAKER_18]: But frankly, they just look up plans and records and pull manholes.

241
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:18,608
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

242
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:22,850
[SPEAKER_23]: This can't be the first project of this nature that's being done in the area, correct?

243
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,190
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

244
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,871
[SPEAKER_23]: So there must be other...

245
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:39,084
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, the towns that have had this done, would you say in your best estimate that, and I realize you're not an engineer, but are we looking at disruption to the roadway?

246
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:49,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, this project will be in the roadway, so the excavation we're talking about, whether it be the trench or the manhole, the majority of it will be in the public roadway.

247
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:51,826
[SPEAKER_23]: Including the sidewalk?

248
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:52,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Potentially.

249
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,207
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

250
00:18:56,623 --> 00:19:01,304
[SPEAKER_23]: My next question, and I'd like to have those questions answered, Mr. President.

251
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:12,748
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure maybe you can fire off an email to the engineer to find out exactly where this falls on the street as this project gets a little closer.

252
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:17,269
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's very important from a public safety standpoint in the community.

253
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:26,152
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you're familiar with our city, our city in the morning and at night turns into a cutthroat from everyone leaving and going into Boston, vice versa.

254
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,378
[SPEAKER_23]: and our streets are packed in the morning.

255
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:29,599
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm very familiar.

256
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:31,561
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm one of those people that's driving through them.

257
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:32,361
[SPEAKER_23]: You're probably right.

258
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,883
[SPEAKER_23]: So you can imagine.

259
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:37,325
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, you mentioned that this project will be phased in.

260
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:48,233
[SPEAKER_23]: Will the project 3.2 miles in the city of Medford, will we be doing a quarter mile and then filling up the area and moving on?

261
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,876
[SPEAKER_23]: Or are we going to dig 3.2 miles and then go back and fill?

262
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,138
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe if you could just explain how

263
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:58,635
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to do it in the most efficient and least impactful way.

264
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:07,380
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I mean by that is, again, once we get the engineering and we see where we're going to be, we don't have to build this from point A to point B. We can do it in phases.

265
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,683
[SPEAKER_18]: So for instance, the line goes right in front of a high school.

266
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,364
[SPEAKER_18]: We might decide it's a good idea to not do construction.

267
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,283
[SPEAKER_18]: during the school year and save that for the summer.

268
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:19,985
[SPEAKER_18]: We could save that piece to a point that's less impactful.

269
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:27,630
[SPEAKER_18]: We can likewise solicit input from the towns that, hey, we really do not want you here in the middle of the summer.

270
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,751
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd rather you go into the winter.

271
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:35,095
[SPEAKER_18]: We can take all that input and phase the project as there is a lot of work to do in different parts.

272
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:38,837
[SPEAKER_18]: For instance, one of the things we have to do is cross the Mystic River.

273
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:44,381
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a solution that we're working on for that involving a HDD, a horizontal directional drill.

274
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,045
[SPEAKER_18]: It might make sense to do that in the winter months as opposed to the peak parkland use in the summer.

275
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:59,437
[SPEAKER_18]: These are all the considerations that we'll take into account when we make our construction and traffic management plan, but I'd say we're at least a year off from that.

276
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:03,882
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it anticipated construction will take place during the day?

277
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,761
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that's the case at all.

278
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:15,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we would look at the, if it's a business area, we may want to do it from, you know, 7 or 8 at night to 6 in the morning.

279
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Something that wouldn't affect their business operations.

280
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,592
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's residential, we'll probably be moving it to daytime.

281
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:28,913
[SPEAKER_15]: because we wouldn't want to affect anybody's sleeping habits.

282
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:29,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

283
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:30,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Speak a little on the construction.

284
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:36,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Typically we work, we have an open trench of 200 to 400 feet maximum.

285
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:42,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of a revolving trench.

286
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:47,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So where someone is digging it up, the crews are behind putting the conduit in and they're right behind paving.

287
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a continuous, we don't go in,

288
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,933
[SPEAKER_06]: do a 3.2-mile trench.

289
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:57,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we work on a specific area, and we move right along.

290
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:03,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at night, for the areas, we'll plate them for the night, come back the next morning, and just continue picking up.

291
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So the impact on a certain area should be one to two days outside of the manhole installations, just on the duct tank.

292
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:20,270
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, with all this digging, I realize the trench is not that much, but the manhole may be some considerable digging, especially within neighborhoods.

293
00:22:21,348 --> 00:22:29,335
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you go into homes and surrounding areas to see if there's any possible damage done by the construction work?

294
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:36,381
[SPEAKER_23]: To what extent do you ensure the safety of area residents and their property?

295
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:45,209
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as surveying of foundations and properties, that's typically not done unless we're doing blasting, which is not anticipated here.

296
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:55,091
[SPEAKER_18]: While this is a big impact to anyone who sees this from the outside world, this is relatively straightforward utility construction.

297
00:22:55,692 --> 00:23:00,414
[SPEAKER_18]: And we employ, you know, very experienced contractors who do this every day, day in and day out.

298
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:07,457
[SPEAKER_18]: So we don't anticipate any ancillary damage or impacts to residences outside of the construction zone.

299
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:09,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, in terms of safety for the construction zone,

300
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:14,362
[SPEAKER_18]: We employ best practices, OSHA standards, we keep our sites very safe.

301
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:25,756
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as alerting residents, that's where Community Relations comes in and they have a robust program from speaking with folks like you to advertising and local media to hanging door hangers.

302
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:30,538
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have a community relations program to address all of that.

303
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,659
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll advise them when we're coming through.

304
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,760
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll understand our schedule.

305
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,661
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have it on our website, and we'll have contact numbers available to the community.

306
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:43,982
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody has concerns, we want to hear it so that we can address it.

307
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:48,143
[SPEAKER_15]: It's our intention to try to be proactive and address any concerns.

308
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:49,844
[SPEAKER_23]: So you mentioned you have a hotline.

309
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:53,105
[SPEAKER_23]: Will that be manned by someone, or is that where you just leave a phone message?

310
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:59,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now it's, I believe it's a phone message, but we do have, we follow up the following day.

311
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:10,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's typically the process that we've used at this point, but as we get more into construction, I think you'll find that this becomes much more engaging.

312
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:13,166
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll find that there'll be a conversation going on.

313
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:14,587
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

314
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:22,933
[SPEAKER_23]: And, and as many method residents are aware with the fast 14 project that took place right out here in front of city hall with the

315
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:29,219
[SPEAKER_23]: the bridge construction, the City of Medford entered into a comprehensive mitigation program.

316
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:41,585
[SPEAKER_23]: And has there been any discussion about mitigation and what the impact may be on this community and how we may be able to benefit from mitigation?

317
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:50,492
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've had some discussions with Ma'am McGlynn, not specifically, because it's pretty early in the process.

318
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:54,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Typically, once we have it engineered, we'll have a better idea.

319
00:24:54,194 --> 00:25:00,538
[SPEAKER_15]: As we start to move toward permitting, we will be seeking grants of locations.

320
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:06,542
[SPEAKER_15]: We will actually have a host agreement with the community, and we'll address all of that at that point.

321
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:09,383
[SPEAKER_15]: That will probably be sometime in the fall of this year.

322
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:11,785
[SPEAKER_23]: And will equipment be left on the street?

323
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:15,337
[SPEAKER_23]: or will equipment, will you have a place to house your equipment?

324
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:17,299
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

325
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:19,741
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that we have not developed yet.

326
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:24,885
[SPEAKER_18]: We're very early in the stage of construction plan will be developed, but not developed yet.

327
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:28,007
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something I think we'll have to address community to community.

328
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:35,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, if we're in the middle of a trenching operation on the street, we would not want to demote that every night if we can't avoid it.

329
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:41,238
[SPEAKER_18]: But if we were, say, in the middle of a town center, or if we were in a highly congested area,

330
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:44,499
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not going to leave our equipment there, clogging it up further when we're not working.

331
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:53,060
[SPEAKER_15]: We would try to find a staging area and we would arrange a leasing arrangement or something to ensure that that's addressed.

332
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:10,923
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, just if I could, if we could make part of the committee report also that we get responses back from the engineering department and also from the city administration regarding any dialogue that has taken place regarding potential mitigation with this project.

333
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,080
[SPEAKER_23]: And I appreciate the gentleman for coming tonight.

334
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

335
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and the clerk is taking those down to make those part of a ongoing resolution.

336
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:30,406
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, from the chair, there's an extensive ongoing construction project going on now in the Winthrop Street area between Mystic Valley Parkway.

337
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:33,067
[SPEAKER_14]: You may have seen it in some of your preliminary work.

338
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,569
[SPEAKER_14]: They've run into a lot of obstacles there with relation to

339
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:48,463
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also been a tremendous burden on the community and people who traverse that area, both local people and just people who make their way periodically through Metfit.

340
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:54,387
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been impactful and it's gone on a long time.

341
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:05,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Although it's going to result in a great improvement on the aggressive wastewater and runoff, nonetheless,

342
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,272
[SPEAKER_14]: the impact of the project has been hard on people.

343
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:20,941
[SPEAKER_14]: My sense is that you're going through that neck of the woods, which will perhaps be repaved and pristine once you start digging again, and that's gonna be a tremendous concern for people.

344
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you address that at all for us?

345
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:33,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll leave it in better condition than we find it, I can assure you, and if these are all new streets, we will address that, we'll pave it curb to curb if that's the case.

346
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you, thank you.

347
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,992
[SPEAKER_14]: So next is Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

348
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:38,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Vice President.

349
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:40,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

350
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming, gentlemen.

351
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:49,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Councilman Marks asked a majority of the questions, but I just had a question with regards to your public open house on May 11th.

352
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:52,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that for the administration?

353
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And what type of meeting was that?

354
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:55,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I was unaware of it.

355
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:08,098
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a series of tables set up with different aspects of the project, and we had subject matter experts that were available that evening.

356
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:25,592
[SPEAKER_15]: We had actually invited people from Medford to join any one of those open houses.

357
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:30,535
[SPEAKER_15]: And I actually spoke with a couple of Medford residents at the Winchester open house when we did hold it.

358
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:38,300
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that process was available so they could see a demonstration of the project.

359
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,301
[SPEAKER_15]: It was actually a taped video.

360
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,568
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a video.

361
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:48,110
[SPEAKER_15]: A video and a tape message actually drove the entire route.

362
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,311
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we could see what the extent of the project.

363
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:57,553
[SPEAKER_18]: We had photographs of what the trenching and manhole excavation looks like.

364
00:28:57,593 --> 00:29:02,295
[SPEAKER_18]: We had video explaining the horizontal directional drill technology.

365
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,936
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a layout of a timeline for the public process.

366
00:29:06,936 --> 00:29:10,997
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had basically people stationed at each one of those tables to speak to those matters.

367
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:12,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was invited?

368
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:21,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone who was on either the preferred route or the alternate route, anyone who lived on those routes, 300 feet on either side.

369
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:28,919
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had something in the vicinity of about 4,000 attendees that were invited.

370
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:29,499
[SPEAKER_04]: 4,000 people invited.

371
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We did not have a large turnout at the Medford event.

372
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was about 17 or 18.

373
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:44,291
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think the point was that they did attend some of our other venues.

374
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:50,095
[SPEAKER_15]: And we understood that- Notified via local newspapers.

375
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but you sent out 4,000 letters?

376
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:53,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what- Oh, wow.

377
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

378
00:29:55,439 --> 00:30:00,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe we sent the entire council an invitation via email.

379
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:01,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, via email.

380
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:02,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

381
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:08,580
[SPEAKER_15]: as well as other city officials.

382
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:15,146
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think our intent was to widely advertise this as much as possible.

383
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:17,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

384
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:20,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I'm glad you invited so many people, especially the people on the route.

385
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:26,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up on South Street, so I know a lot of my neighbors would be concerned, prior neighbors.

386
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:30,358
[SPEAKER_04]: With regards to when you start the project, will you be

387
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:39,412
[SPEAKER_04]: leafleting, you know, the sections as you do them with contact information, if people had questions or concerns or, okay.

388
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're leaving something at everybody's door.

389
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:45,056
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be working near your home in the next week.

390
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:46,257
Okay.

391
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:54,102
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll have an active website that will advise people of what the schedule is and what the most recent activities will be.

392
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:55,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

393
00:30:56,364 --> 00:31:12,452
[SPEAKER_04]: ask that that definitely take place, that residents know, you know, a week in advance of when work will be, where and when work will be scheduled, because those will be the brux of the calls we get from concerned residents, what is going on and what's being done up in front of my house right now.

394
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:17,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be good if they can have a contact information, your contact information with any questions they have.

395
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:19,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

396
00:31:20,076 --> 00:31:21,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

397
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:23,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

398
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:23,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

399
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:33,388
[SPEAKER_21]: My glasses kind of aren't strong enough to read your picture, but can you detail where the project will be starting and the main road that's going down?

400
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:34,228
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like.

401
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,812
[SPEAKER_21]: In Everett?

402
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Where you're starting, in Medford.

403
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:41,235
[SPEAKER_15]: In Medford, okay.

404
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:43,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically on Mystic Avenue.

405
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:43,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

406
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:45,839
[SPEAKER_15]: You're heading from Mystic.

407
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Mystic Avenue down to Route 16 and then.

408
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:50,873
[SPEAKER_21]: or into Medford Square?

409
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:51,474
[SPEAKER_15]: To South Street.

410
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:52,194
[SPEAKER_15]: To South Street.

411
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,115
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we go under the river.

412
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,936
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's going to go Mystic Avenue.

413
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:01,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Mystic to Main.

414
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:01,838
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

415
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:03,038
[SPEAKER_21]: To South.

416
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:04,879
[SPEAKER_21]: And then up 38.

417
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Under the river.

418
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Under the river and through the woods.

419
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:11,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Up Winthrop Street.

420
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:13,543
[SPEAKER_21]: And all the way into Winchester.

421
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and then 38 all the way to Winchester.

422
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:19,145
[SPEAKER_21]: And like the President said, that's going to be all newly paved road.

423
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:24,338
[SPEAKER_21]: and Councilor Knight won't be sleeping for a few more nights because he lives at that corner there.

424
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:38,429
[SPEAKER_18]: We're aware of all the work that's going on and if we had the flexibility to get on this quicker and to go ahead and say install while that was being opened up, whether that be next week, next month, we would.

425
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,751
[SPEAKER_18]: We are bound by the DPU process.

426
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:43,914
[SPEAKER_21]: We are not allowed.

427
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:48,157
[SPEAKER_21]: That route is a major route in the morning and the afternoon during the rush hour time.

428
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:58,070
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, even with the traffic that's there from the projects that's ongoing now, it's been a disaster for the last two years.

429
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,112
[SPEAKER_21]: And especially when they closed it on a Saturday, that's been bad.

430
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:07,653
[SPEAKER_21]: So do you have a timeline?

431
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:09,314
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have a date you're looking to start in Medford?

432
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:17,695
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about starting construction in the first quarter of 2017, assuming that we receive approvals from the FSB.

433
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:26,181
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we would have an 18 to 20-month, 24-month construction period, all of which wouldn't be in Medford.

434
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,222
[SPEAKER_15]: The 18 to 24 months would be the entire project.

435
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:32,165
[SPEAKER_15]: So there would be phases going on.

436
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:35,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, will the bridge project that's going on in Medford impact you also?

437
00:33:36,668 --> 00:33:37,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Credit bridge project?

438
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:37,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

439
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,350
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we're not on that.

440
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,743
[SPEAKER_06]: We just also looked at the construction phase on the beginning of the 24 month.

441
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:50,067
[SPEAKER_06]: The first phase is the civil work, where we'll install the duct bank and the conduits.

442
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:53,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll have to come back later on, which is still part of the construction.

443
00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:59,656
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's when we will need just access to the manholes to pull the cable and to displace it.

444
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:01,942
[SPEAKER_18]: That's actually a good point.

445
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:08,425
[SPEAKER_18]: So of those two years, it's not a two-year civil construction project with excavation and such.

446
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:13,486
[SPEAKER_18]: It is half civil excavation, half electrical wire pulling and splicing.

447
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:23,810
[SPEAKER_21]: And like I said, a good part of that does encompass the route that the buses take to the school in both ways.

448
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:26,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

449
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:28,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

450
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:28,812
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Penta.

451
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:39,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you explain what a kilovolt is as compared to what's there now?

452
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So a kilovolt is 1,000 volts.

453
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:52,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So the usage in your own house is a 120, 240 volt system.

454
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's a very low voltage compared to these systems.

455
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:57,875
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the system.

456
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,703
[SPEAKER_06]: the regional system that delivers the majority of the power into the area is at a much higher voltage, which is 115,000 volts.

457
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:14,786
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we compare that, then from that point, the electricity is transferred down to what we call street level.

458
00:35:15,307 --> 00:35:19,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes from 115,000 volts to 13,800 volts.

459
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:25,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what you see on the street at the very top of the poles if it's an overhead system.

460
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:28,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you will see the transformers on the poles.

461
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:39,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And those transformers then will reduce it even lower to the 120, 240 for your home, or 120, 208, 277, 480 for the commercial or industrial customers.

462
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:47,221
[SPEAKER_17]: So by having this upgrade, you're improving what?

463
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:57,897
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're doing is what was mentioned earlier that the ISO New England did some studies, and they noticed that there was some deficiencies in the area.

464
00:35:57,977 --> 00:36:09,826
[SPEAKER_06]: So when there's faults, when there's a fault in the system, they came out that the existing line that's there right now would overload, and it could cause additional problems.

465
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:14,630
[SPEAKER_06]: If a line is overloaded, it could trip out, and when that trips out, it causes further

466
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:21,971
[SPEAKER_06]: out problems, and they could escalate the issue and cause kind of a domino effect.

467
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:24,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So what they're trying to do is to alleviate that.

468
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:38,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you lose what we call an N minus 1 minus 1 condition, where you lose two pieces of equipment at the very high level, at the high voltage, we can still maintain the whole region running up and running without any deficiencies.

469
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:40,903
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the cost of the project?

470
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:53,341
[SPEAKER_18]: The cost that we've estimated right now, and I will stress that the way that the ISO petition process goes is in this early stage, we're in what we call the conceptual phase of the project.

471
00:36:54,561 --> 00:37:00,903
[SPEAKER_18]: And so the level of accuracy they ask for us is a plus or minus 50% budget.

472
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:04,383
[SPEAKER_18]: And we are estimating the project at $75 million.

473
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:06,524
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we put forward to the ISO.

474
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:09,413
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, that is before engineering happens.

475
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:21,041
[SPEAKER_18]: The next level from the ISO process is to go from the conceptual level to the planned level, where we go to a plus or minus 25 percent.

476
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:23,302
[SPEAKER_18]: And we expect to be doing that in the fall.

477
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:29,907
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have a better accuracy of estimate with the benefit of engineering and having done more study with it.

478
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:33,129
[SPEAKER_18]: But the estimate that is out there today is $75 million.

479
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,692
[SPEAKER_17]: So if it's $75 million and whatever the cost is going to be in the future,

480
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:41,386
[SPEAKER_17]: What portion of that $75 million is coming into the city of Medford?

481
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have that broken down yet?

482
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:44,308
[SPEAKER_18]: We do not.

483
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:56,856
[SPEAKER_15]: If the question is in regards to personal property tax, et cetera, that's something that could... I think that would be something that we would have to calculate once we know what the real numbers are.

484
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:06,703
[SPEAKER_15]: We typically file a form of list with the city, which is a list of all of the personal property that is in service in the community.

485
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:13,368
[SPEAKER_15]: And they would calculate the value of that, and that would be the basis for the property taxes.

486
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:17,031
[SPEAKER_17]: If I understand this correctly, National Grid is part of Eversource, correct?

487
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:20,894
[SPEAKER_15]: National Grid is part of the other two projects that we have.

488
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:24,356
[SPEAKER_15]: There's three projects associated with the Greater Boston Solution.

489
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:27,819
[SPEAKER_15]: They are actively involved in both of those.

490
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:29,460
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a project that runs from

491
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:39,344
[SPEAKER_15]: from the Rubin station, which is an Eversource station, to Wakefield station, which is a 345 national grid station.

492
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,346
[SPEAKER_15]: They're partnered on that particular project.

493
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:54,136
[SPEAKER_18]: But on this particular project, this is a solely Eversource project, which is formerly NSTAR, so not involved with national grid on this particular component of the overall solution.

494
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:58,099
[SPEAKER_17]: So during this past winter, the electric rates went up approximately 39%.

495
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:03,579
[SPEAKER_17]: because supposedly they can't find the energy, or the energy costs more, or whatever.

496
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,042
[SPEAKER_17]: What's this going to cost the city of Medford?

497
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:07,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Because somebody's going to have to pay for this.

498
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:11,368
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I can speak to the cost issues.

499
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:17,895
[SPEAKER_15]: The cost issues are really a pipeline issue, a capacity issue coming up from the Gulf for available gas.

500
00:39:20,222 --> 00:39:27,228
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what people need to understand is that the power generators have to buy gas on the spot market.

501
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:30,371
[SPEAKER_15]: They cannot buy secure pipeline capacity.

502
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:33,974
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're a heating customer, you do have secure pipeline capacity.

503
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:38,258
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you're a generator, you have to buy available pipeline.

504
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:42,265
[SPEAKER_15]: and this winter was very difficult for them.

505
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:48,447
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why we saw such spikes in the cost of electricity this year.

506
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:57,250
[SPEAKER_15]: I have heard, and I can't say this for sure, but I do know that we will see a significant reduction as of July 1.

507
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:07,113
[SPEAKER_15]: They're expecting that the cost of a kilowatt hour may come down to the 10 cent range.

508
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:18,874
[SPEAKER_18]: But to address the question specifically of this project and who bears the cost, it's important to note this is not strictly an Eversource project going through the five or so particular towns here.

509
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:29,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Because this is a regional grid reliability project, the cost gets regionalized not just to Eversource customers, but to all New England rate bearers.

510
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,820
[SPEAKER_17]: But method will bear a cost, right?

511
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Method rate payers will bear a cost.

512
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,101
[SPEAKER_18]: As everyone in Oman, yes.

513
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:37,861
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're already paying those costs.

514
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:44,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of your bill, there's a transmission charge, and that charge is for these types of projects to be built.

515
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:46,423
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's going to go up now.

516
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:47,403
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

517
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:51,644
[SPEAKER_06]: There will not be any change on the rate on the tariff.

518
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:54,685
[SPEAKER_17]: He just said the cost is going to go up.

519
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:56,585
[SPEAKER_18]: That specific element.

520
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:02,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't want anyone to think that this is going to be, you know, we're getting a freebie here because we're not.

521
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:09,184
[SPEAKER_17]: So is there any way that maybe you can figure out approximately what the cost can be once you get going?

522
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for Medford.

523
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:15,508
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could suggest, I don't mean to interrupt,

524
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:47,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we make that part of the ongoing resolutions, is that your office get back to me to, in the overall scope of the project, what would be the community per community expectation or the customer's expectation of the cost to the average rate payer for their electricity?

525
00:41:49,832 --> 00:41:53,235
[SPEAKER_17]: The issue that I have with that, Mr. President, is this.

526
00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:01,212
[SPEAKER_17]: You just said $6 to $9 million per mile, and we had approximately 3.2 miles, you said, in the city of Medford.

527
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:10,295
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think is that going to be fair enough to say that the entire community pays the cost, or is it just the location that it's going to serve?

528
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:13,016
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, is this going to serve the entire city?

529
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:15,017
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is a regional issue.

530
00:42:18,547 --> 00:42:28,169
[SPEAKER_15]: project, and it's intended to actually address the New England region, ISO New England's regional requirements.

531
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:32,329
[SPEAKER_15]: So this will be a charge that will be spread across the region.

532
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,250
[SPEAKER_15]: It won't be just the community of Medford or Winchester or some of them.

533
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:46,712
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be the entire rate base in the system that will bear the cost of this project, as well as the other two projects that are associated with the Greater Boston

534
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:50,013
[SPEAKER_17]: But somewhere along the line, you're going to have some kind of an estimate of what this is going to be.

535
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:50,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it will be.

536
00:42:51,054 --> 00:42:58,757
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I think it's a little preliminary for us to come up with an answer right now, but we'll be certainly happy to respond to that.

537
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:08,201
[SPEAKER_17]: And the last question, Mr. President, is you have this section from here to here that you're going to be resolving because you're trying to make it regionalized and all of that.

538
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:09,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

539
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:11,743
[SPEAKER_17]: What about the points getting to it from both ends?

540
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:14,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they all regionalized or are they going to have to be done?

541
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:16,486
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

542
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:27,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, no, that to the point that I was making earlier, this one particular eight-mile route is one of three unique solutions to this project.

543
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, there was a one from Wakefield to Woburn.

544
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:34,592
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a one from New Hampshire to Tewksbury.

545
00:43:35,352 --> 00:43:38,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's just the three unique ones for Eversource.

546
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:43,015
[SPEAKER_18]: To address all the needs that were brought up by the ISO, there's actually something I think 42

547
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:52,020
[SPEAKER_18]: various projects that could go from a very simple, small line reconductor to new transformers and substations.

548
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Throughout the entire New England region, various utilities will be doing various projects.

549
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:59,445
[SPEAKER_18]: They all come together to solve this problem.

550
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:17,552
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you know, again, using that air traffic analogy, I don't know why that works for me, but I would just say that this is to solve, you know, air traffic on the East Coast, and we are looking at specific airports and specific routes, but it affects the entire region.

551
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,828
[SPEAKER_15]: But to your question, I think we can provide you a better answer.

552
00:44:23,088 --> 00:44:23,848
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we will.

553
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:28,429
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know whether we're there yet to have that information.

554
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, whenever you do.

555
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:34,610
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was talking about the $69 million per mile, that's a cost for us to install.

556
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a cost that residents will pay.

557
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:45,032
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the cost that we'll be using to come up with the personal properties for the town.

558
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

559
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, councillor Penta.

560
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:53,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And councillor Knight.

561
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

562
00:44:55,623 --> 00:44:58,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you to the folks from Eversource for being here this evening.

563
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:02,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is a great opportunity for us to get some questions answered.

564
00:45:02,128 --> 00:45:06,952
[SPEAKER_11]: But more importantly, this is the beginning of a long relationship from the way things look.

565
00:45:07,012 --> 00:45:10,494
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, thank you very much for taking the time to be here for us this evening.

566
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:15,638
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like we had an open house in May of 2015.

567
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:17,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there's going to be a filing in the second quarter of 2015.

568
00:45:21,215 --> 00:45:21,775
[SPEAKER_11]: a public hearing.

569
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,156
[SPEAKER_11]: When do you anticipate that public hearing would occur?

570
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:29,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that you guys aren't the ones that control it or that are going to hold it, but I know that you also have experience in this.

571
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:30,418
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it will be this fall.

572
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:31,018
[SPEAKER_11]: This fall.

573
00:45:31,098 --> 00:45:40,260
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, that's a public utilities energy facility siting board decision, and they will control that process.

574
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:49,243
[SPEAKER_15]: We will certainly be available and work with them, but it's really their process, but we'll be involved all the way through.

575
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:53,676
[SPEAKER_11]: So in terms of a timeline, we're looking at a filing in the second quarter of 2015.

576
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,658
[SPEAKER_11]: In the fall of 2016, there'll be a public hearing.

577
00:45:57,098 --> 00:45:59,319
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we won't see construction start until the fall of 2017?

578
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,260
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

579
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,702
[SPEAKER_18]: In the fall of 15 for the first.

580
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:08,064
[SPEAKER_18]: In a couple months this fall, we would see potentially the first open house from DPU.

581
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:09,305
[SPEAKER_09]: The first open house in the fall.

582
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:11,843
[SPEAKER_18]: and public hearings.

583
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:12,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Public hearing.

584
00:46:13,383 --> 00:46:14,643
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys do the public house, right?

585
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:14,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

586
00:46:15,044 --> 00:46:18,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen them where they do them when they're from three to four months after the petition is filed.

587
00:46:18,905 --> 00:46:20,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Three to four months after the petition is filed.

588
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:20,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

589
00:46:21,305 --> 00:46:28,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the issue is simply that the agenda for the Energy Facilities Signing Board is pretty packed.

590
00:46:28,408 --> 00:46:30,308
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a number of projects that are pending.

591
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:34,610
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we don't know where we'll fall in that schedule.

592
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's my concern is that we have a public hearing on the issue and then

593
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:48,023
[SPEAKER_11]: six, 12, 18 months pass and then construction starts and the residents forget about the public hearing that we had and what was discussed.

594
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:15,261
[SPEAKER_18]: And also I would point out that a butters list that we use to notify everybody that's 4,000 plus invitees, that is the same list that the EP will use for their hearing.

595
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:18,842
[SPEAKER_18]: So there will be proactive reaching out to all those people.

596
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:26,004
[SPEAKER_11]: This public hearing, when it's conducted, is this a public hearing that's exclusively for Medford or is this a regional public hearing for the entire pipeline project?

597
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:29,432
[SPEAKER_15]: The public hearing, I believe, will be regional, but we don't know that yet.

598
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:32,212
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have to wait to see what the EFSB decides.

599
00:47:32,713 --> 00:47:52,497
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think what is important to note is that all of the abutters that have been notified as certified by each city and town, we provide a full list, and they tell us who, if properties have passed hands in the interim, they'll tell us if there's new residents, and they will have been addressed in that process.

600
00:47:53,357 --> 00:47:55,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'd like the committee to report reflect

601
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:59,438
[SPEAKER_11]: the council requests that the public hearing be held in the city of Medford.

602
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:00,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

603
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:04,379
[SPEAKER_14]: So that will be an amendment to the ongoing resolution.

604
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, gentlemen, thank you very much for your time.

605
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate you coming down here.

606
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:11,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I think it's important that we start this project off on the wrong foot.

607
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:17,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello alluded to the fact that I reside right there in the neighborhood where the pipeline is going through.

608
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:22,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you repair the streets in better condition that they're in now, we still might need some work.

609
00:48:22,285 --> 00:48:23,305
[SPEAKER_11]: The way that things are right now.

610
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:26,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can certainly appreciate you guys taking the time down here, and I thank you for that.

611
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:30,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is going to be the first of many discussions that we have.

612
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:32,695
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest.

613
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:34,697
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Councilor Anais.

614
00:48:34,777 --> 00:48:35,657
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Caraviello.

615
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:37,399
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

616
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,545
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to ask the same question that Councilor Pantera asked, where does the consumer fit into this project here?

617
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:47,727
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think you've answered that.

618
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:52,651
[SPEAKER_21]: My only other concern is I would hope that you'd be coordinating with the city

619
00:48:53,543 --> 00:49:04,285
[SPEAKER_21]: especially when you get down to that South Street, Main Street area, that you're not going to be working at the same time that we're working on the bridge, because the city is going to be all constructioned out for a bit, for the next four years.

620
00:49:04,485 --> 00:49:14,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we've been in touch with the city engineer and the EW director, and we'll be working with them closely to try to work out the traffic management plan.

621
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:21,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, not so much traffic management, but that South and Main Street area is going to be bogged down with

622
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,162
[SPEAKER_21]: the bridge project that's going to be happening there for the next two and a half years.

623
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:28,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

624
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

625
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:32,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Will we affect that?

626
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:40,088
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, you're going to be working, you know, like 50 yards from it, you know, at some point when you make that turn there.

627
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:40,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

628
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:43,270
[SPEAKER_15]: On main to south.

629
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,370
[SPEAKER_21]: When you turn on the south there.

630
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:45,831
[SPEAKER_21]: So, like I said.

631
00:49:45,871 --> 00:49:47,432
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll certainly work with them closely.

632
00:49:47,812 --> 00:49:49,632
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not our intention to.

633
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,733
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I know it's not your intention to do it.

634
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:56,612
[SPEAKER_21]: But I say that would be a major concern because now you'd affect the traffic going in.

635
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:59,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Bad enough where we're affecting the traffic that's in the square now.

636
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:11,576
[SPEAKER_21]: But Route 16 right now is a horrible road to ride on for the people that are going to be in.

637
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:17,917
[SPEAKER_21]: At some point when you cross over and you're going to continue up, I really feel bad for the people

638
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:22,445
[SPEAKER_21]: They've been living in that section for the last two years, construction.

639
00:50:22,505 --> 00:50:26,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they're going to have to put up another year or two of construction.

640
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:34,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, I want to stress that our construction in any one specific area is not going to be a year or two years.

641
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:39,197
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, but you're going to be back in front of the house again where they've been the last two years.

642
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:41,399
[SPEAKER_21]: They've been jackhammering and

643
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:46,654
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, their yards are ruined, their cars are ruined, their roads are ruined.

644
00:50:46,694 --> 00:50:51,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they're going to get a nice new street for about a year, and then they're going to come up and dig it up again.

645
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:58,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I guess the only thing I can say is that we will leave it in better condition than we found it.

646
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:00,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you'd have to go curb to curb.

647
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:04,000
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's a brand new street, we will go curb to curb.

648
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,761
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, can you make sure that's in the paper, that they will go curb to curb?

649
00:51:08,122 --> 00:51:09,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Duly noted, Mr. Councilor.

650
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:12,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

651
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:18,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much, and I want to thank you guys for coming here this evening for this presentation.

652
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:22,496
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward last week.

653
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:34,644
[SPEAKER_19]: I realize that it's a few years away from actually putting the shovel into the ground, but the City Council wants to make sure that the citizens know what's going on and what the timeline is.

654
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:40,988
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to thank you, Councilor Marks, and also President Dello Russo for getting them here so quickly.

655
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:51,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Within seven days, we're here with a great presentation, so look forward to the additional communication over the coming years, and we'll see where we go.

656
00:51:52,095 --> 00:52:03,918
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do agree with Councilor Knight that we should have a public hearing here in the City of Medford, even if it's on top of other ones that may be mandated throughout the region that the project is taking place in.

657
00:52:04,531 --> 00:52:12,334
[SPEAKER_19]: even if it's separate and distinct, at least for our residents, to get the opportunity to be heard on this critical matter.

658
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

659
00:52:14,956 --> 00:52:16,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to receive and place on file.

660
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:19,538
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion, we'll require some action.

661
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:20,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

662
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:25,981
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the main motion of Councilor Marks as amended by the several councilors, all those in favor?

663
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:26,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

664
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:27,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Opposed?

665
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:28,862
[SPEAKER_14]: So done.

666
00:52:29,202 --> 00:52:31,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for your presence here, all of you.

667
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:32,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President?

668
00:52:33,044 --> 00:52:33,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

669
00:52:38,418 --> 00:52:46,121
[SPEAKER_15]: We look forward to that.

670
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:47,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

671
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:48,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

672
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:50,523
[SPEAKER_19]: While we're on suspension, Councilor Camuso.

673
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:59,227
[SPEAKER_19]: I move to take paper 15-486 for the young lady in the audience from the Mystic Valley that is here on a paper.

674
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:00,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

675
00:53:00,788 --> 00:53:02,648
[SPEAKER_14]: So, paper number 1586.

676
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:05,210
[SPEAKER_14]: To the honourable President.

677
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:32,131
[SPEAKER_14]: May 13, 2015, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve of the following amendment, the revised ordinances entitled Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel.

678
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:38,204
[SPEAKER_14]: City of Medford amendment to revised ordinances, compensation plan and leave ordinances.

679
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:49,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Chapter 66 personnel, be it ordained by the city council of the city of Medford in chapter 66 entitled personnel article two entitled classification and compensation plans.

680
00:53:49,974 --> 00:54:00,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Section 66 dash 33, uh, adding the following after director of veteran services grade C a F 12 title outreach abuse

681
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:05,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Outreach Agent Substance Abuse.

682
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:14,190
[SPEAKER_14]: This ordinance is in response to City Council Resolution 15-294 and is funded in the fiscal year 16 budget.

683
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Very truly yours, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

684
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if I may.

685
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:21,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor, please do.

686
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:25,115
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may, real quick on this particular matter.

687
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor McGlynn actually gave me a call this afternoon.

688
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:39,365
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the paper that initiated here at the Medford City Council, and it's in direct correlation to the other stuff that Brooke and Penny are working on.

689
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:52,330
[SPEAKER_19]: We will be one of the first communities in the area to have a full-time Office of Substance Abuse and Treatment Opportunity slash education, I'd like to assume.

690
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,893
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a full-time position, I believe Boston, under the leadership of Mayor Walsh.

691
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:14,739
[SPEAKER_19]: has a full-time position as well, but the mayor clearly worked with the council on this, and it is coming to fruition, so I wanna move approval on this, and it's a department head position for this particular matter before us, so I'd like to move approval.

692
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:25,467
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, and I spoke with the mayor also this afternoon, and he'd like me to

693
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:42,804
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, inform you all that, uh, he's moving forward on this, uh, and, uh, at our request and that, uh, just a couple pieces of the job description of being tidied up before it's, uh, uh, being, uh, advertised.

694
00:55:43,184 --> 00:55:45,967
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're, um, uh, grateful for this measure.

695
00:55:46,587 --> 00:55:51,432
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I think, uh, the council, uh, can congratulate itself.

696
00:55:51,888 --> 00:55:54,890
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like to motion to waive the three readings on this where it's.

697
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,711
[SPEAKER_14]: With a motion to waive the three readings.

698
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:58,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Ma'am, do you wish to address us?

699
00:55:58,432 --> 00:55:59,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

700
00:56:00,813 --> 00:56:01,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

701
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:07,237
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Brooke Hoyt, 120 Brookings Street, and I'm also a city employee through the Board of Health.

702
00:56:08,117 --> 00:56:10,359
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to just give support for the position.

703
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:11,760
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a much needed position.

704
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,723
[SPEAKER_22]: Substance abuse in the city of Medford and throughout the country is an ongoing issue.

705
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:20,985
[SPEAKER_22]: So establishing this type of position will just

706
00:56:21,332 --> 00:56:24,714
[SPEAKER_22]: continue primary prevention outreach and recovery efforts.

707
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:26,375
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, it is much needed.

708
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:28,537
[SPEAKER_22]: We have the data to support it.

709
00:56:28,957 --> 00:56:31,959
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll be a position that we can continue to monitor the data.

710
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:41,886
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not seen the job description, so I'm anxious to read the job description and know that the mayor and yourselves will provide the best opportunity for our community.

711
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,168
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for your good work on this matter.

712
00:56:45,828 --> 00:56:46,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

713
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:47,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Vice President.

714
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,930
[SPEAKER_04]: President de la Rousseau.

715
00:56:50,303 --> 00:56:54,266
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor or mayor's office state when the job description will be ready?

716
00:56:56,047 --> 00:56:57,488
[SPEAKER_22]: They did not state when it would be ready.

717
00:56:57,528 --> 00:57:02,131
[SPEAKER_22]: The personnel director can speak more about the position, but I know she's away on vacation at the moment.

718
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:14,118
[SPEAKER_22]: The mayor does want to have conversations with families and other people within the community about the job description before putting it into motion.

719
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:16,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And this will be 40 hours a week?

720
00:57:18,624 --> 00:57:25,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Did he say how much this was going to be funded for?

721
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:30,010
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be between $75,000 and $79,000.

722
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:30,330
[SPEAKER_04]: CAF 12.

723
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,170
[SPEAKER_04]: How much?

724
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:31,590
[SPEAKER_19]: $75,000 and $79,000.

725
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

726
00:57:32,071 --> 00:57:35,472
[SPEAKER_19]: CAF 12, step one, and then right through step five, I believe.

727
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:36,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Department head level.

728
00:57:36,713 --> 00:57:37,473
[SPEAKER_19]: Department head level.

729
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:39,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Same as the Director of Veterans Affairs.

730
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:47,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And do we have any idea of when

731
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,380
[SPEAKER_04]: when the job will be advertised?

732
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:56,242
[SPEAKER_22]: I assume once it's approved that it would be advertised immediately.

733
00:57:56,562 --> 00:58:02,544
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I would give a couple weeks to put the description together and then it would start as soon as possible.

734
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

735
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:05,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

736
00:58:05,204 --> 00:58:06,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for coming, Brooke.

737
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:08,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

738
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,746
[SPEAKER_04]: My only concern would be waiving the readings.

739
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:12,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to have some sort of

740
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:25,772
[SPEAKER_04]: reason for the administration to come back and maybe discuss job description with us, you know, maybe discuss when it goes out for advertisement, maybe possibly find out who's applying.

741
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:28,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like the council to be involved in the process.

742
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:36,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a concern that each one of us have discussed week after week, month after month, especially, you know, going through this epidemic.

743
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:41,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So my only concern would be waiving the three readings and giving up full control.

744
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:49,444
[SPEAKER_04]: and allowing the administration to just do whatever they want.

745
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:54,648
[SPEAKER_04]: We've discussed it, whether it be school committee meetings or city council meetings or here at the floor.

746
00:58:55,388 --> 00:59:10,499
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many prongs to the problem, whether it be prevention in our schools, lack of treatment, helping families get through what they're going through, helping the police and giving them

747
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:12,428
[SPEAKER_04]: the help they need.

748
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's so many different things.

749
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:18,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to get lost on one or two of the probably 10 prongs that there are.

750
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:20,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that we have a say.

751
00:59:20,753 --> 00:59:27,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say move approval tonight, but let it come back before us so that we can hopefully.

752
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:39,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, if we could get the job description when it's complete, if we could make an amendment that we get the job description so we can review it and make our recommendations and be able to help with that.

753
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's probably the best avenue.

754
00:59:41,984 --> 00:59:56,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I will withdraw my motion, but just to be fair and full disclosure for the viewing public, this is only to put the title in the personnel ordinance.

755
00:59:57,915 --> 01:00:01,477
[SPEAKER_19]: Without us doing our job and approving this, there is no job.

756
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,980
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, the description may not even be done until

757
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:11,600
[SPEAKER_19]: after the mayor knows that there's full support of this council, but I'll withdraw the three readings and see where it goes.

758
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Mr. President?

759
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:16,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

760
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:21,807
[SPEAKER_23]: So if it's only for a description, is it safe to say that the money is already appropriated in this year's budget?

761
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,208
[SPEAKER_19]: It says it right at the last line.

762
01:00:23,748 --> 01:00:26,650
[SPEAKER_19]: The money is funded in the fiscal year 2016 budget.

763
01:00:27,071 --> 01:00:30,813
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, so once we approve it, then the money's there to fund it, so.

764
01:00:31,093 --> 01:00:32,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, according to what the mayor says.

765
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:35,656
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, so I would agree with Councilor Longo.

766
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:36,337
[SPEAKER_19]: I withdrew it.

767
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:42,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta, you were all set, Madam Vice President.

768
01:00:42,122 --> 01:00:43,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I apologize.

769
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:49,107
[SPEAKER_17]: During today, I don't know if you've read in today's globe in the city and the town of Plymouth, huge epidemic down there.

770
01:00:49,268 --> 01:00:52,630
[SPEAKER_17]: They've had over 101 people I think have passed on.

771
01:00:52,670 --> 01:01:01,398
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the governor was down there and I believe there's something that's going down there with the sheriff of that particular County and it's, it's, it's vastly spreading throughout the Commonwealth.

772
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:04,340
[SPEAKER_17]: You just made an indication that who is the personnel director?

773
01:01:07,535 --> 01:01:08,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it was Mila.

774
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:09,338
[SPEAKER_17]: No, she said she wasn't.

775
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:12,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Then I'm not aware.

776
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because when I spoke to her, she said she wasn't.

777
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:16,669
[SPEAKER_17]: So we don't know.

778
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:19,914
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we get Mr. Quirk on this as a side note?

779
01:01:19,934 --> 01:01:21,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we find out who the personnel director is?

780
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:25,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Who is the new personnel director?

781
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,348
[SPEAKER_17]: At this point, it would be Louise Miller.

782
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:30,210
[SPEAKER_17]: No, in my conversation with her, she did not get that title.

783
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,291
[SPEAKER_19]: She told me that she was too, personally.

784
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,992
[SPEAKER_19]: She told me she was the director of personnel.

785
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:35,974
[SPEAKER_17]: So can we just find out officially if she is?

786
01:01:35,994 --> 01:01:38,175
[SPEAKER_19]: And her salary was commensurate with that position.

787
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:40,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Also- Just to let you know- Pardon me?

788
01:01:41,515 --> 01:01:42,615
[SPEAKER_08]: You withdrew the three readings.

789
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:43,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

790
01:01:43,876 --> 01:01:47,998
[SPEAKER_08]: All I'm really doing from here is you're passing you to take the first reading, right?

791
01:01:48,198 --> 01:01:48,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

792
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:50,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to have to find out all this other stuff.

793
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:54,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can amend, you know, you're going to amend the first reading.

794
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:55,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you're doing?

795
01:01:56,361 --> 01:02:00,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can ask, you can ask, you can ask some other questions, but that's just, you know, that's all you're doing for Mike.

796
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:01,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I have to go.

797
01:02:01,724 --> 01:02:03,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm advertising the first reading.

798
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:08,326
[SPEAKER_17]: If we can get the information that also comes back and if it is a CAF 12, um,

799
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:14,153
[SPEAKER_17]: as we usually normally get in our budget, it puts the dollar amount next to it.

800
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:15,514
[SPEAKER_17]: So I agree with council Lungo.

801
01:02:15,974 --> 01:02:20,755
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we have never passed having an audience without knowing what the description is for.

802
01:02:20,795 --> 01:02:22,056
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just think it makes sense.

803
01:02:22,756 --> 01:02:26,997
[SPEAKER_17]: And no, no, on this one here, we have its first reading.

804
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:35,100
[SPEAKER_17]: And when it comes back to the next reading, they can put the salary, what the salary is going to be in the description, salary description.

805
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying you've got to, you've got to create your separate resolution because this is,

806
01:02:39,135 --> 01:02:40,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm advertising the first reading.

807
01:02:41,376 --> 01:02:42,117
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm doing.

808
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:43,617
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

809
01:02:43,637 --> 01:02:54,363
[SPEAKER_08]: So create just, you want a salary, you want a, you want a personal director, you just make the resolution that, uh, you know, that we request the salary and the job description for this position.

810
01:02:54,423 --> 01:03:01,287
[SPEAKER_14]: You want the personal scope of responsibilities and, uh, for the information of the council when and timeframe for that.

811
01:03:01,387 --> 01:03:04,248
[SPEAKER_17]: And also on the D paper, who was this personnel director?

812
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:04,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

813
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:07,850
[SPEAKER_14]: And secondly, on the B paper, who is the acting personnel director?

814
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:10,240
[SPEAKER_17]: approval for the first reading.

815
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:19,404
[SPEAKER_14]: On the seconded, we have Councilor knight next.

816
01:03:20,605 --> 01:03:22,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

817
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for your work.

818
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:27,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very happy today.

819
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:29,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this is very rewarding.

820
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:32,690
[SPEAKER_11]: This council came together and we all agreed on an issue.

821
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:33,671
[SPEAKER_11]: We worked together on it.

822
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:37,273
[SPEAKER_11]: We petitioned the mayor for

823
01:03:38,662 --> 01:03:41,643
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor was in agreement that there is a problem in the city.

824
01:03:41,803 --> 01:03:46,105
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor is in agreement that this problem is a crisis and the mayor acted promptly.

825
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:50,746
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the paper.

826
01:03:51,907 --> 01:03:55,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel as though this is a step in the right direction and it just shows what this council can do.

827
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:59,029
[SPEAKER_11]: We work together and we work with the administration to move towards positive results, Mr. President.

828
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:04,451
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, you know, I support this wholeheartedly and I too move for approval.

829
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:06,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good, Councilor Knight.

830
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:07,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion approved by Council,

831
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:10,730
[SPEAKER_14]: seconded by Councilor Pinter, Councilor Marks.

832
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:14,253
[SPEAKER_23]: If I could, and thank you, Brooke, for coming up on all your work on this.

833
01:04:15,754 --> 01:04:19,616
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there going to be a dedicated space within City Hall for this new position?

834
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:22,378
[SPEAKER_23]: And if so, where will it be?

835
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:31,145
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not aware of a dedicated space at this point, but... Would you say the nature of this type of position would call for an area that... Absolutely.

836
01:04:31,885 --> 01:04:35,348
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, that provides some privacy and confidentiality and so forth?

837
01:04:35,588 --> 01:04:35,908
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct.

838
01:04:35,928 --> 01:04:36,769
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

839
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:39,885
[SPEAKER_23]: If we could make that part of the paper, too, Mr. President.

840
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:43,627
[SPEAKER_23]: Just where this office will be located.

841
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:51,631
[SPEAKER_23]: I assume there will be an office, if there will be privacy and so forth, because of the nature of what's involved, Mr. President.

842
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:52,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

843
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:59,554
[SPEAKER_14]: So as an amendment to the B paper, where will the office be located within the structure of City Hall?

844
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:00,114
[SPEAKER_14]: City Hall.

845
01:05:00,975 --> 01:05:04,716
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of approval, seconded by Councilor

846
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:12,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Penta, Mr. Clerk, this requires a roll call as a matter of ordinance, no?

847
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:13,400
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

848
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,500
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

849
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:15,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

850
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,601
[SPEAKER_14]: So all those in favor?

851
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:18,261
All those opposed?

852
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:20,402
That carries.

853
01:05:20,422 --> 01:05:32,027
[SPEAKER_14]: The paper, which was amended by the paper on the final council along with the current, which requests a job description.

854
01:05:41,662 --> 01:05:45,023
[SPEAKER_14]: And I suspect a time frame for hiring.

855
01:05:45,544 --> 01:05:54,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, amended by Councilor Marks, a request for the location of the office in City Hall.

856
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,768
[SPEAKER_14]: So that motion is one more thing that the Vice President.

857
01:05:58,628 --> 01:06:09,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly, what qualifications the administration is looking for, you know, degree of education, courses that, you know, this position will be required to have taken.

858
01:06:09,743 --> 01:06:18,746
[SPEAKER_19]: just so we get an idea of... Every city job description that goes on has that.

859
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:20,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Scope of requirements.

860
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:20,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

861
01:06:20,707 --> 01:06:21,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

862
01:06:21,588 --> 01:06:22,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, Mr. President.

863
01:06:22,668 --> 01:06:23,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

864
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:28,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Based on the timing of the release of this paper,

865
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:39,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have concerns about the matter being held up because of the summer schedule of the council.

866
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:46,563
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd ask that if in fact when the paper becomes ready and available for us to vote on, then we hold a special meeting immediately to take care of it.

867
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:48,244
[SPEAKER_11]: If in fact it falls during the summer schedule.

868
01:06:48,664 --> 01:06:50,985
[SPEAKER_14]: And we make that as an amendment to the B paper as well.

869
01:06:51,786 --> 01:06:53,647
[SPEAKER_14]: A call for a special meeting to vote on it.

870
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,851
[SPEAKER_14]: The paper will be back before us in three weeks.

871
01:07:02,872 --> 01:07:03,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

872
01:07:03,212 --> 01:07:05,013
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll still be in a normal session.

873
01:07:06,345 --> 01:07:09,007
[SPEAKER_14]: If we have such a thing, Councilor Marks, you're all set.

874
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:13,171
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of approval, all those in favor, uh, Councilor Penta, I'm sorry.

875
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:14,692
[SPEAKER_17]: I passed the chief of question.

876
01:07:20,257 --> 01:07:21,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you aware of this position?

877
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:28,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I am as of today, or actually a couple of days ago, I did, did understand this would be on the agenda for this evening.

878
01:07:28,964 --> 01:07:33,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this particular individual, whoever he or she might be going to have access to

879
01:07:34,765 --> 01:07:38,967
[SPEAKER_17]: police files and vice versa, because apparently this is going to be part of it.

880
01:07:39,927 --> 01:07:50,551
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect to work very closely with whoever is in that position, as we do right now with the substance abuse agents here at City Hall, Brooke and Penta.

881
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:54,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will provide them all the access that we can legally.

882
01:07:57,914 --> 01:07:58,214
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

883
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:00,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

884
01:08:00,355 --> 01:08:02,076
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of approval, all those in favor?

885
01:08:02,216 --> 01:08:02,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

886
01:08:02,676 --> 01:08:03,236
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

887
01:08:04,088 --> 01:08:04,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

888
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:07,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Councilor Knight.

889
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:09,349
[SPEAKER_10]: While we're into suspension, can we take paper 15485?

890
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:09,349
15485.

891
01:08:10,189 --> 01:08:29,474
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, while under suspension, we're going to take all these communications from the mayor.

892
01:08:30,494 --> 01:08:33,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So on that motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor, all those opposed?

893
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:35,919
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion carries 15-485.

894
01:08:36,459 --> 01:09:00,154
[SPEAKER_14]: To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve of the following amendments to revised ordinances entitled Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel, City of Medford, Amendment to Revised Ordinances, Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter

895
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:07,604
[SPEAKER_14]: On a motion of Councilor Camuso to waive the reading, and if I could offer a synopsis.

896
01:09:07,884 --> 01:09:24,794
[SPEAKER_14]: This was regarding a compensation plan for our library employees, and it was, is requested due to the recently negotiated agreement with the Medford Library Staff Association, Local 4928, MLSA, AFT, MAF, AFL,

897
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:55,852
[SPEAKER_14]: The contract will expire on June 30, 2018, and this is a routine result of contract negotiations with this particular body, and it tidies up, I think, this year's raise and then is effective for the next three years at 2%.

898
01:09:56,876 --> 01:09:59,137
[SPEAKER_14]: equally each year for all those.

899
01:09:59,377 --> 01:10:00,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

900
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Councilor.

901
01:10:04,759 --> 01:10:08,040
[SPEAKER_17]: On this particular paper, you know what it shows?

902
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,822
[SPEAKER_17]: It shows something that seems to be pretty consistent here for the next three years.

903
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,603
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a 2% raise, 2% and 2%.

904
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:22,245
[SPEAKER_17]: And from my understanding, as it relates to contracts that are forthcoming, I believe there's a whole host of them.

905
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,606
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it bodes well for the community to know that

906
01:10:26,364 --> 01:10:31,047
[SPEAKER_17]: If employees all working for the same government, they all work for the city of Medford, they all work for the taxpayers.

907
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:34,228
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we had this conversation many years ago.

908
01:10:34,248 --> 01:10:38,331
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be nice if we could all step in line to the same amount on the percentages.

909
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:41,112
[SPEAKER_17]: The other entitlements, the other benefits is a different story.

910
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:49,977
[SPEAKER_17]: But at least it puts the house in a much better financial order to know that every employee is going to wind up getting the same amount of money by percentage because that's all the city can afford.

911
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:51,438
[SPEAKER_17]: That's number one.

912
01:10:51,950 --> 01:11:04,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, I believe there was a lady here a few weeks ago and she was talking about the Method Public Library and the possibility, because they haven't reached a certain dollar amount, that a waiver could be attainable.

913
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:16,358
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that they just received their waiver from the Commonwealth of Mass, and they are one of 75 libraries that did receive that, and we're also in the Minuteman category.

914
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:21,560
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, Mr. President, not only do I move approval,

915
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:47,627
[SPEAKER_17]: but I think it's a good step forward, and I think it's a step that we really need to sit down, and knowing the fact that we had to get a waiver to get into that category, I think we need to talk about that, and maybe, Mr. Clerk, put that as part of the resolution of approval when the budget time comes, as it relates to the waiver that the Medford Public Library has now gotten, because they've been trying to get this for a few years, and they now got it.

916
01:11:48,647 --> 01:11:51,588
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the situation that dictates the waiver

917
01:11:52,419 --> 01:11:59,485
[SPEAKER_17]: and what needs to be done so we can maybe go on the road, so to speak, without having to apply for a waiver.

918
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:02,627
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, what's the necessary ingredients to stay out of the waiver category?

919
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,309
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is the waiver for the accreditation, you're saying?

920
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:11,494
[SPEAKER_17]: No, the waiver to, there is a dollar amount that's a criteria that they have to be in.

921
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:15,137
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know if the proper word is certification or qualification.

922
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:17,880
[SPEAKER_17]: But that we did, wasn't that last week's resolution?

923
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,000
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a few weeks ago.

924
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:20,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, we did ask for that last week.

925
01:12:21,246 --> 01:12:21,766
[SPEAKER_17]: But they got it.

926
01:12:22,026 --> 01:12:24,307
[SPEAKER_17]: They got certified with the waiver.

927
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:25,848
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we asked for the dollar amount.

928
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:27,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I specifically asked for it.

929
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:28,229
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, I understand that.

930
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:29,530
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's what I want to find out.

931
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:32,251
[SPEAKER_17]: When they come in here to do the budget, let them come in to explain this.

932
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:35,433
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of people ask the question, why does the library need a waiver?

933
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:36,913
[SPEAKER_17]: What do they need the waiver for?

934
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:38,474
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the dollar amount involved?

935
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:42,336
[SPEAKER_17]: And how do we stay away from going into the waiver if something needs to be done?

936
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:44,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it because of the building that's in desperate need of help?

937
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:55,814
[SPEAKER_17]: between the roof leaking and the bathrooms that are desplicable and the books and some of the books, I don't know, but I think we need to discuss this.

938
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:59,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, you never shut my microphone off from when you took the paper out of order.

939
01:13:00,117 --> 01:13:01,038
[SPEAKER_10]: I move for approval.

940
01:13:01,058 --> 01:13:01,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

941
01:13:02,318 --> 01:13:02,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded.

942
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:04,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso.

943
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:09,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I would just like to go on record that although Councilor Pentlander's

944
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:16,921
[SPEAKER_19]: our motion, our thoughts regarding the same exact increases across the board.

945
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:18,161
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds good.

946
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:19,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's unrealistic.

947
01:13:20,242 --> 01:13:29,386
[SPEAKER_19]: We have lunch mothers, we have paraprofessionals that are making $11,000 a year, and then we also have other unions that are across the board that are making $100,000 a year.

948
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:38,810
[SPEAKER_19]: So to say that there should be parity amongst every single union, I just think that at this point, that's what the unions do, as well as

949
01:13:39,397 --> 01:13:43,120
[SPEAKER_19]: the other side of management sitting at the table, and that is called negotiations.

950
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:57,131
[SPEAKER_19]: If you just look at the past several years, too, there's been situations where the city has gotten back language from contracts that were put in in 1980s and 1970s, taken six days back, or personal days, and things of that nature.

951
01:13:57,772 --> 01:14:04,657
[SPEAKER_19]: And when that happens, usually the other side gets something back.

952
01:14:05,704 --> 01:14:22,013
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called negotiation, so although I agree with Councilor Penter, it sounds great, I just think that it's a little bit unrealistic where you can't compare the maxed out city worker and the maxed out lunch mother.

953
01:14:23,054 --> 01:14:24,635
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no equity when it comes to that.

954
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:31,539
[SPEAKER_19]: The 3% raise on $11,000 is not paying the gas bill increase each month.

955
01:14:32,095 --> 01:14:34,897
[SPEAKER_19]: But with that being said, I'd like to waive the three readings on this paper, too.

956
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:39,059
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Penta is seconded by Councilor Knight.

957
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:44,123
[SPEAKER_14]: And the motion to move the three readings by Councilor Camuso.

958
01:14:44,423 --> 01:14:44,883
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion.

959
01:14:44,903 --> 01:14:46,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta, on that motion.

960
01:14:46,944 --> 01:14:48,686
[SPEAKER_17]: I hear what Councilor Camuso was alluding to.

961
01:14:48,726 --> 01:14:54,889
[SPEAKER_17]: But you just mentioned somebody, a group, that hasn't received a raise in, I think, eight years, if not more.

962
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,190
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the lunch mothers.

963
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:56,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

964
01:14:56,851 --> 01:14:57,151
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

965
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:58,572
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't received anything.

966
01:14:58,692 --> 01:15:01,894
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like the forgotten school and the whole school department budget.

967
01:15:03,052 --> 01:15:10,273
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you talk about percentages, whether it's 1%, 2%, or 3%, my idea was just looking at it from the point of view, what would the dollar cost be?

968
01:15:10,313 --> 01:15:14,654
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of these contracts go from zero to six months, and six months to 12 months.

969
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:16,894
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a barometer.

970
01:15:16,914 --> 01:15:17,755
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a starting point.

971
01:15:18,115 --> 01:15:24,696
[SPEAKER_17]: For those that don't remember, many years ago, I think John Golony, when he was the city manager, had indicated that that would probably be a pretty good way to start.

972
01:15:24,716 --> 01:15:29,236
[SPEAKER_17]: So you'd have an idea where your money would be going on an annual basis rather than every six months.

973
01:15:29,797 --> 01:15:32,137
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we're going to get into that, I would hope,

974
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:48,239
[SPEAKER_17]: The city administration this year recognizes loudly the lunch mothers in the method of public school system who have dedicated themselves for year in and year out for the measly, um, dollars that they make per hour for which they love it because they're around the kids, but they've been the forgotten souls.

975
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:54,102
[SPEAKER_17]: And it becomes very tough as council along alluded to, and we've just got a $2 million increase this past year.

976
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,932
[SPEAKER_17]: to hire seven new individuals making an excessive $90,000 a year.

977
01:15:58,892 --> 01:15:59,533
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not right.

978
01:15:59,713 --> 01:16:05,336
[SPEAKER_17]: So you need to take care of the people that are there that have paid their dues year in and year out, instead of hiring people at $90,000.

979
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:07,797
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't even know if we can sustain them this year in the budget.

980
01:16:09,362 --> 01:16:12,084
[SPEAKER_17]: The politics will certainly go around this budget.

981
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:17,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Jufri, Mrs. Diciara, Mrs. Szymanski, Mrs. Cermia.

982
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:18,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Gargold.

983
01:16:18,148 --> 01:16:19,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Basinati.

984
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:21,910
[SPEAKER_14]: All my lunch mothers, I loved every one of them.

985
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:24,612
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motions for approval, Councilor Camuso.

986
01:16:24,692 --> 01:16:29,875
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to follow up with that, I think Councilor Penta just proved the point that I was trying to make.

987
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:37,140
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have a bargaining unit that hasn't got raises in eight years, like the lunch mothers, then the, uh,

988
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:45,169
[SPEAKER_19]: raises should be commensurate with the length of time that surpassed since the last raise.

989
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:51,892
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to thank the councilor because I think we agree that my way is better on this particular matter.

990
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:52,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

991
01:16:52,632 --> 01:16:53,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, we're all set.

992
01:16:53,992 --> 01:16:54,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Move for approval, Mr. Mayor.

993
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:55,693
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion.

994
01:16:56,173 --> 01:16:57,413
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

995
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:57,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

996
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,334
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

997
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:00,995
[SPEAKER_14]: And we waive the three readings.

998
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:07,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So the matter is approved.

999
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:15,231
[SPEAKER_14]: 15483, communication from the Mayor to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

1000
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:29,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve of the following amendment to revised ordinances entitled, Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances, Chapter 66, Personnel.

1001
01:17:29,723 --> 01:17:36,009
[SPEAKER_14]: City of Medford amendment to revised ordinances, Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinances.

1002
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:43,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Chapter 66, personnel be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford in Chapter 66, entitled Personnel.

1003
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:54,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Article 2, entitled Classification and Compensation Plans, Section 66.40, entitled Public Safety Personnel, is hereby amended by adding the following.

1004
01:17:54,655 --> 01:17:59,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Grade PS1A, title Student Officer, Step 1, $40,000 effective upon passage.

1005
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:08,202
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose of this ordinance change is to create a new classification for candidates attending the police academy.

1006
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:18,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Upon graduation of approved police academies, the student officer will have successfully completed the prescribed course of study for basic police training.

1007
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:26,932
[SPEAKER_14]: and to exercise police powers as mandated by Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 41, Section 96B.

1008
01:18:27,873 --> 01:18:31,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Very truly yours, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

1009
01:18:31,634 --> 01:18:35,915
[SPEAKER_14]: And with us tonight is the Chief to address this.

1010
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:41,097
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a motion for approval with the waiver of three readings for Councilor Camuso.

1011
01:18:41,737 --> 01:18:42,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Chief.

1012
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:47,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Leo Sacco, police chief.

1013
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:50,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford.

1014
01:18:51,062 --> 01:18:55,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you for hearing this this evening, and hopefully we have your support.

1015
01:18:55,244 --> 01:19:09,388
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something the state had made an amendment to the law back in around 1995, so it's about 20 years ago, where they mandated, in addition to a number of things, primarily,

1016
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:17,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Before an officer could exercise police powers on the street, they had to attend and successfully complete a police academy first.

1017
01:19:19,265 --> 01:19:28,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, it was a thing where they could put officers to work and then wait for an academy to open up and then schedule them for an academy at that point.

1018
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:35,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So when that change was made, the state also recommended that communities adopt a student officer category.

1019
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:40,632
[SPEAKER_05]: because they really do not have police powers until they successfully complete the academy.

1020
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:48,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, the academy, basic recruit academy, is somewhere in excess of 800 hours of curriculum.

1021
01:19:49,194 --> 01:19:54,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So it only makes sense that they be appointed as a student officer first.

1022
01:19:55,136 --> 01:20:01,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we appoint them as police officers or patrolmen, as they are called in the ordinance.

1023
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:04,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were appointed as police officers.

1024
01:20:06,206 --> 01:20:13,554
[SPEAKER_05]: the day that they're sworn in, that their police powers do not begin until they successfully complete the academy.

1025
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:21,463
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a problem that hasn't presented itself as a problem for us, but it could potentially be a problem with someone's attitude.

1026
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:29,004
[SPEAKER_05]: actually go out and affect an arrest because they felt as though they were sworn in as a police officer.

1027
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,345
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the category that they're sworn in as.

1028
01:20:31,925 --> 01:20:35,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's safer for us to have them sworn in as student officers.

1029
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:40,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And during that six month period that they're in the academy, they are student officers.

1030
01:20:40,311 --> 01:20:46,134
[SPEAKER_05]: When they complete and graduate, they'd be the badge pinning in their full uniform here at City Hall.

1031
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:53,839
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be an actual swearing in ceremony at that point as police officers once they successfully complete the academy.

1032
01:20:57,297 --> 01:20:57,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Chief.

1033
01:20:59,258 --> 01:20:59,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1034
01:21:00,518 --> 01:21:03,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief, what's the step one patrolman receive at this point in time?

1035
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:04,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, it's significantly higher.

1036
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:05,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It's between $56,000 and $57,000.

1037
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,321
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a 2% pay raise on June 30th.

1038
01:21:07,341 --> 01:21:13,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe it's $57,000 and change as of June 30th this year is the step one for patrol officer.

1039
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:34,331
[SPEAKER_11]: And presently, the individuals that have been selected as officers but have not completed the academy would be compensated at a rate based upon the $56,000?

1040
01:21:34,631 --> 01:21:38,934
[SPEAKER_05]: If they are sworn in as police officers, yes.

1041
01:21:40,335 --> 01:21:42,977
[SPEAKER_11]: But they can't be seen as a police officer until?

1042
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:45,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Until they graduate the academy successfully.

1043
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:51,243
[SPEAKER_11]: So at this point in time, there are no student officers and an individual that was going through the academy wouldn't be compensated at all?

1044
01:21:52,344 --> 01:21:53,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Or would be compensated at a rate of $56,000?

1045
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:54,863
[SPEAKER_11]: at the $56,000.

1046
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,965
[SPEAKER_05]: They would be compensated at the higher rate right now.

1047
01:21:58,046 --> 01:21:58,846
[SPEAKER_05]: While they're in the academy.

1048
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:07,134
[SPEAKER_05]: While they're in the academy, but if the ordinance were to pass, the ordinance change, the title would be student officer and it would be significantly lower.

1049
01:22:07,814 --> 01:22:11,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are considered employees of the city of Medford while they are in the academy?

1050
01:22:11,778 --> 01:22:15,521
[SPEAKER_05]: They are, but they are not covered by civil service.

1051
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:18,144
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not covered by the unions.

1052
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,531
[SPEAKER_05]: until they successfully complete.

1053
01:22:20,951 --> 01:22:22,451
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not earn sick time.

1054
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,612
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not earn injury.

1055
01:22:25,072 --> 01:22:30,494
[SPEAKER_05]: In the line of duty, they'd have to be on worker's comp if they were injured while attending the academy.

1056
01:22:31,174 --> 01:22:32,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are a different category.

1057
01:22:32,675 --> 01:22:35,496
[SPEAKER_05]: If they wouldn't be considered a police officer, they'd fall under the civilian status?

1058
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:36,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1059
01:22:39,077 --> 01:22:40,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I move for approval.

1060
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:42,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd ask that the three readings be waived.

1061
01:22:42,898 --> 01:22:43,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1062
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:46,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Diller.

1063
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:46,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Vice President.

1064
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:49,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you answered one of my questions.

1065
01:22:49,266 --> 01:22:57,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So currently, or in the past, those attending the police academy have been paid, but they've been paid at this rate.

1066
01:22:58,931 --> 01:22:59,411
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1067
01:23:00,912 --> 01:23:05,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And you mentioned something about in 1995, there was an amendment by the state at that time.

1068
01:23:05,894 --> 01:23:07,975
[SPEAKER_04]: It was when we should have accepted this.

1069
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:11,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know there was some discussion at the time.

1070
01:23:11,437 --> 01:23:16,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And almost any time there's something going on, there's always another issue that takes your eye off of the prize.

1071
01:23:18,836 --> 01:23:21,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sidetracked at the earlier date.

1072
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:24,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't seem to be that important at that point in time.

1073
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so do we have anybody in the academy currently?

1074
01:23:28,162 --> 01:23:40,049
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we do not, but we are in the process of screening candidates to place on the reserve list, and it is hoped that before the end of the year, we're supposed to be screening seven candidates for the reserve list.

1075
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:46,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping that with the new fiscal budget in July, that we'd be able to maybe appoint four of those as

1076
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:51,169
[SPEAKER_05]: permanent offices, but starting out as a student officer for an academy.

1077
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:54,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many retirees do we have this year, do you know?

1078
01:23:56,232 --> 01:23:56,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Four.

1079
01:24:02,556 --> 01:24:03,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that was off topic.

1080
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:06,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I just figured that was a question that I wanted to get answered.

1081
01:24:07,138 --> 01:24:12,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that this is something that probably should have been done a while ago.

1082
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:15,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's definitely time to do it.

1083
01:24:15,534 --> 01:24:21,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a separate category for those that are in the academy is probably necessary.

1084
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:23,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have my approval.

1085
01:24:23,677 --> 01:24:25,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1086
01:24:25,338 --> 01:24:25,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

1087
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Chief, you said this came out in 1995.

1088
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,080
[SPEAKER_17]: That's almost 20 years ago.

1089
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was a lot of change.

1090
01:24:32,481 --> 01:24:40,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time it was a recommended practice and many communities over the course of the past 20 years did change their ordinance to reflect that.

1091
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we were just,

1092
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:45,584
[SPEAKER_05]: a little later than others in getting this to the table.

1093
01:24:46,825 --> 01:24:53,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, this title of student officer, since we didn't have this before, what were these trainees called?

1094
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:54,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Policemen.

1095
01:24:55,531 --> 01:24:56,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrolmen, actually.

1096
01:24:56,631 --> 01:24:57,772
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the title, patrolmen.

1097
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:04,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to call them patrol officers, but the title in the city charter says patrolmen.

1098
01:25:05,237 --> 01:25:06,718
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're going to be going from the $56,000 or $57,000 range down to $40,000.

1099
01:25:06,758 --> 01:25:07,839
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the recommended figure.

1100
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:34,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And the benefit for that would be, depending on where we are in the fiscal year and where our budget is during the fiscal year, it may mean that we could appoint maybe one or two additional because of the lower starting rate, which would allow us to budget appropriately at graduation time for bringing them up to step one.

1101
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:37,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Then let me ask you the next question.

1102
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:39,040
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you can answer this.

1103
01:25:40,278 --> 01:25:41,699
[SPEAKER_17]: You're calling it student officer.

1104
01:25:42,059 --> 01:25:45,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this going to have the same implication for the fire department?

1105
01:25:45,802 --> 01:25:46,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

1106
01:25:46,362 --> 01:25:50,085
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not covered under the same regulation.

1107
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,766
[SPEAKER_05]: But do they have a law similar to this?

1108
01:25:52,627 --> 01:25:54,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to speak for the fire chief, and I could be totally wrong.

1109
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:57,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm probably going down the wrong road on this.

1110
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:05,255
[SPEAKER_05]: But my understanding is that the fire department city could hire a firefighter and wait for an academy to open.

1111
01:26:06,136 --> 01:26:07,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe they end up

1112
01:26:08,133 --> 01:26:14,235
[SPEAKER_05]: probably dispatching or working in the firehouse with some training at the initial step.

1113
01:26:14,735 --> 01:26:18,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be totally wrong on that, but I believe the law is somewhat different for firefighters.

1114
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:28,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Police officers are not allowed to exert or exercise any police authority until they successfully complete the academy.

1115
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:30,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we swear them in as patrolmen.

1116
01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:34,180
[SPEAKER_05]: God forbid we could have a problem, someone stops a motor vehicle,

1117
01:26:35,077 --> 01:26:36,717
[SPEAKER_05]: and tries to affect an arrest.

1118
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:39,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really don't have that power.

1119
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:41,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're swearing them in as police officers.

1120
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:44,459
[SPEAKER_17]: So in essence, they're only trainees, correct?

1121
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:45,820
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, student officer.

1122
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,341
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we're saying the language, so it'd be consistent with the statute, Chapter 49.

1123
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:53,722
[SPEAKER_17]: But an officer doesn't give the same implication as a trainee.

1124
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:54,902
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference.

1125
01:26:55,222 --> 01:27:01,384
[SPEAKER_05]: No, once they're sworn in as a police officer upon graduation from the academy, they have full police powers.

1126
01:27:04,003 --> 01:27:08,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So what's the period of time from the time somebody, you bring them on and they graduate the academy?

1127
01:27:08,984 --> 01:27:09,584
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the time period?

1128
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:11,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It's approximately six months.

1129
01:27:11,725 --> 01:27:13,665
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what these people are, student officers?

1130
01:27:13,825 --> 01:27:14,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Student officers.

1131
01:27:14,845 --> 01:27:17,746
[SPEAKER_17]: So why don't they call them student trainees, student police trainees?

1132
01:27:18,046 --> 01:27:18,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean.

1133
01:27:18,326 --> 01:27:19,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, officer.

1134
01:27:19,126 --> 01:27:22,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the term officer, they're student officers, not police officers.

1135
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:24,967
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens upon graduation.

1136
01:27:25,668 --> 01:27:27,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but couldn't a student officer mean anything

1137
01:27:28,337 --> 01:27:31,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Student officer, we're going with the language that's in the statute, 4196B.

1138
01:27:31,258 --> 01:27:32,358
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the statute?

1139
01:27:32,598 --> 01:27:34,158
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the general law statute?

1140
01:27:34,598 --> 01:27:38,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Chapter 41, section 96B refers to them as student officers.

1141
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:39,319
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1142
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:41,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

1143
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:42,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1144
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:43,980
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1145
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:51,641
[SPEAKER_23]: Chief, you could potentially have an academy-trained officer on the reserve list, correct?

1146
01:27:52,201 --> 01:27:52,401
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1147
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:57,102
[SPEAKER_23]: And if, I know you said in the past you would not call upon them for any

1148
01:27:57,724 --> 01:28:01,947
[SPEAKER_23]: duties, but if you, I guess under the general laws, you're allowed to.

1149
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:08,873
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'd have to provide them some degree of training locally before we could do that.

1150
01:28:09,533 --> 01:28:10,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe me, it's not my goal.

1151
01:28:11,235 --> 01:28:12,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't been my goal.

1152
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,518
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're on a reserve list, we're not going to work them.

1153
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:34,975
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have the opportunity to have an academy-trained person on the list that gets screened for the police department, I would be pleading with the mayor to appoint the person as a police officer, not place them on the reserve list, because we get the automatic benefit of being able to put them right to work.

1154
01:28:36,095 --> 01:28:39,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe an eight-week field training program, and they'd be able to go right to work.

1155
01:28:40,577 --> 01:28:46,058
[SPEAKER_23]: So let's just say you had a call upon someone that was a trained past the academy.

1156
01:28:46,591 --> 01:28:52,654
[SPEAKER_23]: They had some training, and they were on the reserve list, and you had to call upon them for whatever emergency circumstance.

1157
01:28:53,915 --> 01:29:01,318
[SPEAKER_23]: Would they get the starting salary of the $40,000, or would they get a police officer's starting salary?

1158
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be calling upon them.

1159
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:08,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say you did, Chief.

1160
01:29:08,141 --> 01:29:13,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there isn't a category for payment for anyone that's on the reserve list right now.

1161
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,901
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, and that's my question.

1162
01:29:14,921 --> 01:29:17,523
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not police officers until they're appointed as such.

1163
01:29:18,003 --> 01:29:20,024
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're appointed to the reserve list.

1164
01:29:20,045 --> 01:29:22,506
[SPEAKER_23]: But the law allows you to use them, Chief.

1165
01:29:22,586 --> 01:29:26,409
[SPEAKER_23]: My understanding is if they're on the list, you could use them.

1166
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I could use them if I put them through a training program.

1167
01:29:30,872 --> 01:29:40,939
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have an academy-trained individual that's already passed the 800-hour curriculum and is sitting on the reserve list, I would just repeat what I just said.

1168
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:45,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be pleading for him to fill an open void we have in the department right now.

1169
01:29:45,178 --> 01:29:47,559
[SPEAKER_23]: So you don't know what salary they would get if you did use them?

1170
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the chief answered that, that it's not going to be.

1171
01:29:52,640 --> 01:30:01,323
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, if I, if I had to use them, I just thinking of this chief, this chief, you know, you've been around for a while, chief, and you may not be the chief in 10 years from now.

1172
01:30:01,343 --> 01:30:03,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just the worst situation.

1173
01:30:03,343 --> 01:30:09,285
[SPEAKER_05]: If we had a natural disaster or something, we had to put people to work as a,

1174
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:18,440
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, watching for, you know, down wires, helping, you know, people evacuate a building, get them, get them onto a bus.

1175
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:25,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, if we had a call upon them to bring them in for something like that, they'd probably be getting the starting rate of a police officer.

1176
01:30:26,146 --> 01:30:26,306
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1177
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:28,528
[SPEAKER_23]: So, so they wouldn't fall into the student office.

1178
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,270
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't, they wouldn't, unless they're attending the Academy.

1179
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:35,914
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm specifically speaking about Academy trained.

1180
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they're already, if they're already Academy trained,

1181
01:30:39,305 --> 01:30:56,050
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the goal would be to appoint them as police officers, not on the reserve list, but police officers, and put them through the field training program, which lasts for approximately eight weeks, maybe sometimes 10 weeks, depending on how quickly they grasp what goes on in the city.

1182
01:30:56,810 --> 01:31:01,091
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we had that benefit, you know, in a couple of cases, we've had that.

1183
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:06,653
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've had academy-trained people appear on our list, and that's a benefit to the city.

1184
01:31:11,115 --> 01:31:12,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1185
01:31:12,236 --> 01:31:12,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1186
01:31:14,277 --> 01:31:22,261
[SPEAKER_21]: Chief, with all the construction projects going around, would these gentlemen be, these offices be available for details or?

1187
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:26,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Not based on the ordinance change that's here tonight, no.

1188
01:31:26,623 --> 01:31:30,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reserve offices, we would not be utilizing them for details.

1189
01:31:31,025 --> 01:31:31,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not.

1190
01:31:33,146 --> 01:31:37,608
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, we've talked about miles of construction going on in the city.

1191
01:31:38,009 --> 01:31:40,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Where are we going to get all the offices to cover all these details?

1192
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:47,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if we're able to hire more people, we'll be able to cover everything.

1193
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:52,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have good working agreements with the surrounding communities, state police.

1194
01:31:53,115 --> 01:31:54,555
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll try to fill as many as we can.

1195
01:31:54,836 --> 01:31:55,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We can never guarantee.

1196
01:31:55,816 --> 01:32:02,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we've been very fortunate with the number of details that have been out there in the office's response to crimes in progress.

1197
01:32:02,779 --> 01:32:06,481
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really been a benefit to us with the work that's been going on.

1198
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:12,044
[SPEAKER_21]: I see the officers every day, but, you know, they say now you're going to have another three-mile project.

1199
01:32:12,317 --> 01:32:14,618
[SPEAKER_21]: You can have the British project going on at the same time.

1200
01:32:14,638 --> 01:32:16,740
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to cut yourself thin?

1201
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:22,103
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm sure these other cities must be thin on opposites too.

1202
01:32:22,964 --> 01:32:25,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Every community around us are calling every day.

1203
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:30,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone's exhausting their list pretty early in the day for detail work that's out there.

1204
01:32:30,168 --> 01:32:33,790
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far we've been able to manage pretty well.

1205
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:38,073
[SPEAKER_05]: There've been some details that have gone uncovered, but it's done on a priority list.

1206
01:32:38,457 --> 01:32:42,878
[SPEAKER_05]: what's a low priority, what's a higher priority, and the higher priority details are filled first.

1207
01:32:42,898 --> 01:32:44,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a lot of work going on.

1208
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:46,879
[SPEAKER_05]: There's work on Mystic Avenue that's going on now.

1209
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:57,842
[SPEAKER_05]: The ramps have been done on Route 16, and Route 16's been resurfaced on the overnight, so it's fluctuated daytime work and nighttime work, so that's been a benefit there.

1210
01:33:01,018 --> 01:33:01,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1211
01:33:01,298 --> 01:33:11,708
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of approval by council and night with the, uh, request to waive three readings, all those in favor of those pose carries.

1212
01:33:12,028 --> 01:33:12,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

1213
01:33:12,889 --> 01:33:13,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, chief.

1214
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:14,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1215
01:33:18,514 --> 01:33:20,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we're going to do that right now.

1216
01:33:21,136 --> 01:33:25,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, 15 four 84 dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend

1217
01:33:27,213 --> 01:33:53,345
[SPEAKER_14]: that your honorable body approve of the following amendments to revised ordinances entitled compensation plan and leave ordinances chapter 66 personnel city of medford amendment to revised ordinances compensation plan and leave ordinances chapter 66 personnel be it ordained by the city council of the city of medford in chapter 66 entitled personnel article 2 entitled classification and compensation plans sections 66 and

1218
01:33:55,859 --> 01:34:02,003
[SPEAKER_14]: .32 miscellaneous personnel section be amended to add the following lines.

1219
01:34:02,844 --> 01:34:05,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Title traffic supervisors.

1220
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:13,331
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is over consecutive years at June 30th, 2016, 17 and 18 2% increase to the monthly payment, bringing it up to 916.44.

1221
01:34:24,175 --> 01:34:24,435
[SPEAKER_14]: 934-77, 953-46.

1222
01:34:24,475 --> 01:34:40,039
[SPEAKER_14]: This amendment is requested due to the recently negotiated agreement with the Medford School Traffic Patrol Supervisors Union, Local 1599 AFSCME.

1223
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:43,320
[SPEAKER_14]: The contract will expire on June 30, 2018.

1224
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello?

1225
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1226
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:58,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

1227
01:35:01,843 --> 01:35:03,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, if you would explain this to us, please.

1228
01:35:04,785 --> 01:35:09,288
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, the traffic supervisors recently negotiated their contract with the city.

1229
01:35:10,649 --> 01:35:16,834
[SPEAKER_05]: They're entitled to a 2% pay increase on the last day of each of the fiscal years.

1230
01:35:18,275 --> 01:35:21,458
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, we have 25 posts that are staffed every day.

1231
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:23,199
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 20 or 21

1232
01:35:25,377 --> 01:35:27,238
[SPEAKER_05]: full-time traffic supervisors.

1233
01:35:27,678 --> 01:35:48,489
[SPEAKER_05]: We have four that have been pretty much permanent reserves who soon will be moved up to permanent to fill the vacancies, but they have been working posts on a consistent, steady basis pretty much since the start of the school year, and then some of them began almost full-time after the December vacation.

1234
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:52,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this council has supported them

1235
01:35:53,909 --> 01:35:54,950
[SPEAKER_05]: forever in the past.

1236
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:56,710
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a good group.

1237
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:58,371
[SPEAKER_05]: They work hard.

1238
01:35:58,691 --> 01:35:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Very little problem.

1239
01:35:59,992 --> 01:36:02,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you right now, the parents and the children love them.

1240
01:36:03,434 --> 01:36:05,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And they perform a great service for the city.

1241
01:36:06,615 --> 01:36:06,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1242
01:36:06,976 --> 01:36:07,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1243
01:36:08,176 --> 01:36:09,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1244
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:15,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief, could you elaborate a little bit on the training programs that a traffic supervisor has to go through before they're appointed?

1245
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it starts out with the application process.

1246
01:36:18,401 --> 01:36:21,203
[SPEAKER_05]: They fill out an application for the position here at City Hall.

1247
01:36:21,223 --> 01:36:21,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's room 204.

1248
01:36:24,835 --> 01:36:29,077
[SPEAKER_05]: The application is then forwarded to the police station to my attention.

1249
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:32,359
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a form.

1250
01:36:33,059 --> 01:36:54,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we know that we have to appoint some people, we send out a letter to each of them asking if they're still interested in applying for the position, and if so, we have a waiver of rights so that they'll sign off so that we can actually do a query check on them, do a thorough background check on them, check with employers, check with neighbors, and then beyond that,

1251
01:36:54,888 --> 01:37:02,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they respond, those that successfully pass that portion of it, the names are passed off to our traffic unit.

1252
01:37:03,092 --> 01:37:05,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Sergeant Carroll calls them in for an interview.

1253
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:08,735
[SPEAKER_05]: He does that in conjunction with Officer Brooks.

1254
01:37:09,635 --> 01:37:14,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And those that pass the interview level, their names get sent back up to me.

1255
01:37:14,858 --> 01:37:23,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I send a letter over to the mayor requesting that they be appointed as reserve part-time traffic supervisors to fill vacancies that occur.

1256
01:37:24,373 --> 01:37:27,736
[SPEAKER_05]: on a day-to-day, monthly, or for the year basis.

1257
01:37:28,596 --> 01:37:42,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And once they serve well in that capacity, and if a permanent vacancy becomes available, then again, I'll send the letter to the mayor requesting the most senior reserve be appointed to that vacancy.

1258
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:52,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the good things in this contract that was negotiated, and actually was brought forward by the traffic supervisors themselves, which is a benefit to the city,

1259
01:37:53,303 --> 01:38:02,611
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone is appointed as a permanent traffic supervisor for that first six month period, if they do not perform properly or do not perform well, they can be removed.

1260
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:04,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And that came from the body.

1261
01:38:06,734 --> 01:38:10,357
[SPEAKER_11]: So once they get appointed, is there any training in terms of best practices?

1262
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:11,698
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the safest?

1263
01:38:11,858 --> 01:38:14,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten kids on the corner before you cross?

1264
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:16,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of his traffic unit take them out.

1265
01:38:16,581 --> 01:38:21,922
[SPEAKER_05]: give them some actual hands-on training, work them with a senior traffic supervisor.

1266
01:38:22,362 --> 01:38:26,003
[SPEAKER_05]: The president of the Traffic Supervisors Union works with them as well.

1267
01:38:26,763 --> 01:38:28,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some training.

1268
01:38:28,184 --> 01:38:35,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a great deal, but it depends on their level when they're monitored out there on the street, how well they're doing.

1269
01:38:35,646 --> 01:38:41,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it looks like someone needs more assistance, that's provided to them so that they can feel comfortable about it.

1270
01:38:42,498 --> 01:38:53,106
[SPEAKER_11]: And lastly, Chief, have there been any incidents of any accidents, any type of traffic supervisor being hit by a vehicle, or a child being hit by a vehicle, or a traffic supervisor?

1271
01:38:53,126 --> 01:38:53,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Not recently.

1272
01:38:53,906 --> 01:38:55,528
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of close calls.

1273
01:38:56,308 --> 01:39:03,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I think sometimes what they face the most of is some abuse by the motorists.

1274
01:39:03,373 --> 01:39:07,296
[SPEAKER_05]: People going by and giving them a lot of grief, but no one wants to be stopped.

1275
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:14,283
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're the ones that stand out in front, and they make sure the cars are stopped before they allow the children to cross.

1276
01:39:17,344 --> 01:39:21,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So the actual line of reporting is straight up the ladder, that's Sergeant Carroll?

1277
01:39:21,546 --> 01:39:22,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, that's correct.

1278
01:39:22,306 --> 01:39:24,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They're considered part of the traffic unit.

1279
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:26,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, excellent.

1280
01:39:26,408 --> 01:39:27,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

1281
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:29,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approved by Councilor Knight.

1282
01:39:29,209 --> 01:39:29,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1283
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:31,630
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks, Chief.

1284
01:39:32,471 --> 01:39:34,732
[SPEAKER_23]: What are the current numbers in the reserves right now?

1285
01:39:35,995 --> 01:39:38,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have four that are actually working full-time posts.

1286
01:39:38,977 --> 01:39:44,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're reserves, but they're not available for other assignments because they're filling right now open assignments.

1287
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:47,402
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one long-term.

1288
01:39:48,162 --> 01:39:52,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And they hopefully shortly will be appointed permanent in that post.

1289
01:39:53,065 --> 01:40:02,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one traffic supervisor, reserve traffic supervisor right now that bounces around to the openings, the day-to-day openings.

1290
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:04,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Other times, and the majority of

1291
01:40:05,107 --> 01:40:09,109
[SPEAKER_05]: If we go beyond that one, it's all police officers filling them during those time frames.

1292
01:40:10,049 --> 01:40:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have right now a list of about eight people that are being screened, and they're all recent applicants, so that's good.

1293
01:40:17,632 --> 01:40:27,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Many times in the past, we were screening applicants that had applied maybe a year and a half prior, and they already found other jobs, so we're kind of spinning our wheels.

1294
01:40:27,317 --> 01:40:34,940
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, we're pretty much up to date with the most recent applicants, so hopefully they'll screen out well and they'll be appointed.

1295
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1296
01:40:36,621 --> 01:40:43,225
[SPEAKER_23]: And we've had this discussion before and just leading to council and Knight's point about any incidences that happen.

1297
01:40:43,765 --> 01:40:52,671
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've talked to a number of the traffic crossing guides and a road rage is throughout the community and they're our first line of defense.

1298
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:57,294
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've, I've witnessed it when cars actually will not stop for them.

1299
01:40:57,594 --> 01:40:58,314
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

1300
01:40:58,334 --> 01:41:02,157
[SPEAKER_23]: And I mentioned to you chief that I know most people carry cells now,

1301
01:41:02,783 --> 01:41:18,729
[SPEAKER_23]: But it would be great for them to have a direct line of communication via the walkie-talkie, like the police have on a dialed station, that they can report something immediately, report a license plate, or something happened, go off a bit, a child gets struck.

1302
01:41:18,749 --> 01:41:22,671
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, that may be the best and quickest line of communication.

1303
01:41:23,131 --> 01:41:27,773
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't understand, you know, why we can't arm these traffic

1304
01:41:28,435 --> 01:41:35,139
[SPEAKER_23]: Talk about having another set of eyes, like you mentioned, about details, having police on the street and God forbid something happens, they're right there.

1305
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:42,502
[SPEAKER_23]: Why not arm another 15 or 16 people with a walkie talkie that's directly right to the station that can report things?

1306
01:41:43,123 --> 01:41:53,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're looking at that right now and actually the radios that were replaced probably close to two years ago now, we still have those radios.

1307
01:41:54,603 --> 01:41:55,364
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been tested.

1308
01:41:55,604 --> 01:41:56,384
[SPEAKER_05]: They still work.

1309
01:41:56,745 --> 01:42:08,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have to modify the channels, the number of channels that are on there, and probably just keep it local on the Medford channel, wipe out the other channels, and then provide some training on how to use the radio.

1310
01:42:09,014 --> 01:42:15,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So the hope would be, I know it's probably not soon enough, but the hope would be that we'd have these in the field by September when school opens.

1311
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,500
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great, Chief.

1312
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,781
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good news.

1313
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:19,602
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want to make sure that these radios work.

1314
01:42:19,642 --> 01:42:20,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, they're sitting in the blocks.

1315
01:42:22,124 --> 01:42:22,705
[SPEAKER_05]: They still work.

1316
01:42:24,151 --> 01:42:32,835
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not really good enough to be used on, you know, 24 hour day to day patrol, but it should serve a purpose to fill that void.

1317
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:35,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something I know that you've mentioned numerous times in the past.

1318
01:42:36,076 --> 01:42:41,418
[SPEAKER_23]: So only because they only because they've mentioned it to me, chief saying they'd like to have a direct line of communication.

1319
01:42:41,718 --> 01:42:44,579
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's not just to say, Hey, how's, you know, what's the weather down there.

1320
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:47,421
[SPEAKER_23]: It's to report stuff at a time of emergency.

1321
01:42:47,441 --> 01:42:49,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're in total agreement on that.

1322
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:50,082
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks chief.

1323
01:42:50,302 --> 01:42:50,842
[SPEAKER_23]: That's good news.

1324
01:42:51,548 --> 01:42:55,909
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1325
01:42:56,809 --> 01:42:57,689
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1326
01:42:58,069 --> 01:42:58,169
[SPEAKER_23]: Aye.

1327

[SPEAKER_14]: And so motioned to waive the three readings in addition.

1328
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,031
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1329
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:06,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1330
01:43:06,951 --> 01:43:07,651
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1331
01:43:08,631 --> 01:43:10,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to the traffic supervisors.

1332
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:10,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1333
01:43:11,091 --> 01:43:14,912
[SPEAKER_14]: And Chief, thank you for your presence here tonight and for your leadership.

1334
01:43:15,512 --> 01:43:16,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

1335
01:43:16,652 --> 01:43:17,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I will stay.

1336
01:43:18,773 --> 01:43:19,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1337
01:43:19,253 --> 01:43:19,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1338
01:43:28,808 --> 01:43:34,771
[SPEAKER_14]: So, on the motion of Councilor Camuso to resort back to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

1339
01:43:36,451 --> 01:43:37,132
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1340
01:43:37,152 --> 01:43:38,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the chief was waiting around.

1341
01:43:40,533 --> 01:43:43,514
[SPEAKER_23]: Can we take it out of order, one of the papers?

1342
01:43:44,915 --> 01:43:45,715
[SPEAKER_13]: What paper do you want?

1343
01:43:47,636 --> 01:43:49,197
[SPEAKER_13]: We're back in the regular order of business.

1344
01:43:54,097 --> 01:44:19,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So motion by councillor Penta to take item number 15 of 478 Out of order all those in favor aye all those opposed Offered by councillor Penta be resolved that the ongoing parking ticket actions of the out-of-state Republic parking company be discussed councillor

1345
01:44:22,515 --> 01:44:22,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Penta.

1346
01:44:23,015 --> 01:44:23,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1347
01:44:24,036 --> 01:44:31,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, chief, I'm, I'm glad that you're here because the first thing I want to talk about is something that I believe it came up at your March meeting.

1348
01:44:32,179 --> 01:44:33,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we'll start with this group of people.

1349
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:41,724
[SPEAKER_17]: You have folks that have purchased permit stickers to park in the governor's app parking lot who are business merchants.

1350
01:44:42,724 --> 01:44:43,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1351
01:44:43,504 --> 01:44:48,947
[SPEAKER_17]: And these merchants, um, two in particular on,

1352
01:44:49,443 --> 01:44:55,185
[SPEAKER_17]: any particular day have been unable to go into the Governor's Air parking lot to find a spot.

1353
01:44:56,505 --> 01:45:07,408
[SPEAKER_17]: And by not being able to find a spot, the gentleman who supposedly is in the parking lot over there turned around and told them it's okay for them to park on the street on Governor's Avenue.

1354
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:13,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, this one particular person has received four tickets since Saturday in the amount of $100, four $25 tickets.

1355
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:13,650
[SPEAKER_17]: That's number one.

1356
01:45:16,265 --> 01:45:33,072
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe at the March meeting they come up to you and they asked you about this as it relates to, and I believe that you indicated to them, paraphrasing, that you would be okay to park on Governor's Avenue if there were no spots because you have a permit parking sticker and the cars should be able to pick it up.

1357
01:45:34,273 --> 01:45:35,033
[SPEAKER_17]: That's number one.

1358
01:45:35,834 --> 01:45:40,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, there's a gentleman who parked his car, put the money in the meter,

1359
01:45:43,186 --> 01:45:45,388
[SPEAKER_17]: And the expiration of the media was at 144.

1360
01:45:48,411 --> 01:45:55,096
[SPEAKER_17]: He got a ticket, chief, at 104, for which the expiration wasn't even anywhere near it.

1361
01:45:57,258 --> 01:46:01,262
[SPEAKER_17]: The gentleman who gave him the ticket turned around and says, if you don't like it, you know what to do.

1362
01:46:01,362 --> 01:46:01,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Appeal.

1363
01:46:03,804 --> 01:46:09,929
[SPEAKER_17]: The next issue is, is a resident who lives on Governor's Avenue, a resident who lives on Governor's Avenue.

1364
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:20,356
[SPEAKER_17]: And this resident got a ticket after 10 o'clock at night by the bounty hunters that the city has hired to go out there and give tickets to.

1365
01:46:22,558 --> 01:46:23,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely wrong, chief.

1366
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:31,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Question then was asked on this particular individual, parking on the street, resident parking.

1367
01:46:32,727 --> 01:46:35,029
[SPEAKER_17]: They told her she had to move her car every two hours.

1368
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:38,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And by moving her car every two hours brings it up to midnight.

1369
01:46:40,025 --> 01:46:41,965
[SPEAKER_17]: And this woman is just upset.

1370
01:46:44,526 --> 01:46:49,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Next one is in Medford Square, behind the UPS store.

1371
01:46:50,587 --> 01:46:54,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Lady goes out there, puts money in the meter, which is good until 10.22.

1372
01:46:55,028 --> 01:47:02,430
[SPEAKER_17]: The gentleman comes up to her at 10.11, starts to give her a ticket, and she says to him, what are you doing?

1373
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:07,071
[SPEAKER_17]: He says, well, listen, don't worry about it.

1374
01:47:07,151 --> 01:47:09,251
[SPEAKER_17]: I can take it back if you get a ticket.

1375
01:47:09,513 --> 01:47:13,196
[SPEAKER_17]: He didn't give her the ticket because she said to him, what are you doing?

1376
01:47:14,677 --> 01:47:25,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Chief, you have a lady in Medford Square who is a registered hairdresser who has in excess of 250 signatures because this is killing her business in the square.

1377
01:47:26,045 --> 01:47:28,287
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not Elsie, but the other end of the square.

1378
01:47:28,327 --> 01:47:29,408
[SPEAKER_17]: This is on Salem Street.

1379
01:47:30,348 --> 01:47:32,330
[SPEAKER_17]: This thing with the Republic has not gotten any better.

1380
01:47:33,891 --> 01:47:39,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Two complaints from individuals who have out-of-state plates that come into Medford Square

1381
01:47:39,832 --> 01:47:42,353
[SPEAKER_17]: They try to put their plate number in, and it doesn't take.

1382
01:47:42,953 --> 01:47:43,833
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't know what to do.

1383
01:47:43,873 --> 01:47:46,654
[SPEAKER_17]: They go into the store, and they come out, and they get a ticket.

1384
01:47:49,894 --> 01:47:51,135
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not making any sense.

1385
01:47:51,855 --> 01:47:53,275
[SPEAKER_17]: These things are supposed to be resolved.

1386
01:47:54,175 --> 01:47:56,356
[SPEAKER_17]: On High Street, you and I had this conversation.

1387
01:47:56,396 --> 01:47:56,976
[SPEAKER_17]: I have the tickets.

1388
01:47:56,996 --> 01:47:58,016
[SPEAKER_17]: I have the pictures in my bag.

1389
01:47:58,696 --> 01:48:05,098
[SPEAKER_17]: They still have the kiosk in front of a two-family residential house for which people still try to put money in the meter.

1390
01:48:05,522 --> 01:48:09,965
[SPEAKER_17]: thinking that they're supposed to, which McCulloch paid to park there.

1391
01:48:10,766 --> 01:48:15,969
[SPEAKER_17]: That was one of the very first ones they said they were going to remove as soon as the weather got better, as soon as the snowstorm ended.

1392
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:22,233
[SPEAKER_17]: And we could just go on and on with the telephone calls relative to the people saying they try to put money into the machine.

1393
01:48:22,654 --> 01:48:23,774
[SPEAKER_17]: One lady put a quarter in the machine.

1394
01:48:23,794 --> 01:48:24,855
[SPEAKER_17]: She got four quarters back.

1395
01:48:25,736 --> 01:48:26,716
[SPEAKER_17]: But she didn't get her ticket.

1396
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:30,459
[SPEAKER_17]: She got a ticket that had a different license plate number on it.

1397
01:48:31,262 --> 01:48:36,643
[SPEAKER_17]: So unfortunately, or good for her, she didn't get a ticket because she didn't get the right receipt that went to her number plate.

1398
01:48:38,364 --> 01:48:39,744
[SPEAKER_17]: This craziness has got to stop.

1399
01:48:40,744 --> 01:48:44,965
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, these people that are giving out the tickets, it's a combination of them not knowing what they're doing.

1400
01:48:45,005 --> 01:48:46,926
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't tell someone if you don't like it, appeal it.

1401
01:48:47,286 --> 01:48:55,388
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't go up to somebody, and I think it even reflects upon Councilor Caraviello, on one particular day near CVS, they were just waiting to put a ticket in his car.

1402
01:48:55,968 --> 01:48:57,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, they're all here.

1403
01:48:57,688 --> 01:48:58,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not making this stuff up.

1404
01:48:59,549 --> 01:49:00,549
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's just wrong.

1405
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:09,367
[SPEAKER_17]: But when it's so blatant, giving a guy a ticket, when he has until 144, and they give him a ticket 104, well, if you don't like it, appeal it.

1406
01:49:09,407 --> 01:49:10,608
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, how do you do this?

1407
01:49:11,428 --> 01:49:12,669
[SPEAKER_17]: How do you say it's OK?

1408
01:49:12,789 --> 01:49:13,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

1409
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:14,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly don't agree with that.

1410
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:14,851
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't.

1411
01:49:14,891 --> 01:49:15,932
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you say, how do you do this?

1412
01:49:15,952 --> 01:49:17,113
[SPEAKER_05]: You had two of those that were similar.

1413
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:22,237
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the 1011 in the UPS store, and you had the 104 on a meter.

1414
01:49:22,257 --> 01:49:23,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Then you have the one on Governor's Avenue.

1415
01:49:24,599 --> 01:49:29,322
[SPEAKER_17]: At 10.07 AM, she put a quarter in the meter at 10.07 AM.

1416
01:49:30,487 --> 01:49:34,951
[SPEAKER_17]: She ran into the UPS store, came out at 1011, and the guy was sitting there waiting to give her a ticket.

1417
01:49:35,211 --> 01:49:36,512
[SPEAKER_17]: And the ticket expires at 1022.

1418
01:49:40,014 --> 01:49:40,475
[SPEAKER_17]: It's wrong.

1419
01:49:40,895 --> 01:49:41,756
[SPEAKER_17]: This is wrong, chief.

1420
01:49:41,816 --> 01:49:43,477
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not what the people asked for.

1421
01:49:43,837 --> 01:49:45,959
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not what the city expected from it.

1422
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,801
[SPEAKER_17]: They've had more than enough time to get their act together.

1423
01:49:48,821 --> 01:49:50,603
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think it's wrong.

1424
01:49:50,643 --> 01:49:52,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I address a few of these?

1425
01:49:52,384 --> 01:49:53,285
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, go ahead.

1426
01:49:53,725 --> 01:49:55,847
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, the first one, the governor's av lot.

1427
01:49:57,768 --> 01:49:59,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone has been told in the lot

1428
01:50:00,474 --> 01:50:05,598
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a business permit, park against the wall, which abuts 15 Governor's Ave.

1429
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:08,360
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only spot for business permits.

1430
01:50:09,321 --> 01:50:13,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I never told anyone that if you have a business permit, you can park on Governor's Ave.

1431
01:50:13,484 --> 01:50:20,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I have told them they can park on Governor's Ave up by Terrace Road, which allows for a business permit for two hours.

1432
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:21,591
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's Governor's Ave.

1433
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:24,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But not in the lower end of Governor's Ave.

1434
01:50:24,313 --> 01:50:24,894
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's Governor's Ave.

1435
01:50:24,914 --> 01:50:25,414
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where they park.

1436
01:50:25,434 --> 01:50:27,756
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they go up there by the wall, by the Terrace Road wall,

1437
01:50:28,082 --> 01:50:31,063
[SPEAKER_05]: They can park up there as long as they're registered with the business permit.

1438
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I think part of the bigger problem that we have, too, is we're not using permits.

1439
01:50:36,145 --> 01:50:45,709
[SPEAKER_05]: The virtual permit, their plate number is registered with the company, and there's no decal being given to the person who purchases.

1440
01:50:45,749 --> 01:50:47,630
[SPEAKER_05]: They register their vehicle, their plate number.

1441
01:50:48,095 --> 01:50:49,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a problem.

1442
01:50:49,855 --> 01:51:05,260
[SPEAKER_17]: It should be a problem, because the fact of the matter is, if the city is giving out too many tickets or too many permits, and there's more permits that are allowed in the parking lot, how do you blame the person that bought the permit, believing that they could use the parking lot, but now have to go up on Governor's Avenue to find a spot?

1443
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:09,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone was told that they could only use the back wall for business permits.

1444
01:51:09,161 --> 01:51:10,221
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know yourself.

1445
01:51:10,281 --> 01:51:11,801
[SPEAKER_05]: The middle section is three hours.

1446
01:51:11,961 --> 01:51:14,642
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more- The parallel parking behind the stores

1447
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:19,303
[SPEAKER_05]: It ranges from 15 minutes, I believe, 30 minutes, and an hour.

1448
01:51:19,323 --> 01:51:20,324
[SPEAKER_17]: 15, 30, one hour, and then two hours.

1449
01:51:20,524 --> 01:51:23,266
[SPEAKER_17]: But these people pay the $100 for their parking permit, OK?

1450
01:51:23,586 --> 01:51:24,407
[SPEAKER_17]: They shouldn't be getting a ticket.

1451
01:51:24,427 --> 01:51:25,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't guarantee them a spot, though.

1452
01:51:25,808 --> 01:51:29,611
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't have to, but they shouldn't be guaranteed getting a ticket either if they can't find a spot.

1453
01:51:29,631 --> 01:51:31,632
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they're not in violation.

1454
01:51:31,652 --> 01:51:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: There are spots, though.

1455
01:51:32,813 --> 01:51:33,714
[SPEAKER_05]: There are spots.

1456
01:51:33,734 --> 01:51:35,756
[SPEAKER_05]: They may have to hike a bit, but there are spots.

1457
01:51:36,096 --> 01:51:41,480
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're going to be in a business all day long, they should park the furthest point away.

1458
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they don't need their car all day long.

1459
01:51:44,542 --> 01:51:45,983
[SPEAKER_05]: They shouldn't be parked right there.

1460
01:51:46,543 --> 01:51:49,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm agreeable with the wall.

1461
01:51:49,265 --> 01:51:50,766
[SPEAKER_05]: That's historic.

1462
01:51:50,806 --> 01:51:52,548
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the business permit along that wall.

1463
01:51:53,168 --> 01:51:56,331
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the governor's terrace road wall for the business permits.

1464
01:51:56,771 --> 01:52:00,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We have business permits in this end of the square as well.

1465
01:52:00,934 --> 01:52:03,356
[SPEAKER_05]: They can use the shell parking lot during the daytime.

1466
01:52:04,559 --> 01:52:07,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Chief, what do you do if somebody's handicapped, they have a business permit parking?

1467
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,540
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to go out and then they come back.

1468
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:13,302
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're handicapped and they want to display their handicapped placard, they could park all day on any spot.

1469
01:52:13,322 --> 01:52:17,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know as well as I that they've given out tickets to people that have a handicapped placard, OK?

1470
01:52:17,763 --> 01:52:19,784
[SPEAKER_17]: These people are pretty rude as to what they're doing.

1471
01:52:19,984 --> 01:52:21,365
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're only out there to make money.

1472
01:52:21,665 --> 01:52:29,387
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't care about the simple little guy who's just trying to negotiate his day's life, trying to spend $0.25 or $0.50 in a parking lot to do their business.

1473
01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:30,428
[SPEAKER_17]: That's wrong.

1474
01:52:30,448 --> 01:52:31,208
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1475
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:32,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I go down this list?

1476
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:34,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go ahead, keep going.

1477
01:52:34,021 --> 01:52:37,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the meters that we talked about, the 1.44 p.m.

1478
01:52:37,243 --> 01:52:39,065
[SPEAKER_05]: and then 1.04, there's no excuse for that.

1479
01:52:39,105 --> 01:52:40,746
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been a problem.

1480
01:52:41,026 --> 01:52:42,126
[SPEAKER_05]: People haven't received tickets.

1481
01:52:42,186 --> 01:52:51,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Councilor Camuso even received, or his wife, received a ticket early on in the program when she still had time on the meter, and that's not right, and that should have been corrected.

1482
01:52:52,293 --> 01:52:55,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am told by Republic that WestCore, the company who

1483
01:52:57,462 --> 01:53:02,604
[SPEAKER_05]: installed these machines, came out and tested every single machine, every single kiosk.

1484
01:53:02,744 --> 01:53:05,325
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 85 of them that they tested them for accuracy.

1485
01:53:05,705 --> 01:53:09,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly they modified some of them that they found having a problem.

1486
01:53:09,387 --> 01:53:11,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've done some preventive maintenance.

1487
01:53:11,828 --> 01:53:13,489
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably time for them to come out again.

1488
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:18,391
[SPEAKER_17]: How can they test them for accuracy if I put money in a machine and I get somebody else's receipt?

1489
01:53:19,937 --> 01:53:20,357
[SPEAKER_17]: How does that work?

1490
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:22,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You might've got the receipt from the person before you.

1491
01:53:22,658 --> 01:53:25,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there was some difficulty getting the receipt out of the slot.

1492
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:29,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, you know, I, I'm only making an assumption that that's the case.

1493
01:53:30,262 --> 01:53:37,346
[SPEAKER_05]: The resident on governor's Avenue, she was at our traffic commission meeting last, last month, uh, earlier this month, I should say.

1494
01:53:37,926 --> 01:53:49,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And that ticket was taken care of right there because we had a representative from Republic at the meeting and he was told in no uncertain terms that the parking restriction, even though it says two hour parking,

1495
01:53:50,908 --> 01:53:53,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like all the other on street parking.

1496
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:54,711
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only until 6 p.m.

1497
01:53:55,171 --> 01:53:56,772
[SPEAKER_05]: So they could pack from 6 p.m.

1498
01:53:57,153 --> 01:53:58,013
[SPEAKER_05]: until 8 a.m.

1499
01:53:58,033 --> 01:54:00,595
[SPEAKER_05]: The next morning and not be subject to ticketing.

1500
01:54:00,855 --> 01:54:01,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And she got a ticket.

1501
01:54:01,776 --> 01:54:03,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not a permit parking street.

1502
01:54:03,818 --> 01:54:05,139
[SPEAKER_17]: And she got a ticket at 10 p.m.

1503
01:54:05,519 --> 01:54:05,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1504
01:54:05,739 --> 01:54:07,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are they doing out at 10 o'clock?

1505
01:54:07,801 --> 01:54:10,182
[SPEAKER_05]: They took that ticket away.

1506
01:54:10,222 --> 01:54:11,824
[SPEAKER_17]: But what are they doing out at 10 o'clock at night?

1507
01:54:12,484 --> 01:54:17,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Given people hot attacks over stupid tickets, the signs on governor's Avenue did not have a time limit on them.

1508
01:54:18,543 --> 01:54:21,944
[SPEAKER_05]: They said two hours, but didn't say a beginning time and an end time.

1509
01:54:21,964 --> 01:54:23,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know what the contract says about all of this?

1510
01:54:24,205 --> 01:54:30,927
[SPEAKER_17]: These people are supposed to be trained, they're supposed to know the streets that they give the tickets on, and they were supposed to have a course in this, okay?

1511
01:54:31,687 --> 01:54:35,188
[SPEAKER_17]: And they acknowledged, Mr. Nash, when he acknowledged that they hadn't done it, okay?

1512
01:54:35,248 --> 01:54:39,630
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're still dealing with the same problems from a contract signed on October 10th, 2014.

1513
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:42,051
[SPEAKER_17]: This makes no sense at all.

1514
01:54:42,491 --> 01:54:43,071
[SPEAKER_17]: This is wrong.

1515
01:54:43,755 --> 01:54:46,376
[SPEAKER_17]: People should not even have to go and have a ticket waived.

1516
01:54:46,576 --> 01:54:48,357
[SPEAKER_17]: They shouldn't even have to go to give you a call.

1517
01:54:48,517 --> 01:54:49,557
[SPEAKER_17]: They shouldn't have to go to a travel.

1518
01:54:49,698 --> 01:54:52,799
[SPEAKER_17]: They shouldn't have to be inconvenienced for this, because these people should know what they're doing.

1519
01:54:53,699 --> 01:54:54,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're not.

1520
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,160
[SPEAKER_17]: They're causing a hardship to people.

1521
01:54:58,341 --> 01:54:59,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We spoke about the UPS store.

1522
01:54:59,782 --> 01:55:04,084
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same thing with the, they still had time on the meter, and they were about to get a ticket.

1523
01:55:04,604 --> 01:55:07,845
[SPEAKER_05]: The hairdresser on the square, I know she had generated a petition.

1524
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:09,086
[SPEAKER_05]: She has over 200 of them.

1525
01:55:09,306 --> 01:55:11,927
[SPEAKER_05]: But quite honestly, she sandwiched in

1526
01:55:12,797 --> 01:55:21,218
[SPEAKER_05]: between the 15-minute spots that are in front of Martin Pastry and pretty much the restricted spots at Dunkin' Donuts.

1527
01:55:22,559 --> 01:55:30,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that, and I know, and I've spoken with the lady, I know that she's having problems with patrons because now there's enforcement.

1528
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:36,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if we enforce the time limits on the signs without even the meters, she would have a problem with her clientele.

1529
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:41,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what she did before because there was never a spot to park on Salem Street.

1530
01:55:42,038 --> 01:55:44,120
[SPEAKER_05]: from Ashland Street to the center of the square.

1531
01:55:44,501 --> 01:55:46,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Never, absolutely never a spot.

1532
01:55:46,863 --> 01:55:49,165
[SPEAKER_05]: They were full at 8 o'clock in the morning.

1533
01:55:49,626 --> 01:55:54,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know where her customers parked before this, but Salem Street is open now.

1534
01:55:54,351 --> 01:56:00,177
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I will grant you is that many of the patrons probably need more than two hours in the hairdressing shop.

1535
01:56:00,657 --> 01:56:03,601
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to say that there's much more parking available.

1536
01:56:03,921 --> 01:56:05,002
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to cross the street.

1537
01:56:05,517 --> 01:56:08,460
[SPEAKER_05]: She is in between all the 15-minute spots right there.

1538
01:56:08,521 --> 01:56:11,564
[SPEAKER_05]: She never was able to have anyone park right in front of her shot.

1539
01:56:11,744 --> 01:56:19,113
[SPEAKER_17]: But the difference between what you're talking about, the patrons that she had before, before these crazy kiosk stuff came in, maybe she got a two- or three-hour person.

1540
01:56:19,456 --> 01:56:23,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And she wasn't losing these one or two customers, whatever they might be.

1541
01:56:23,677 --> 01:56:29,898
[SPEAKER_17]: This past week, I was in West Medford, and I saw a lady walk out of the hairdresser across the street with the curls in her hair.

1542
01:56:29,938 --> 01:56:36,099
[SPEAKER_17]: She was having a foil, just to run out to go in there and to put the money in the meter, which made no sense at all.

1543
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I thought the parking lots were going to be three hours.

1544
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,060
[SPEAKER_17]: The signs still have not been changed.

1545
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:41,921
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they waiting for?

1546
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:44,601
[SPEAKER_05]: The West Medford lot is supposed to be reconfigured.

1547
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:46,101
[SPEAKER_05]: All the lots are supposed to be three hours.

1548
01:56:46,121 --> 01:56:46,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are.

1549
01:56:47,322 --> 01:56:48,862
[SPEAKER_17]: So how do they turn around and give people tickets?

1550
01:56:48,922 --> 01:56:49,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell me.

1551
01:56:50,174 --> 01:56:55,275
[SPEAKER_05]: The kiosk, well, whatever meters are in the lots right now, supposedly have been programmed for a few hours.

1552
01:56:55,295 --> 01:56:55,735
[SPEAKER_05]: This is wrong.

1553
01:56:56,776 --> 01:57:00,316
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to just say, if I were the mayor, you know this would be the second thing in this building to go.

1554
01:57:00,696 --> 01:57:02,757
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be the second contract of the city to go.

1555
01:57:03,397 --> 01:57:06,038
[SPEAKER_17]: I won't tell you what the first one is, but that's the second one.

1556
01:57:06,498 --> 01:57:07,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably mine, right?

1557
01:57:07,678 --> 01:57:08,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1558
01:57:10,018 --> 01:57:11,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1559
01:57:11,499 --> 01:57:16,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief, now that the snow is gone, all 10 feet of it,

1560
01:57:17,891 --> 01:57:23,774
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a program that Republic was willing to participate in, and I believe they called it their ambassador program.

1561
01:57:24,534 --> 01:57:34,919
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it might make sense to get them out there now that people are actually walking around in the streets as opposed to running to their car, running from their car, and trying to get into the stores as fast as they can to keep out of the elements.

1562
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:40,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering, Chief, if that's something that the Traffic Commission would be interested in maybe requesting.

1563
01:57:41,312 --> 01:57:48,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That has been mentioned to them several times since the snow has gone, and we're hoping that they will do that.

1564
01:57:48,515 --> 01:57:50,676
[SPEAKER_05]: They're being told, basically, that they have to do that.

1565
01:57:51,356 --> 01:57:56,759
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to reacquaint people with the kiosks, and they need to be testing the machines to make sure that they're working.

1566
01:57:57,279 --> 01:58:00,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, by and large, though, I have to say the office staff up there have been very good.

1567
01:58:01,381 --> 01:58:04,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Any times that we've had any problems, we've been able to call.

1568
01:58:05,023 --> 01:58:07,425
[SPEAKER_05]: PM in the office, and she's been very receptive.

1569
01:58:08,105 --> 01:58:13,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick, who is the local person in charge of the operation, he has been good.

1570
01:58:13,769 --> 01:58:22,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that, you know, we need to reach Dan Nash or maybe people above him to take them to task for some of these things that are just continuous, that are ongoing.

1571
01:58:23,456 --> 01:58:28,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief, when you said from Ashland Street down to, you know, the foot of

1572
01:58:29,174 --> 01:58:31,415
[SPEAKER_11]: the square, you'd never find a parking spot over there.

1573
01:58:31,475 --> 01:58:34,536
[SPEAKER_11]: And before, before the meeting, right.

1574
01:58:34,556 --> 01:58:45,719
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the only time that I think I could ever find a spot was when, when Maddie and Sonya was working the shift before he retired down there, because he was very vigilant, um, in his efforts to ensure that the parking regulations were, were, were abided by.

1575
01:58:46,219 --> 01:58:57,522
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, we're having a lot of problems with, uh, the current officers working for a public in their unfamiliarity with what spots should be enforced in what fashion.

1576
01:58:57,906 --> 01:59:11,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Has there been any consideration given to maybe giving some retired officers who work in the traffic division the opportunity to maybe come forward and assist in showing these people the ropes and how it's done, maybe for a per diem or something like that, to get the program off the ground and running smoothly?

1577
01:59:11,676 --> 01:59:14,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think we can all agree that there have been a lot of bumps in the road.

1578
01:59:14,778 --> 01:59:19,081
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe this is just one of the ways that we can solve some of the problems that we're facing.

1579
01:59:20,182 --> 01:59:21,463
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something worth looking at.

1580
01:59:21,503 --> 01:59:25,025
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a call that someone else will have to make.

1581
01:59:25,086 --> 01:59:27,067
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know that once school is out,

1582
01:59:28,372 --> 01:59:38,195
[SPEAKER_05]: We plan on having the day shift traffic officers work with them a little closer and pretty much itemize where the problems are and see if we can correct them.

1583
01:59:38,855 --> 01:59:42,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that people have been hearing an improvement on permit parking streets.

1584
01:59:42,736 --> 01:59:54,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, but I'm hoping that you're hearing from the constituents that there has been some improvement on the enforcement there and the consideration for the neighborhood as opposed to just street by street.

1585
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:58,622
[SPEAKER_05]: that at least giving, if someone's on Burwick, they could park on Yale.

1586
01:59:59,322 --> 02:00:01,763
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been very helpful from the constituents.

1587
02:00:01,883 --> 02:00:08,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that from the police department end, I think some of the calls that we used to get have dropped off for the permit parking.

1588
02:00:09,406 --> 02:00:19,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not sure if they've dropped off because people are just totally frustrated or whatever, but I still believe that we have to go forward with the actual decal on the vehicle.

1589
02:00:19,817 --> 02:00:20,418
[SPEAKER_05]: for the permits.

1590
02:00:20,678 --> 02:00:33,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Another thing, Chief, if Republic isn't so interested in doing their ambassador program, and when school gets out, we are going to have some of our traffic division officers helping out, maybe it might make sense to allow our traffic supervisors to maybe participate in the ambassadorship program as well.

1591
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:34,491
[SPEAKER_11]: They're already city employees.

1592
02:00:34,511 --> 02:00:36,132
[SPEAKER_11]: They're already working for the traffic division.

1593
02:00:36,493 --> 02:00:43,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe it makes sense to train them on the machines as well and give them an opportunity to maybe help out and make this work a little smoother.

1594
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:45,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1595
02:00:46,868 --> 02:00:49,169
[SPEAKER_17]: President council Pender chief.

1596
02:00:49,569 --> 02:00:49,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

1597
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:58,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Page and their operator employees standards on page 13 of the contract.

1598
02:00:59,415 --> 02:01:09,620
[SPEAKER_17]: It says the operator shall be solely responsible for the complete training of all its parking enforcement personnel and will maintain training records as prescribed by law or policy as appropriate.

1599
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,043
[SPEAKER_17]: This training will include, but not be limited to customer service, conflict management,

1600
02:01:15,445 --> 02:01:25,318
[SPEAKER_17]: civil rights law, disability and accessibility laws and procedures, municipal ordinances pertaining to parking enforcement, job safety included but not limited to OSHA standards.

1601
02:01:28,009 --> 02:01:30,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you tell me, did they follow this contract proviso?

1602
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:40,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that about a month ago, maybe a little more than a month ago, they did have someone from their human relations unit, the corporate office, come in and do a training for the personnel.

1603
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:45,442
[SPEAKER_17]: This was supposed to be in October before this contract.

1604
02:01:45,662 --> 02:01:46,863
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what the contract says.

1605
02:01:47,163 --> 02:01:48,344
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is now what, May?

1606
02:01:48,364 --> 02:01:48,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1607
02:01:49,004 --> 02:01:52,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know there's been some changes in staff since the beginning.

1608
02:01:52,643 --> 02:01:54,405
[SPEAKER_17]: But before you hire someone, don't you train them?

1609
02:01:54,866 --> 02:01:58,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Before you get a police officer, we just had a student school for them tonight, didn't we?

1610
02:01:59,431 --> 02:02:06,620
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't hire them off the street to come in here and aggravate the people and be bounty hunter number one or two or three because you collect the most amount of money.

1611
02:02:07,665 --> 02:02:08,986
[SPEAKER_17]: This is wrong, dead wrong.

1612
02:02:09,226 --> 02:02:11,847
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, as I said to you before, I like you, you're my friend.

1613
02:02:12,168 --> 02:02:13,468
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not your job.

1614
02:02:13,488 --> 02:02:14,589
[SPEAKER_17]: This was the mayor's job.

1615
02:02:15,409 --> 02:02:16,610
[SPEAKER_17]: You should not be doing this.

1616
02:02:17,371 --> 02:02:18,471
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here to answer the questions.

1617
02:02:18,491 --> 02:02:19,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.

1618
02:02:19,532 --> 02:02:20,873
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate it, okay?

1619
02:02:20,973 --> 02:02:22,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all under the same umbrella.

1620
02:02:22,313 --> 02:02:25,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's all about public safety, parking, and traffic calls to the police department.

1621
02:02:25,915 --> 02:02:37,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, maybe we should just abolish it, like I said, and have a nice little, like it was before, start off with a small revenue enforcement program, see how it works, see if that leads into maybe meters if you want to put

1622
02:02:37,602 --> 02:02:41,145
[SPEAKER_17]: the court is in in the future, which people can understand, not this craziness.

1623
02:02:41,485 --> 02:02:42,226
[SPEAKER_17]: And tell me something.

1624
02:02:42,266 --> 02:02:48,370
[SPEAKER_17]: If I'm out of the state, and I put money in the meter, and it doesn't take my receipt, it doesn't take my license, why should I be subject to a ticket?

1625
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:49,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I'm out of state.

1626
02:02:50,011 --> 02:02:50,692
[SPEAKER_17]: How does this work?

1627
02:02:51,553 --> 02:02:52,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to check that.

1628
02:02:52,573 --> 02:02:53,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an answer to that.

1629
02:02:53,894 --> 02:02:55,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's the problem here.

1630
02:02:55,576 --> 02:02:57,757
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's another way to juice somebody out of $25.

1631
02:02:57,837 --> 02:03:00,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1632
02:03:02,601 --> 02:03:05,083
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a motion by counsel.

1633
02:03:05,764 --> 02:03:06,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it an amendment?

1634
02:03:07,387 --> 02:03:08,148
[SPEAKER_04]: by Councilor Knight.

1635
02:03:09,688 --> 02:03:10,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no amendment.

1636
02:03:11,849 --> 02:03:12,409
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Marks.

1637
02:03:12,429 --> 02:03:12,970
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1638
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:25,335
[SPEAKER_23]: Chief, a few weeks ago I put something on the agenda for the Traffic Commission, I don't know if you got it yet, but Placeted Road, I think you're familiar, from Irving Street all the way up to Century Street, on the right-hand side.

1639
02:03:26,175 --> 02:03:26,776
[SPEAKER_23]: In front of the homes.

1640
02:03:27,096 --> 02:03:27,756
[SPEAKER_23]: In front of the homes.

1641
02:03:28,596 --> 02:03:31,558
[SPEAKER_23]: That permit parking doesn't take effect until 10 or 11?

1642
02:03:31,838 --> 02:03:34,179
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's permit parking all day.

1643
02:03:35,287 --> 02:03:36,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?

1644
02:03:36,368 --> 02:03:41,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Place that road from Irving Street all the way up to just about Century.

1645
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:43,451
[SPEAKER_23]: If you could check into that.

1646
02:03:43,611 --> 02:03:44,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I did right after that.

1647
02:03:45,092 --> 02:03:46,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, it's all day.

1648
02:03:46,912 --> 02:03:49,574
[SPEAKER_05]: There used to be permit parking from 11 p.m.

1649
02:03:49,614 --> 02:03:50,554
[SPEAKER_05]: to 7 a.m.

1650
02:03:50,594 --> 02:03:51,334
[SPEAKER_05]: on the park side.

1651
02:03:53,087 --> 02:03:56,308
[SPEAKER_05]: and also on Century Street Extension going way back.

1652
02:03:56,368 --> 02:03:57,928
[SPEAKER_05]: That was something passed in the 70s.

1653
02:03:58,388 --> 02:03:59,829
[SPEAKER_05]: That had been rescinded a while ago.

1654
02:03:59,889 --> 02:04:01,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that a long time ago.

1655
02:04:01,289 --> 02:04:03,210
[SPEAKER_23]: So nothing on Placelift Road then on the house side?

1656
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:05,890
[SPEAKER_05]: On the house side, it's permit parking all day.

1657
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:07,491
[SPEAKER_05]: All day.

1658
02:04:07,511 --> 02:04:07,731
[SPEAKER_05]: 24-7.

1659
02:04:08,511 --> 02:04:08,791
[SPEAKER_23]: OK.

1660
02:04:09,991 --> 02:04:10,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll check it again.

1661
02:04:10,912 --> 02:04:12,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it again.

1662
02:04:13,132 --> 02:04:18,554
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe it stops at Century, from Irving Street up to Century.

1663
02:04:18,594 --> 02:04:19,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And after Century, there's no

1664
02:04:20,407 --> 02:04:24,591
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no, I am talking from Irving Street up to Century, that area on the house side.

1665
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:26,253
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe it's 24-7.

1666
02:04:26,293 --> 02:04:29,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1667
02:04:29,716 --> 02:04:30,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just 11 to 7.

1668
02:04:31,078 --> 02:04:31,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1669
02:04:31,478 --> 02:04:37,845
[SPEAKER_05]: But we used to, all over the city, around all of the parks and playgrounds, it used to be 11 p.m.

1670
02:04:37,865 --> 02:04:38,545
[SPEAKER_05]: to 7 a.m.

1671
02:04:38,565 --> 02:04:42,529
[SPEAKER_05]: because back in the day when we had a large number of

1672
02:04:43,732 --> 02:04:50,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Children congregating at night, that was a tool to be able to tag their vehicles that were parked there when they were in the wooded part of the parks.

1673
02:04:51,138 --> 02:04:53,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's been rescinded years ago when I heard that.

1674
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:57,462
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be a stray sign still out there, but I'm not sure.

1675
02:04:57,482 --> 02:05:02,266
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you know if they're enforcing the lot behind the cleaners in the hillside?

1676
02:05:02,726 --> 02:05:03,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe they are.

1677
02:05:03,587 --> 02:05:05,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen any tickets issued there.

1678
02:05:05,108 --> 02:05:09,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I frequent that quite a bit, and I have yet to see any enforcement there.

1679
02:05:09,511 --> 02:05:11,973
[SPEAKER_23]: You see a lot of out of state plates there for hours on end.

1680
02:05:12,433 --> 02:05:14,074
[SPEAKER_23]: So you may want to check that out, too.

1681
02:05:14,114 --> 02:05:16,875
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1682
02:05:16,995 --> 02:05:17,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1683
02:05:18,395 --> 02:05:24,817
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, through the chair, I, too, received calls with regards to the Medford Square business permit issue.

1684
02:05:26,018 --> 02:05:28,459
[SPEAKER_04]: The businesses feel that there's not enough spots.

1685
02:05:28,519 --> 02:05:29,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you say there are.

1686
02:05:30,419 --> 02:05:32,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Condon Shell, you're saying, should be the backup?

1687
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, depending on the location and the square.

1688
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:38,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if they can figure it out.

1689
02:05:39,332 --> 02:05:48,016
[SPEAKER_05]: This little lot over here by 64 Salem Street, the electric company, it's amazing how full that is at 7 o'clock, 7.30, 8 o'clock in the morning now.

1690
02:05:48,036 --> 02:05:49,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And that used to be empty.

1691
02:05:50,937 --> 02:05:59,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And one question on that, the business permit, if somebody needs to change a car, can they swap plates for a day, call the office?

1692
02:05:59,861 --> 02:06:03,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's the benefit for them to register their plate number with the company.

1693
02:06:03,623 --> 02:06:06,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier before if you have just the decal.

1694
02:06:06,551 --> 02:06:11,532
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if your car was in the shop and you had a rental for the day, you faced a problem.

1695
02:06:11,832 --> 02:06:15,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they can just call up and say, I'm using this car today, and give them the plate number.

1696
02:06:15,853 --> 02:06:18,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, everything jives on that end, and they can do it.

1697
02:06:18,593 --> 02:06:26,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had two complaints from business owners that they've called the office, Republic office, tried to switch the plate numbers for the day because they had to switch cars.

1698
02:06:26,875 --> 02:06:29,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say they're unable to do that.

1699
02:06:29,836 --> 02:06:32,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could just check with Republic on that.

1700
02:06:33,697 --> 02:06:35,477
[SPEAKER_04]: One was today, and one was last week.

1701
02:06:36,403 --> 02:06:36,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1702
02:06:36,923 --> 02:06:41,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And the business owners are being told that they can't, they can't swap plates on the business permit.

1703
02:06:42,365 --> 02:06:52,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that that was one of the selling points in the, in the beginning, because many times something happens and you can't take the guy that's registered and you have to use a rental or something.

1704
02:06:52,308 --> 02:07:02,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you could ask that question, cause I know tissue tickets were issued in those two instances, even though the business owner called Republic asked to switch the plate, they said she couldn't.

1705
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:03,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she got tickets.

1706
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can talk to you afterwards.

1707
02:07:07,501 --> 02:07:07,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1708
02:07:08,101 --> 02:07:09,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Camuso.

1709
02:07:09,582 --> 02:07:09,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1710
02:07:10,102 --> 02:07:15,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, you know, with the parking complaints, um, and businesses claiming that, um, there's not enough spots.

1711
02:07:16,565 --> 02:07:21,667
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, this is probably an appropriate time to start looking at the garage again in Medford square.

1712
02:07:22,387 --> 02:07:23,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, the money is set aside.

1713
02:07:24,028 --> 02:07:26,389
[SPEAKER_19]: State representative has it in the bond bill.

1714
02:07:27,129 --> 02:07:31,271
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, I think that this is the appropriate time to actually start talking about it again.

1715
02:07:32,211 --> 02:07:32,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

1716
02:07:33,994 --> 02:07:38,435
[SPEAKER_19]: There is a need for longer-term business parking within the square.

1717
02:07:39,296 --> 02:07:58,482
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I think the administration should take it under consideration, at least at this point, because the business owners that are complaining about not having spots, if there are additional spots that are allocated for long-term parking, and as I said in the past, the administration, it was another one of those issues that they just never brought forward.

1718
02:07:59,002 --> 02:08:01,983
[SPEAKER_19]: They talked about it, and this and that, and the council talked about it,

1719
02:08:02,307 --> 02:08:07,750
[SPEAKER_19]: But there has not been a proposal for the garage that's been before us for a vote for funding.

1720
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:19,275
[SPEAKER_19]: And as I said, State Rep Donato has worked tirelessly to get funding in the transportation bond bill for that specific purpose, as well as other money that was set aside by, I believe, the previous administration.

1721
02:08:19,295 --> 02:08:20,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of clarification.

1722
02:08:20,116 --> 02:08:20,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of clarification.

1723
02:08:20,656 --> 02:08:20,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Penta.

1724
02:08:20,956 --> 02:08:30,721
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason that money got into the bond bill is when the mayor knew that three members of the council weren't going to vote for it, he went to Representative Donato, who never came to us, to explain that they were putting that money into the bond bill.

1725
02:08:31,418 --> 02:08:36,662
[SPEAKER_17]: So there was no understanding of that money going in by any vote of this council one way or the other.

1726
02:08:36,682 --> 02:08:37,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I say that?

1727
02:08:39,144 --> 02:08:40,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you didn't say that.

1728
02:08:40,365 --> 02:08:41,045
[SPEAKER_19]: I did not say that.

1729
02:08:41,426 --> 02:08:45,809
[SPEAKER_19]: All I said was in the transportation bond bill, there's $3 million set aside.

1730
02:08:45,829 --> 02:08:50,412
[SPEAKER_19]: $8 million, Councilor Caraviello said.

1731
02:08:50,432 --> 02:09:00,460
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not exactly sure on the figure, but the bottom line is I think as one member of this council, there is a need for it.

1732
02:09:01,014 --> 02:09:05,296
[SPEAKER_19]: And we haven't had the opportunity to take a formal vote, whether we're for or against it.

1733
02:09:05,796 --> 02:09:23,262
[SPEAKER_19]: And as I said, I'm urging the administration to bring it forward and finally give the people of Medford Square, the neighbors, the business owners, an opportunity to come down here and be heard, as people were given the opportunity to come down in the Brooks Estates, the new science labs, and the list goes on and on and on.

1734
02:09:23,802 --> 02:09:27,303
[SPEAKER_19]: Jot the Course, which was brought forward by the McGlynn administration.

1735
02:09:28,183 --> 02:09:29,724
[SPEAKER_19]: This was part of it originally, I believe.

1736
02:09:30,165 --> 02:09:31,365
[SPEAKER_19]: And it just never came to a vote.

1737
02:09:31,565 --> 02:09:37,507
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that we owe it at least to the business owners to take a long, serious look at it.

1738
02:09:38,047 --> 02:09:48,030
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, the people out there, the farmer garage was built under the old farmer government, where it was the city council and the city managers back in, I want to say the 80s.

1739
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:55,172
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sure Mayor McGlynn still has the plaque from the garage when it fell down with the names on it.

1740
02:09:55,632 --> 02:09:58,173
[SPEAKER_19]: But with that being said, it's

1741
02:09:59,842 --> 02:10:01,243
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's long overdue.

1742
02:10:01,744 --> 02:10:03,666
[SPEAKER_19]: And I, as one member of this council do support it.

1743
02:10:03,826 --> 02:10:07,790
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would hope that it at least entertain it and give the people the opportunity to be heard.

1744
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:08,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1745
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:11,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, thank you chief for answering our questions.

1746
02:10:11,073 --> 02:10:14,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, some questions resolved Councilor Penta chief.

1747
02:10:14,756 --> 02:10:15,457
[SPEAKER_17]: One last question.

1748
02:10:15,637 --> 02:10:19,941
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, the hours of operation have now been changed from eight to six.

1749
02:10:20,242 --> 02:10:20,722
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

1750
02:10:20,862 --> 02:10:21,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Monday through Saturday.

1751
02:10:22,003 --> 02:10:22,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1752
02:10:22,424 --> 02:10:24,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you tell me why the office is not open on a Saturday?

1753
02:10:27,307 --> 02:10:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1754
02:10:28,428 --> 02:10:31,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they try to follow city hall hours.

1755
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:33,411
[SPEAKER_05]: City hall is not the parking clerk.

1756
02:10:33,771 --> 02:10:37,094
[SPEAKER_05]: They're open late on Wednesday night.

1757
02:10:37,154 --> 02:10:37,894
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't work that way.

1758
02:10:37,914 --> 02:10:41,917
[SPEAKER_17]: There are people that on Saturday is the only day they can make this appointment or see them or whatever it might be.

1759
02:10:42,818 --> 02:10:43,538
[SPEAKER_17]: This is not fair.

1760
02:10:43,558 --> 02:10:44,399
[SPEAKER_17]: It's another issue.

1761
02:10:44,419 --> 02:10:50,483
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can make a notation, ask them to be open on Saturday from 8 to 6, just like they are every other day.

1762
02:10:51,648 --> 02:10:57,496
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if they're good enough to give out the tickets, they should be good enough to hear their complaints on the same days that they give out their tickets.

1763
02:10:58,718 --> 02:10:59,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam President.

1764
02:11:00,921 --> 02:11:03,004
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may too, I'd just like to go on record.

1765
02:11:04,749 --> 02:11:21,970
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there is some frustration by some of the members of the Ticket Enforcement Unit, but there are several members of working for that company that are good, long-standing Medford families, Medford residents, and I think they're doing a fine and admirable job.

1766
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:26,192
[SPEAKER_19]: You call that office, we all know who works up in the office.

1767
02:11:26,912 --> 02:11:31,474
[SPEAKER_19]: A Medford gal and very friendly, two Medford gals, I didn't know the other one.

1768
02:11:31,934 --> 02:11:39,396
[SPEAKER_19]: And then one of the enforcement officers is a Medford young man that grew up here in our community.

1769
02:11:39,857 --> 02:11:43,538
[SPEAKER_19]: So the ones that at least live in this community are taking pride in their work.

1770
02:11:44,298 --> 02:11:46,379
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just want the record to reflect that.

1771
02:11:51,668 --> 02:11:58,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive in place on file and hopefully chief will get us, you know, ask those questions for us, get us those answers.

1772
02:11:59,155 --> 02:11:59,795
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

1773
02:12:00,296 --> 02:12:00,896
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed.

1774
02:12:01,397 --> 02:12:01,997
[SPEAKER_04]: It passes.

1775
02:12:02,918 --> 02:12:03,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1776
02:12:03,819 --> 02:12:05,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to revert back to regular.

1777
02:12:05,140 --> 02:12:06,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Could I just ask one question?

1778
02:12:06,421 --> 02:12:06,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1779
02:12:07,122 --> 02:12:08,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I'm just curious.

1780
02:12:09,304 --> 02:12:17,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you have the year for the public concerns and all the complaints, but I'm not hearing all the complaints.

1781
02:12:17,908 --> 02:12:19,929
[SPEAKER_05]: on the parking that I did in the very beginning.

1782
02:12:20,169 --> 02:12:24,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering, are you hearing anything positive?

1783
02:12:24,511 --> 02:12:28,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been hearing from some merchants that this is beginning to work.

1784
02:12:29,394 --> 02:12:30,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hearing some positives.

1785
02:12:31,755 --> 02:12:32,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear some positives.

1786
02:12:33,356 --> 02:12:41,100
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obvious that we need to round off the rough edges, but I just want to know, are you hearing any of the good things?

1787
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:44,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes I think the silent majority is out there.

1788
02:12:44,042 --> 02:12:46,783
[SPEAKER_05]: No one likes someone to come up and put a ticket on their windshield.

1789
02:12:47,332 --> 02:12:52,794
[SPEAKER_05]: whether you're a sworn police officer or you're a civilian, they don't want the tickets so they're going to complain.

1790
02:12:55,434 --> 02:12:56,115
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso.

1791
02:12:56,515 --> 02:13:01,676
[SPEAKER_19]: The one thing that's been unanimous amongst the people that I talk to is they all look forward to Sunday.

1792
02:13:03,497 --> 02:13:04,337
[SPEAKER_19]: The day of rest.

1793
02:13:04,777 --> 02:13:14,360
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, on a serious note though, we brought it up a few weeks ago, the holiday has to be straightened out and it has to be a lot of public output because

1794
02:13:15,088 --> 02:13:18,910
[SPEAKER_19]: There were people on Patriots Day, and you weren't here for the meeting, but people on Patriots Day were getting tickets.

1795
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:24,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I know the company did write by it, but it has to be unison.

1796
02:13:24,893 --> 02:13:27,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it the federal calendar, or is it the state calendar?

1797
02:13:27,814 --> 02:13:35,178
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it should be the state calendar, because how can you justify having City Hall closed and the schools closed, but still be able to get a ticket?

1798
02:13:35,678 --> 02:13:38,240
[SPEAKER_19]: And rubbish delivery doesn't get picked up, like Councilor Pender said.

1799
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:40,481
[SPEAKER_19]: It should be all holidays on both schedules.

1800
02:13:40,661 --> 02:13:41,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was corrected.

1801
02:13:43,124 --> 02:13:43,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1802
02:13:43,324 --> 02:13:46,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Burke gave them the list of holidays, and I think it was all of them.

1803
02:13:48,168 --> 02:13:53,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if Bunker Hill Day fit in that category, but all the others did.

1804
02:13:53,372 --> 02:13:56,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Bunker Hill Day, though, City Hall is closed, so it should be closed.

1805
02:13:57,395 --> 02:13:57,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1806
02:13:57,676 --> 02:13:58,516
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1807
02:13:58,757 --> 02:13:59,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1808
02:13:59,277 --> 02:13:59,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1809
02:13:59,737 --> 02:14:00,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Chief.

1810
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:03,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1811
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:11,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 15-470 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved with the Medford City Council, discuss the proposed

1812
02:14:12,157 --> 02:14:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Proposed appeal of 198202 Harvard Street to change from a three-family to a non-conforming five-family in an already congested area with insufficient off-street parking.

1813
02:14:23,381 --> 02:14:24,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1814
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:25,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

1815
02:14:25,722 --> 02:14:42,027
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Madam President, as the Ball Square station is getting closer to us, completion, people in that neighborhood are going to start seeing more and more of these conversions that are going to want to happen.

1816
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:45,611
[SPEAKER_21]: Property is selling at record prices up there right now.

1817
02:14:45,951 --> 02:14:49,033
[SPEAKER_21]: South Medford and the real estate market is on fire.

1818
02:14:49,653 --> 02:14:51,394
[SPEAKER_21]: And people are starting to cash out now.

1819
02:14:52,314 --> 02:15:01,278
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think the time has come where I think we need to sit down, maybe with the appeals board or somebody, to discuss all these that are going to come in.

1820
02:15:01,298 --> 02:15:05,760
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, here's somebody that wants to go from a three to a five on Harvard Street.

1821
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:08,681
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, did the chief already leave?

1822
02:15:09,661 --> 02:15:10,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief left already.

1823
02:15:12,427 --> 02:15:16,888
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there's barely enough parking for the three-family there.

1824
02:15:17,108 --> 02:15:28,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Never mind, you're going to add four more people, which might be four more cars, five more cars in an area that just cannot handle any more cars or any more people.

1825
02:15:29,951 --> 02:15:35,692
[SPEAKER_21]: And I say, as these two families continue to sell, people are going to want to take the two, make it a three.

1826
02:15:36,072 --> 02:15:37,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Three is going to want to go to a four.

1827
02:15:37,732 --> 02:15:40,013
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, Stern's Ave just sold for $8.90, a two-family.

1828
02:15:42,642 --> 02:15:45,484
[SPEAKER_21]: to a person who works up at Tufts.

1829
02:15:45,564 --> 02:15:54,428
[SPEAKER_21]: It's only a matter of time before the gentleman's on it, before the appeals board, that's going to want to tear that down, or make that a fire family.

1830
02:15:55,789 --> 02:16:06,174
[SPEAKER_21]: So I say, I think the time has come where we need to send a message to the appeal boards that next week, you better look hard and fast on these,

1831
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:13,181
[SPEAKER_21]: As they say, as fast as they start coming, as the train gets closer, they're going to come further.

1832
02:16:13,521 --> 02:16:16,202
[SPEAKER_21]: And once it gets over the college, you're going to see the hillside.

1833
02:16:16,242 --> 02:16:18,382
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, can you fit a little car on the hillside?

1834
02:16:18,402 --> 02:16:19,923
[SPEAKER_21]: Or can you fit another apartment on the hillside?

1835
02:16:20,623 --> 02:16:22,463
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, these people, I mean, listen, it's good.

1836
02:16:23,023 --> 02:16:25,624
[SPEAKER_21]: It's good for the, you know, if you want to cash out, it's good.

1837
02:16:25,664 --> 02:16:28,125
[SPEAKER_21]: But we're fast losing our neighborhoods.

1838
02:16:28,825 --> 02:16:29,825
[SPEAKER_21]: There'll be no more neighborhoods.

1839
02:16:30,225 --> 02:16:32,826
[SPEAKER_21]: There'll be just, we'll be a city of transients.

1840
02:16:33,026 --> 02:16:36,347
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why people come in, students, and I say, I mean,

1841
02:16:37,923 --> 02:16:41,785
[SPEAKER_21]: There's five generations of my family that have been in this city.

1842
02:16:43,866 --> 02:16:47,548
[SPEAKER_21]: That won't be happening much if this continues at this pace.

1843
02:16:48,468 --> 02:16:51,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to make a recommendation to the Board of Appeals?

1844
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:54,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I plan on going to this meeting next week also during that one.

1845
02:16:54,271 --> 02:16:56,372
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make a recommendation?

1846
02:16:56,392 --> 02:17:07,497
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to make a recommendation that they either maybe look at maybe some type of moratorium or some type of, before they approve,

1847
02:17:08,863 --> 02:17:14,546
[SPEAKER_21]: Any more of these, maybe we should be kept more in the loop in this.

1848
02:17:15,006 --> 02:17:22,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Recommend that the Board of Appeals put a moratorium until the matter is discussed with the City Council?

1849
02:17:22,710 --> 02:17:22,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1850
02:17:26,712 --> 02:17:27,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso.

1851
02:17:27,573 --> 02:17:27,913
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1852
02:17:29,670 --> 02:17:40,218
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with a lot of the sentiments of Councilor Caraviello, but I also know there are a lot of two and three families that have significant amount of parking right on their own property.

1853
02:17:40,859 --> 02:17:44,462
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is a new way of life.

1854
02:17:44,902 --> 02:17:46,363
[SPEAKER_19]: People don't want the big homes anymore.

1855
02:17:46,403 --> 02:17:48,605
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to buy a smaller condominium.

1856
02:17:49,786 --> 02:17:52,668
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just think the Board of Appeals has to look at each individual cases.

1857
02:17:53,489 --> 02:17:57,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Similar to a few years ago when the Meadow Glen Mall sign came up, and I'm not far of those big signs.

1858
02:17:58,234 --> 02:18:01,816
[SPEAKER_19]: But in certain areas, I think they're actually good and they bring business.

1859
02:18:02,497 --> 02:18:11,843
[SPEAKER_19]: But to tell someone that there's a moratorium in place, and if they have 7,500 square feet and they can fit the appropriate parking and-.

1860
02:18:12,743 --> 02:18:21,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe moratorium might be the wrong word, but at least we look at the rules that go with the granting of these

1861
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:24,190
[SPEAKER_20]: changes.

1862
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:29,492
[SPEAKER_19]: But a lot of times the conversions, I think the conversions and the board of appeals are two separate things.

1863
02:18:30,292 --> 02:18:39,796
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, a lot of times you don't even have to go to the board of appeals to convert to a, if you already own a two family, it's more or less just going to the building department and condo eyes in it.

1864
02:18:39,936 --> 02:18:43,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to have converting two to two, two to five.

1865
02:18:43,637 --> 02:18:47,118
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, two is going to go to three, three is going to go to four.

1866
02:18:47,438 --> 02:18:52,920
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, but some of them, a three family is going to could have six cars in there.

1867
02:18:53,182 --> 02:18:53,942
[SPEAKER_20]: But I understand that.

1868
02:18:54,002 --> 02:19:03,345
[SPEAKER_19]: But also, there are some buildings throughout our community that are currently zoned for more than the units that they have.

1869
02:19:03,425 --> 02:19:05,585
[SPEAKER_19]: They may have a zoning for a six-family.

1870
02:19:05,945 --> 02:19:10,927
[SPEAKER_19]: At the end of Irving Street, at the corner of Irving and Placestead, you've got six or seven units in that building.

1871
02:19:11,527 --> 02:19:12,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, is it appropriate?

1872
02:19:13,707 --> 02:19:14,948
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's conforming use.

1873
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:16,208
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a conforming use.

1874
02:19:16,837 --> 02:19:26,303
[SPEAKER_19]: And I agree with you that we have to actually take a long, hard look at it, but I think we have to leave it in the Board of Appeals hands, and they have to look at it individually.

1875
02:19:26,723 --> 02:19:34,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Because there are certain lots and properties within the community that take a blighted area, for instance.

1876
02:19:35,949 --> 02:19:45,596
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd rather have maybe a three or four family than the one family that's run as a rental place.

1877
02:19:46,547 --> 02:20:00,635
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, I think, I just think the Board of Appeals right now is in a total, it's a good, it's a good, not it's a good, it's the only avenue where they can go and look at it realistically, too.

1878
02:20:01,656 --> 02:20:10,521
[SPEAKER_19]: They are very, I'd say that they deny more than they approve developments and conversions in the city.

1879
02:20:11,061 --> 02:20:12,722
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'd like to know the statistics on it, too,

1880
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:17,552
[SPEAKER_19]: How many of these properties have actually made it to the Board of Appeals and were approved?

1881
02:20:17,572 --> 02:20:18,972
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, sir.

1882
02:20:19,593 --> 02:20:21,173
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, that's something that I'd like to know.

1883
02:20:23,374 --> 02:20:24,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta.

1884
02:20:25,535 --> 02:20:32,739
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree somewhat with Councilor Camuso, but, you know, the Board of Appeals has a statutory autonomy, so to speak, to make their own decisions.

1885
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:40,323
[SPEAKER_17]: But the council has a right to interject what its concerns might be in a particular neighbourhood or a particular section.

1886
02:20:41,343 --> 02:20:43,104
[SPEAKER_17]: We can jump over to another location

1887
02:20:43,835 --> 02:20:51,717
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on Winthrop Street, right opposite the gas station, where across the street they want to put 11 houses into a four-home unit area over there.

1888
02:20:51,737 --> 02:20:53,798
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't know how they're going to do it, whatever it might be.

1889
02:20:54,518 --> 02:20:57,319
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a true encroachment in a particular neighborhood.

1890
02:20:57,339 --> 02:21:02,220
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the residents don't want it, or they're not even aware of it because

1891
02:21:03,586 --> 02:21:08,730
[SPEAKER_17]: They just don't either have the time to be bothered with it or to be involved with it.

1892
02:21:08,930 --> 02:21:14,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you know, we do have a responsibility if something we feel needs to be communicated to any particular board.

1893
02:21:15,155 --> 02:21:20,439
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, one of the benefits of getting all these notices when these board meetings are, we see what the agendas might be.

1894
02:21:20,499 --> 02:21:27,565
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of these agendas have worked out for the purposes of having a council go to them and find out what's going on or express their interest.

1895
02:21:28,085 --> 02:21:31,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I know Councilor Caraviello, this won't be the first time,

1896
02:21:32,468 --> 02:21:46,775
[SPEAKER_17]: that he would have an interest at the Board of Appeals because, and rightfully so, he had an interest in a piece of property in the West Medford area where the legitimacy of why the building was being sold and what was going to be proposed to be put there was not one and the same.

1897
02:21:47,735 --> 02:21:52,698
[SPEAKER_17]: And because of his interaction at the board and with the neighborhood, it helped resolve the problem.

1898
02:21:52,778 --> 02:21:59,421
[SPEAKER_17]: So what was going to originally go up and what became after the fact did not really come to fruition.

1899
02:21:59,781 --> 02:22:02,062
[SPEAKER_17]: And this might be a combination of the same thing.

1900
02:22:02,998 --> 02:22:05,681
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think anybody should be dissuaded from going to any meeting.

1901
02:22:06,081 --> 02:22:14,588
[SPEAKER_17]: City Council, Board of Appeals, Public Health, Water and Soil Commission meeting, whatever it might be, because if you have your opinion, what difference does it make if you're an elected official or not?

1902
02:22:14,888 --> 02:22:26,658
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're going as an elected official expressing your opinion, but more importantly, people have expressed their concern to you, and that's the reason why you're going, well, to some degree, that adds some weight, I would assume, in any particular meeting.

1903
02:22:27,179 --> 02:22:30,942
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what the board members are there for, to listen to all the opinions that people might have.

1904
02:22:31,528 --> 02:22:37,351
[SPEAKER_17]: While they might be autonomous to make their own decision, they're not precluded from listening to other people's decisions.

1905
02:22:37,691 --> 02:22:38,252
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll strike that.

1906
02:22:38,492 --> 02:22:41,654
[SPEAKER_17]: They should not be precluded from listening to other people's decisions.

1907
02:22:42,054 --> 02:22:48,837
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the reason why we're elected, to listen to the people, hear what they have to say, go to a meeting if we want to go, and express our concerns.

1908
02:22:49,438 --> 02:22:51,239
[SPEAKER_17]: So I agree with you, Councilor Caraviello.

1909
02:22:51,699 --> 02:22:57,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think there's anything wrong with going to the meeting, expressing your opinion, even if it's contrary to all three members of the board.

1910
02:22:57,582 --> 02:22:59,003
[SPEAKER_17]: At least you were there to say what you felt.

1911
02:23:01,295 --> 02:23:02,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1912
02:23:03,417 --> 02:23:09,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think it's time that we start protecting the integrity of our neighborhoods because otherwise they're going to cease to become neighborhoods.

1913
02:23:10,583 --> 02:23:13,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Just going to become landing spots that people just move in and out.

1914
02:23:14,546 --> 02:23:15,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1915
02:23:15,767 --> 02:23:17,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1916
02:23:17,108 --> 02:23:19,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this matter forward.

1917
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:26,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I understand your concerns, I do feel as though we need to really respect the autonomy of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1918
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:30,542
[SPEAKER_11]: and their process should be undue from political interference and influence.

1919
02:23:31,622 --> 02:23:37,005
[SPEAKER_11]: With that being said, I think that Councilor Caraviello raises some great concerns about the situation that's going on there.

1920
02:23:37,805 --> 02:23:54,153
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I think the proper course of action for this council to take would be to take a look at the current zoning ordinances and then maybe make recommendations to revise the current existing zoning ordinances that governs their operations as opposed to making recommendations to them that fall well within their scope and purview, Madam President.

1921
02:24:03,430 --> 02:24:04,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1922
02:24:04,691 --> 02:24:05,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1923
02:24:05,051 --> 02:24:07,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to agree with Mr. Caraviello.

1924
02:24:08,633 --> 02:24:29,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you go to South Medford, they are crowded and maybe the answer is what Mr. Knight is saying is maybe I don't understand the process, but I do agree with Mr. Caraviello's line of thought, which is that the crowded, the more crowded you become, the more cars on the street, the more stress it puts on the fire department, on the teachers, on the schools, you have more people.

1925
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:33,227
[SPEAKER_00]: more people that aren't related.

1926
02:24:34,129 --> 02:24:39,682
[SPEAKER_00]: These two family houses that are getting rented have three non-relatives living in three different bedrooms.

1927
02:24:40,453 --> 02:24:42,254
[SPEAKER_00]: They have three different cars per unit.

1928
02:24:43,795 --> 02:24:46,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It just causes a lot of congestion, and I absolutely agree.

1929
02:24:46,597 --> 02:24:51,499
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe the right way to approach it is what Mr. Knight is saying, is to go in.

1930
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:56,262
[SPEAKER_00]: But the federal laws came in under 40B, and they get away with stuff anyway.

1931
02:24:56,362 --> 02:25:01,485
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the towers, domestic valley towers came in under 40B.

1932
02:25:01,525 --> 02:25:02,866
[SPEAKER_00]: You had the 40B over there.

1933
02:25:03,426 --> 02:25:07,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And when 40B came in, the towers, it was regulated very strongly for 30 years.

1934
02:25:08,909 --> 02:25:13,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they got through their contract, now it's open to the general public.

1935
02:25:13,853 --> 02:25:17,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have three, often three non-related people living in the same apartment.

1936
02:25:18,215 --> 02:25:22,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you have a lot of, and they do, they're like roommates to each other.

1937
02:25:22,398 --> 02:25:23,319
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not families.

1938
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:26,561
[SPEAKER_00]: In some areas that's okay, they can absorb it.

1939
02:25:27,742 --> 02:25:34,447
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly in certain parts of the city, there's a saturation point at which it becomes a problem.

1940
02:25:34,907 --> 02:25:36,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to make people aware of that.

1941
02:25:36,785 --> 02:25:42,271
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're living in North Medford and you have a couple of houses that, you know, are party central, that's okay because it can be absorbed.

1942
02:25:42,571 --> 02:25:49,318
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a couple of houses that are party central in South Medford, it's not going to be absorbed because there's already enough congestion.

1943
02:25:49,792 --> 02:25:50,973
[SPEAKER_00]: The roads are more congested.

1944
02:25:50,993 --> 02:25:52,694
[SPEAKER_00]: The cars make an impact.

1945
02:25:53,134 --> 02:25:58,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd just like to say that it puts a stress on the city, so it is a city issue.

1946
02:25:59,037 --> 02:26:06,202
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, every week, I get a letter in the mail from a retailer, a real estate person, ready to sell my house.

1947
02:26:06,862 --> 02:26:07,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is hot.

1948
02:26:07,803 --> 02:26:08,623
[SPEAKER_00]: The market is hot.

1949
02:26:09,063 --> 02:26:11,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that some people would love for me to move out of the city, but that's another story.

1950
02:26:12,465 --> 02:26:14,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.

1951
02:26:15,687 --> 02:26:16,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.

1952
02:26:16,948 --> 02:26:18,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping you guys as honest as I can.

1953
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:26,736
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, no, seriously, the market is hot, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have some kind of cap.

1954
02:26:27,197 --> 02:26:34,403
[SPEAKER_00]: How we come about that, how we come to that conclusion on how to put controls on that is up for debate.

1955
02:26:34,883 --> 02:26:38,686
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sentiment that he's talking about, I'm absolutely positive with.

1956
02:26:39,127 --> 02:26:39,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1957
02:26:44,178 --> 02:26:45,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1958
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:55,706
[SPEAKER_14]: As someone who lives in close proximity to the property in question, I have grave concerns for that as well.

1959
02:26:56,427 --> 02:27:02,591
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm intimately associated with the congestion we experience in South Medford.

1960
02:27:03,091 --> 02:27:12,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also intimately aware of so much of the change that's happened there and the changing real estate market there.

1961
02:27:13,352 --> 02:27:25,420
[SPEAKER_14]: and the possibility that people of moderate to low income will find it difficult to live in that neighborhood, those people who are most in need of use of public transportation.

1962
02:27:27,101 --> 02:27:38,328
[SPEAKER_14]: That being said, I'm unclear as to what obligation or restrictions are upon us as councillors when we speak before these boards.

1963
02:27:39,060 --> 02:27:43,703
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that we have to be clear to it and clear about it before we do that.

1964
02:27:44,724 --> 02:28:04,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Furthermore, I would want to be very respectful towards the autonomy of that board in particular, which prides itself and by its constitution ought to be free from inappropriate influence and encumbrance.

1965
02:28:05,298 --> 02:28:29,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying that your motion, Councilor Caraviello, is in any way an encumbrance, but until I am clear on what it is, because for some reason I have in the back of my head from doing those tedious ethics examinations we have to do,

1966
02:28:30,307 --> 02:28:39,150
[SPEAKER_14]: that really the examples that they give us, the case studies that they give us to complete really aren't all that clear either.

1967
02:28:42,191 --> 02:28:50,694
[SPEAKER_14]: There seems to be something there that when we appear before a board, that there's something attached to that.

1968
02:28:50,714 --> 02:28:53,195
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

1969
02:28:53,536 --> 02:28:55,576
[SPEAKER_21]: As an elected official, I can go to any meeting.

1970
02:28:55,836 --> 02:28:57,157
[SPEAKER_21]: I can go there as a regular citizen.

1971
02:28:58,279 --> 02:29:01,200
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I'm putting any undue influence on them.

1972
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:06,481
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's my right to protect the integrity of that neighborhood.

1973
02:29:06,841 --> 02:29:14,163
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the term affordable housing over there is going to be nonexistent.

1974
02:29:14,383 --> 02:29:19,784
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I'm going to say anything, no one's threatening the board.

1975
02:29:20,364 --> 02:29:24,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm entitled to my opinion as an elected official of the city.

1976
02:29:29,328 --> 02:29:36,530
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I've gone to those meetings before, and I have the right to speak my opinion as an ordinary citizen.

1977
02:29:38,331 --> 02:29:39,791
[SPEAKER_21]: I've gone to many board meetings.

1978
02:29:41,312 --> 02:29:42,712
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right, give my name and address to the record.

1979
02:29:45,393 --> 02:29:46,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1980
02:29:49,195 --> 02:29:49,995
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1981
02:29:50,035 --> 02:29:53,076
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for offering this resolution.

1982
02:29:55,391 --> 02:30:03,897
[SPEAKER_23]: The council is stating, and I won't speak for him, is he sees the neighborhoods in the very fabric of what makes up our individual neighborhoods being changed.

1983
02:30:04,718 --> 02:30:10,622
[SPEAKER_23]: And clearly, the market in the city of Medford has changed over the last several years.

1984
02:30:10,742 --> 02:30:14,344
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think we as a council have to get ahead of the curve.

1985
02:30:15,105 --> 02:30:20,308
[SPEAKER_23]: And we are the legislative body in this community and in charge of zoning.

1986
02:30:21,269 --> 02:30:23,871
[SPEAKER_23]: That may be the appropriate place for this to appear.

1987
02:30:25,228 --> 02:30:27,669
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I support this wholeheartedly.

1988
02:30:28,549 --> 02:30:36,792
[SPEAKER_23]: I also think we have to take one step further and look at illegal apartments, illegal apartments in the community.

1989
02:30:37,272 --> 02:30:42,233
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there are more illegal apartments in this city than what we realize.

1990
02:30:42,974 --> 02:30:53,517
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you want to talk about having more cars on the street and so forth, and people living in situations that may be dangerous because they fall under the radar of

1991
02:30:53,973 --> 02:30:56,335
[SPEAKER_23]: certain ordinances and state laws and so forth.

1992
02:30:57,036 --> 02:31:00,679
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, that to me is an issue that has to be examined also.

1993
02:31:00,779 --> 02:31:11,248
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think it's about time that the zoning board, uh, actually not the zoning board, the, uh, zoning subcommittee get together and start discussing some of these issues, Madam President.

1994
02:31:11,288 --> 02:31:21,877
[SPEAKER_23]: So, uh, if my council colleague wouldn't mind, I think that may be the appropriate first step of this, uh, to refer this to the zoning subcommittee for further action, Madam President.

1995
02:31:25,658 --> 02:31:37,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam President, a few weeks ago, we had a little bit of a discussion on the council floor, but firstly, I want to get back to Councilor Caraviello's resolution as it relates to the fabric of the neighborhood, as Councilor Marks has alluded to.

1996
02:31:38,825 --> 02:31:41,186
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think there's anything wrong with going to any board of appeals.

1997
02:31:41,806 --> 02:31:43,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been there many times through the years.

1998
02:31:43,367 --> 02:31:46,168
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been to many boards during the courses of the year.

1999
02:31:46,508 --> 02:31:54,172
[SPEAKER_17]: I've gone and spoken as a citizen and as an elected official, and 90% of the time when I've gone, I've been recognized as an elected official in the city.

2000
02:31:54,590 --> 02:31:57,231
[SPEAKER_17]: but coming to speak on the matter whether I was pro or con.

2001
02:31:57,972 --> 02:32:01,213
[SPEAKER_17]: So what makes that any different than a few weeks ago before this council?

2002
02:32:01,894 --> 02:32:14,720
[SPEAKER_17]: We were asked to vote and participate on a private outside contractor who works at Tufts University, their custodial staff, we were asked to take a vote to support them.

2003
02:32:15,446 --> 02:32:17,927
[SPEAKER_17]: as it relates to them not losing their jobs.

2004
02:32:18,307 --> 02:32:19,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Something entirely different.

2005
02:32:20,287 --> 02:32:23,508
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got nothing to do with the Medford City Council.

2006
02:32:23,548 --> 02:32:26,568
[SPEAKER_17]: We were led to believe they were Tufts University employees.

2007
02:32:26,608 --> 02:32:28,869
[SPEAKER_17]: They were outside paid contractors.

2008
02:32:28,949 --> 02:32:33,030
[SPEAKER_17]: And by being outside paid contractors, further removed from the whole issue.

2009
02:32:33,290 --> 02:32:34,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And what did we do?

2010
02:32:34,330 --> 02:32:35,610
[SPEAKER_17]: We took a vote to support them.

2011
02:32:36,130 --> 02:32:45,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And something right here in our own building, something that represents the heartbeat of this community where people live, we're going to be precluded from going to any board

2012
02:32:45,528 --> 02:32:51,113
[SPEAKER_17]: or any meeting and talking to them because we're doing something wrong, we're strong-arming them, you're not.

2013
02:32:51,454 --> 02:32:52,254
[SPEAKER_17]: What is your opinion?

2014
02:32:52,675 --> 02:32:53,696
[SPEAKER_17]: What does an opinion mean?

2015
02:32:53,756 --> 02:32:58,881
[SPEAKER_17]: It means to offer what you think in your mind, what the situation might be and what you might want it to be.

2016
02:32:59,281 --> 02:33:03,865
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to look at the zoning ordinances and look at the criteria and the priority that it needs to take.

2017
02:33:04,146 --> 02:33:05,607
[SPEAKER_17]: If you need some revision, so be it.

2018
02:33:06,749 --> 02:33:10,073
[SPEAKER_17]: But to say we're gonna check the zoning first before we even go forward?

2019
02:33:10,533 --> 02:33:12,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely, absolutely ridiculous.

2020
02:33:13,217 --> 02:33:15,360
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the most ridiculous thing that I could hear of.

2021
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:23,790
[SPEAKER_17]: You're making it sound like we have to just stay in this particular room and we can't go to before any board, any meeting, any commission because it's undue influence.

2022
02:33:23,811 --> 02:33:24,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's absurd.

2023
02:33:25,362 --> 02:33:26,363
[SPEAKER_17]: absolutely absurd.

2024
02:33:26,823 --> 02:33:42,114
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just as absurd as the vote we took that night to go out of our way to protect outside employees contracted by Tufts University, not even their own employees who we thought that was happening, and we took a vote to make sure to try to protect them to keep their jobs.

2025
02:33:46,888 --> 02:33:49,370
[SPEAKER_19]: That evening, I believe the company was, was it DTZ?

2026
02:33:50,030 --> 02:33:52,232
[SPEAKER_19]: We were well aware that it was a contracted company.

2027
02:33:52,752 --> 02:33:59,978
[SPEAKER_19]: They got up here and represented themselves as a contracted company and members of SEIU, Service Employees International United.

2028
02:34:01,079 --> 02:34:04,321
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I understand they're not employees at Tufts Universities, but it doesn't matter.

2029
02:34:04,541 --> 02:34:06,623
[SPEAKER_19]: We would try to, we would try to, no it doesn't.

2030
02:34:06,723 --> 02:34:13,328
[SPEAKER_19]: So what, if they were Tufts University employees, we don't want them getting laid off, but because they have to work, because they happen to work for an outside entity, we, okay, let them go.

2031
02:34:13,764 --> 02:34:16,745
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I don't see any difference in that at all.

2032
02:34:18,805 --> 02:34:26,367
[SPEAKER_17]: President, should we be aware of the fact that in our sheriff's department, they may want to lay off employees, and we should take a vote to make sure that the sheriff keeps all the employees?

2033
02:34:26,687 --> 02:34:28,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Should we do that in every agency that's going out there?

2034
02:34:29,387 --> 02:34:31,508
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to discuss it because that's my place of employment.

2035
02:34:31,528 --> 02:34:32,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's your place of employment.

2036
02:34:32,788 --> 02:34:36,129
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you were going to get laid off, you'd like to have somebody be there to support you, wouldn't you?

2037
02:34:37,055 --> 02:34:42,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Once again, once again, the more Councilor Penta talks, he backs up what I'm trying to say.

2038
02:34:42,620 --> 02:34:45,042
[SPEAKER_19]: It's twice this evening you've done what I've tried to say.

2039
02:34:45,602 --> 02:34:51,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Earlier in the evening, you contradicted me, and then in the end, you end up agreeing with me.

2040
02:34:52,909 --> 02:34:55,251
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's kind of, I find it kind of comical.

2041
02:34:55,571 --> 02:35:03,738
[SPEAKER_19]: But with that being said, Madam President, with this particular issue, I would like to, the motion before us is to discuss it.

2042
02:35:04,223 --> 02:35:05,864
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's been plenty of discussion.

2043
02:35:05,884 --> 02:35:09,006
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if the council is going to bring forward a motion other than this.

2044
02:35:09,427 --> 02:35:27,639
[SPEAKER_19]: But to go one step further, I know firsthand from going to the Board of Appeals over the years and following the rulings and stuff, and I'm sure you know this as well as a congratulations being one of the top female attorneys in the area, by the way.

2045
02:35:27,919 --> 02:35:29,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2046
02:35:29,823 --> 02:35:37,306
[SPEAKER_19]: But with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I'd like to find out how many of these were approved over the years.

2047
02:35:37,967 --> 02:35:38,847
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say it's less than 12.

2048
02:35:39,607 --> 02:35:51,633
[SPEAKER_19]: So for us to sit here and say it's changing the fabric of our entire community, matter of fact, we had someone, and I'm not going to use the name, but was going for one of these who worked for the United States Senator's office.

2049
02:35:51,673 --> 02:35:53,154
[SPEAKER_19]: At the time, it was a congressman's office.

2050
02:35:53,634 --> 02:35:54,394
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was denied.

2051
02:35:55,155 --> 02:35:55,835
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was denied.

2052
02:35:57,565 --> 02:35:59,627
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is not a major problem.

2053
02:35:59,888 --> 02:36:03,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, this particular one, I don't know where 198 and 202 Harvard Street is.

2054
02:36:03,271 --> 02:36:04,152
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to get into that.

2055
02:36:04,172 --> 02:36:08,597
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to discuss it prior to going down and maybe looking at the property and everything else.

2056
02:36:09,358 --> 02:36:12,381
[SPEAKER_19]: But with that being said, the Board of Appeals, I think it's incumbent upon us.

2057
02:36:13,424 --> 02:36:38,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Rather than to sit here and say it's changing the fact the the character of all our neighborhoods I think we have to ask the question How many of these were approved over say the last 10 years and if it's more than a dozen, I will be shocked shocked in a city of our size I'm pretty sure it's less than a dozen because they are very very strict and anyone that knows anything about the Board of Appeals There's only a few criteria

2058
02:36:39,058 --> 02:36:41,059
[SPEAKER_19]: that they can actually approve something.

2059
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:44,142
[SPEAKER_19]: One is when it's created a hardship, I believe.

2060
02:36:44,762 --> 02:36:46,323
[SPEAKER_19]: And what's the other one, Mr. Clerk?

2061
02:36:46,343 --> 02:36:47,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you know off the top of your head?

2062
02:36:47,744 --> 02:36:49,586
[SPEAKER_19]: It's if there's a financial hardship.

2063
02:36:51,567 --> 02:36:52,247
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the main one.

2064
02:36:56,167 --> 02:37:02,152
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think we spent 45 minutes on an issue that Councilor Caraviello is probably right.

2065
02:37:02,312 --> 02:37:03,574
[SPEAKER_19]: I know he does his due diligence.

2066
02:37:03,594 --> 02:37:06,356
[SPEAKER_19]: He drives around more than any councillors that sit here.

2067
02:37:07,137 --> 02:37:09,999
[SPEAKER_19]: And he checks out all the properties that he brings up and stuff.

2068
02:37:10,499 --> 02:37:15,283
[SPEAKER_19]: So as I said, I'd like to reserve my judgment on that particular matter.

2069
02:37:15,804 --> 02:37:22,770
[SPEAKER_19]: But with that being said, I'd like to make a motion, if you don't mind, on how many of these were actually approved in the last 10 fiscal years.

2070
02:37:24,008 --> 02:37:31,794
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we can actually tell if there's a major problem in the community, and we should be putting in some sort of zoning ordinance or zoning law.

2071
02:37:32,695 --> 02:37:36,597
[SPEAKER_19]: But knowing that board, I will be shocked, like I said, if it's more than a dozen.

2072
02:37:36,938 --> 02:37:40,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I get more phone calls of the projects that get denied.

2073
02:37:41,421 --> 02:37:48,006
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes they're legitimate reasons, but just the hardship or whatever criteria that needs to be met is not met.

2074
02:37:48,586 --> 02:37:53,370
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know Attorney Arena, he is so tight when it comes to ethical standards.

2075
02:37:55,362 --> 02:37:57,163
[SPEAKER_19]: It's amazing, so.

2076
02:38:11,967 --> 02:38:13,087
[SPEAKER_11]: By address, Madam President.

2077
02:38:13,628 --> 02:38:20,590
[SPEAKER_11]: If we're going to get a listing from the last 10 years, we want to get them by address so we can see what pockets of the city these changes are happening in as well.

2078
02:38:20,610 --> 02:38:22,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no problem requesting the information,

2079
02:38:22,873 --> 02:38:26,355
[SPEAKER_11]: My concern is the fact that we're the legislative body that actually makes the zoning ordinances.

2080
02:38:26,435 --> 02:38:30,077
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a zoning ordinance that gives the Zoning Board of Appeals this power.

2081
02:38:30,417 --> 02:38:32,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're telling them, don't exercise that power because we said so?

2082
02:38:33,039 --> 02:38:33,779
[SPEAKER_11]: We gave them the power.

2083
02:38:33,859 --> 02:38:36,400
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want to take it away, we can take it away, but there's a process to do that.

2084
02:38:36,741 --> 02:38:38,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying that Councilor Caraviello is doing something wrong.

2085
02:38:38,942 --> 02:38:39,582
[SPEAKER_11]: He's doing his job.

2086
02:38:39,602 --> 02:38:42,544
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going out there and he's exercising his due diligence, which he does every day.

2087
02:38:42,924 --> 02:38:44,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand exactly where he's coming from.

2088
02:38:44,685 --> 02:38:46,766
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly have concerns for the fabric of the neighborhood, too.

2089
02:38:47,547 --> 02:38:49,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly have concerns for the fabric of the neighborhood.

2090
02:38:49,729 --> 02:38:52,031
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that there's a proper process that's in place.

2091
02:38:52,071 --> 02:38:53,692
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't want to run rush out over the process.

2092
02:38:54,153 --> 02:39:02,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly don't want to make any steps that are going to put us in a position to be politicizing an issue that shouldn't be politicizing, or politicizing a process that shouldn't be politicized.

2093
02:39:03,321 --> 02:39:05,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where I'm coming from, Madam President.

2094
02:39:05,162 --> 02:39:06,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Insofar as the Tufts University situation,

2095
02:39:07,147 --> 02:39:09,067
[SPEAKER_11]: The Tufts University is a resident of the city of Bedford.

2096
02:39:09,707 --> 02:39:12,848
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have any oversight control or dictation over their operations.

2097
02:39:13,048 --> 02:39:21,129
[SPEAKER_11]: We can make recommendations and we can make suggestions, but the zoning board of appeals and the rules and regulations that they fall under and that they are there to enforce are created by us.

2098
02:39:21,730 --> 02:39:22,290
[SPEAKER_11]: We make them up.

2099
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:23,610
[SPEAKER_11]: We're the ones that make them.

2100
02:39:23,870 --> 02:39:25,050
[SPEAKER_11]: We make the zoning ordinances.

2101
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:27,691
[SPEAKER_11]: We're the body that creates the zoning ordinances.

2102
02:39:28,111 --> 02:39:31,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're going to tell them which ordinances to pay attention to and which ones not to?

2103
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:33,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some concern about that.

2104
02:39:33,472 --> 02:39:36,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly do question whether or not it's undue political influence.

2105
02:39:36,672 --> 02:39:40,114
[SPEAKER_11]: With that being said, Madam President, it's no criticism of Councilor Caraviello or his efforts.

2106
02:39:40,174 --> 02:39:43,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that he's raised a good issue and it's a good issue to discuss.

2107
02:39:43,576 --> 02:39:53,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we as a body have a duty now to sit down and figure out what course of action we want to take in order to ensure that the fabric of the neighborhood is protected and that the process remains a process that's free from undue influence.

2108
02:39:57,784 --> 02:40:05,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Why would you want to sit down and discuss the ordinances now after Councilor Caraviello brought up something that's a concern if you don't think it's a concern until the Board of Appeals?

2109
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:09,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to disagree with all of you except with this particular issue.

2110
02:40:09,892 --> 02:40:11,393
[SPEAKER_17]: One house can tear down a neighborhood.

2111
02:40:11,773 --> 02:40:12,994
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a house on Forest Street.

2112
02:40:14,134 --> 02:40:16,175
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to leave the number and the location nameless.

2113
02:40:16,856 --> 02:40:18,797
[SPEAKER_17]: And that house turned out to be a crack house.

2114
02:40:19,297 --> 02:40:22,159
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was causing a tremendous amount of problem.

2115
02:40:22,599 --> 02:40:27,222
[SPEAKER_17]: So to say that one house or any house, you don't need a quantitative number.

2116
02:40:27,242 --> 02:40:28,782
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't have to be 12, 15, or 20.

2117
02:40:28,942 --> 02:40:31,904
[SPEAKER_17]: It can take just one house to bring down a neighborhood.

2118
02:40:32,264 --> 02:40:33,345
[SPEAKER_17]: And this house almost did it.

2119
02:40:39,034 --> 02:40:50,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I requested the addresses of the homes because I wanted to see if there was any type of trend or any type of cluster in a certain neighborhood or a certain area where these requests have been made and then later issued.

2120
02:40:51,346 --> 02:40:55,069
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was why I asked that the address should be there, so that we can see and we can track it.

2121
02:40:55,875 --> 02:40:58,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, five requests came in, we approved two of them, and that's it.

2122
02:40:58,096 --> 02:40:59,236
[SPEAKER_11]: We still don't know where these houses were.

2123
02:40:59,256 --> 02:41:00,256
[SPEAKER_11]: We still don't know where it happened.

2124
02:41:00,616 --> 02:41:02,377
[SPEAKER_11]: We still don't know if it happened in a blighted area.

2125
02:41:02,437 --> 02:41:04,878
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know if it happened in an area that was suitable for it.

2126
02:41:05,038 --> 02:41:12,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, one area that I think of is right off of High Street, across from Essex Street, where they knocked down a dentist office and they built seven homes.

2127
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:13,380
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

2128
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:15,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven $600,000 homes, all on the tax rolls.

2129
02:41:16,241 --> 02:41:18,142
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just something to look at.

2130
02:41:18,182 --> 02:41:19,302
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I'm saying, Madam President.

2131
02:41:32,834 --> 02:41:46,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, about a month or two ago, we had a detective from the Medford Police Department here, and to say a crack house can pop up, we have these problems in every single neighborhood in this city.

2132
02:41:47,202 --> 02:41:52,244
[SPEAKER_19]: Every single neighborhood in this city, we have problems when it comes to people selling drugs out of a certain house.

2133
02:41:52,865 --> 02:41:54,886
[SPEAKER_19]: So to say it's as a result of these or that,

2134
02:41:58,328 --> 02:42:03,549
[SPEAKER_19]: what's the word, not when they condoize it, when it goes from a two to three, conversion, exactly, I'm sorry.

2135
02:42:04,849 --> 02:42:18,772
[SPEAKER_19]: To say that it's as a result of conversion, Forest Street may have been one particular case, but we've had a drug bust on Wareham Street, $40,000, a gun, heroin, and everything else within the last seven days.

2136
02:42:19,192 --> 02:42:22,552
[SPEAKER_19]: We have other drug busts within the last three or four months up in North Medford.

2137
02:42:24,033 --> 02:42:25,713
[SPEAKER_19]: The detective that was here a few weeks ago,

2138
02:42:26,244 --> 02:42:34,147
[SPEAKER_19]: talked about how each and every councillor, and he knows where all of us live, within walking distance of all of our own houses, there's been drug arrests from residents.

2139
02:42:37,668 --> 02:42:40,589
[SPEAKER_17]: You missed the point, because you say I'm following you, so maybe you should follow me.

2140
02:42:40,649 --> 02:42:45,570
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm talking about applications that go before the board, not houses that had nothing to do with the board.

2141
02:42:45,870 --> 02:42:47,631
[SPEAKER_17]: You just said they turn into crack houses.

2142
02:42:48,231 --> 02:42:50,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the application had to go before the board.

2143
02:42:50,832 --> 02:42:53,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Talking about applications that went before the board.

2144
02:42:53,053 --> 02:42:53,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'll tell you one thing.

2145
02:42:54,510 --> 02:43:13,600
[SPEAKER_19]: If I had a situation near my house where my family's growing up and it is a crack house and there was a potential for development to come in and make it maybe a two-family house or something else, I would go to the Board of Appeals and I would support the conversion with the hopes of having the crack house vacated.

2146
02:43:14,161 --> 02:43:18,343
[SPEAKER_19]: So in some cases, this is actually good.

2147
02:43:18,363 --> 02:43:19,183
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at Boynton Road.

2148
02:43:19,584 --> 02:43:22,085
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been talking about Boynton Road, number 56 Boynton Road.

2149
02:43:22,812 --> 02:43:31,476
[SPEAKER_19]: If there was a conversion that could take place that would be good in that neighborhood, I'm sure Mr. Crowley would be here and his neighbors to speak on behalf of it.

2150
02:43:32,276 --> 02:43:37,679
[SPEAKER_19]: But there is particular cases where you're better off taking a conversion than dealing with some of the nonsense that goes on.

2151
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:44,142
[SPEAKER_19]: I know in Councilor Caraviello's neighborhood, there's a house that there's overdoses in weekly, weekly.

2152
02:43:44,322 --> 02:43:45,322
[SPEAKER_19]: People going in and out.

2153
02:43:45,342 --> 02:43:48,864
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, Councilor Caraviello, what was it, two deaths or one death there?

2154
02:43:49,564 --> 02:43:50,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Two deaths.

2155
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:55,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure the neighbors would want that to be converted if someone came in and wanted to clean up the property.

2156
02:43:57,502 --> 02:43:57,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

2157
02:43:59,303 --> 02:44:07,905
[SPEAKER_19]: So there is cases that the Board of Appeals should take into consideration, and they have.

2158
02:44:08,665 --> 02:44:19,989
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to get that number, though, because I think we're all going to be surprised by the small, small amount of approvals for conversions from a single family or a two family or a three family.

2159
02:44:20,232 --> 02:44:22,793
[SPEAKER_19]: So any conversion higher, what's the question?

2160
02:44:22,813 --> 02:44:24,893
[SPEAKER_19]: We got to ask the actual question rather than get it back.

2161
02:44:24,913 --> 02:44:25,953
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't understand the question.

2162
02:44:26,693 --> 02:44:36,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Any conversion that added a different, an additional unit, a single to a, a single to a two, a two to a three, a three to a four.

2163
02:44:37,256 --> 02:44:37,436
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

2164
02:44:37,456 --> 02:44:46,378
[SPEAKER_21]: I, you know, I, I think we, I think this sort of, uh, it's been a little out of control.

2165
02:44:46,658 --> 02:44:47,578
[SPEAKER_21]: No one is saying that we,

2166
02:44:48,169 --> 02:44:50,990
[SPEAKER_21]: influence and the undue influence over the Appeal Board.

2167
02:44:52,111 --> 02:44:56,573
[SPEAKER_21]: Ten years ago, there wasn't two train stations coming in that neighborhood.

2168
02:44:57,013 --> 02:45:03,697
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, in the next five years or next few years, there's going to be a train station and there's going to be more people there.

2169
02:45:04,317 --> 02:45:09,299
[SPEAKER_21]: And as you can see, the properties are selling and you're going to see more people.

2170
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:11,921
[SPEAKER_21]: They're paying record prices.

2171
02:45:12,601 --> 02:45:16,463
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't charge enough money to support the record prices that they're paying.

2172
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:18,591
[SPEAKER_21]: And like I said, before the other one gets there.

2173
02:45:18,631 --> 02:45:24,495
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, there was no intent of undue influence on the Appeal Board.

2174
02:45:24,975 --> 02:45:32,360
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a matter of that there's going to be more and more of these coming forward in the next year or the next couple of years.

2175
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:34,662
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we need to keep our eye on it.

2176
02:45:35,582 --> 02:45:39,085
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the intent of this, not to influence the Appeal Board.

2177
02:45:40,365 --> 02:45:40,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2178
02:45:40,806 --> 02:45:41,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

2179
02:45:42,667 --> 02:45:44,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, in proposing in

2180
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:57,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Putting this question together, I think it would be very important that we clarify that it would be asking the Zoning Board of Appeals how many of those conversions occurred by way of approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

2181
02:45:59,484 --> 02:46:00,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So matters that were before them.

2182
02:46:01,726 --> 02:46:02,947
[SPEAKER_04]: By way of approval, correct.

2183
02:46:03,268 --> 02:46:03,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2184
02:46:06,918 --> 02:46:08,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, sorry.

2185
02:46:08,519 --> 02:46:08,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2186
02:46:08,999 --> 02:46:10,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.

2187
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:16,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to provide some information about the upcoming Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.

2188
02:46:16,162 --> 02:46:19,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It was referenced as potentially next week.

2189
02:46:19,164 --> 02:46:26,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It originally was scheduled for next week, the 26th of May, but it has been rescheduled for June 10th.

2190
02:46:26,367 --> 02:46:29,149
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 7 p.m.

2191
02:46:29,309 --> 02:46:30,229
[SPEAKER_02]: here in City Hall.

2192
02:46:30,849 --> 02:46:35,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to the Harvard Street project that was

2193
02:46:36,335 --> 02:46:40,937
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned there are four other projects on the agenda just for anybody who might be interested.

2194
02:46:41,718 --> 02:47:04,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the same actually Harvard street, uh, owner has a petition to, um, do some work at the 23 forest street, uh, building, which is across the street from the post office to, uh, convert that, uh, property from, uh, three residential dwellings, I think apartments and offices into, um, five condos and a retail space.

2195
02:47:05,182 --> 02:47:18,132
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a proposal to add two residential units to the building at 241 Boston Avenue, which is a commercial building near North Street.

2196
02:47:19,113 --> 02:47:30,061
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a petition to add a undersized parking space to 16 Dunbar Avenue, which is in the Haines Square area.

2197
02:47:30,702 --> 02:47:34,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a petition to operate a kennel

2198
02:47:35,884 --> 02:47:38,185
[SPEAKER_02]: on 168 Mystic Avenue.

2199
02:47:39,266 --> 02:47:46,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that's June 10th at seven o'clock here at City Hall for anybody that's interested in any of those projects.

2200
02:47:46,589 --> 02:47:47,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ken.

2201
02:47:50,031 --> 02:47:59,775
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting for the Winthrop Street development is before the Community Development Board tomorrow, the 20th here at 6.30.

2202
02:47:59,915 --> 02:48:00,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ken.

2203
02:48:08,336 --> 02:48:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record.

2204
02:48:09,897 --> 02:48:11,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario Martin, 18 Benton Road.

2205
02:48:12,639 --> 02:48:17,202
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually live pretty close to Harvard, so it's actually right on the corner.

2206
02:48:17,222 --> 02:48:24,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to thank, by the way, Councilor Gavriello for bringing up this important issue as a resident of Benton Road and Harvard Street.

2207
02:48:25,607 --> 02:48:26,408
[SPEAKER_12]: This does affect me.

2208
02:48:27,268 --> 02:48:32,312
[SPEAKER_12]: The question I have for the Council is actually if it's, as Councilor Camuso mentioned earlier,

2209
02:48:34,814 --> 02:48:42,560
[SPEAKER_12]: essentially difficult for zoning boards to approve conversions or additions, in this case, especially to a non-conforming home.

2210
02:48:44,381 --> 02:48:48,123
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we know that compliance is actually being enforced?

2211
02:48:48,644 --> 02:48:57,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning, how do we know landlords aren't actually going out and if they know they can't get it approved, how do we know that they're not doing it behind the back of the city?

2212
02:48:58,491 --> 02:48:59,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And how are we enforcing it?

2213
02:49:00,012 --> 02:49:00,212
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2214
02:49:00,592 --> 02:49:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2215
02:49:01,153 --> 02:49:01,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Camuso.

2216
02:49:03,034 --> 02:49:04,495
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that that's a good question.

2217
02:49:04,913 --> 02:49:06,354
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have a code enforcement department.

2218
02:49:06,374 --> 02:49:12,357
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of times, most of the complaints come from actual neighbors that will see additional vehicles and things of that nature.

2219
02:49:12,938 --> 02:49:29,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, as we all know, as city councilors, we don't find out all the time about these illegal units until it goes to sell or they're doing a home inspection or doing the appraisal for the taxes, which we're going through right now.

2220
02:49:31,115 --> 02:49:43,084
[SPEAKER_19]: City actually sends someone in the house and they're looking for stoves in the basement and stuff in the basement that would indicate that it's... But I'd say 90% of them, and we've heard this from our building department, comes from neighbors' complaints.

2221
02:49:44,766 --> 02:49:50,310
[SPEAKER_19]: So they do take them very serious when it does come up, but if they don't know, they can't do anything about it.

2222
02:49:50,330 --> 02:49:52,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, ma'am.

2223
02:49:52,952 --> 02:49:53,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2224
02:49:53,272 --> 02:49:55,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Cassidy.

2225
02:49:59,377 --> 02:49:59,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2226
02:50:00,771 --> 02:50:02,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Mass.

2227
02:50:04,092 --> 02:50:05,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make it brief as possible.

2228
02:50:06,153 --> 02:50:10,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Our city is getting more congested and it's getting worse.

2229
02:50:10,314 --> 02:50:11,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Caraviello, you're right.

2230
02:50:13,836 --> 02:50:20,038
[SPEAKER_01]: By right, a real estate owner, the way I understand it, can go do whatever they please and build out within the zoning rights.

2231
02:50:21,398 --> 02:50:28,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's through a Board of Appeals, through a hardship that they would have to prove hardship.

2232
02:50:29,702 --> 02:50:39,770
[SPEAKER_01]: and do arrests of some sort that they could get a variance in order to go from a three-family to a five or whatever if it's not allowed in that area.

2233
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:45,794
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, Mr. Caraviello, you should go to the meeting and express your concern.

2234
02:50:45,814 --> 02:50:48,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people should also if they have some issues with that.

2235
02:50:50,178 --> 02:50:53,600
[SPEAKER_01]: But most importantly, I would worry about Tufts University.

2236
02:50:53,620 --> 02:50:59,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I would make sure that Tufts University is buying all their real estate.

2237
02:51:01,002 --> 02:51:14,366
[SPEAKER_01]: through Wild Night Hill Properties to keep the real estate tax bill in place, or else it becomes a non-profit and we lose more and more of our real estate tax base, or some other entity that will pay a real estate tax.

2238
02:51:15,926 --> 02:51:18,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's commercial or residential.

2239
02:51:19,727 --> 02:51:19,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2240
02:51:20,027 --> 02:51:20,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2241
02:51:21,988 --> 02:51:22,628
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion.

2242
02:51:26,669 --> 02:51:29,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want them to request a moratorium, or do you want to

2243
02:51:43,390 --> 02:51:53,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll ask for how many conversions in the last 10 years, and then the last year by address, and also how many are coming forward within the next two to four months.

2244
02:51:55,613 --> 02:51:57,194
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, we'll take off the moratorium.

2245
02:52:02,805 --> 02:52:04,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be notified when they come forward?

2246
02:52:04,887 --> 02:52:07,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we be notified?

2247
02:52:15,175 --> 02:52:22,321
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the neighbors should know there's going to be more, they expect more, and people should be aware of what's going to be coming down the line.

2248
02:52:23,982 --> 02:52:28,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So by resolution by councillor Caraviello, amended by councillor

2249
02:52:31,432 --> 02:52:31,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Kamuso.

2250
02:52:33,753 --> 02:52:34,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval.

2251
02:52:37,435 --> 02:52:38,095
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

2252
02:52:38,796 --> 02:52:46,560
[SPEAKER_04]: All those passed.

2253
02:52:46,580 --> 02:52:47,660
[SPEAKER_04]: 15471 offered by Councilor Knight.

2254
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:51,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Be resolved that motion to withdraw.

2255
02:52:51,422 --> 02:52:52,123
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

2256
02:52:52,543 --> 02:52:53,203
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

2257
02:52:54,764 --> 02:52:55,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper is withdrawn.

2258
02:52:56,045 --> 02:52:57,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper 15-472 offered by Councilor Knight.

2259
02:52:59,357 --> 02:53:10,163
[SPEAKER_04]: be resolved the contractors performing the construction work on Winthrop Street between Route 16 and Route 60 remove all construction equipment, materials and debris at the conclusion of each day.

2260
02:53:10,303 --> 02:53:10,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

2261
02:53:14,025 --> 02:53:17,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much and thank you for indulging me once again on this topic.

2262
02:53:19,148 --> 02:53:26,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I've gotten a number of complaints, Madam President, from the residents of the area, many of whom are my neighbours, relative to the closure of

2263
02:53:27,781 --> 02:53:38,487
[SPEAKER_11]: one lane of traffic going down Winthrop Street and one lane of traffic going up Winthrop Street so that these contractors can store their materials during the day and after the work hours.

2264
02:53:38,627 --> 02:53:50,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I can understand blocking off lanes of traffic to ensure their safety and to allow them to have access to their equipment and materials when construction's going on, but at this point in time, with this mini big dig that's been going on for the past two years now,

2265
02:53:52,135 --> 02:53:53,996
[SPEAKER_11]: The area is just looking blighted and terrible.

2266
02:53:54,337 --> 02:53:56,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a gateway to the city.

2267
02:53:56,379 --> 02:54:06,467
[SPEAKER_11]: As someone gets off the highway and they go down Route 16 and take a right onto Route 38 to go up to Winthrop Circle, they're going to drive through an area that's just blighted at this point in time.

2268
02:54:06,828 --> 02:54:14,955
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a generator, there's cones, there's curbs, there's piles of dirt, there's old rusted pipes, there's new pipes, there's plastic.

2269
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:18,939
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a port-a-party on the sidewalk at the corner of Winthrop Street and High Street.

2270
02:54:18,999 --> 02:54:21,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it can't get any worse at this point in time, Madam President.

2271
02:54:22,203 --> 02:54:28,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we have an opportunity to request that these materials be removed at the end of the day.

2272
02:54:29,030 --> 02:54:30,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that that's too much to ask.

2273
02:54:31,393 --> 02:54:36,258
[SPEAKER_11]: There's ample space for the contractor at their yard.

2274
02:54:36,695 --> 02:54:38,375
[SPEAKER_11]: They're keeping two bulldozers out there.

2275
02:54:38,415 --> 02:54:39,436
[SPEAKER_11]: They can move the bulldozers.

2276
02:54:39,476 --> 02:54:41,336
[SPEAKER_11]: They can put the bulldozers in a parking lot.

2277
02:54:41,356 --> 02:54:42,936
[SPEAKER_11]: They can put the bulldozers at the condom shelf.

2278
02:54:43,176 --> 02:54:54,698
[SPEAKER_11]: They can put it in a number of places, Madam President, but one of the places that it shouldn't be is sitting in a lane of traffic, blocking a lane of traffic and creating congestion and creating traffic hardships, especially with the current condition of the roadway that it's in.

2279
02:54:55,258 --> 02:55:04,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So Madam President, I'd ask for my council colleagues to support this resolution and to make the request that at the end of each workday, the area is cleaned out of all construction materials, debris and equipment.

2280
02:55:04,882 --> 02:55:09,184
[SPEAKER_11]: in the interest of public safety and in the interest of, you know, egress into the city.

2281
02:55:09,244 --> 02:55:11,905
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's just a beautification issue at this point in time, Madam President.

2282
02:55:11,925 --> 02:55:14,586
[SPEAKER_11]: The residents have been very patient in dealing with this issue.

2283
02:55:16,006 --> 02:55:22,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Earlier in the meeting tonight, we had a very long discussion about what these residents are going to have to face again in 18 short months.

2284
02:55:22,589 --> 02:55:27,850
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think at this point in time, they need a little bit of relief, Madam President, and I think that this will do it for a short period of time.

2285
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:32,152
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I'd also like to see when this construction project is going to end two months ago.

2286
02:55:32,613 --> 02:55:37,095
[SPEAKER_11]: When we made the request of the DPW, they said that there were 18 more connections that needed to take place.

2287
02:55:37,716 --> 02:55:45,820
[SPEAKER_11]: And that led me to believe that how many of them had been done, led me to question how many have actually been done if they need 18 more to do.

2288
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:49,121
[SPEAKER_11]: So this project's been taking an extremely long time.

2289
02:55:50,282 --> 02:55:51,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I can only imagine what the budget looks like.

2290
02:55:52,363 --> 02:55:56,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this was something that was supposed to be wrapped up in short order, and it hasn't been, Madam President.

2291
02:55:56,065 --> 02:56:00,487
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the interest of mitigation, I'd make this request, and I'd ask my colleagues to support it.

2292
02:56:00,952 --> 02:56:02,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, motion for approval.

2293
02:56:02,712 --> 02:56:03,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

2294
02:56:03,653 --> 02:56:05,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Council President Dello Russo.

2295
02:56:05,673 --> 02:56:06,373
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

2296
02:56:06,393 --> 02:56:06,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

2297
02:56:06,894 --> 02:56:07,534
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

2298
02:56:07,614 --> 02:56:08,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper passes.

2299
02:56:09,134 --> 02:56:12,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper 15-473, offered by Councilor Knight.

2300
02:56:12,175 --> 02:56:21,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved the City Clerk provide a listing of all requests for budget appropriations made by the Council for review in concert with the City Council budget hearings.

2301
02:56:21,297 --> 02:56:21,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

2302
02:56:22,278 --> 02:56:23,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, again, thank you very much.

2303
02:56:25,458 --> 02:56:27,579
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have budget hearings coming up in June.

2304
02:56:28,489 --> 02:56:29,550
[SPEAKER_11]: to go over the state budget.

2305
02:56:29,810 --> 02:56:36,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for the past year, this council has been very active and involved in lobbying for issues and matters that are important to it.

2306
02:56:37,154 --> 02:56:45,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that now is the right time for us to take a look at these materials, go through them all, and to develop our position as we go forward to set the budget for the next fiscal year, Madam President.

2307
02:56:46,059 --> 02:56:52,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's very important for us to maybe take a look at what we've requested, prioritize them, and bring those issues to the administration.

2308
02:56:52,796 --> 02:56:55,057
[SPEAKER_11]: and make sure that they're included in the budget process, Madam President.

2309
02:56:55,077 --> 02:56:58,639
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd ask that my colleagues support this resolution in order for us to prepare for council budget hearings.

2310
02:56:59,619 --> 02:57:01,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by Council of the Night.

2316
02:57:06,803 --> 02:57:08,964
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to withdraw at this point in time, Madam President.

2317
02:57:09,985 --> 02:57:10,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to withdraw.

2318
02:57:10,745 --> 02:57:11,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper 15-474.

2319
02:57:12,166 --> 02:57:12,906
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

2320
02:57:13,366 --> 02:57:14,027
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

2321
02:57:14,087 --> 02:57:14,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper is withdrawn.

2322
02:57:15,550 --> 02:57:18,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper 15-475 offered by Councilor Knight.

2323
02:57:19,073 --> 02:57:32,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved the harbour master and project manager for the Craddock Bridge renovation project conduct an information session for boat owners to determine what waterway restrictions will be implemented during the renovations of the Craddock Bridge.

2324
02:57:32,964 --> 02:57:33,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

2325
02:57:33,865 --> 02:57:35,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much.

2326
02:57:35,186 --> 02:57:38,209
[SPEAKER_11]: I was contacted by a number of avid fishermen who

2327
02:57:39,246 --> 02:57:47,289
[SPEAKER_11]: during previous construction projects had loaded up their boat with their bait and their friends and their barbecue and their food.

2328
02:57:47,389 --> 02:57:53,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And they got on the river at 4 o'clock in the morning and tried to make their way out to the harbor to go fishing for the day.

2329
02:57:53,911 --> 02:57:58,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were met with a roadblock, no access, no access to the harbor.

2330
02:57:59,271 --> 02:58:05,032
[SPEAKER_11]: And these same individuals purchase a slip every year to house their boat in the upper lake.

2331
02:58:05,732 --> 02:58:08,033
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a significant expense for them.

2332
02:58:08,093 --> 02:58:17,755
[SPEAKER_11]: So in discussions that we've had, one of the issues that was raised was whether or not there were going to be restrictions for these individuals to take their boats downriver to get into the harbor.

2333
02:58:18,395 --> 02:58:23,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had some discussions with our Office of Community Development and the project manager, and there will be some restrictions.

2334
02:58:23,556 --> 02:58:26,177
[SPEAKER_11]: The project manager has changed on the project at this point in time.

2335
02:58:26,897 --> 02:58:31,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm requesting that the Harbormaster and the new project manager sit down and develop a schedule.

2336
02:58:31,639 --> 02:58:44,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And the schedule can be posted and shared with boat owners, and an information session be conducted so that people that have concerns about this can sit down and can actually speak to the individuals that are making the decisions in the Harbormaster to figure out what best course of action will be.

2337
02:58:45,384 --> 02:58:47,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

2338
02:58:47,345 --> 02:58:48,145
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

2339
02:58:48,165 --> 02:58:48,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

2340
02:58:48,665 --> 02:58:49,326
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

2341
02:58:49,366 --> 02:58:50,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper passes.

2342
02:58:50,866 --> 02:58:54,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper 15-476, offered by Councilor Knight.

2343
02:58:54,328 --> 02:58:55,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, I withdraw.

2344
02:58:56,010 --> 02:58:56,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to withdraw.

2345
02:58:56,770 --> 02:58:57,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

2346
02:58:57,871 --> 02:58:58,612
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

2347
02:58:58,652 --> 02:58:59,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion is withdrawn.

2348
02:59:02,074 --> 02:59:05,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper 15-477, offered by Councilor Knight.

2349
02:59:05,496 --> 02:59:14,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved the administration provide the council with a listing of all vacant board and commission positions that are established by way of ordinance, statute, or state law.

2350
02:59:14,522 --> 02:59:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

2351
02:59:15,562 --> 02:59:16,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam President, thank you very much.

2352
02:59:18,104 --> 02:59:21,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Early last month I had my office hours and an individual came before me.

2353
02:59:23,390 --> 02:59:34,855
[SPEAKER_11]: some concern relative to vacancies in certain boards and commissions and the lack of meeting in a frequency that would be established by statute ordinance or by way of law.

2354
02:59:35,456 --> 02:59:44,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Madam President, I took a look at the listing of boards and commissions and noticed that there are a variety of vacancies that exist in those boards and commissions.

2355
02:59:45,460 --> 02:59:50,923
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think with the change of administration coming, it would be very important for us to see what positions are vacant at this point in time.

2356
02:59:51,858 --> 02:59:58,704
[SPEAKER_11]: what's filled, what's not filled, and then take a look at why they're not filled and maybe make a recommendation to fill certain positions, Madam President.

2357
03:00:01,066 --> 03:00:02,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no problem with that.

2358
03:00:02,847 --> 03:00:05,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, I'd like to amend the paper to request what the salaries are.

2359
03:00:06,270 --> 03:00:06,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

2360
03:00:06,670 --> 03:00:10,173
[SPEAKER_14]: On the amendment, motion of Council of the Night for approval as amended.

2361
03:00:10,213 --> 03:00:10,954

03:00:10,974 --> 03:00:11,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2363
03:00:11,834 --> 03:00:12,575

03:01:25,082 --> 03:01:38,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, if we could, one more condolence offered by Councilor Penta, 15 of 482, be resolved that an expression of sympathy be forwarded to the family of Joseph Callahan, the former city auditor

2379

2383

[SPEAKER_17]: And it took place at the Grace Episcopal Church.
