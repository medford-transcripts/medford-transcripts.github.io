[SPEAKER_02]: This meeting is called to order.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first item on our agenda is

20
00:00:54,321 --> 00:01:04,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just reviewing our 2024 2025 council governing agenda, which is just all of the papers that we are.

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,102
[SPEAKER_02]: We have in this committee.

22
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that is on this agenda is something that I was hoping to discuss today.

23
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:19,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've invited a number of people here to talk about.

24
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:33,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping to discuss that first, which is the paper 24-023, which is a warming and or cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness in Medford.

25
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:40,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we will get to talking about the governing agenda after we review that if that's okay with everyone.

26
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the.

27
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all right with the committee members if we talk about the warming center 1st.

28
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:51,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because we have a bunch of guests here.

29
00:01:52,006 --> 00:02:01,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm just going to read through the resolution 1st, and then we will get to a couple of.

30
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:03,357
[SPEAKER_02]: folks here to speak.

31
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:15,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there was also Councilor Collins had something that she wanted to speak about the wildlife feeding ordinance, which is not officially on the agenda, but we're going to get there as well.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So Councilor Collins need not be concerned.

33
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:29,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So, paper 24-023 warming cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness be it resolved that the Medford City Council

34
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:40,827
[SPEAKER_02]: By the Medford City Council, let the City of Medford explore the options, cost, and requirements to open a warming and cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness in December 2024.

35
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:53,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council invite representatives from the administration, including the Board of Health, along with stakeholders in our community and in neighboring communities to attend meetings on this topic.

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we would dive right in and try to do this as quickly as possible.

37
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:05,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some understanding of how long it can take to kind of gear up for something like this because.

38
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:22,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with Pastor Jerry Whitestone who is in attendance at the Malden Warming Center for the past few years, and it can take some lead time and in anticipation of trying to get everything together by next winter.

39
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:27,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to start talking about it as soon as possible.

40
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here with us today are Marianne O'Connor, who is one of our representatives from the Medford Board of Health, as well as Penny Funioli and Alicia La Gambina.

41
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:53,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alicia hunt, who is from the planning department who I thought maybe couldn't be here, but maybe since we're on zoom and maybe basketball's canceled is able to be here, which is exciting.

42
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to give some background on some conversations I've had.

43
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:05,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke with a woman named Karen from Somerville.

44
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:18,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Somerville and Revere are two cities in our region that have recently opened warming centers by contracting with a nonprofit called Housing Families.

45
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:21,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are using city buildings

46
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:30,743
[SPEAKER_02]: to have overnight warming centers during the months of January, February, March.

47
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they both opened in, oh, Sophie Antoine is also here.

48
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Penny.

49
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Health equity coordinator.

50
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:39,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you, Sophie.

51
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not met you in person yet, but thank you for being here as well.

52
00:04:44,657 --> 00:05:01,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So, both of those cities are using their public buildings and are contracting with housing and families, and the woman that I spoke with from Somerville said that she was interested in the possibility of a regional conversation with Medford for future years.

53
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:02,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think

54
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:10,539
[SPEAKER_02]: either, I don't think either Revere or Somerville is married to the model that they're using this year.

55
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Revere last year used a different location.

56
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:18,703
[SPEAKER_02]: They used their senior center last year, which is also a city building.

57
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They faced a lot of resistance last year, so I think everybody's just kind of

58
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,245
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling their way through.

59
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:33,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I can also say that the Malden Warming Center did a lot of feeling its way through the first three or four years of its existence.

60
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:45,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the work that you do in this kind of space involves a little bit of trial and error and learning what works and what doesn't in the process.

61
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:48,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to invite

62
00:05:50,967 --> 00:06:10,733
[SPEAKER_02]: First, if I can, Pastor Jerry Whetstone to speak just for a couple of minutes about maybe just to give us a little bit of background on the Malden Warming Center, how it started and you can just give us like a couple minutes of description of of what we do at the warming center and where the.

63
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:25,206
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, this, this sort of being a high level conversation about, like, what the needs are in the region and, and where we came about, uh, where the warming center, um, began and where we are now.

64
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:30,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then we can sort of start talking about how Medford can fit in that puzzle piece.

65
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:34,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

66
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:35,912
[SPEAKER_05]: That's quite a tall order.

67
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:36,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

68
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:38,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening everyone.

69
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:46,496
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to meet you and I appreciate the opportunity to come in and encourage you in your exploration of this.

70
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:54,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, when we find the other cities that I've had the privilege of working with, and I've been working with several of them recently.

71
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:04,786
[SPEAKER_05]: over the past few years, there's often the question, well, do we even have a problem with those that are experienced homelessness in our community?

72
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer to that is yes.

73
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:08,368
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't always see them.

74
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:13,872
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the reasons is, is because they're doing very well at hiding sometimes.

75
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:17,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And other times we don't see them because we're not really looking.

76
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:22,538
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't really see them because we tend to be busy on our own tasks.

77
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:25,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But we definitely have that problem in our region.

78
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:37,249
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our area, Malden was the 1st warming center of its kind ever from what I can understand in our in our region in our area and.

79
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:56,929
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that it actually got started was we were sitting in a conversation with our mayor, with a group of faith group leaders, and we just said, is there something that the city could use some help on that we might be able to step in and see what we can do?

80
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:05,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first thing that came to his mind was, well, we have a significant number of people that are experiencing homelessness, and we're not sure what to do.

81
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:07,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that gave dream.

82
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't go into all the details about it.

83
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:11,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but, um.

84
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:15,558
[SPEAKER_05]: We, uh, I, I approached my own church that I have.

85
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:21,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I pastor, um, threw out an idea to them and said, would you be willing to host this and give birth to this?

86
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and then we, we launched it from there.

87
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,241
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in our 6th season.

88
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:31,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we Malden warming center actually operates totally by volunteers.

89
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:31,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

90
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:35,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, our, our budget runs.

91
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:46,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Some in the vicinity of about 130,000 to 150,000, depending on some of the things that we provide for our guests, which wouldn't necessarily need to be provided by every warming center.

92
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:56,346
[SPEAKER_05]: We worked closely as she mentioned with with Revere and Somerville, and they use basically our model to get theirs off the ground.

93
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:03,731
[SPEAKER_05]: The amazing thing is that many people have a misunderstanding of those who are homeless.

94
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:09,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we approach it as is that we are a people who practice hospitality.

95
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:17,120
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a group of people of compassionate hearts that recognize that there are many people and that number is increasing.

96
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:25,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I have to tell you as city officials, especially in the public health, that homelessness is on the rise exponentially right now.

97
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're just the people that come together and say, we're going to practice hospitality.

98
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:43,600
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to open our place and say, come on in and and, you know, we have a rather extensive program and the fact that we provide dinner as well as breakfast as well as snacks throughout the night.

99
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,522
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have what's known as Amy's closet.

100
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:46,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So we provide clothing.

101
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:56,667
[SPEAKER_05]: for those that need it, as well as any warm clothing or personal care items, as well as provide sandwiches and such when they leave in the morning so they can have lunch during the day.

102
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,348
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just us practicing hospitality.

103
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:07,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Our pledge to them is to provide for you a warm, safe place for you to be during the harsh New England winter months.

104
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:10,332
[SPEAKER_05]: We operate December 1 through March 31.

105
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:14,614
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of essentially what Malden Warming Center is all about in a nutshell.

106
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:18,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I mentioned, we do it completely by volunteer.

107
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:22,516
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a self-signup program to where the volunteers sign up for their own shifts.

108
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:23,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We have broken down.

109
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:32,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been fortunate to have some exceptional leaders come along and join us in the leadership team so that there's just an amazing group of people.

110
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:41,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we have approximately 147 active volunteers that are rotating the various responsibilities and covering the responsibilities.

111
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:58,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's even times like today, we thought it was going to be a snow emergency and it was at 1st, but as you well know, things kind of changed, but we had planned on remaining open and we just put the word out and said, look, if there's some volunteers that are available.

112
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:04,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We really don't want our guests to have to be outside during the day and we had people respond.

113
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were able to be open for the day.

114
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,968
[SPEAKER_05]: The people are there and ready with compassionate hearts to respond.

115
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:18,773
[SPEAKER_05]: The Revere and Somerville programs, as she mentioned, are actually operated by housing families, which we work and collaborate with closely.

116
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:25,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And though they use our model, they have paid staff, and they mix in volunteers.

117
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:28,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of variety and ideas that can work with that.

118
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:36,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm willing to come alongside and to help any group of people that want to explore it more or find out some of the details to it.

119
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,704
[SPEAKER_05]: and answer any questions you might have.

120
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:45,967
[SPEAKER_05]: But the key is that those that are experiencing homelessness are people and their constituents.

121
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:48,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't have an address because they're homeless.

122
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And that puts them in a very real difficult position.

123
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:57,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when people say, well, where are they from?

124
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:01,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they from Medford, or from Malden, or are they from Everett?

125
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,696
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer is yes, they are.

126
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:08,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that happens to be where they are at the moment sometimes.

127
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:14,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we need to band together, because the need is great.

128
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see a hand raised.

129
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:18,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So Madam Chairman.

130
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:21,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Pastor Jerry.

131
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:22,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

132
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:23,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor LeMang.

133
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:25,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

134
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for coming.

135
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:36,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you talk a little bit about the land situation?

136
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:41,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Who owns the land or the building for the Malden Learning Center?

137
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:43,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it rented out?

138
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it donated?

139
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,081
[SPEAKER_07]: You said the budget was $130,000 a year.

140
00:12:52,927 --> 00:13:19,561
[SPEAKER_05]: just could you could you just like talk a little bit about the about those sure yeah uh the the the building is actually belongs to the church that i pastor the first church of the nazarene uh and uh we we wanted to collaborate so that uh when it originally started the warming warming center was under the umbrella of the church so that we could get it organized and started our first year budget was was only about

141
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:24,623
[SPEAKER_05]: about $60,000, I think, $60,000 or $70,000, because we were really just getting started out.

142
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: The $130,000 covers quite a bit.

143
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,565
[SPEAKER_05]: We provide a shuttle in the morning.

144
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:32,346
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, we provide quite a few meals.

145
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a relationship with the church that, though the church doesn't charge rent, the warming center does cover

146
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:47,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Extra utilities that pays a portion of the utilities.

147
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:52,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it basically pays for itself as far as utilities and and any kind of.

148
00:13:54,756 --> 00:14:04,778
[SPEAKER_05]: items that we might need, plastic bags for garbage, those type of things, paper plates, all the stuff that we do for our meals, the warming center provides.

149
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:10,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably some of our largest part of our budget is security.

150
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,341
[SPEAKER_05]: We do allow the people to come because it's a first-come, first-served basis.

151
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,222
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a limitation of 25 individuals that we're able to house.

152
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:29,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're able to come early and get a number and wait in some tents that we have out in our parking lot until we open our doors at 7.

153
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:32,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of that, we provide security.

154
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a huge amount.

155
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:35,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We also provide blankets.

156
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,372
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a health issue.

157
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:47,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want anyone to be using their own blankets or their own sleeping bags in the building, because we want to make sure it's a safe place health-wise as well.

158
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:53,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we provide blankets every night, and we get those laundered every night so that they're clean.

159
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of those are pretty hefty aspects.

160
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the other warming centers choose not to do that.

161
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:06,325
[SPEAKER_05]: They use mats or something, but in our city, they haven't allowed us to go that route as yet.

162
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that help some?

163
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, absolutely.

164
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:13,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And where does the $130,000 come from the city or donations?

165
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:22,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably about right now about 42 to 45%.

166
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:27,245
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not even that hard.

167
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Between 40 and 42% of our budget is probably grants.

168
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,947
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of it comes from personal donations.

169
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:41,248
[SPEAKER_05]: We have incorporated recently so that we're now our own 501c3 and we do our own fundraising.

170
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:45,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the largest chunk of our budget

171
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:54,430
[SPEAKER_05]: donations come from personal donations or from organizations or businesses that support us.

172
00:15:55,891 --> 00:16:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a local foundation in town that is a tremendous supporter and has been for all 6 years that we've been in operation.

173
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:15,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we raised the budget and pretty much we do use CBDG money that we have a small grant from the city that covers parts of what we do.

174
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:24,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And also there was some ARPA money this year that they were able to help us with helping to cover some of the security aspects.

175
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:38,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's also the, uh, uh, Malden recovery coaches are, um, they staff, uh, a portion of the night.

176
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:43,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're pretty employees and we'll have like two or three.

177
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:44,576
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three a night.

178
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:46,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's a collaboration.

179
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm huge on collaboration.

180
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:53,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So we collaborate with Malden Cares, which is a part of Malden Overcoming Addiction.

181
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:54,842
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have been familiar with that.

182
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:56,604
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have met Paul Hammersley.

183
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:58,525
[SPEAKER_05]: If you met him, you remember him.

184
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we actually have three recovery coaches on site every single night.

185
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,310
[SPEAKER_05]: We also collaborate with Elliott ABCD Housing.

186
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:13,255
[SPEAKER_05]: We collaborate with Melrose Wakefield Tufts Hospital.

187
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:23,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And these collaborations all provide services that we that we can't, but in the collaboration, we're able to provide other resources in the 6 years.

188
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are going to be rounded off numbers because I didn't write them all down.

189
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the 6 years, we've been in operation, we've helped probably over.

190
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:34,398
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 and something people find secure housing through our collaborations.

191
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:51,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And through our collaboration with Malden Overcoming Addiction and Malden Cares, we probably have somewhere in the vicinity of close to 200 people that have entered recovery programs by being guests at the center, giving them opportunity to work with Malden Cares and such.

192
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So those collaborations have been tremendous.

193
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:57,506
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, the center itself, we practice hospitality.

194
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:58,887
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we are about.

195
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:05,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have, just to kind of give you an idea, we have two room monitors on for the 25 people.

196
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:10,908
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of figure that's a safe guest to room monitor ratio.

197
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:16,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's two room monitors on all night long when the guests are in the building.

198
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, we have volunteers that do many other tasks, you know, for the beginning of the night.

199
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:38,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And apologies, Chair, I just have one more question, though I don't, I'm not, I don't know, this is a Medford specific thing, so this is just like for later in the meeting of somebody else.

200
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:45,155
[SPEAKER_07]: What would the candidate locations for Medford be if it were a learning center?

201
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:46,876
[SPEAKER_07]: like what locations.

202
00:18:48,137 --> 00:19:12,235
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could ask you, Councilor Leming, to pause on that question and redirect to Marianne O'Connor or Penny Funigalli to ask if you all could give us a little, or actually Alicia Lagumbina as well, if you all would maybe be able to address what I would describe as the needs of Medford residents that you're

203
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:28,779
[SPEAKER_02]: that you witness in, you know, sort of day-to-day interactions now and sort of what you generally tell them when you do refer people who are struggling with housing instability or eviction, things like that in the winter.

204
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Alicia would best speak to that.

205
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:43,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody, Alicia here, community social worker for the city of Medford.

206
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've been working in this capacity for some years, and I have volunteered only once at the.

207
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:58,158
[SPEAKER_03]: warming center in Malden with a couple of folks from our recovery coach program here.

208
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:00,939
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit for our new Councilors.

209
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, haven't been on a council meeting with you yet, but I'm sure many more.

210
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:16,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work with individuals who are in recovery from substance use disorder or are currently using substances.

211
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who are unhoused, those who are

212
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:29,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Facing eviction and so there are certainly different levels to the folks that we're working with.

213
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:39,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that our main concern, our main issue with the folks that we are working with is eviction in housing.

214
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:44,787
[SPEAKER_03]: unable to pay rent, low income housing, affordable housing.

215
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:54,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are getting a majority of folks at that preventative state where they could be in a home and yet they are losing their homes.

216
00:20:55,911 --> 00:21:03,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And thus far, leaving the community, becoming homeless, living in unlivable spaces,

217
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:12,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that we do have a fairly small presence of people who are living outdoors in Medford.

218
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:27,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have a good grasp on folks in our previous years with our recovery coach previous to this one who was funded through the city.

219
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:34,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would do that street outreach and go to locations and engage with folks.

220
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:50,795
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had that capacity in some time, but we do know that a lot of folks have moved from spaces that they previously were in, and that's due to some of the construction beside the river.

221
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:04,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And community members will utilize really any sort of communication measure to communicate that there are unhoused folks in the city of Bedford.

222
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:08,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've gotten emails to the mayor, see, click, fix.

223
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrons of the library have had a lot of concerns.

224
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:19,962
[SPEAKER_03]: The library is such an open and welcoming space to all and they're really supporting this population.

225
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:26,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've taken up hours on Wednesdays at the library to try to engage with folks in that space.

226
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:35,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, another important thing to note is that it's a transient population.

227
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:42,967
[SPEAKER_03]: These folks, like Jerry said, and I'm so glad, Pastor Wetzel, I'm so glad that he did.

228
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,367
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a transient group.

229
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:48,608
[SPEAKER_03]: These are not people that attended Medford High.

230
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:52,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly, these are folks coming from different communities.

231
00:22:55,794 --> 00:23:03,319
[SPEAKER_03]: older adults, living with family members, taking showers at family members' houses, but then living outdoors.

232
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:16,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do see a very variety of those who had roots in Medford prior to becoming homeless and those who just found themselves here.

233
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:40,823
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's any other direct questions about those that we serve in Medford and have been working with, the Behavioral Health Commission has been really great with some of our services and really allocating or hopefully allocating some future funding like dinner is provided and we have

234
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:46,298
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hygiene kits that we give out to folks.

235
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:55,705
[SPEAKER_03]: We have MBTA passes and target gift cards for a number of like necessities, workforce gear.

236
00:23:55,765 --> 00:24:02,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we really tried to give as many resources as we can outside of actually giving folks housing.

237
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:10,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis anything?

238
00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:12,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

239
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:15,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

240
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:40,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that and I just wanted to jump in ahead of any other city staff who are going to speak and just say you know I really appreciate that overview and I think it's, it's certainly abundantly clear to me as one Councilor all the time and I feel pretty safe and speaking for my fellow Councilors that the health department, the Office of Prevention and Outreach, everybody involved in this type of preventative

241
00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:47,443
[SPEAKER_10]: and supportive work in City Hall, just always doing such an incredible job with the resources that they have.

242
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:50,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of always in awe of it, and I really appreciate it.

243
00:24:50,186 --> 00:24:54,951
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always a good time to get an overview of what is currently on offer, so I just really appreciate that.

244
00:24:56,032 --> 00:25:04,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And Pastor Jerry as well, it's incredible to hear about the work that you and your congregation have done for years in Malden, and I think

245
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:17,006
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the theme that's come up and kind of the testimony that we've heard so far that I suspect we'll hear over and over again for as long as we talk about this topic and future meetings is that, you know, just like we say that the housing crisis is a regional issue.

246
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,748
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so too is the homelessness issue.

247
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:21,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think it's really

248
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:31,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that really is at the heart of it to think about and how this plays out across a blurry line, across our various municipal boundaries.

249
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:35,809
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the end of the day, we have to think about regional capacity and how we're contributing to that.

250
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,369
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you so much.

251
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking forward to hearing more perspectives on this.

252
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:43,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would definitely agree with that.

253
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can also say that in my experience in Malden,

254
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody who's at the Malden Warming Center definitely didn't go to Malden High, but a lot of them did.

255
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:05,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they know one of our volunteers who was a longtime high school principal at Malden High, and sometimes they know each other from when they went to high school.

256
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also spoke with one of our guests.

257
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.

258
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:11,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I did check in last night.

259
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:19,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went to Medford High, and he was telling me about his house that he grew up in, that it was his parents' house.

260
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:22,588
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was located, like across the street from St.

261
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:25,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Clement's and what color it used to be and what color it is now.

262
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he had roots in Medford.

263
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:32,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's like, well, he's in Malden now because that's where the warming center is.

264
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:39,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you kind of wherever you grow up, you go to the place where the services are available.

265
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:48,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's it's the responsibility and the duty of everybody in the region to be kind of working together and making sure that we're all

266
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:54,970
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the best we can for the people that are around us.

267
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:08,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if, Marianne, if you might be able to speak to maybe a conversation that you had with Somerville about the possibility of a regional discussion.

268
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:14,745
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this is really going to end up with us making any concrete

269
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:27,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, decisions tonight, but I am hoping for us to, like, begin a conversation and really, um, maybe hopefully, uh, I think the next step will be like a more solid, uh.

270
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:35,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the next conversation will be about what kind of space we might need or have access to, but, um.

271
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:38,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you very much.

272
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:40,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Council is very nice to meet you.

273
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:43,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And same with you council.

274
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:43,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

275
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:50,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was kind of the juxtaposition of the conversation we had last week.

276
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:58,653
[SPEAKER_04]: We met with Somerville, Cambridge, Arlington, and Medford, and the Somerville Homeless Coalition.

277
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:03,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks were on the call as well, who worked very closely.

278
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:08,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So Karen, who you spoke with, Karen Carroll, she's the Director of Health and Human Services for Somerville.

279
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:13,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did start the conversation as a coalition, thinking on a regional level,

280
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:22,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It might make a lot more sense for us to put our heads together, find locations, because space is an issue in Medford, and I know we'll get into that.

281
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:33,491
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, as we kept going forward, so some of those shelter right now is ARPA funded.

282
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:39,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be facing the same ARPA cliff we're all facing next.

283
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:44,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Winter, they're not sure how they're going to continue to fund.

284
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:50,134
[SPEAKER_04]: They are probably close to 200,000 dollars with housing families as far as the budget goes.

285
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:56,219
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the conversation was just said, okay, we need further conversations and let's start.

286
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's something we can do.

287
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:08,245
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some low hanging fruit, something smaller, we can get going before we start to launch into this greater conversation of a regional.

288
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:10,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, center, um.

289
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:22,128
[SPEAKER_04]: only because doing things regionally now, specifically with the state, DBH, it's a lot easier to get funding as opposed to individual communities.

290
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:28,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we work as a region, we may actually be able to tap into funding if available.

291
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:32,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a lot stronger of a case as a region.

292
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:34,819
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's a big issue.

293
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, Cambridge and Somerville have different

294
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:44,065
[SPEAKER_04]: issues than Arlington versus Medford.

295
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:49,909
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all trying to figure out what's the extent of the problem and who we're going to serve.

296
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,513
[SPEAKER_04]: But we all came to the same, like you all said, this is a transient population.

297
00:29:55,573 --> 00:30:04,839
[SPEAKER_04]: So people from Medford will go to Somerville, people from Somerville will go to Cambridge, people from Cambridge will go to Medford, and they will move around as they can.

298
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:19,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the start of a conversation, no solid answers came out of it, but certainly something that we want to continue to talk about and see where we can collaborate and hopefully come up with some funding.

299
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:25,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Space is an issue, so where the location would be is something we're looking at.

300
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:29,845
[SPEAKER_04]: But the funding is certainly going to be an issue as well.

301
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:39,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like running out of ARPA funding is going to be a problem for everybody, everywhere, in a lot of ways.

302
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:41,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be something to keep in mind.

303
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:49,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really happy to hear about the concept of state funding being more available for regional projects, though.

304
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:50,180
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a really good idea.

305
00:30:50,680 --> 00:31:01,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing to keep in mind is that definitely if people find out that something is one town over, but it's available and you don't have to show paperwork, that makes sure that you have a connection.

306
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:08,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that there was a shelter in Cambridge that established a new rule at some point.

307
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:12,399
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a guest last year who was trying to get a little bit more of a solid.

308
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:26,105
[SPEAKER_02]: situation, Pastor Jerry, I'm not sure if you remember this, I think it was Mike, he was trying to get into one of the Cambridge shelters, but you needed like some kind of piece of mail that said that you lived in Cambridge.

309
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, but you're homeless.

310
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:31,387
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you have a piece of mail that says you live in Cambridge when you don't have a home?

311
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:33,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, he couldn't.

312
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, you were supposed to prove residency, but you don't have residency anyway.

313
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,391
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it was like, well, I'll go to Cambridge.

314
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:44,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I would happily go to Cambridge.

315
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:50,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Councilor Leming.

316
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

317
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So two questions, just about what Marianne said.

318
00:31:55,703 --> 00:32:04,611
[SPEAKER_07]: So with the regional funding issue, I mean, does that, sorry if I misunderstood sort of what you were saying there.

319
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:12,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that imply that if warming centers were like band together and apply for like a block grant in that model, they'd be more likely to get funding?

320
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:16,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just like my first question, like try to understand that situation.

321
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:33,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And the second is, I mean, is it possible that Medford has less of a homeless situation than some of the surrounding communities because we just lack resources compared to those communities for the homeless?

322
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:34,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're sort of just like,

323
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,062
[SPEAKER_07]: putting the problem off to our neighbors.

324
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's part of that.

325
00:32:40,723 --> 00:32:42,604
[SPEAKER_04]: We have different issues here in Medford as well, though.

326
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:45,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just folks on the street being homeless.

327
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:53,129
[SPEAKER_04]: We have folks who we know are doubling and tripling up in apartments, are couch surfing, are living in cars.

328
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:57,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So they may not be on the street necessarily, but they're homeless.

329
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:58,711
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one thing.

330
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:05,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're seeing more and more of that, and the schools will attest to that.

331
00:33:06,577 --> 00:33:07,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a problem.

332
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:13,703
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the regional funding goes, it's kind of the way they're going with the state and DPH and everyone else.

333
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:22,751
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really looking at regional approaches now, and they'd much prefer to fund regional approaches as opposed to individual communities trying to solve problems on their own.

334
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:32,994
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking for folks to band together, and they're much more supportive of regional coalitions and regional collaboration.

335
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:46,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I was just asking if there's a future possibility with that in mind, or if this is already a thing, like having all the warming centers and greater Boston sort of apply as a group and split the funding, or is that not a thing?

336
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

337
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

338
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:56,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not to say that there's actually even funding out there right now for warming centers that we're aware of.

339
00:33:56,766 --> 00:34:05,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just to say that if there were, and we collaborated as a region, we'd be more successful than if we tried to do it individually as Medford.

340
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:14,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember I had a conversation with Nisha over a year ago where she was talking about some of these regional funding issues.

341
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,922
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's interesting to see how it evolves over time.

342
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Pastor Jerry.

343
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you madam chair.

344
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm a guest, but just to throw out something 1 is the regional aspect yesterday.

345
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:33,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was yesterday.

346
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:44,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I was pleased to be invited and participated in the ribbon cutting for the CHA behavioral health clinic that's now in Malden.

347
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a perfect example of some of the things that's happening on the mental health area.

348
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:56,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you realize it or not, the number one reason for homelessness, the cause of homelessness is mental health.

349
00:34:57,286 --> 00:35:01,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that could be dual diagnosis with substance abuse disorder.

350
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:04,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we move into the evictions and such as that.

351
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:11,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could share personal stories that we've met and worked with in our warming center.

352
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just one of those regionals.

353
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:23,891
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually worked to get regional care and went for some state money and able to do that.

354
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:28,114
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the reasons they were able to do that, and they're doing it in other areas as well.

355
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to throw out a name to you.

356
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:40,525
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't met him yet, Alex Prax is our Director here in Malden, our Director of Community Development and Housing.

357
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:44,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's the 1 that's helped us tremendously.

358
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:51,934
[SPEAKER_05]: To know where some of the money is and how we might be able to tap into that money and he actually.

359
00:35:51,954 --> 00:36:06,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Our mayor actually invited mayors of the surrounding cities to come and we've met a couple of times and he was very instrumental in talking about some of this potential regionalization and how there was money available.

360
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:07,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just.

361
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:13,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Which say to to your chairperson Councilor zero, you might want to.

362
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Connect with him and have him at 1 of your meetings, because he definitely knows the ropes when it comes to some of that and especially with some of the as well as other things that can be tapped in for some of for some of those aspects.

363
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:33,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the third thing I just wanted to throw out too, the collaboration that we have is just tremendous.

364
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:35,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the collaborations we have is with the city.

365
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:44,614
[SPEAKER_05]: When we began, the very first thing that I did was bring all the city officials that would come and sit down with us and say, this is what I'm thinking about doing.

366
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:46,155
[SPEAKER_05]: What can we do and what can't we do?

367
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:52,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And how can we best partner with the city to help individuals that are experiencing homelessness?

368
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And that partnership has just

369
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Grown exponentially.

370
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Our mayor is 1 of our volunteers.

371
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:02,106
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 4 council members that volunteer.

372
00:37:02,706 --> 00:37:04,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those are on a very regular basis.

373
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:08,130
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 2 of our council members that every single Friday night for 4 years.

374
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they do dinner.

375
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,772
[SPEAKER_05]: They bring in dinner and serve dinner to our guests.

376
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:19,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our city council has been very supportive, and so that collaboration is very important.

377
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:32,156
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that there are probably some faith groups, so when you begin looking at locations, I would suggest that you might just want to start reaching out to other individuals to say, would you be willing to partner with the city?

378
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:35,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to think that every church would open their doors to you.

379
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:36,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that.

380
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:38,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a heartbreak of mine.

381
00:37:39,017 --> 00:37:40,358
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little story another time.

382
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:48,680
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do know that it's been a wonderful partnership that we've had and working together.

383
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:56,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that you just don't look to cities, to city buildings, because that's going to limit you to start with, I know.

384
00:37:56,743 --> 00:38:00,984
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are those in the community that might say, we can come alongside of a project like that.

385
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:02,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it.

386
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:03,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be quiet.

387
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:04,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chairman.

388
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:07,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Penny.

389
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:12,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, thank you for having me here.

390
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:19,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Alicia and Maryam for all they've they've added the conversation extremely knowledgeable and have been doing hard work.

391
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,991
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to point out that.

392
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:28,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Breonna Lunger-Kern and Sophie Antoine and I did attend the meeting at the Malden Warming Center last fall.

393
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:36,831
[SPEAKER_09]: And following that meeting, the mayor did reach out to our faith leaders and to other contacts and was looking for support.

394
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:42,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And she did not get anyone who was biting to come and help and be a part of this conversation.

395
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:45,475
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think really the bigger issue I think is

396
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:51,883
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just each town's individual CDBG funds we need to be thinking about.

397
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:53,645
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the continuum of care?

398
00:38:54,827 --> 00:39:05,231
[SPEAKER_09]: which is the larger regional system that's, and Alicia can speak to that far deeper than I can, but you know, they do the point in time homeless count.

399
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,412
[SPEAKER_09]: They are our contact for this work.

400
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:10,513
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a systematic issue.

401
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:17,915
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an issue that Boston's just been taking on for the last 50 years probably for all of our communities.

402
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:22,057
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've started to say no thank you and started to take care of their own.

403
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:25,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we should be working collaboratively.

404
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:27,238
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be working with our state reps.

405
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:36,221
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be working with your fellow Councilors across other cities and towns to create a systematic change where we service the people in this area.

406
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:40,402
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been fighting for the opioid epidemic for the last 13 years.

407
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And what was the main point?

408
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:48,765
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no services in this area is desert service area for people who need help.

409
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:55,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So at that time, the conversation was, what's Medford going to do about this thing?

410
00:39:55,972 --> 00:40:00,315
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reality is, what is Middlesex County going to do about this issue?

411
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:09,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think that every other state in America operates on a county system, not Massachusetts.

412
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,441
[SPEAKER_09]: 351 fiefdoms, that's how it works around here.

413
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:14,396
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to be thinking much broader.

414
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:24,385
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be, you know, making some sort of like, you know, sector advocates for our county, which is one of the largest counties out there.

415
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:29,149
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's no president of Middlesex County, but there's a D.A.

416
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:30,050
[SPEAKER_09]: and there's a sheriff.

417
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:30,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

418
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:35,935
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there is the continuum of care that's servicing the area in terms of homelessness and housing.

419
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:39,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that we need to think a little bit bigger.

420
00:40:40,368 --> 00:40:48,595
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also think that we want to do the one thing that you're doing that's so critical is you're providing dignified place to be.

421
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:58,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the starting point for true change for an individual is to be treated like a human, to be treated well, and to be respected.

422
00:40:58,383 --> 00:41:00,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can see them grow.

423
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:05,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that can't be necessarily done necessarily on a larger regional level.

424
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:08,925
[SPEAKER_09]: If we all fight for that, maybe you can.

425
00:41:11,566 --> 00:41:12,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree with you.

426
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:14,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I've thought about that as a bigger picture thing.

427
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:29,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issue with the warming center, from my perspective, is that it catches folks right before they hit the pavement as a final.

428
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:53,655
[SPEAKER_02]: uh last gasp so it's it's definitely not the safety net that everybody deserves but it can be the last catch um of course we also need all the layers of safety net um but the the least we can do is make sure that you're not freezing to death so as a first as a first thing that's kind of

429
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:55,937
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the first thing I'm thinking.

430
00:41:55,957 --> 00:42:14,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can start working on, you know, the Office of Housing Stability and making sure that we have like a fully staffed city hall that's that's like checking in on people and that, you know, you never end up getting evicted in the wintertime and having to go to a warming center.

431
00:42:14,174 --> 00:42:19,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe then we don't need a warming center like Pastor Jerry and I talk about sometimes where it's like, hey, maybe we just like

432
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:21,653
[SPEAKER_02]: make ourselves obsolete.

433
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:24,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we wouldn't even need to exist.

434
00:42:25,998 --> 00:42:28,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia Hahn, I'd love to hear your perspective.

435
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:29,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

436
00:42:29,902 --> 00:42:30,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

437
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:30,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

438
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:35,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to the storm, my sentence event this evening got canceled.

439
00:42:36,963 --> 00:42:51,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, I think that it's also helpful to know, I feel like the newer Councilors may not have as much information about what are some of the systems that we have in place, but some of the systems that need to be a little bit more robust.

440
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:54,473
[SPEAKER_01]: People have mentioned CDBG a few times.

441
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:58,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a community development block grant, and that's managed out of my office.

442
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:09,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So twice a year, we have public hearings where we ask the public, we ask public service agencies, et cetera, to tell us what are the needs in Medford.

443
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Reality is we don't get a lot of feedback, but we have used those to be able to change some of the stuff.

444
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:22,646
[SPEAKER_01]: We get through CDBG, we are allowed to use 15% of the funding we get for public service agencies.

445
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:39,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to Mayor Brianna taking office and me being in this role, there was a very small group of public service agencies that always got the same amount of money every year, and other agencies were discouraged from applying because they wanted to not have to ever say no to anybody.

446
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:49,707
[SPEAKER_01]: We've kind of opened that up, and I've been working with Penny and Alicia and Marianne, and now Sophie, to really open up, like, what are our needs?

447
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:52,611
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we actually be funding with this money?

448
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:56,775
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have, like, a public service plan.

449
00:43:57,075 --> 00:44:01,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we might have a housing production plan, right?

450
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,021
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't have a plan.

451
00:44:03,061 --> 00:44:07,183
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done like a needs assessment, although Penny's done some work in this area about needs.

452
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:17,628
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually when we get funded for a needs assessment, it's for a target area, a target group, or a target issue, and not just in general, what are the public service needs?

453
00:44:18,148 --> 00:44:21,110
[SPEAKER_01]: We've started trying to ask that question.

454
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:29,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then when we did start to get more applications in, I asked the public service agencies to talk with this team.

455
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:37,219
[SPEAKER_01]: in advance of applying and then I sat down with this team last year because last year we got $451,000 of asks for that money and we only had $215,000 to give out, right?

456
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to say no to half.

457
00:44:45,524 --> 00:44:47,145
[SPEAKER_01]: of what had been asked for.

458
00:44:47,566 --> 00:44:49,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to give you that.

459
00:44:49,667 --> 00:45:03,598
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about the Malden Warming Center having a budget of $150,000 a year, just in context, we get for the city public service funding from the federal government $215,000 a year to give out.

460
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:05,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And that number is not going up.

461
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:07,080
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in danger of Congress cutting that number.

462
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:10,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the only number we ever get.

463
00:45:11,324 --> 00:45:12,464
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been other

464
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:15,883
[SPEAKER_01]: funds that have come in for nonprofits.

465
00:45:16,303 --> 00:45:19,665
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the past, the city has kind of said, OK, it's open.

466
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:20,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonprofits can apply.

467
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:26,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And the PTOs and the friends of this and everybody sort of competes.

468
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:32,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the small pot of money, usually when that has occurred, it's been about $100,000.

469
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Gaming Commission has been a source of this.

470
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:44,499
[SPEAKER_01]: but that could be targeted to areas of high need if that was sort of the preference of the city.

471
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:53,385
[SPEAKER_01]: But often those, so those funds and CDBG have a very strong preference, if not a requirement, for being Medford-based.

472
00:45:54,305 --> 00:45:55,886
[SPEAKER_01]: CDBG does have the ability.

473
00:45:55,946 --> 00:46:02,511
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we were giving money to Bread of Life based in Malden to help feed Medford residents.

474
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:14,638
[SPEAKER_01]: But we realized that we were giving them $2,500, $2,500, that it was five, it was something on the order of 5% of their budget or less.

475
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:16,399
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been less than that.

476
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:23,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were serving 5% of their population they had identified as being Medford residents.

477
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:30,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of said, maybe that money could be more effectively used for something else.

478
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:32,513
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the kinds of questions.

479
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to let you know that these

480
00:46:37,037 --> 00:46:38,878
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings are gonna come up.

481
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:43,841
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually do one of our public hearings at a city council committee of the whole.

482
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:50,886
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually have our nonprofits who have applied present to the city councilors and ask the city councilors to weigh in on that.

483
00:46:52,007 --> 00:46:58,611
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a really hard thing to do and we don't have enough money to go around.

484
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:19,917
[SPEAKER_01]: On the, I just want to quickly touch on locations on the city has been working really hard to find a location, a building where we could have a result resiliency hub right it's hard, there are not available properties in Medford, and I won't really get into that right now, but we've also been trying really hard to get more.

485
00:47:20,678 --> 00:47:29,861
[SPEAKER_01]: afterschool programs and daycares in the Medford, you might find that a lot of our churches are already running daycares and afterschool programs.

486
00:47:30,962 --> 00:47:45,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one person I'd talked to about this idea had sort of mentioned that there was an incompatibility with the space, like you couldn't use it for a daycare in the daytime and a warming center at night because of the timing and the turnover.

487
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:46,727
[SPEAKER_01]: and the difficulty with that.

488
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:59,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never worked in either, so I can't argue that, but that is one of the issues, and we're actually trying to get more of our churches to host daycare programs and afterschool programs.

489
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:01,953
[SPEAKER_01]: My office has been working to play matchmaker.

490
00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:12,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why my office, but we have between daycare programs that are interested to come to Medford and churches that may have spaces for them.

491
00:48:13,397 --> 00:48:14,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just leave it at that.

492
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:23,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerry and I were just laughing because the building that hosts the Worming Center in Malden is also a daycare during the day.

493
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:27,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're familiar with that juggle and it's been challenging.

494
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:35,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that my kids go to an after school program that is also a daycare and is in a church.

495
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:38,800
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is also a functioning church.

496
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the people that goes to that church is the kitchen coordinator for the Malden Warming Center.

497
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:46,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We have many, we got our fingers in all the little pots.

498
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:51,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Your children must be at the daycare run at the church that I'm a member of.

499
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:52,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a grace church.

500
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:52,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

501
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:57,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like not everything's falling apart over there.

502
00:48:57,569 --> 00:48:59,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's like an absolute crisis everywhere.

503
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Daycare is a big challenge.

504
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:06,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's another conversation for another probably city council meeting if I have anything to say about it.

505
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming.

506
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:12,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, just a minor part.

507
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:17,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the requirements for a daycare and a warming center in terms of the physical space similar?

508
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:24,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So if something's eligible to be a daycare, is it basically eligible to be a potential warming center?

509
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, probably.

510
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:29,924
[SPEAKER_02]: The requirements for a warming center are really pretty minimal.

511
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:41,133
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, like the Malden Warming Center is probably more, it does more than it needs to because there's a full kitchen, but it just needs to be like a big room.

512
00:49:41,874 --> 00:50:00,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, I'm just asking because, I mean, potentially if, like, you know, if Alicia's office approached a church at one time and just found that they couldn't be a daycare for some reason, then potentially you could go back, you could, like, circle back to them and be like, hey, would you maybe want to be a warming center?

513
00:50:00,843 --> 00:50:06,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's just a thought popped into my head.

514
00:50:08,086 --> 00:50:10,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

515
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:22,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go to Alicia Lagumbina and then I want to stop because if I keep talking about this, I could talk about this for a very long time.

516
00:50:23,433 --> 00:50:30,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to move on to one thing that Councilor Collins wanted to take off the table from the agenda.

517
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:37,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So Alicia Lagumbina and then I'm going to try to move on from this discussion and wrap it up.

518
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:39,104
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, Alicia Lagumbina.

519
00:50:40,592 --> 00:51:01,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I did want to highlight something that happened last winter, and that was that our folks that we were working with were well informed of the warming centers, our ability to transport them, and they were unwilling to seek shelter or have an overnight stay outside of their encampment.

520
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:06,593
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were very concerned about their belongings being tampered with.

521
00:51:06,753 --> 00:51:17,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what happened last year was that we had a lot of people using illegal like heating systems.

522
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:23,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had folks starting outdoor fires, which obviously, you know, you can't do.

523
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:33,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did have a fatality behind National Grid of somebody who used a built heating system.

524
00:51:34,773 --> 00:51:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So so folks are pretty serious about

525
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:47,694
[SPEAKER_03]: in our experience with last winter, because I would go home and think about people and be texting them these lists.

526
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, we're fine.

527
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:53,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, how could they be fine?

528
00:51:53,199 --> 00:52:00,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thought of someone taking everything that you belong and trying to get to one of these centers

529
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:07,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't something that we experienced people doing last year.

530
00:52:07,212 --> 00:52:19,763
[SPEAKER_03]: With that being said, the City of Medford historically has opened warming and cooling centers at multiple places throughout the City of Medford.

531
00:52:19,923 --> 00:52:20,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously,

532
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:24,487
[SPEAKER_03]: office hours, we have the senior center, the library.

533
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:32,073
[SPEAKER_03]: The only overnight one, which probably isn't the most favorable to folks, is the police station.

534
00:52:32,133 --> 00:52:33,474
[SPEAKER_03]: That is always an option.

535
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:40,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have spoken with any of our officers, they've had people in the lobby overnight.

536
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:53,086
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are able to transport as well as I believe historically our EMTs were going to be able to transport folks.

537
00:52:53,966 --> 00:53:04,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our two biggest homeless agencies that advocate for folks are housing families and ABCD and so last year we teamed up

538
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: with PDS to make sure that they were funded so that folks weren't like, well, where are these agencies that are supposed to help?

539
00:53:12,377 --> 00:53:15,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And they aren't based in Medford.

540
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:26,989
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually our contribution to these agencies that give them the ability to serve Medford, not these are the agencies they should serve Medford.

541
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And so last year, we did

542
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:40,983
[SPEAKER_03]: a really good job, we as in PDS did a really good job of giving a lot more money to the agencies that we suggested and are the most highly utilized.

543
00:53:41,943 --> 00:53:55,487
[SPEAKER_03]: With that being said, ARPA is no longer a thing, you know, having people fill out applications with their circumstances due to COVID really isn't accessible to people and

544
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:59,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the experiences that we've had.

545
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:10,035
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have an outreach team through ABCD that got more funding this year, had no very minimal funding last year.

546
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:22,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have Elliott Path, which is the co-occurring mental health and homelessness agency that's supposed to serve this area.

547
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:30,469
[SPEAKER_03]: But the applications are so tough that most people aren't eligible for most things.

548
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:35,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So while I have you here, I just want to give you some real-time information.

549
00:54:35,832 --> 00:54:45,760
[SPEAKER_03]: The point in time count, which counts those who are on house once a year, that happened and

550
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:52,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure that we have historically been a part of that, as we don't have those resources here.

551
00:54:53,550 --> 00:55:11,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unclear whether those who are in shelter with the last address in Medford are being counted or whatnot, but historically we haven't had any numbers to support us getting this kind of funding and whatnot, despite our own data that we've been collecting.

552
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:15,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And Penny said in the chat also that anyone who is

553
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:17,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

554
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:32,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who's a part of our recovery coach program and is in our recovery readiness program, they are able to receive a scholarship of up to, you know, two to three months of recovery home scholarship.

555
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:40,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have emergency shelter, what we call the emergency shelter funding for folks who are in recovery and looking to get into recovery houses.

556
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:43,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things that we have been working on.

557
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:47,892
[SPEAKER_03]: with our people.

558
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:51,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

559
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:54,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you so much.

560
00:55:56,116 --> 00:56:05,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, where are the communities that were using illegal, where physically were they, that were using illegal heating systems?

561
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:10,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Councilor Lohmann, can you repeat that question?

562
00:56:11,053 --> 00:56:18,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just asking Alicia where physically the communities that were using illegal eating systems were that refused to go into shelters.

563
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:25,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a lot of mapping and honestly, it's it's hearsay, right?

564
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:32,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the police department will tell us we have people still with the C click fix, which I think is just

565
00:56:34,216 --> 00:56:57,066
[SPEAKER_03]: different so we'll get see quick fix there is a homeless encampment here so you're looking on the you're looking mainly like where Wellington station is that whole line of where the train tracks are into Malden you're looking anywhere under I-93 you're looking at certain parks that people will

566
00:56:58,607 --> 00:57:00,968
[SPEAKER_03]: stay at overnight and you'll see their belongings.

567
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:12,731
[SPEAKER_03]: We're less talking about folks who are the folks at the Wellington train station who are kind of we think that people come here.

568
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the technical name of it is.

569
00:57:19,488 --> 00:57:22,009
[SPEAKER_03]: those looking for money from cars that are driving by.

570
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:30,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had had reports of people in that forestry in the target side of that area as well.

571
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:35,155
[SPEAKER_03]: But there has been a lot of construction on the riverway.

572
00:57:35,215 --> 00:57:42,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of disrupt where we know and have visited folks who are living in tents.

573
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:45,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was that tent that popped up.

574
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,341
[SPEAKER_03]: in West Bedford on the median.

575
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:58,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so we did have a map and we were tracking and we were outreaching, but we just we don't have the capacity.

576
00:57:58,545 --> 00:58:00,166
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the funded positions to do.

577
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:16,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd also like to point out that it's not in the Office of Prevention's best interest to put on a public meeting where people are located in great detail, because it's our job to build relationships with them and to support them.

578
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:23,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't want to put that kind of stuff in a public meeting, but we're happy to discuss general areas, which Alicia did.

579
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:29,013
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want to make sure that that's very clear that we're here to support these people to get help and

580
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,733
[SPEAKER_09]: not draw eyes towards them.

581
00:58:31,753 --> 00:58:44,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you before I send anything too specific and honestly our ATMs are places where folks will find solace.

582
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:59,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so much for giving us so much of your time and sort of an overview of our situation.

583
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:03,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot more to say.

584
00:59:03,024 --> 00:59:12,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Board of Health and the Planning Department does so much excellent work.

585
00:59:15,462 --> 00:59:20,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really, really appreciate your partnership as we began talking about this.

586
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:25,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's something that's very important to me.

587
00:59:25,612 --> 00:59:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I'm probably going to harp on about for quite a while.

588
00:59:28,996 --> 00:59:33,961
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize in advance for everybody to everybody forever.

589
00:59:34,121 --> 00:59:35,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's very, I think.

590
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important.

591
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:39,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate everything that you do.

592
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:41,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really thank you for being here.

593
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:47,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that we can continue the conversation and make some progress.

594
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And Councilor Collins.

595
00:59:56,024 --> 01:00:00,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, my headset was still muted, even though my computer was not.

596
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:03,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Chair Lazzaro.

597
01:00:03,807 --> 01:00:05,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I second everything that you said.

598
01:00:05,207 --> 01:00:06,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I echo everything you said.

599
01:00:06,088 --> 01:00:22,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much to all of our members of city staff for being here for tonight and for really grounding the beginning of this conversation in your years of experience and expertise in helping us frame this conversation that prioritizes

600
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:35,697
[SPEAKER_10]: contributing material benefit to these neighbors and framing this conversation in dignity for everybody that this serves to touch dignity and safety.

601
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:41,459
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure this will be the first of, I hope, many meetings and conversations about this project.

602
01:00:41,859 --> 01:00:46,080
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounded like we were trying to wrap this up for now because it's getting late.

603
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would put forward a motion to keep this paper in committee.

604
01:00:52,303 --> 01:01:05,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know Chair Lazari did note I do have a paper that I'd love to take off the table if we have time for tonight, but I know that we have another action item to review the governing agenda, so I would be happy for us to proceed to that first.

605
01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:15,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that Councilor Collins has prepared some materials for taking something off of the table for tonight.

606
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:31,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins, would you prefer to wait since it's already 8.15-ish or would you rather, would you like to wait or do you want to do it tonight?

607
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:33,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the question, Chair Lazzaro.

608
01:01:33,224 --> 01:01:36,167
[SPEAKER_10]: If we are going to continue and try to get through the second

609
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:42,212
[SPEAKER_10]: action discussion item for this meeting during this meeting, which is going over the governing agenda.

610
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:48,114
[SPEAKER_10]: The ordinance that I was hoping to take off the table is included in the governing agenda because it was assigned a paper number last term.

611
01:01:49,914 --> 01:02:01,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I might see if my fellow Councilors would entertain a motion on it if we get to it during that section of the agenda, instead of taking it off the table as a separate paper.

612
01:02:03,277 --> 01:02:04,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm seeing confused looks.

613
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:06,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel confused.

614
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:11,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so, um.

615
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:15,868
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me so on the motion.

616
01:02:16,188 --> 01:02:20,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a 2nd on Councilor Collins motion to keep this paper in committee?

617
01:02:20,792 --> 01:02:22,134
[SPEAKER_07]: 2nd.

618
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:35,619
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to keep paper 240-010, I'm tired, it's been a long day.

619
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:46,525
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to keep paper 24-023 in committee, seconded by Councilor Leming.

620
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:52,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

621
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:53,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

622
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:55,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

623
01:02:56,032 --> 01:02:56,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

624
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

625
01:02:58,713 --> 01:02:58,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

626
01:03:00,393 --> 01:03:01,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

627
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:01,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

628
01:03:03,014 --> 01:03:03,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

629
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:04,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

630
01:03:04,895 --> 01:03:05,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair Lazzaro.

631
01:03:06,175 --> 01:03:06,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

632
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:08,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

633
01:03:10,017 --> 01:03:16,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So next, would we, okay, let's, I would like to, yeah, let's, okay.

634
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:21,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

635
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:27,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's go over the Council Governing Agenda.

636
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:43,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper 24-006, offered by President Bears, resolution that each Council Committee review the 2024-2025 Council Governing Agenda as amended in the committee of the whole meeting.

637
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we have a number of papers in committee, including

638
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:55,071
[SPEAKER_02]: One significant resolution to draft a wildlife feeding ordinance.

639
01:03:56,573 --> 01:04:06,364
[SPEAKER_02]: If we would like to discuss that, do we want to go through the other papers first, or do we want to just jump straight to that, Councilor Collins?

640
01:04:12,086 --> 01:04:12,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair Lazzaro, thank you.

641
01:04:13,807 --> 01:04:14,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I defer to you.

642
01:04:15,868 --> 01:04:19,569
[SPEAKER_10]: I am pulling up the draft governing agenda right now just to look at.

643
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:25,952
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of sort of complicated ordinances.

644
01:04:27,052 --> 01:04:33,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the replication ban ordinance, face surveillance ban ordinance.

645
01:04:35,396 --> 01:04:40,177
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one that actually that I know that we will not be addressing until

646
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:45,803
[SPEAKER_02]: April, the, uh, Medford police department.

647
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:48,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh, that's not even in here.

648
01:04:48,065 --> 01:04:48,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

649
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:53,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even in here, so never mind if I may.

650
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:53,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

651
01:04:55,192 --> 01:05:00,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, just to offer suggestion, which, you know, um, as chair, I completely leave it up to you.

652
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:02,239
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you like to do with the remainder of our meeting?

653
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:06,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we, if we'd like to set a goal end time, I think that would be.

654
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:16,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, fine as well, but I know a number of the projects that are in the governing agenda under public health and community safety committee, and I'd be happy to share my screen if that's helpful.

655
01:05:17,919 --> 01:05:19,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, a number of these.

656
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:27,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Are new as of this term on a number of them were proposed in the previous term.

657
01:05:27,244 --> 01:05:34,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So, depending on how we want to spend the remainder of our time, I'd be happy to, um, assist with kind of quickly running through.

658
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,712
[SPEAKER_10]: that list of projects to provide a general overview and perhaps the timelines.

659
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be great.

660
01:05:44,195 --> 01:06:03,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy to, probably best to discuss the new ones quickly if we'd like, and then maybe decide what the timeline would be for probably as many as we can.

661
01:06:05,778 --> 01:06:08,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Councilor Collins, that would be great.

662
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, before we do that, though, yes, Councilor Leming?

663
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:20,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just asking if we could, Chair, if we'd be able to screen share the governing agenda, if one of us has it.

664
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:24,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it up, Chair Lazzaro.

665
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:27,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah.

666
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:29,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to make you something?

667
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,714
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think we're all co-hosts.

668
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:32,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

669
01:06:33,475 --> 01:06:34,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can screen share.

670
01:06:45,276 --> 01:06:46,617
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, is my screen viewable?

671
01:06:47,697 --> 01:06:47,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

672
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:52,199
Great.

673
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to talk through any of these projects, if that would be helpful.

674
01:06:57,762 --> 01:06:59,683
[SPEAKER_10]: One's from the previous term, myself or Councilor Tseng.

675
01:07:00,904 --> 01:07:04,586
[SPEAKER_10]: But Councilor Lazzaro, I'll wait for your direction on which would be helpful.

676
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:09,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to grab the steering wheel more than I already have.

677
01:07:11,414 --> 01:07:12,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, that would be great.

678
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I appreciate it.

679
01:07:13,815 --> 01:07:14,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

680
01:07:14,215 --> 01:07:15,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, full disclosure here.

681
01:07:15,836 --> 01:07:19,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I really was very focused on the warming center, um, discussion.

682
01:07:19,797 --> 01:07:23,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so I'm happy for anybody else to take the steering.

683
01:07:24,379 --> 01:07:27,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, but yes.

684
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.

685
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, let's dive in.

686
01:07:31,161 --> 01:07:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So the focus of the public health and community safety committee, um, is emergency response, public health.

687
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:40,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Inspectional Services and Animal Control.

688
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:52,843
[SPEAKER_02]: The departments that are relevant are Health, Police, Fire, Building, DPW, and Civil Defense, so it does encompass a lot of significant departments in the city.

689
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:57,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Relevant City Ordinances being Chapter 6, Animals.

690
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 10, Buildings and Building Regulations.

691
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:04,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 22, Civil Emergencies.

692
01:08:05,346 --> 01:08:07,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 34, Emergency Services.

693
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 42, Fire Prevention and Protection.

694
01:08:10,109 --> 01:08:11,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 46, Floods.

695
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:14,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Chapter 54, Law Enforcement.

696
01:08:14,593 --> 01:08:16,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And Chapter 58, Offenses.

697
01:08:17,675 --> 01:08:21,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And Relevant City Regulations, Board of Health Rules and Regulations.

698
01:08:23,906 --> 01:08:28,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, Councilor Callahan has to take off and that is fine.

699
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being here.

700
01:08:29,111 --> 01:08:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

701
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:35,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, major projects now we just discussed the warming center.

702
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper 24-023.

703
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:50,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And the goal of that is to start talking about it as soon as possible and for it to pilot during next quarter.

704
01:08:51,486 --> 01:08:53,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just talked about that for an hour.

705
01:08:53,287 --> 01:08:55,028
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to not talk about it anymore.

706
01:08:56,469 --> 01:09:01,232
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so alternative emergency response and civil.

707
01:09:01,412 --> 01:09:02,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, can you scroll down slightly?

708
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:03,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Oversight, is that what it says?

709
01:09:04,884 --> 01:09:24,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd be happy to speak to as I've probably spent, second only to President Bears, I've probably spent the most time staring at this document of the Councilors assembled in assisting compiling ideas from

710
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,761
[SPEAKER_10]: from all of from all of the Councilors, you and I included.

711
01:09:29,781 --> 01:09:36,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy to speak to this is one that I submitted and just quickly run through some of the others.

712
01:09:36,985 --> 01:09:47,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Eternity emergency response slash civilian oversight, being a topic that has been brought up to myself as one Councilor by constituents many times.

713
01:09:49,591 --> 01:09:53,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of I know that we're kind of broadly having a conversation about where these projects will occur.

714
01:09:55,197 --> 01:09:56,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Over the course of the two years.

715
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,726
[SPEAKER_10]: So this one we have a goal date of starting not immediately perhaps beginning this conversation in July.

716
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:33,608
[SPEAKER_10]: perhaps with the conversation that we were just having, the hypothetical proposed warming center, ideally a regional collaboration, something that we're starting to do in Medford, and also I think dovetails with the resiliency hub work that several of our city staff were just talking about when we were talking about this need to kind of plug some of our social service needs here in Medford.

717
01:10:34,748 --> 01:10:36,049
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm interested to see how this

718
01:10:38,573 --> 01:10:42,634
[SPEAKER_10]: this item on the governing agenda evolves as our conversation about the warming center evolves.

719
01:10:46,454 --> 01:10:46,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

720
01:10:46,995 --> 01:10:48,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

721
01:10:48,115 --> 01:10:52,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to speak to any of the ordinances briefly, if helpful.

722
01:10:52,896 --> 01:10:58,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, this section is just about a half dozen.

723
01:10:58,957 --> 01:11:05,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we already covered the plant medicine decriminalization ordinance because we passed it on Tuesday.

724
01:11:07,745 --> 01:11:09,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Councilor Leming, would you like to speak to that?

725
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:15,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it bugs me because it's not an ordinance.

726
01:11:15,591 --> 01:11:16,351
[SPEAKER_07]: The resolution.

727
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:16,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

728
01:11:17,872 --> 01:11:21,575
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did submit that as an ordinance.

729
01:11:21,835 --> 01:11:23,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is my language.

730
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make sure that it's updated.

731
01:11:27,059 --> 01:11:27,419
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

732
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:28,000
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

733
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to put that out there.

734
01:11:31,122 --> 01:11:31,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

735
01:11:35,294 --> 01:11:50,847
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the overgrowth ordinance, which I believe was tabled at the last meeting but do we want to talk individual ordinances here or just kind of summarize, we can talk about individual ordinances Councilor Collins do you want to jump in on this one.

736
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:52,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

737
01:11:52,453 --> 01:12:09,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the overgrowth ordinance was born out of conversations I've had with constituents and staff about the need to empower city staff to do enforcement around essentially when vegetation on private property is grown so long that it is obstructing the public way.

738
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:13,532
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, a hedge or, you know,

739
01:12:14,269 --> 01:12:19,651
[SPEAKER_10]: plants in somebody's yard that are so overgrown that they're spilling into the sidewalk and people can't walk in the sidewalk.

740
01:12:19,691 --> 01:12:21,552
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to cross the street.

741
01:12:21,572 --> 01:12:27,814
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to push their stroller in the street, et cetera, just to give city staff the ability to enforce around that because currently they don't.

742
01:12:27,914 --> 01:12:29,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So that should be fairly straightforward.

743
01:12:30,616 --> 01:12:31,576
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the idea there.

744
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:40,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Similarly, paper 23449 is, again, about giving city staff the authority to do enforcement around

745
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:46,250
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, not around activities when they become problematic.

746
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:51,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Similar to the overgrowth ordinance, it's not about policing everybody for your plants must be about a certain height.

747
01:12:51,475 --> 01:12:56,200
[SPEAKER_10]: It's if something is happening to such an extent that it's becoming a problem, we should be able to do something about that.

748
01:12:56,841 --> 01:13:03,287
[SPEAKER_10]: With the wildlife feeding ordinance, this is a measure that would empower city officials to

749
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:12,932
[SPEAKER_10]: issue warnings or tickets if persistent wildlife feeding is really creating nuisances or health hazards on private property.

750
01:13:13,892 --> 01:13:26,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So after we run through the governing agenda I might put forward a motion to authorize myself as ordinance sponsor to circulate a draft ordinance to the members of this committee and city staff for comment ahead of this next committee meeting.

751
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:30,640
[SPEAKER_10]: After that regulating the retail

752
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:33,976
[SPEAKER_10]: reading facilities.

753
01:13:34,716 --> 01:13:42,481
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no draft for this yet, this has come out of another, this has also come out of constituent request for this regulation.

754
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:52,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Councilor Tseng, would you like to speak to the gender affirming care and reproductive health care protection ordinances?

755
01:13:53,507 --> 01:13:54,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.

756
01:13:55,209 --> 01:14:13,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, at a previous meeting, we, I think, decided to combine this ordinance, or these two different ordinance ideas, because a lot of communities around us have done it that way, and their ordinances have gone through legal reviews.

757
01:14:15,809 --> 01:14:19,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, we have a draft that we reviewed already.

758
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:25,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's in a place where folks are pretty alright with it.

759
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:32,672
[SPEAKER_00]: We only didn't move forward on it because we were busy getting feedback from the mayor's office about whether we had

760
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:46,720
[SPEAKER_00]: basically checking with Mayor Lungo-Koehn to see if we had already passed an ordinance like this, which then Councilor Caraviello said we did, but the mayor's office responded to the council saying that we didn't, so we should move forward on it.

761
01:14:47,641 --> 01:14:54,365
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also at that time waiting to see what the state had done on it, because the state was acting on things at the same time.

762
01:14:54,905 --> 01:15:00,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the feedback that we got from activist groups was that

763
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:08,156
[SPEAKER_00]: that it would be helpful for the city to move alongside the state on it.

764
01:15:08,316 --> 01:15:18,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I also reached out based on motions that made at that meeting to health care providers in Medford because this would affect them in terms of protecting their doctors.

765
01:15:21,423 --> 01:15:25,765
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe Harvard Vanguard did not reach back, but Tufts Medicine did.

766
01:15:26,725 --> 01:15:28,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a few meetings on it.

767
01:15:28,305 --> 01:15:36,468
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very, very enthusiastic about it, very happy that this city council is looking to pass an ordinance in addition to state efforts as well.

768
01:15:37,649 --> 01:15:41,770
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I believe we can be ready to move on it soon.

769
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:48,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to redistribute some updated ordinance language to this committee.

770
01:15:49,213 --> 01:15:49,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

771
01:15:49,773 --> 01:15:50,193
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

772
01:15:51,269 --> 01:15:53,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay, uh, oversight and engagement.

773
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:58,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We have surveillance ordinance reporting, uh, Councilor Collins.

774
01:16:01,412 --> 01:16:02,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

775
01:16:04,013 --> 01:16:08,514
[SPEAKER_10]: A ordinance that we passed in 2023, the community control over surveillance.

776
01:16:09,852 --> 01:16:20,241
[SPEAKER_10]: over public surveillance ordinance requires the annual submission of reports from the city agencies that employ surveillance technology about those uses.

777
01:16:21,062 --> 01:16:36,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is just an annual procedure of meeting with the agency that submit those reports and discussing them, fielding questions from Councilors in the public, is something that, per the language of the ordinance, belongs with this committee.

778
01:16:37,815 --> 01:17:00,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So as the chair is aware, we have already scheduled the first meeting to go over an annual surveillance report for this committee's April meeting, which I am myself very much looking forward to, to go over Medford Police Department's annual surveillance report, which should only include the use of body-worn cameras for the part of the year leading up to March 2024.

779
01:17:01,102 --> 01:17:05,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And that process will be ongoing on an annual basis.

780
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:12,439
[SPEAKER_10]: This is another sort of maintenance project that has to do with an ordinance passed in the previous term.

781
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:29,590
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as my understanding goes, the implementation process for the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance, which was also passed in 2023, I believe is still being worked on by partners in the Planning Department, the Board of Health, the Office of Outreach and Prevention.

782
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:35,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting the word out about this ordinance was, you know, no small feat to tenants and landlords alike.

783
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:52,654
[SPEAKER_10]: So this project would be to follow up with those partners in how broadcasting the news of this ordinance is going, how upkeep, how uptake is going, and how we can enforce that this ordinance is known about and being followed.

784
01:17:55,282 --> 01:17:57,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this has a goal start date of April.

785
01:17:57,983 --> 01:18:01,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I know our April meeting date, as we just said, is already pretty full.

786
01:18:01,925 --> 01:18:11,870
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe the chair and I can work on scheduling an appropriate date to schedule a meeting to begin to take up this project as well.

787
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:15,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate lofty goals, though.

788
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:19,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I always appreciate big goals.

789
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:29,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a comment from HSNO got slowed down when we had legal review it and there were conflicts in the language.

790
01:18:32,198 --> 01:18:33,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Emergency response equipment.

791
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:37,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, HSNO, I'm not sure what that refers to.

792
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Director Hunt, would you like to speak on that?

793
01:18:40,201 --> 01:18:42,502
[SPEAKER_01]: The housing stability notification ordinance.

794
01:18:42,682 --> 01:18:43,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Got you.

795
01:18:43,809 --> 01:18:50,373
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought we had a finished thing and we decided that we should have the lawyers just look at it.

796
01:18:51,253 --> 01:18:58,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted us to make the language much less understandable by the general public.

797
01:18:58,117 --> 01:19:06,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been trying to rectify their requests and recommendations with our use of simple, clear language.

798
01:19:07,822 --> 01:19:16,166
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of that and turn over a gap in staffing in our office from the person who was heading it up also impacted it.

799
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:19,247
[SPEAKER_01]: But it should be just about ready to go.

800
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:26,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And your your body asking for stuff like that actually kind of when bumps it up on the priority list.

801
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:26,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

802
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:29,492
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to like, well, we'll get to it, but we, you know.

803
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:31,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

804
01:19:31,913 --> 01:19:35,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we appreciate being able to move things along in that manner.

805
01:19:37,614 --> 01:19:38,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, that's good to know.

806
01:19:38,535 --> 01:19:43,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we'll keep, maybe we'll keep April, but maybe, maybe May.

807
01:19:44,741 --> 01:19:46,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins and I will discuss.

808
01:19:48,265 --> 01:19:53,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Emergency response equipment replacement with the lead Councilor TBD.

809
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:58,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anybody have an interest in describing that?

810
01:20:04,059 --> 01:20:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: No takers.

811
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:06,060
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm just going to read through it.

812
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:08,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Lead Councilor, it's TBD.

813
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:11,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Timeline, not a start until January 2025.

814
01:20:13,223 --> 01:20:17,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Review capital plan for funding replacement of equipment for emergency responders.

815
01:20:17,944 --> 01:20:22,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty self-explanatory and something to take up next year.

816
01:20:22,446 --> 01:20:23,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Leming?

817
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:26,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that require knowing what the budget is?

818
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:28,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, I would think so.

819
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

820
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:36,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but also, you know, the budget will most likely be in flux and different at that point.

821
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:41,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll probably be something that we'll be able to better assess closer to.

822
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:45,457
[SPEAKER_02]: 2025 trailers are.

823
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:54,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's my understanding and again, this, of course, the, uh, the parameters of this project would be.

824
01:20:56,488 --> 01:21:02,312
[SPEAKER_10]: put forward by the Councilor that's leading on it, and it's currently listed as no Councilor owning this project.

825
01:21:02,332 --> 01:21:03,793
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just put forward as a good idea.

826
01:21:04,394 --> 01:21:22,988
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't want to speak for whoever leads on this project and their priorities, but it's my understanding that rather than fitting, rather than creating a maintenance plan for emergency equipment based on a particular year's operating schedule, this is more about reconciling our emergency fleet

827
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,022
[SPEAKER_10]: with our capital spending plan, which is a multi-year document.

828
01:21:29,062 --> 01:21:42,306
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that this wouldn't need to wait for the submission of any annual operating budget, but rather be something that we do in parallel with our long-term budget planning collaboration with the administration.

829
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:44,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for clarity.

830
01:21:44,867 --> 01:21:45,427
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

831
01:21:46,327 --> 01:21:46,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

832
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:47,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

833
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:49,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you scroll up just a bit?

834
01:21:49,148 --> 01:21:49,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

835
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:51,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

836
01:21:51,432 --> 01:21:51,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

837
01:21:52,013 --> 01:21:54,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And then review relevant city ordinances and regulations.

838
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:55,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

839
01:21:55,737 --> 01:21:56,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

840
01:21:56,658 --> 01:22:04,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Councilor Collins, would you like to take that paper off of the table and address it now?

841
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:08,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that there's time or do you want to wait for our next meeting?

842
01:22:09,248 --> 01:22:09,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

843
01:22:09,948 --> 01:22:10,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the question.

844
01:22:10,769 --> 01:22:12,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for making space for that project.

845
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:19,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I think at this point, the clerk has helpfully reminded me that I don't need to officially motion to circulate a draft.

846
01:22:20,112 --> 01:22:26,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So if it is all right with the chair, I would love for and I can communicate about this with you offline as well.

847
01:22:26,695 --> 01:22:30,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love for that paper to be listed as an action item for our next meeting.

848
01:22:30,596 --> 01:22:32,337
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the meantime, I will circulate a draft.

849
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:39,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Of the ordinance to the members of this committee and to city staff for their feedback so we can have a more substantive conversation next time.

850
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:40,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

851
01:22:40,241 --> 01:22:43,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plan being that we will review it.

852
01:22:45,163 --> 01:22:54,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Review it in committee at our next meeting, and then it can be voted out and move to the regular if if we decide to move it to the regular after that.

853
01:22:55,369 --> 01:22:57,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a question on my on my behalf.

854
01:22:58,633 --> 01:22:59,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

855
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,055
[SPEAKER_10]: A good question.

856
01:23:00,115 --> 01:23:05,640
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be the first time that we review the draft in this committee.

857
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:09,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Any work and amendments and revisions that we make to the ordinance will be done in this committee.

858
01:23:09,925 --> 01:23:18,153
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when this committee feels that it's ready to be put before the full council, we'll vote it out to a regular session for presumably a vote.

859
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:19,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

860
01:23:19,735 --> 01:23:20,316
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, great.

861
01:23:21,434 --> 01:23:21,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.

862
01:23:23,055 --> 01:23:25,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, is there anything else?

863
01:23:25,837 --> 01:23:29,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any other discussion items?

864
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Councilor Collins.

865
01:23:32,561 --> 01:23:41,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I would motion to receive and place on file 24006, which is the paper to review the governing agenda.

866
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:43,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second?

867
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:47,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

868
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:51,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk, can you call the roll?

869
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:52,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

870
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:57,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang on.

871
01:23:57,363 --> 01:24:00,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, you're disposing of the document if you do that, though.

872
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:06,164
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be the practice that the other committees have been... Okay.

873
01:24:06,765 --> 01:24:09,805
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the committee's call.

874
01:24:09,885 --> 01:24:13,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just... You're disposing of the document if you receive it and place it on file.

875
01:24:13,426 --> 01:24:14,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going in the garbage forever.

876
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be placed on file.

877
01:24:17,006 --> 01:24:17,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We can still see it.

878
01:24:17,706 --> 01:24:18,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

879
01:24:18,607 --> 01:24:19,127
[SPEAKER_08]: That is true.

880
01:24:20,067 --> 01:24:20,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

881
01:24:20,307 --> 01:24:20,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang on a second.

882
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:22,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I will call the roll.

883
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:30,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan is absent, I believe.

884
01:24:31,177 --> 01:24:34,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

885
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:35,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

886
01:24:37,022 --> 01:24:37,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

887
01:24:38,963 --> 01:24:40,064

888
01:24:40,605 --> 01:24:40,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

889
01:24:41,525 --> 01:24:42,346

890
01:24:42,806 --> 01:24:43,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: Chair Lazzaro?

892
01:24:44,688 --> 01:24:44,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

893
01:24:48,826 --> 01:24:52,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, four yes, one absent, motion passes.

894
01:24:52,309 --> 01:24:54,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a motion to adjourn?

895
01:24:55,832 --> 01:24:56,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So moved.

896
01:24:57,153 --> 01:24:57,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

897
01:24:58,574 --> 01:25:03,138
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

898
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Clerk, can you call the roll, please?

899
01:25:08,802 --> 01:25:09,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, hang on a second, please.

900
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:17,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

901

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

903
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:22,393

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Leming.

905
01:25:28,176 --> 01:25:29,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking this is important.

906
01:25:31,138 --> 01:25:31,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

907
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:33,920
