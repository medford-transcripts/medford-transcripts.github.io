Update report.

27
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,899
Before we do that, can we have Mr. Cieri come up and give us just a quick presentation?

28
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,661
Mr. Falcomo, suspension of the rules and other, we may take a paper out of order.

29
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,982
All those in favor say aye.

33
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:44,563
Is Mr. Rocco?

34
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:47,405
Cieri is, okay.

35
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,687
Very exciting day today, we're going to get a report.

36
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:10,250
Good evening, school committee and Mayor McGlynn and Superintendent Belson.

37
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:24,080
I'm very pleased to report that on Monday, June 15th, today, Stanford High School students and staff were visited by Professor Jerome Friedman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1990.

38
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:39,721
The program was supported by the Nobel Laureate's School Visits Program from Quincy, Massachusetts, and students from all science classes were invited to hear Professor Friedman speak about his discoveries in the area of particle physics.

39
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:49,827
More importantly, students had an extraordinarily personal encounter with a unique, genuine, and brilliant scientist of our time.

40
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:54,590
The event was held in the newly renovated Science Lecture Hall

41
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,797
It was an intimate experience for all present.

42
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:16,663
At the conclusion of the lecture, students asked both personal and scientific questions, which touched a number of disciplines and topics, including particle physics, the nature of discovery, ethics, and what college experiences are like.

43
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:22,805
Cafe Electra prepared a wonderful reception event for Professor Friedman.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,283
where students and staff were able to speak even more closely with the Nobel Laureate.

45
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:31,647
And I'd like to thank the Director of Mathematics and Science, Ms.

46
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:37,171
Carolyn Joy, the Headmaster, Dr. Perrella, Director of the Vocational Technical High School, Ms.

47
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:39,713
Heidi Riccio, the Assistant Superintendent, Ms.

48
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,055
Diane Caldwell, the Deputy Superintendent, Ms.

49
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:50,602
Beverly Nelson, and the Superintendent of Schools, Mr. Roy Belson, for their assistance in coordinating the event for the students and faculty of Medford High School.

50
00:03:51,559 --> 00:04:05,550
And I'd also like to acknowledge that the students of Medford High School did a fantastic job with their incredibly insightful questions, very thoughtful comments, and exemplary behavior during the entire event.

51
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:09,474
Mr. Mayor.

52
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:10,535
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

53
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:14,798
Thank you very much for coordinating this and bringing this to our students.

54
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:20,303
I mean, I'm sure that this has inspired many of them to follow in his footsteps in

55
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:24,150
and moving forward with their career.

56
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,612
What was your most memorable piece of the day?

57
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,654
For me, it definitely resonated.

58
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:40,699
His message to the students resonated with them, that he didn't begin his career in science.

59
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,061
He began as an artist.

60
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,342
He had a full scholarship to a pretty exclusive

61
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:58,075
post high school institution in Chicago and elected to go to the University of Chicago and study physics.

62
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:04,742
So he has a really varied background that didn't begin in science.

63
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:08,225
It began elsewhere and came into science.

64
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:10,487
So it was really nice to hear that from him.

65
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:12,449
Mr. Mann.

66
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,071
Mrs. Cunha.

67
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:15,578
Thank you.

68
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:19,579
Thank you for all the hard work, because I know this was not done in a very short time.

69
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,259
I know that it's been months and months of your hard work.

70
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,180
And I know that you and a lot of people are very excited.

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,880
We were very excited to hear about it.

72
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:36,402
I'd like to know the take of, one, the student's enthusiasm when he was speaking.

73
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:42,863
And also, what did he say about the facility itself?

74
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:47,059
He was completely impressed with the facility.

75
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,821
He went to, I believe it was Marshall High School in Chicago.

76
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,602
It's part of a film.

77
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:58,363
I think it's Hoop Dreams or something like that.

78
00:05:58,443 --> 00:05:59,383
So he went to that high school.

79
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:06,205
And when he saw what he was able to view at our high school, he said, this facility is amazing.

80
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:11,147
You know, he had wished he had a facility like this when he was in high school.

81
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:13,819
That clearly resonated with him.

82
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:24,864
But even more importantly, what he saw from the audience and the students themselves were so engaged in that conversation.

83
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:32,007
It's hard to replicate and describe what that's like in a lot of different ways.

84
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:40,231
I can say that the bells were ringing, because they do at the high school, and you could hear a pin drop.

85
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:41,332
The kids didn't move.

86
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:43,923
Not a single one of them.

87
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:44,644
It was amazing.

88
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,367
So definitely they were there.

89
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:55,015
I would love to see a piece of this on our newspapers, on our Facebook page, on our own website.

90
00:06:56,023 --> 00:07:04,587
I think this was an amazing day for a lot of students that were involved, but it was definitely something that I believe our community definitely needs to know about.

91
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:05,628
Mr. Mayor.

92
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:07,469
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

93
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:12,051
Could we please send a thank you note for him to come and speak with our children from the school committee?

94
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:16,954
I think that would be very nice, and maybe that will encourage him to come back again.

95
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:18,495
We'd love that.

96
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:19,615
Thank you, Michael.

97
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:20,636
It's a gentleman.

98
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:20,896
Great job.

99
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,196
Thank you.

100
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,237
Thank you so much.

101
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:23,657
Mr. Belz.

102
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:27,809
Rocco did a great job in acquiring this.

103
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,351
And we also established a good relationship with the person who coordinates the program.

104
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,772
And I suspect we're going to see some more people coming to Medford very soon.

105
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:44,615
But just to give you an idea, this topic was on subatomic particles.

106
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:49,036
So if you didn't know it, you were all made up of quarks.

107
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,758
That's what you are, up quarks, down quarks, and electrons.

108
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,994
Those are the subatomic particles that you're made of.

109
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:58,554
Everything else doesn't matter.

110
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:09,278
It was a very interesting kind of discussion about how the colliders and all these things come together to actually see these things, to actually find these things, these subatomic things.

111
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:12,539
But one of the messages that he gave to the young people, which I thought was really significant,

112
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:18,017
He said, sometimes when you study things, you don't know how you're going to use it or where it's going to take you.

113
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:23,139
But knowledge, studying knowledge for its own sake, often leads to things.

114
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,921
So today, we have many things that we take for granted.

115
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:31,883
But when they were first studied, they had no application whatsoever.

116
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,665
And they didn't make sense to anybody else except the scientists who worked with them.

117
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:40,146
And the youngsters were so engaged and so

118
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:53,170
feeling strong with this man, because this man was so engaging and so warm to the youngsters, so interested in what they had to ask, that it really was an exciting experience.

119
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,611
I wish we could have all shared it again, but maybe the next time when he comes in or someone comes in like that.

120
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:01,333
But just remember when someone asks you what you are, you just tell them I'm a simple clerk.

121
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:03,834
Native clerks.

122
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:04,874
And everything else doesn't matter.

123
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:06,695
On behalf of all the members of the school committee, yeah.

124
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:10,426
We know this, we listened to Rocco the other night at the budget hearing.

125
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:10,806
Okay?

126
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,206
On the motion of the report be accepted and placed on file.

127
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,067
All those in favor say aye.

128
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:16,347
Aye.

129
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:16,527

Aye.

Aye.

188

Aye.

189
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:27,489
Aye.

190
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,229
Aye.

191
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:28,409
Aye.

192
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:28,549
Aye.

193
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:28,669
Aye.

194
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:28,969
Aye.

195
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:29,089
Aye.

196
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:29,269
Aye.

197
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:29,469
Aye.

198
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:29,589
Aye.

199
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:29,809
Aye.

200
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:30,109
Aye.

201
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:30,209
Aye.

202
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:30,489
Aye.

203
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:30,609

205
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:31,469
Aye.

206
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:31,649
Aye.

207
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:31,789
Aye.

208
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:31,889
Aye.

209
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:32,049
Aye.

210
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:32,229
Aye.

211
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:32,489
Aye.

212
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:32,630
Aye.

213
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,110
Aye.

214
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,290
Aye.

215
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:33,630
Aye.

216
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:33,790
Aye.

217
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:33,930
Aye.

218
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,050
Aye.

219
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,290
Aye.

220
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,410
Aye

221
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:40,936
the former director of social studies, will you all please rise and join us in a moment of silence.

222
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,210
On that motion, all in favor say aye.

223
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,970
Opposed, none.

224
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,372
The resolution is adopted.

225
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:02,195
Update report on the capital improvements to school facilities, Mr. Superintendent.

226
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:08,530
Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, our Director of Finance and Administration is going to deliver this report.

227
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:13,534
We wanted to give you an idea of some of the terrific things that have been done over the last several years.

228
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:23,741
And we also give you an idea of some of the important things that were done this year to respond to elements in our schools that needed substantial involvement this year.

229
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:28,644
To give you an idea, sometimes during budget hearing, you would ask some of these questions, and so I'm going to call upon Pat to

230
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:34,790
Go through that list with you, give you an idea of where we spent some money this year and where we have spent money in recent years.

231
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,092
Good evening, Mayor, school committee.

232
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:42,536
Attached, please find a capital improvements list covering the years 2001 through 2015.

233
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:49,461
Additionally, find a list of FY15 maintenance and operations, emergency repairs, and special projects.

234
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:53,905
Fiscal year 2015 was a very busy one within the school district.

235
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:59,309
Planned projects, such as the pool and the new boilers of the high school, are in the final closeout paper stages.

236
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:09,374
Emergencies noted are the new water heaters at both the Roberts and the Columbus Elementary Schools, and the replacement of five-unit ventilators at MHS on the second floor.

237
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:20,080
Other emergency expenses were incurred as professionals were hired to clean up, dry out post-flooding at MHS and the McGlynn Elementary, and one fire at the Volk.

238
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,001
And that was the auto shop.

239
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:28,685
Further repairs included new handrails at the Curtis Tufts, and postponing additional handrail work at the building's side entrance

240
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:31,596
providing ADA compliant entrance assistance.

241
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:39,099
Additional repair and renovations improved the educational experience at the Vogue and allowed for a mock apartment in the special education area.

242
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:45,862
Other repair and renovations are continually ongoing within the buildings to include painting, repairs, and general upkeep.

243
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:53,065
All of the above would not be possible without the excellent group that we employ in our buildings and grounds department led by John McLaughlin.

244
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,026
Any questions for me?

245
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:56,286
Mr. Chairman?

246
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:57,667
Mr. Schoenig.

247
00:11:58,628 --> 00:11:58,688
Ms.

248
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,870
Velia, are there any capital improvements planned for next school year?

249
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,452
At this time, we're gathering our list.

250
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:09,014
And we have meetings beginning tomorrow to start putting priorities in place.

251
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:11,275
And the summer's very short, as you know.

252
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:16,538
So we're going to list everything by priority and by price and deal with the things that are most significant to the district.

253
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:19,399
Is the entrance rate of the high school on that list by any chance?

254
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:20,320
Do you mean the?

255
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,440
Yes.

256
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:22,021
Yes.

257
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:22,781
Thank you.

258
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:24,102
Thank you.

259
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,780
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

260
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,321
All in favor say aye.

261
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:27,421
Aye.

262
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,861
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

263
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,281
All in favor say aye.

264
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:29,401
Aye.

265
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,821
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

266
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,621
All in favor say aye.

267
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:31,701
Aye.

268
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,142
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

269
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:33,602
All in favor say aye.

270
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:33,682
Aye.

271
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,122
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

272
00:12:35,142 --> 00:12:35,702
All in favor say aye.

273
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:35,802
Aye.

274
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,203
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

275
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:44,824
All in favor say aye.

276
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:44,924
Aye.

277
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,845
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

278
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:47,945
All in favor say aye.

279
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:48,025
Aye.

280
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,445
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

281
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:49,865
All in favor say aye.

282
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:49,945
Aye.

283
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,786
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

284
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:52,286
All in favor say aye.

285
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:52,366
Aye.

286
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,566
The motion of Mr. Schapelle be accepted and placed on file.

287
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:53,726
All

288
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:56,964
And Jeanne Irwin is with her.

289
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,595
Jeanne is the person working on the implementation of the

290
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,860
Good evening again.

291
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:15,384
An internal task force, and the list was provided for you, reviewed the needs of our school system with regard to the management of student information data and state compliance.

292
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:22,806
We provided you with a PowerPoint presentation that Gene provided for you, and we'll go into that next.

293
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:27,688
Our current system, I-PASS, no longer provides us with the requisite capacity to meet our needs.

294
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,730
I-PASS was merged with a larger entity, and they have not maintained certification with the state.

295
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:44,389
What led us to seek out other alternatives were what we called the slide the drivers for change.

296
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:51,212
I-PASS has demonstrated significant incompetence for service and workflows since being acquired by this parent company.

297
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,673
They've been virtually unreachable.

298
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:57,774
Unable to file state reports this year and had to complete them manually.

299
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:03,877
This is mandated as of September of this year that they have to be filed through a system called SIF.

300
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:10,047
And we were unable to do that with them, and thus that caused them to be decertified with the state.

301
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:14,028
It is not only Medford, but other communities as well.

302
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:19,690
Currently, Harris I-pass is decertified by the state for incompetences and inadequacies.

303
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:25,252
Since being acquired by Harris, they have increased their cost by 20% and decreased their service.

304
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:28,934
They have outdated capabilities and inadequate systems.

305
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:32,695
I believe you heard from Tony Vento, the school nurse, she's still

306
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,888
They're still using reports from 2010, which were changed in 2013.

307
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:39,969
So they haven't changed them in the last five years.

308
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:49,311
Other systems are much more complete, which include HR attendance modules that would alleviate the need for additional programs and redundancies.

309
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:56,353
The next slide was just basically our process that we did during this whole school year.

310
00:14:56,373 --> 00:15:00,054
I contacted the leading three companies.

311
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,390
within the state for school information management systems.

312
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,272
We had them come in and we developed this focus group, which you have the list of.

313
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:11,295
We had them come in, do their demonstration.

314
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:16,238
We had everybody in the room to ask pertinent questions that was going to be important to their department.

315
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,941
Then we had the leading two companies.

316
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:26,665
There was one company right off the bat we knew wasn't going to meet our needs, was woefully inept, basically.

317
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:43,906
And the other two companies, we brought them back for a full day that we had departments, myself, Pat, whether it be Tony Vento, meet with them for the full day and get really in depth in the program and ask the questions that we needed to ask to make sure it had the capabilities and capacities that we were looking for.

318
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:55,035
And then we made a recommendation as a focus group, a final recommendation to go with the company called School Brains, which also happens to be the recommended company by the state.

319
00:15:55,604 --> 00:16:03,628
It is different than being on the state contract because the two finalists, which was Aspen X2 and School Brains, are both on the state contract.

320
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:09,891
But this School Brains has a very different state contract that was initiated by the DESE last year.

321
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:15,233
They went through an extremely rigorous RFP process to acquire them.

322
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:21,657
And basically, our price will be based on the enrollment overall for the state.

323
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:24,518
So the more cities and towns that join School Brains,

324
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:27,304
the lower that our rate will be.

325
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:34,907
And so we spoke, and I spoke with references for all the companies in different communities that use them.

326
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:38,449
The next slide is a comparative criteria.

327
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:44,331
This is kind of what, as a focus group, what we identified was important to the departments.

328
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:49,113
And so you can just see a check off box as far as which companies did what.

329
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,481
They were very comparable.

330
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:57,386
There were some that were better than others in one area, and then the other company was better in another area.

331
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:06,192
But we did identify with School Brains that it was going to be able to meet our needs, as well as Tony Vento and School Health, which is a big win.

332
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:13,198
SIF performance rating.

333
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:16,100
This was actually a slide given to us by the state.

334
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:24,168
The state analyzed how everybody, all the different districts did their reporting this year, and they analyzed and ranked the companies that did the best.

335
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,151
So you'll see that School Brains was ranked number one.

336
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:39,584
It had four and a half stars, whereas IMG is at number six, and it has a. Next slide is the cost.

337
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:46,753
And after the implementation year, the per pupil cost is actually going to be virtually identical to what we're paying right now.

338
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:52,194
So we just have to get over that implementation year, which Pat has already budgeted for.

339
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:53,975
Okay.

340
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:55,095
Mr. Mayor.

341
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:56,955
Mr. Falco.

342
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:57,776
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

343
00:17:58,176 --> 00:17:59,956
Thank you very much for your report.

344
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:03,017
First of all, I like the process that you went through.

345
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:03,717
That was very good.

346
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:08,838
It seems like you had a lot of people included throughout the district, which I think is definitely beneficial.

347
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:11,072
It seems like it's a good package.

348
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:12,393
It seems like it's very robust.

349
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,453
I like how it includes the health, the health component.

350
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:16,994
Um, so I think that that's great too.

351
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:18,814
I just had questions about the cost.

352
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,715
So I know we have budgeted some money for that.

353
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:29,957
And, uh, but, um, with regard to the negotiated state contract at a per pupil cost, can you talk more about that?

354
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:30,257
I guess.

355
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:36,819
So, so did you say depending on how many school districts, so where do they cut that off?

356
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,279
I guess, I mean, is it, is it like as a,

357
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:45,915
September 1st, how many school districts enroll, or is it just like, is it ongoing and do we get like rebates off of that, I guess?

358
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:47,977
There'll be no rebate the first year.

359
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:54,742
You know, whatever the price is when we sign on will be our price that we sign on, but we'll see a greater savings the next year as more schools going on.

360
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:58,825
And it's interesting the note that are leaving.

361
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,768
I pass and School Brains is their choice.

362
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:04,770
So the more that sign up, the better off it is for us.

363
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,032
So we get through our implementation period.

364
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:11,825
and we are ready to go live July 1, then we'll know our rate.

365
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,586
And then we'll have that rate secure for the next year.

366
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,686
And they'll give that to us in time for budget season.

367
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:16,986
OK.

368
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:17,607
Great.

369
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:30,011
And as far as, do we know from, I guess, a user standpoint about how user-friendly this is with regard to, from, I guess, a parent's perspective and from a teacher's perspective?

370
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:34,633
Out of actually all the three programs, this was the most user-friendly.

371
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:55,446
to the whole group, the whole focus group, was that it was kind of a unanimous vote that for parents, the student interface, the teacher interface, there was just one portal that teachers can link their website, if they have their own websites, that they have the, you know, students do different assignments and so forth, and they can link that right through.

372
00:19:55,466 --> 00:20:00,110
So all they're doing is logging onto School Brains, and they're going to, it's like a central portal for everything.

373
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,891
It's very Windows.

374
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,412
It's very, very user-friendly.

375
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:16,104
We, you know, the other company that we were considering, Aspen X2, is, you know, maybe had a little bit more complex capabilities to it, but as far as user-friendliness, it really wasn't.

376
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:23,887
And that was coming from, you know, some tech people that are very familiar with the technology and going, you know, I don't think the average user is going to be able to use this.

377
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:27,648
School Brains definitely is going to be far superior.

378
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:28,568
Okay, great.

379
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:30,249
Thank you for your question.

380
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:32,089
Thank you very much for your answers.

381
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:32,490
Mr. Mayor.

382
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,790
Mrs. Goodell.

383
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:35,424
Thank you for the report.

384
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:36,704
I totally appreciate this.

385
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:40,207
And just to continue on with what Mr. Falco was talking about.

386
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:46,551
So the capability of this, first of all, we have, you were saying that it's very user friendly.

387
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:55,336
So for parents and students, I'm going to throw out here, maybe throw you to the superintendent.

388
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:07,967
Am I understanding correctly then that all elementary, middle, high school, Curtis Tufts teachers will be using this so parents could get information and students could get information from this?

389
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:17,549
As per our discussion at a committee of the whole meeting, um, the system we're looking to put in place is much more user friendly.

390
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:23,210
It will encourage more people to use it because I think they'll find that it's an easy way to take,

391
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:27,119
information they put in and transmit it or get information back.

392
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,679
It'll be to their advantage.

393
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,201
But as far as mandating its use, that's part of negotiations.

394
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:35,441
So that's in our negotiations package.

395
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:38,742
And, you know, we're going to have to encourage people to use it.

396
00:21:38,782 --> 00:21:40,603
But as far as mandating it goes, we need

397
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:44,242
that will be dealing with it on a different basis.

398
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:44,523
Okay.

399
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:50,326
And this program then will encompass everything.

400
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:57,229
It's like from the health, from administration, from parents to students, from homework to grades to everything.

401
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,053
This company also has, you know, has does as builds.

402
00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:07,475
So as we move along and we see something is lacking, they'll work with us to approve it.

403
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:08,215
Okay.

404
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:11,217
And I also, I also know that at the beginning, especially,

405
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:17,962
I passed, it was really difficult for parents sometimes to actually, you know, link in.

406
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,604
It was like it would take days sometimes.

407
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:26,469
I know it got better, but I'm hoping that this would be easier for parents to get, to link on.

408
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:29,172
Is that what I'm understanding?

409
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,394
There's going to be an initial, you know, transition and setup period, but once that

410
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:37,044
is through, it's going to be instantaneous.

411
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,625
I mean, there will still be somebody that's a point of approval.

412
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:46,107
Like, I have to go through the approvals of any parent that assigns for an IPAS account, just for security's sake.

413
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,967
You want to make sure everything matches.

414
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,888
But it's instantaneous, basically.

415
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:51,068
OK.

416
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:51,829
Perfect.

417
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:52,509
Thank you.

418
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:54,429
Mr. Mayor?

419
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:54,610
Ms.

420
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,250
De Benedetto.

421
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,770
Hi.

422
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,310
Thank you.

423
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,791
I work at a school that just transferred over there, the whole system.

424
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:02,292
And I work with Sims, and I know

425
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,351
parent piece is very important.

426
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:07,214
So I suggest trainings for parents.

427
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:11,277
And your data is only as good as how accurate it is.

428
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:25,049
So what I suggest maybe is maybe registration, like having parents re-register so that way they register right on and that the current address and current phone number and everything is actually updated.

429
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:27,191
So I don't know if you could do like a computer lab

430
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:33,132
at each school on open house night or something and have parents going in and using that, just a suggestion.

431
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:41,258
Because if you're transferring old data to new software, it's still no good.

432
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:50,925
So any way you can get hands-on information from a parent, I find that that's good, as well as the training for the parents to use the program.

433
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,005
I strongly suggest that it should be more than a suggestion to our district teachers and staff to use this program.

434
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:08,874
It should be a requirement for everybody throughout the district to transfer all of their information onto this because it's only good if we utilize the program in its full capacity.

435
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:15,239
I also wanted to ask you a question about the ability to link and integrate with outside programs.

436
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,901
Is Naviance going to be up and running day one?

437
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:20,683
Is the special education program

438
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:24,657
Are they going to sync every night or how often are they syncing?

439
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:27,278
How often is that data updated?

440
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,019
I have a lot because I work in it.

441
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:30,920
We determine that.

442
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,301
So, I mean, it could be nightly, it could be weekly.

443
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:39,923
We, you know, the food services in the back there with Nutri-Kids, Naviance, EZIEP, all these programs are going to be up and running.

444
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:42,204
Are they going to be up and running when the program hits the ground?

445
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:42,304
Yes.

446
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:46,546
So, we have an implementation period that we're not going to be going live with for a while.

447
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:49,507
And in that time is when we're going to be backloading

448
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,209
all of that information.

449
00:24:52,030 --> 00:25:07,534
To your point of training inside this implementation cost is our, excuse me, several days of training for each different category, whether it be the teachers, the students, the administrators, the parents, so we can break that up however we want to.

450
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:10,515
so you know for the training aspect that's covered.

451
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:15,936
And I can't really stress enough, updated data is really the key.

452
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:36,400
Once parents have, I know you might not want to open the parent portal immediately to change dresses and phone numbers and stuff like that, and as you build, but that's really going to be a way for parents to keep that information up to date for our nurses and for our teachers for emergency contacts, because then you can print them a class list

453
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:40,045
In that way, they always have them when they're on the schoolyard or wherever they're at.

454
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:44,689
It's just a great program, but we just want to make sure that the data is accurate.

455
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,432
It's only as good as the data is.

456
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:49,113
Right.

457
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,835
The program's only as good as the data is.

458
00:25:51,995 --> 00:26:02,765
So I'm really happy and excited to see this for our district, but I believe, and my colleague has stressed this point repeatedly, because as parents, they have told me about

459
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:08,137
How difficult it is, they have to go to three different sites to find out what homework assignments are for one child.

460
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:12,879
And if you have multiple children, that gets frustrating in the evening.

461
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:17,921
So I really wanna suggest to the superintendent that this should be more than encouraged.

462
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:20,582
It should be a requirement for our staff and our employees.

463
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:24,964
Thank you ladies.

464
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:25,325
Thank you.

465
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:36,744
Report on the new phone system, Mr. Superintendent.

466
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:40,447
Very members of the committee, we have another surprise guest.

467
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:54,878
Pat Healy is going to come up and brief you on the issues of our new phone system, where we're going with it, and the great tour they took the other day to do a lot of inventory and work with a lot of people to move it forward.

468
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:56,619
Good evening.

469
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,525
The Medford Public Schools District, as you all know, has been experiencing considerable problems with the current phone system for the past few years.

470
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:14,856
FY 15 has seen extended periods of time that one or no more buildings have no phone service, leaving this building to use cell phones with limited success as communication devices.

471
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:22,701
The lack of properly functioning phone systems provides for child and staff safety concerns and routine communication issues with stakeholders.

472
00:27:23,262 --> 00:27:31,808
To prepare for the remediation of the telephone issues, the district hired Chamber's advisory to fully review and inventory all phone lines currently charged to the district.

473
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:45,254
After the completed inventory was received back, I met with several phone vendors and other individuals who know a lot more about phones than I do, and made some decisions based on the inventory results.

474
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:55,623
By staying pots to pots, which is plain old telephone service, we could save upwards of $12,000 a year.

475
00:27:55,743 --> 00:28:02,528
You have to keep in mind that the first year there is a cost for having used this service, and it's 50% of whatever they save us.

476
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:15,052
If we had gone POTS to Centrex, we could have saved $24,000 the first year, would have lost 50% of it, and there is a $50 per line changeover fee.

477
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:27,556
And since we're in the beginning stages of deciding what we're going to do, it didn't make sense to spend the $50 in line when we don't know if we're going to stay with Centrex or if we're going to go to VoIP, voice over IP.

478
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:31,417
So we have the determination we can change that at any time.

479
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:40,194
So if we get down the road and they say that Centrax is the way for us to be based on what our infrastructure is in the city, we can still make that savings.

480
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:44,717
But we delay it and not spend the money and then maybe not recoup that later on.

481
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:59,707
So the committee, Roy Belson, Beverly Nelson, Diane Caldwell, myself, Kevin Andrews, Kirk Johnson, Alan Arena, John McLaughlin, John Costas, an interested city member, Kathy Kay, Heidi Riccio, and Bill Timmons met May 6

482
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:03,937
to discuss needs, wants, and the next step, interviewing the vendors.

483
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:20,709
Friday, June 12th, we invited six vendors on the state contract list to walk through each and every school building to visually view the current systems and ask the necessary questions regarding maintaining current intercom paging issues and integration of working phone systems.

484
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,573
The expectation post walkthrough is to provide three options to MPS.

485
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:30,529
Improve the current system to fully functioning at all locations to include new equipment.

486
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:35,893
Upgrade system to Centrix and replace replacement equipment at all locations.

487
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:40,737
Upgrade system to VoIP and replacement of equipment at all locations.

488
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:47,182
All proposals must maintain most buildings work very well or improve the viability of intercom and paging.

489
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:50,865
We really only have a couple schools who have intercom paging issues.

490
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,207
And if we can save that, we'll save money.

491
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:59,721
and a breakdown of cost and suggested options by each individual building and a grand total for the district.

492
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:07,065
Our goals, after having met with them on Friday, we had thought that we'd have everything ready to go July 3rd to make a decision.

493
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:10,567
We need two more weeks to put together a few more things for them.

494
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:15,130
And then they said that they could meet with us and do their presentations middle of July.

495
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:22,475
They also stated that our two most suffering buildings, the Brooks and the McGlynn,

496
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:29,523
could be up and running by the start of the school year, and that we could integrate the rest of the buildings throughout the year and finish up at the time.

497
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:34,710
So we would put our focus, again, on those buildings that have priorities and that are having the most issues.

498
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:38,686
So at this point, we're going to do a few more things for them.

499
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:41,508
And then they'll come in and do their presentation.

500
00:30:41,949 --> 00:30:46,373
We are going to hire someone who has more experience in this field than I do.

501
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,755
And they are an unbiased person.

502
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:54,460
And they will give us their opinion as to which system would work best for us, and give us the most bang for our buck.

503
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,120
Mr. Chairman?

504
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,881
Mr. Mayor?

505
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:56,742
Mr. Skagg.

506
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:58,003
Through you to Ms.

507
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:58,764
Ville.

508
00:30:58,804 --> 00:31:01,306
How many unused lines did they find?

509
00:31:02,002 --> 00:31:07,726
Approximately how much have we paid out in the last couple of years for services that we should not have been paying for?

510
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:10,808
And is there any chance to recapture any of those monies is the first question.

511
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,789
We are recapturing.

512
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:22,597
In fact, we just received a credit for $8,500 on voicemails that were not up and running and that Verizon was charging us for that we had canceled.

513
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:27,812
and made changes to, and so we have received that credit that just showed up on our phone bill.

514
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:32,955
And as far as the unused or the lines, I'm still working on them.

515
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:39,138
We have ring no answers on them, and I've been calling them at different times to see if I can get somebody to answer.

516
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:49,443
But what will happen is that before we make any changes, we'll talk with our vendor that we choose, and they'll tell us whether or not we need those lines, because it costs money to have them turned back on.

517
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,325
So I'd rather wait another month and turn them off.

518
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,434
And have we done an audit of cell phones?

519
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:57,014
I sign the bills every month.

520
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,075
It seems that we pay an awful lot for cell phones.

521
00:31:59,455 --> 00:32:00,455
We have done an audit.

522
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:01,975
And are they all accounted for?

523
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:03,216
They're all accounted for.

524
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:06,196
And we just recently renegotiated with Nextel.

525
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:09,637
And we're saving about $400 a month starting last month.

526
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:13,318
Is there a school policy, school-wide policy regarding cell phones?

527
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:21,140
If a person is retired or working part-time and come back for 120 days, are they entitled to a cell phone that the taxpayers are paying for?

528
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:32,921
I met with the superintendent at the beginning of the year, and he helped me go through the list, and we cut several people, and let them know that the phones were being turned off, and then redistributed those lines to people who did need them.

529
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:36,282
Okay, when that list is compiled, can we have a copy of that list as soon as possible?

530
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:36,823
Sure, yes.

531
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:37,443
Thank you.

532
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:38,403
Mr. Mayor.

533
00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:39,664
Mrs. Crenshaw.

534
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:40,924
Thank you, Pat.

535
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:48,808
Just to go over, on the expectations, it says all proposals must maintain most buildings work well.

536
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,965
Could you reiterate that for me?

537
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:56,448
When it says most buildings work well, we're hoping that all our buildings work well.

538
00:32:56,948 --> 00:33:00,431
We do have some intercom and paging issues at some of the buildings.

539
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:04,234
Some of them, you have to use the phone to page.

540
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:08,037
You can't just go up and push the unit and page, so you have to be called in directly.

541
00:33:08,657 --> 00:33:09,878
So we will fix that.

542
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:15,074
We also have one company that no longer has a service rep in our area, and that is Simplex.

543
00:33:16,075 --> 00:33:24,442
And so we need to do something about that system, because if we can't get them out to service it, then it's not a piece of equipment we want to maintain.

544
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:38,747
But we just found out through Louise Miller that even though it is a proprietary system, that because of the fact that they have not serviced our contract the way they should have, we have permission to move forward and find somebody who can service it.

545
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:39,387
OK.

546
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:47,972
So when you were talking about that, you were talking about the intercom system within the school system, not parents or other people calling the school.

547
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:48,392
OK.

548
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:49,438
So that's one.

549
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:56,624
Not that I'm happy about that, but at least I'm more concerned with parents trying to get in touch with administration and teachers.

550
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:56,944
OK.

551
00:33:58,385 --> 00:33:59,086
So that.

552
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:05,891
The family network, the daycare, is that all inclusive with what we're doing?

553
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:08,192
Or are those separate forms?

554
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:11,795
If they're within the buildings, they fall within the realms of our project.

555
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:12,475
OK.

556
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,137
And I guess that was?

557
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,273
basically.

558
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:31,023
Oh, um, I know, I don't know if this is part of it, but I do know that, um, a lot of the secretaries, a lot of the time have also said it would be nice if we could have like, um, when they go to answer the phone, they know exactly who's calling.

559
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:36,908
And, um, you have to be careful because you know, whatever model phone we put in the rooms,

560
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:44,040
gauges the expense, and currently all the rooms have analog phones, which are the basic phones with the touch tone.

561
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,602
But at the secretary consoles, we would have caller ID.

562
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:47,722
OK.

563
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,284
Thank you.

564
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:50,985
Thanks for all the work.

565
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:53,606
Mr. Mayor, one quick question.

566
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:57,589
When will we be receiving an update as to how things are progressing?

567
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:05,155
Well, we'll have the presentation about mid-July, and our unbiased representative will be there, and they'll be listening

568
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:10,668
the discussions and he said that he could give us a discussion or a decision within seven to ten days.

569
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:15,210
And then of course, you know, we have the right to go our way if we don't really care for what he's saying.

570
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,991
But this is a gentleman who works specifically in this field.

571
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,152
And so I expect to rely on his opinion.

572
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:20,672
Okay.

573
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:21,572
Thank you.

574
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:24,173
Thank you.

575
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:26,354
On the motion, Mr. Chair, the report be accepted and placed on file.

576
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,835
All those in favor signify by closing all the ayes.

577
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:28,095
Have it.

578
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,036
Report is accepted and placed on file.

579
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:32,457
Report on the food service program, Mr. Superintendent.

580
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:34,438
Members of the committee.

581
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:38,885
In the previous meeting, you asked for information on the food service program.

582
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:52,108
Tonight, our Director of Finance and Administration, Pat Bailey, along with our Director of Food Services, Jewel Bradley, and her assistant, Maria Archeri, will be here tonight to update you on our food service program.

583
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:56,109
And at some point, we need to at least, we have three options here.

584
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:59,790
We need to at least meet the federal standard as we go into next year.

585
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,171
So there's three options for an increase.

586
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:09,244
One of them is an absolute minimum, and the other two are highly desirable if you decide you want to move forward.

587
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:11,004
Otherwise, we'll have to look at it going forward.

588
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:17,407
So may I return it over to Pat again, and they can take us through the food service report.

589
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:24,999
The Food Service Program has worked diligently to include the USDA and National School Lunch Program rules and regulations.

590
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:29,122
The initial results of the new regulations reflected in lower participation.

591
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:34,446
As time goes on and children accept the new food choices, participation is starting to increase.

592
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:38,670
The district has also seen an increase in free and reduced meal participants.

593
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,093
Increases are also reflected in food and labor prices.

594
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:46,256
The review offers a lot of information, including participation numbers,

595
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:53,809
free and reduced numbers, the FY 15 profit and loss through June 10th, and three proposals for price increase consideration.

596
00:36:54,749 --> 00:37:03,715
I appreciate the school committee's well-placed reserve in considering a food service price increase, but without a price increase, we are non-compliant and have been informed this could affect our funding.

597
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:08,378
I ask the school committee to consider the three price increase proposals that we will submit.

598
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,722
The first price proposal for school lunch increase request should see us through three years

599
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:16,827
if costs remain at the expected increased levels.

600
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:22,929
The second proposal should see the district through the next fiscal year without having to ask for another price increase.

601
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:34,233
The third proposal meets the FY15 USDA guidelines and assist MPS in meeting compliancy for last year's FY15 weighted average expectation.

602
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:38,895
We've attached the USDA paid lunch equity memo previously presented.

603
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:43,117
We're going to go through the presentation and then take your questions regarding the proposals.

604
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:48,341
Good evening, Mayor, Superintendent, School Committee.

605
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,807
Help, I had it right side up.

606
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:55,530
What's cooking?

607
00:37:56,271 --> 00:38:01,938
The focus of the food service program is about educating and modeling the best way to fuel the body and the mind.

608
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:08,299
School lunch is the perfect model for students to see, smell, touch, and experience proper nutrition.

609
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:25,988
Just a bite program, harvest of the month when found to schools, better training of staff of what makes a reimbursable meal, meeting the national school lunch program meal and hydration requirements, and students are now directly certified.

610
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:28,203
What's cooking?

611
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:35,428
All grains served need to be 51% whole grains, and that also includes snaps.

612
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:43,394
The big picture, this is a chart of our revenues and expenses for fiscal year 14 and fiscal year 15.

613
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,578
Our average daily participation on the next chart.

614
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,022
This is our current average daily participation.

615
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,993
And then here's a chart for the last three years of average daily participation.

616
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,097
What's cooking for 2016?

617
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:11,619
Farm to School is expanding the Harvest of the Month program.

618
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,661
Each month features a different produce item.

619
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:19,044
Farm to School provides marketing materials that saves us a lot of money.

620
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:24,468
The DOD Fresh Program, fresh produce at DOD prices.

621
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:28,923
Sponsor entitlement dollars are used to purchase fresh produce.

622
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:32,544
USDA commodities to help control food costs.

623
00:39:34,324 --> 00:39:36,004
What's cooking for 2016?

624
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:42,306
USDA working to upgrade the commodities program with DOD Fresh.

625
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:49,007
And for 2015, districts were able to request what items the USDA sourced for the monthly offer sheets.

626
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:58,724
We use more than 100% available commodities by taking advantage of commodities other schools have chosen to opt out of the commodity program.

627
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:09,310
MPS was proactive in securing a bid for poultry products for fiscal year 16 prior to the issues currently facing production.

628
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,592
And here is a chart for the commodity usage for the past five years.

629
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:19,895
And for 2015, that's only going up to April.

630
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,542
Opportunities for 2016.

631
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,924
Full program improvements in place for next year.

632
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:34,027
Inventory for better cost control.

633
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,769
Menu includes a nutritional analysis.

634
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:39,451
Offerings.

635
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:42,674
Monitor our labor.

636
00:40:44,015 --> 00:40:44,756
Free and reduced.

637
00:40:53,382 --> 00:40:54,323
For meals per lay.

638
00:40:55,976 --> 00:41:02,680
And in the last column, that shows you how many meals per labor hour each school is making.

639
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:11,225
The next is our a la carte menu options with a variety of our snacks.

640
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:16,028
More opportunities for 2016.

641
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:20,691
The participation at the high school continues to struggle.

642
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:28,094
Current student base had the new nutritional regulations thrust on them, and food service has felt the brunt of their frustration.

643
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:32,276
There is lower level of participation at the middle and high school level.

644
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:35,938
As the kids move up, so will participation at the high school.

645
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:46,144
Improve meal labor hours percentages, reducing high labor costs through attrition and redistribution of labor to higher need areas.

646
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:54,174
Next chart is our current free and reduced enrollment for fiscal year 14 and 15.

647
00:41:57,155 --> 00:42:16,160
And then this is a chart for the last two years of the increase or decrease by school and the need for price increase, paid lunch equity, fiscal year 15, MPS charged an average of 270 for a paid lunch.

648
00:42:16,856 --> 00:42:19,117
That is the SFA weighted scale.

649
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:27,220
The SFA weighted scale is a combined calculation of current pricing weighted by free, reduced and pay means.

650
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:33,863
The premise is that the free and reduced program cannot be what is sustaining the food service program.

651
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:38,425
Increasing costs of food prices in fruits, vegetables and meats.

652
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:42,167
Meat prices are slated to increase by 16% in fiscal year 16.

653
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:50,415
The free kids act, each meal is mandated to have a fruit and a vegetable.

654
00:42:51,276 --> 00:43:00,523
Fiscal year 16, MIP prices will increase $0.07 per unit, which is resulting in a $20,000 additional cost just to our milk.

655
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:05,927
Capital request to begin replacing aging or non-operating equipment.

656
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:14,174
Wage increases, Massachusetts minimum wage law will require all new employees to start at 11 an hour in 2017.

657
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:21,539
Additionally, new staff requires surf safe training.

658
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,520
NPS employees are guaranteed 33 cents an hour fiscal year 14, 15, and 16.

659
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:31,902
The last lunch price increase was just about 10 years ago.

660
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:42,326
And the next is a food price survey that was conducted to show the different cities and towns of their lunch prices.

661
00:43:46,663 --> 00:43:54,814
And the next is a graph on our food or grocery prices this year, last year, and the year before.

662
00:43:54,854 --> 00:44:00,722
Can you slow down while we look at the food service price surveys from the different communities?

663
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:01,783
There's a lot of communities here.

664
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:47,798
So when you look at these, we're not on the high side of anything, correct?

665
00:44:49,378 --> 00:44:50,078
Not at these.

666
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:51,739
Pardon me?

667
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:53,419
Not at this list, no.

668
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,822
But a lot of these districts have higher percentages of free and reduced, so they would get more funding from the government.

669
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:13,905
That's how the formula is based on your free and reduced children, and we're at 44%.

670
00:45:14,926 --> 00:45:16,827
A lot of districts are at 60, 70, 50%.

671
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:25,433
And that raises the USDA's financial contribution to those districts.

672
00:45:27,234 --> 00:45:31,997
I think what the mayor's asking is that the rack price is still pretty reasonable.

673
00:45:33,538 --> 00:45:34,879
Yes, yes, I'm sorry.

674
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:35,699
I just understood.

675
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:48,934
I know there are some changes in the food programming for next year, and they're going to reorganize free and reduced, and they're going to call it, what is it, it's economically disadvantaged, and I'm wondering how that's going to affect our community.

676
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:07,726
in our funding for our food and lunch program.

677
00:46:08,827 --> 00:46:17,551
Because there are going to be less students eligible for free and reduced lunch because the DESC is changing those regulations as of next year.

678
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:24,654
Are you talking about the community eligibility provision?

679
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:25,454
Yes.

680
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:30,116
They're changing it from free and reduced lunch to a new category.

681
00:46:30,777 --> 00:46:30,937
Ms.

682
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:31,257
Garlow.

683
00:46:33,105 --> 00:46:38,409
So there is a new metric system that they're going to be using to identify children on free and reduced lunch.

684
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:39,610
It's a new metric system.

685
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:46,255
What they're doing for Title I students, especially, and this will affect the free and reduced lunch, is giving you the comparison.

686
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:48,517
And the first year will be like a wash.

687
00:46:48,537 --> 00:46:50,138
So you can use free and reduced lunch.

688
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:53,101
But we're not sure yet how that's going to affect our numbers.

689
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:58,485
I know that in other districts, they're a little concerned because of the criteria for now.

690
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,328
It's going to change the amount that we're funded for free and reduced lunch.

691
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:06,012
not through our community, but through all communities in Massachusetts.

692
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:08,874
And they won't be called free and reduced lunch anymore.

693
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:13,017
They're going to call it, I'm sorry, I took notes earlier.

694
00:47:13,418 --> 00:47:21,444
It's going to be all about just calling it different things and redefining the low income.

695
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:24,747
And they're going to be a lot of changes in it.

696
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:28,310
And they're going to call it economically disadvantaged now.

697
00:47:28,857 --> 00:47:39,107
And I know some schools are going to see a 50% decrease in the amount of students that are going to qualify for what was known as free and reduced lunch.

698
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:41,029
And that's going to affect our students.

699
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:46,174
So if we go up on the price, it's going to make it harder for those families to afford to buy lunch.

700
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:48,677
And my concern is students not eating.

701
00:47:49,226 --> 00:47:51,027
That's my concern.

702
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:56,169
And when I was looking through some of your paperwork, we're not in the red in this program.

703
00:47:56,209 --> 00:48:00,570
We still have, like, we have, like, what, $130,000 this year?

704
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:04,632
Am I correct the way I looked at that?

705
00:48:04,992 --> 00:48:07,953
I know we started at a little deficit, but now the balance.

706
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:10,464
Well, we should end the year around 69,000.

707
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:14,867
But you have to remember that July is a big month for food service.

708
00:48:15,328 --> 00:48:19,411
We have to pay out longevity and two weeks of vacation for all full-time employees.

709
00:48:19,951 --> 00:48:21,192
OK.

710
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:23,694
No, I just want to make sure that I have the whole picture.

711
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:26,857
And I don't want to read your budget things incorrectly.

712
00:48:27,257 --> 00:48:31,240
But I also am really afraid to.

713
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:38,147
to raise the prices and have high school students say, oh, I only have $1.50 in my pocket.

714
00:48:38,487 --> 00:48:39,888
I don't have money for lunch today.

715
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:43,051
And I know the portions have changed over the years.

716
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,752
I just don't want to see our kids hungry.

717
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:48,215
A concern, a very big concern for me.

718
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:55,080
And with the government changing things in the next year or two, we're going to have less and less kids on free and reduced lunch.

719
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:57,342
I know that for a fact.

720
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:02,348
that they are looking into this and that big changes are on the horizon.

721
00:49:02,368 --> 00:49:08,309
And I'm just, I'm, I just don't want to, kids, too many kids are hungry in the world today.

722
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:09,949
I don't want the monocity.

723
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:22,332
I don't want kids going all day with nothing to eat and then have to take an AP exam or a test that really matters or a youngster going home hungry that, that parents might not have food at home.

724
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:25,352
Some kids come to school and those are the only meals they get all day.

725
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:27,993
And if they can't afford them here, what are we doing?

726
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:31,556
Like in the snow, I'm like, open the schools.

727
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:34,456
Some kids don't have heat or food at home.

728
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:36,717
We have to open the schools as much as we can.

729
00:49:37,597 --> 00:49:41,277
I feel strongly about this issue, and I'm very hesitant to raise the prices.

730
00:49:41,757 --> 00:49:44,978
I understand that we need good quality ingredients to feed them.

731
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:47,779
I know we need good quality people to serve them.

732
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:52,599
I understand that costs money, so I just feel torn about this situation.

733
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:55,400
And with the current changes coming and unknown,

734
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,611
I have one more question that you might be able to answer.

735
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:05,253
The 45% of our students, is that with 100% return rate on those documents?

736
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:10,855
Are we really getting those all back to make sure every student that is qualified, we get that back for?

737
00:50:11,215 --> 00:50:16,956
Are we really pushing that so that way every kid that would qualify for a free lunch is getting it?

738
00:50:17,357 --> 00:50:19,097
Because that's a really important piece.

739
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:21,178
Mr. Mayor?

740
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:22,938
Oh, I'm sorry.

741
00:50:23,198 --> 00:50:24,559
This is Scott Kelly.

742
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:29,348
Was that a question that you wanted to answer?

743
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:30,829
I know it's a lot out there, but.

744
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:40,516
I think it was a chat that I brought that I should have handed you out, and it gives the percentages of our enrollment according to free or reduced, and how much of them participate in.

745
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:48,722
Our elementary is a pretty good, meaning anywhere from 50 to 60% participation on the free reduced.

746
00:50:51,462 --> 00:51:03,191
It's really our middle and high schools, but I think with the push, as the younger ones grow, when they come up to middle and high school, they're going to be the ones carrying the tree because of the big changes.

747
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:08,015
Now they're used to it, so we just do a little more marketing.

748
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:16,102
I think it's important to note, too, that while the food regulations say that we can provide a child with a cheese sandwich,

749
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,999
For lunch, Jewel and Maria never do.

750
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,841
Those children, nobody ever knows that they could not afford lunch that day.

751
00:51:23,262 --> 00:51:24,282
They get a full lunch.

752
00:51:25,903 --> 00:51:26,724
Mr. Scott Pelley.

753
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:33,949
If I can, I can understand completely how difficult this is moving forward.

754
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:36,110
I have my own work.

755
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:37,672
I see the waste.

756
00:51:40,257 --> 00:51:54,204
where my staff is trained that if a youngster wants a meal, and they're still hungry, or they just want an apple, they have to get the orange, the milk, everything, and just throw it away.

757
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:56,485
And that's a disgrace.

758
00:51:57,046 --> 00:52:01,508
And this isn't us, this is the government as we go forward with this.

759
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:09,752
The whole parameter, if they catch anybody, any school system, any one of our programs that do that, they take the funding away.

760
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:21,381
And so I think it's really backwards, and what I really focused on, this will be an increase to us from the federal government for our free and reduced.

761
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:31,127
I want to look at the kids that, it looks very close to 50-50, free and reduced, and just a regular parent who's paying for my children.

762
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:39,906
I'm afraid the free and reduced is still going to be getting fed.

763
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:49,552
But the increase is really going to hit the person's wallet at home that's working and has to pay for that on a daily basis.

764
00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:54,375
So that's where I find it very difficult as we move forward.

765
00:52:54,555 --> 00:53:02,380
I know the comparison of what we pay and other communities pay, but when people don't qualify for free and reduced,

766
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:07,555
They're the ones paying out of their pocket, people that qualify for free and reduced.

767
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:09,836
We're getting money from the federal government.

768
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:11,097
That sounds great.

769
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,160
I apologize, but I don't see that.

770
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:23,605
The middle class worker that's out there busting their humps every day, and the fee really hits them hard.

771
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:33,440
Okay, so that's why I, if we're federally mandated, then we have to do any sort of increase as we move forward with the presentation.

772
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,223
I just find it alarming for what the federal government's telling us to do.

773
00:53:38,663 --> 00:53:41,224
And then what I've seen on a daily basis, I think it's districts.

774
00:53:42,044 --> 00:53:50,769
And I'll probably say that, but I still need to know more about this before I look at someone like myself that gives that money every day.

775
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:55,384
Because I don't qualify, and so it's coming out of my paycheck.

776
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,691
My kids have to eat every day, so.

777
00:53:58,731 --> 00:53:59,953
Mr. Mayor.

778
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:00,394
Mrs. Crenshaw.

779
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,482
I don't think there's anyone here who disagrees with both of what my colleagues have said.

780
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:10,503
I mean, you know, we're, we're all compassionate and that's why we're here.

781
00:54:10,523 --> 00:54:13,985
I mean, we all know why we're here.

782
00:54:14,145 --> 00:54:23,288
We're definitely here for the kids, but if we also have to look at our regulations and what we have to comply with, we also, that is also our responsibility of why we're here.

783
00:54:23,788 --> 00:54:27,630
So I'm looking at the three proposals and the way I'm looking at it is this.

784
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,151
I've looked at the second and the third,

785
00:54:31,763 --> 00:54:38,225
And the second and the third, the differences are right now, we're looking at the breakfast day is the same.

786
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:43,947
As far as it's a dollar now, it goes up to a dollar 10 with the proposal.

787
00:54:44,608 --> 00:54:50,270
The lunch, the elementary, we're talking a 10 cent difference.

788
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:55,251
The middle school and the high school, the lunch we're talking a five cent difference.

789
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:59,913
If we combine those two, the second and the third proposal,

790
00:55:00,778 --> 00:55:09,147
But the caveat, no pun intended, is that we look at those numbers, but now we're saying that if we

791
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:17,624
as a committee decide that we're going to go with those two proposals, but then we're going to look at it next year and say that we're going to be bringing up the rate.

792
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:20,126
It's something that I definitely don't want to do.

793
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:22,488
I mean, personally, I don't want to do any of this.

794
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:31,076
But if I have to look at logistically, I'm looking at the fact that we haven't touched this in approximately 10 years.

795
00:55:33,018 --> 00:55:36,661
Not looking at the breakfast portion of proposal number one,

796
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:46,382
The difference between an elementary lunch at $2.75 and the proposal of $2.01, we're talking a $0.05 difference.

797
00:55:47,983 --> 00:55:56,245
The difference between the middle school lunch and the high school lunch, we're talking a $0.10 difference.

798
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:02,286
Again, I'm just throwing out the numbers to really break them down in what we're talking and what we're discussing.

799
00:56:03,046 --> 00:56:04,847
What I do have a problem with,

800
00:56:05,276 --> 00:56:07,377
As I mentioned before, I have a problem with the whole thing.

801
00:56:08,257 --> 00:56:10,518
But we're going from a breakfast of $1 to $1.50.

802
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:13,980
A $0.50 jump is a lot.

803
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:21,404
And that's a $0.40 difference between number one proposal and the two and the third.

804
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:24,345
So I'm looking at it

805
00:56:25,701 --> 00:56:33,725
Would it still be beneficial if there's some room to work out the breakfast of a dollar if we're looking at this as a committee?

806
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:35,887
And again, these are just numbers to throw out there.

807
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:41,730
I'm not speaking for anyone else, but I am saying a 50 cent jump is huge.

808
00:56:43,463 --> 00:56:55,855
Is there any way to work that breakfast from $1 to like, I don't know, $1.20, $1.30, something like that, and still not touch this for a few years down the road?

809
00:57:02,842 --> 00:57:05,464
We'd have to do the weighted scale for you and then submit it to you.

810
00:57:05,845 --> 00:57:06,065
Okay.

811
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,853
I just want, you know, I want to do both.

812
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,494
I want to do the right thing for both sides.

813
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:20,876
I want, you know, I want to do the due diligence of making sure that we're in compliance, but I also want to make sure that our children are all being fed.

814
00:57:21,056 --> 00:57:35,819
And, you know, as our, as my colleague said, I mean, we understand that the free and reduced lunch children are going to be covered, but we don't want to take advantage of the person who's going out there working day after day and they're going from paycheck to paycheck either.

815
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:37,347
It's hard on everyone.

816
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:41,909
So that was what I was throwing out there.

817
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:43,530
Is this a self-supporting program?

818
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:45,671
Is it self-sustaining?

819
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:46,292
Yes.

820
00:57:47,852 --> 00:57:51,114
It is this year through great efforts by Jewel and Maria.

821
00:57:51,574 --> 00:57:53,315
We did enter this year in a negative.

822
00:57:54,136 --> 00:58:03,561
And it's been through a lot of hard work and a lot of monitoring of inventory and staffing levels and making the right decisions as we go through the year.

823
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,162
And as we got to April,

824
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:15,469
We really started to look at what the inventory was, what our needs were, and it was time to, as you would at home, start to clean out the refrigerator and the freezers and the stock shelves.

825
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,631
And, you know, we also want to make sure we're turning over product, and they've done an excellent job of it.

826
00:58:20,511 --> 00:58:21,751
What about equipment in this program?

827
00:58:21,771 --> 00:58:23,612
Well, it's interesting.

828
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:28,753
We have an inventory here for you, and it has pictures and all kinds of good details.

829
00:58:28,893 --> 00:58:30,153
I read through it.

830
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:33,094
It said that there's a need for upgrades.

831
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:38,307
So will the price increase affect what type of equipment we have in there?

832
00:58:44,311 --> 00:58:46,952
Our new schools, the steamers are breaking down.

833
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:48,873
Our tilt skillets are breaking down.

834
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:54,576
The question is, will the price increase affect what equipment we have in there?

835
00:58:54,936 --> 00:59:00,339
Does some of that money, does it go towards upkeep or purchase of new equipment?

836
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,161
It definitely could, as long as we are monitoring our other costs.

837
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,240
I'm sorry, what?

838
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,202
I said it definitely could, as long as we're monitoring our other costs.

839
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:13,044
We just have to go at this strategically and really monitor what's going on in the program.

840
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:17,726
And that means by watching our meals per labor hours and our inventory of food products.

841
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:22,588
But there definitely could be money in proposal one to start fixing some of the equipment.

842
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:32,653
All right, so as I also read through this, it said that there are people who are looking for an upgrade.

843
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:41,083
what the kids have an interest in eating that is going to be nutritious for them.

844
00:59:42,304 --> 00:59:44,104
Is that reflective in the cost?

845
00:59:45,944 --> 00:59:46,445
Yes, Mayor.

846
00:59:46,465 --> 00:59:50,885
You'll see in the chart how much our groceries have gone up this year.

847
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:55,446
We've gone back to a lot of scratch cooking and fresh produce.

848
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:57,227
All our schools have salad bars now.

849
00:59:59,002 --> 01:00:00,582
That's really a price increase.

850
01:00:00,602 --> 01:00:02,023
This is providing all the fresh.

851
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:05,743
So nobody wants to make a price increase.

852
01:00:06,183 --> 01:00:06,363
No.

853
01:00:06,443 --> 01:00:11,204
But we have fairly moderate pricing right now.

854
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:23,526
And if we do not have a price increase, what's going to happen to the quality of the food, the equipment, and the food service program that is a self-sustaining program?

855
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:24,806
And non-compliant.

856
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:26,727
Be non-compliant.

857
01:00:27,187 --> 01:00:27,967
And then we'll lose funding.

858
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,834
So the bottom line is, we have to have an increase.

859
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:37,699
And people have always been reluctant to do it in the past, and that's part of the reason that we're in this situation.

860
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,803
But we probably should have been building reserve all the way along so you can prepare for these things.

861
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:47,748
So what are you recommending in terms of the increases?

862
01:00:49,669 --> 01:00:55,715
We know there's a wide range from a nickel to 50 cents, but what is reasonable?

863
01:00:56,475 --> 01:01:01,397
That provides a good program for the kids, so they continue to get food.

864
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:08,699
We'll have the equipment, the labor, and everything else involved in it to make sure that the program runs properly.

865
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:18,962
I like proposal one with a $10 for breakfast.

866
01:01:20,563 --> 01:01:21,263
Well, I don't know.

867
01:01:21,363 --> 01:01:23,464
That way we wouldn't have to come back next year and

868
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,664
The whole thing is, is the government is giving us $2.70 per child that is free.

869
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:33,006
And this year, we're under a nickel.

870
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:39,130
We should have raised it this past year and we didn't, so we're really non-compliant right now.

871
01:01:39,811 --> 01:01:41,552
So next year, the figure is $2.70.

872
01:01:41,592 --> 01:01:45,575
And yes, we sell lunches at $2.85 and $2.50, but we sell more $2.50 lunches than we do $2.85 lunches.

873
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:57,124
There's no balance there.

874
01:01:57,884 --> 01:01:59,225
Mr. Schapela.

875
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:07,689
But again, this is 50% of that's in the free and reduced that comes back, that we'll be automatically getting from them.

876
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,610
Correct?

877
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:14,552
Roughly it's 50% of our lunches in each school.

878
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:15,573
Correct.

879
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:22,536
The way the weighted scale works is their whole philosophy is that people who pay full price for lunch or breakfast

880
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:28,526
can't be supporting the program, and with our current ratio, that's the situation we're in.

881
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:37,729
Free and reduced is paying more for the program than what you would have for your equal balance, and that's why they're saying that we are not where we need to be.

882
01:02:37,749 --> 01:02:40,410
Mr. Mayor.

883
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,110
Mr. Mayor.

884
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,471
Just to clear this up, what's the actual record?

885
01:02:44,711 --> 01:02:47,872
What percentage are on throughout the school system, free and reduced?

886
01:02:49,793 --> 01:02:50,693
Total free and reduced?

887
01:02:52,293 --> 01:02:53,834
The total right now is 41%.

888
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:53,834
41%.

889
01:02:54,214 --> 01:03:04,301
It's important we don't round off.

890
01:03:05,622 --> 01:03:07,463
We look at what the percentage is.

891
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,145
Mr. Mayor?

892
01:03:10,185 --> 01:03:11,246
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

893
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:17,970
So what's the minimum amount that we have to go up to meet the requirement?

894
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:20,732
Which option?

895
01:03:20,772 --> 01:03:21,653
Is that option three?

896
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:30,697
Because I would rather meet every year and meet that minimum than overcharge every year, to be honest with you.

897
01:03:30,897 --> 01:03:32,738
I don't want to overcharge our families.

898
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:43,825
And I think some of the maintenance issues are important to maintain the proper, so that the food is cooked properly and we're not making anyone.

899
01:03:46,427 --> 01:03:52,911
But at the same time, I really know families that don't qualify that kids won't eat because they won't have enough.

900
01:03:53,322 --> 01:04:01,104
They don't have the $20 every week, plus the bus fare up to the high school if the kid's tired to walk from one area of the city or not.

901
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,205
I mean, it gets expensive.

902
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:05,286
And it's a concern.

903
01:04:05,306 --> 01:04:07,266
I want our children to be eating lunch.

904
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:08,127
I really do.

905
01:04:08,147 --> 01:04:15,049
So I think what everyone is asking is, nobody wants to go number one.

906
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:16,909
It's probably the best option.

907
01:04:17,529 --> 01:04:19,910
But the question is, can it be molded

908
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:29,769
better fit what everybody's talking about here, to make sure that we are meeting the standards, we're providing the very best to the kids, but we're not croaking the families.

909
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:31,470
Mr. Mayor.

910
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:32,892
Mrs. Cunha.

911
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:42,723
I just want to keep in mind that one thing that has come up in discussion is this is a self-sustaining program.

912
01:04:43,693 --> 01:04:47,675
And if we have equipment that is not going to work properly.

913
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:54,417
And I don't want to see this department come to us in a year, two years and say, guess what?

914
01:04:55,498 --> 01:04:57,438
It's going downhill now.

915
01:04:57,979 --> 01:04:59,499
And then in two years, guess what?

916
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:04,181
We're not going to be able to feed the students because it's completely broken.

917
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:10,864
I don't like to see our prices go up, but we haven't gotten, we haven't raised any prices in 10 years.

918
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:11,684
So,

919
01:05:12,715 --> 01:05:14,196
I like to keep my budget at home.

920
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:15,376
I have four kids.

921
01:05:16,457 --> 01:05:26,762
And if something breaks, I'd rather have—gee, I'll put $2 aside every week, and that way at least I know if, God forbid, anything happens, I have that money.

922
01:05:27,222 --> 01:05:39,709
To say that I'm going to go to the minimum now, and then all of a sudden next year we're to the minimum, and next year we're to the minimum, that's why we're sitting here now saying, gee, maybe we should have put that money aside for the last 10 years.

923
01:05:40,463 --> 01:05:42,904
So that's my concern.

924
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,306
I don't want to go up and overcharge anyone.

925
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:59,453
My concern is that we've been sitting here for a few amount of years now, going back to the pool and the fields and the theater, saying, we're going to maintain, we're going to maintain.

926
01:05:59,753 --> 01:06:01,975
This is a self-sustaining program.

927
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,597
It's been doing very well for a very long time.

928
01:06:06,097 --> 01:06:07,518
I do not want any child

929
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:09,499
to not eat.

930
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:20,144
But I don't want to see the day that we're going to turn around and say, we're going to have to close this cafeteria, or we're going to have to close that cafeteria, because we have no money for this.

931
01:06:20,745 --> 01:06:21,925
That's my concern.

932
01:06:22,766 --> 01:06:31,110
Or within the program itself, if equipment does go down, then you'll be talking about a much larger increase.

933
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:31,831
No kidding.

934
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:33,772
Because it'll be a rushed situation.

935
01:06:34,712 --> 01:06:35,473
Mr. Mayor?

936
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:41,588
I mean, you can come back every year and do it, but what it means is you're hanging on by a thread every year.

937
01:06:43,008 --> 01:06:45,670
You should always try and build some reserves.

938
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:52,874
I mean, that's why the city as a whole has done extremely well in recent years, because we've built those reserves.

939
01:06:54,054 --> 01:06:58,577
So if it means charging a fine- Mr. Mayor, I'd rather- Mrs. DiBenedetto.

940
01:06:59,021 --> 01:07:17,467
Mr. Mayor, if I'm not mistaken, I believe Pat might have said that with this increase, there would be some money, like even the minimum increase to upgrade and to maintain our steamers and things and make a priority and utilize our food and our staff effectively.

941
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:19,407
There would still be some room for that.

942
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:20,467
Was I mistaken?

943
01:07:20,487 --> 01:07:21,948
Did I hear that mistakenly?

944
01:07:22,488 --> 01:07:24,829
Or is that only option three, the highest option?

945
01:07:27,195 --> 01:07:30,576
Option one would offer you the ability to replace some equipment.

946
01:07:31,196 --> 01:07:32,496
Option two would be minimal.

947
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:34,697
And option three would cover no equipment.

948
01:07:35,077 --> 01:07:35,357
OK.

949
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:38,778
Mr. Scappelli.

950
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:45,540
When we know that something's going down, and I don't blame you.

951
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,720
I'm not blaming you guys.

952
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:53,192
We're getting this now, and we're getting that, we have equipment failing.

953
01:07:53,952 --> 01:07:57,856
Now that doesn't shock me, but we didn't know anything about it.

954
01:07:58,056 --> 01:08:02,220
Okay, so here we are, after we voted on the budget, now there's equipment failing.

955
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:09,726
So I understand waiting and increasing building reserve, so we don't have it, but that should have been done five years ago.

956
01:08:10,727 --> 01:08:16,312
I'm looking at this right now, and I think that's what's bothering more than anything right now,

957
01:08:17,712 --> 01:08:18,492
What is going down?

958
01:08:18,752 --> 01:08:21,853
Do we have an estimate cost of what's going down?

959
01:08:22,294 --> 01:08:25,435
What are we looking at, hundreds of thousands, 50,000, 20,000?

960
01:08:25,955 --> 01:08:39,779
I've replaced the equipment that I can replace without going to the state, because the state requires me to notify them if I have any capital equipment purchases, which is 5,000 or over.

961
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:43,260
So I have been maintaining.

962
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:49,628
They've been maintained, they're usable, it's not that they're broken down and need replacement today.

963
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:53,290
We are using them, we are utilizing them.

964
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:56,453
Thank you.

965
01:08:56,673 --> 01:09:02,737
What I'm saying is, we're looking at piecing together things and spending 5,000 to keep things going.

966
01:09:03,478 --> 01:09:06,400
Now we're saying as we look forward, we're looking at major

967
01:09:08,188 --> 01:09:09,649
repairs or major replacements?

968
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:11,049
I mean, is there an idea?

969
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:11,930
Do you have a report?

970
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:12,790
Do you have something?

971
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:17,233
Because I don't see that.

972
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:18,453
I should have brought that with me.

973
01:09:18,493 --> 01:09:18,954
I'm sorry.

974
01:09:18,974 --> 01:09:21,195
I didn't know we were going to talk equipment.

975
01:09:21,235 --> 01:09:26,617
I have equipment specs here that has pictures of our equipment and what they are.

976
01:09:26,818 --> 01:09:28,819
And I don't want to put you on the spot because I don't think it's fair.

977
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:29,399
No, that's fine.

978
01:09:30,059 --> 01:09:33,641
I do have two freezers that are going to need compressor repairs this summer.

979
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:33,921
OK.

980
01:09:33,941 --> 01:09:36,002
Do you have the funding?

981
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:39,270
Mr. Bellson.

982
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,131
Mr. Mayor and members of the committee.

983
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:43,671
Early this evening we received a capital report.

984
01:09:45,071 --> 01:09:51,033
And in the last page we saw that we had to spend money to replace water heaters.

985
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:55,934
We had to spend money to replace ventilation systems and other things like that.

986
01:09:55,994 --> 01:10:03,155
Because in the normal scheme of things, things break down or things need more maintenance.

987
01:10:04,275 --> 01:10:06,936
We have a lot of equipment in the food service operation.

988
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:11,965
It's a prudent course of action to properly fund it.

989
01:10:12,845 --> 01:10:26,388
Now, we can get by into the fall with just being compliant, or we can make a move to give the department a little bit more room so they can do what they have to do as it occurs.

990
01:10:27,128 --> 01:10:31,029
Now, we didn't plan on a water heater going down this year, but when it went down, we had to fix it.

991
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:33,850
In fact, two water heaters went down.

992
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:34,770
So it's really a matter

993
01:10:35,684 --> 01:10:46,547
of either planning for forward plan to put things in place, or just simply meeting compliance, because we have no choice but to meet compliance, or you'll lose serious money.

994
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:53,209
And then come back to you in the fall and say, by the way, if something goes down, we need the money.

995
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:57,050
Things are going to break in any normal operation.

996
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,150
Let's not kid ourselves.

997
01:10:58,778 --> 01:10:59,178
They do.

998
01:10:59,278 --> 01:10:59,859
They go down.

999
01:10:59,879 --> 01:11:01,259
We've talked about bulbs.

1000
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:02,540
We've talked about projectors.

1001
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:03,720
We've talked about computers.

1002
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,281
We've talked about maintenance things.

1003
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:11,044
We have things that can, we have things that are going to go down and the food service is no exception.

1004
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:14,846
So it isn't a question of bad planning.

1005
01:11:14,866 --> 01:11:16,607
It's a question of they've worked within their revenues.

1006
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,308
We've gone through a recession and we've managed to stay whole.

1007
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:27,812
The school system hasn't asked for a supplemental budget in years, almost a decade because we've stayed within our world.

1008
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:30,865
working with the mayor, working with you, working with everyone else.

1009
01:11:31,925 --> 01:11:47,292
So we can either decide that we're going to fund it intelligently going forward for the year or going the next couple of years, or we're going to put a bandaid on it and we'll be back in the fall or back in, you know, the first of the year talking about looking for an increase.

1010
01:11:47,992 --> 01:11:48,872
So it's really a choice.

1011
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:50,993
It's really a choice.

1012
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:52,694
I mean, it's just, it's just good planning.

1013
01:11:52,734 --> 01:11:52,974
That's all.

1014
01:11:57,492 --> 01:12:07,299
So we can fund it either through the people paying for lunches or we can fund it through our budget as far as our maintenance and make that an important thing if we need upgrades.

1015
01:12:07,379 --> 01:12:08,259
I don't know if we can.

1016
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:09,580
It's a self-sustaining program.

1017
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:18,186
If we start paying for self-sustaining programs through budgetary items, then you're going to have to take it away from something else.

1018
01:12:18,746 --> 01:12:25,331
And if you get into, which I've been through three recessions during my tenure, if you get into a recession,

1019
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:28,595
Now you're starting to eliminate jobs in different programs.

1020
01:12:30,036 --> 01:12:38,082
The stole instead of generating the revenue through a self-sustaining program that is supposed to be self-sustaining.

1021
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:42,045
So it's dangerous to go in that direction.

1022
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:49,250
Again, I can't stress how much I appreciate the work.

1023
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:54,494
And I know how hard you work and how hard you've kept it together for so long.

1024
01:12:54,827 --> 01:12:57,169
without having to come before us and ask for money.

1025
01:12:57,569 --> 01:13:09,096
And I know you wouldn't be sitting here and asking us to increase the amount that our parents in our community has to pay for their kid to go off and have lunch every day unless you needed it.

1026
01:13:09,477 --> 01:13:11,058
And I wholeheartedly get that.

1027
01:13:11,498 --> 01:13:16,001
I just want to make sure I protect those families and those students and make sure they eat as well.

1028
01:13:16,401 --> 01:13:17,142
And I get it.

1029
01:13:17,222 --> 01:13:18,422
I can see it in your faces.

1030
01:13:18,563 --> 01:13:20,664
I know it through the dedication, through the years.

1031
01:13:21,108 --> 01:13:31,670
And I'm going to work with you to make sure that we have a compromise that families can afford and that we can get what we need to provide good food for our children with the right equipment.

1032
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:35,250
So I just want to be careful.

1033
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:37,611
I just want to be careful that our kids don't go hungry.

1034
01:13:37,991 --> 01:13:44,252
And if in any way that seems unappreciative to you, I don't want to go there.

1035
01:13:44,632 --> 01:13:49,493
Because I know the dedication and the hard work and why you haven't come before us in 10 years.

1036
01:13:49,863 --> 01:13:52,886
is because you also don't want to go up on the prices for these children.

1037
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,188
Mr. Felco.

1038
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:56,008
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1039
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:57,750
Thank you very much for your report.

1040
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:02,334
It's in depth, it's thorough, and I like how you gave us a number of proposals.

1041
01:14:03,214 --> 01:14:07,638
And I think that helps us as a committee to see what we're, you know, what we need to do here.

1042
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:18,107
And with regard to proposal number two, so if we went with proposal number two, which I believe is the middle of the road proposal,

1043
01:14:19,202 --> 01:14:33,447
Would that allow us to build some reserves to come up with a plan to fix or develop a plan to maintain some of the equipment that needs to be fixed over the next few years?

1044
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:35,107
Yes.

1045
01:14:35,307 --> 01:14:36,448
I mean, it would be minimal.

1046
01:14:36,668 --> 01:14:38,909
We would not be repurchasing any major steamers.

1047
01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:45,171
But we could strategically plan for replacement and possibly do one each year.

1048
01:14:45,571 --> 01:14:48,692
And we could look at an equipment list and actually gauge those priorities.

1049
01:14:49,392 --> 01:14:50,633
OK, that's what I think I'd like to do.

1050
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:56,238
So I would like to make the motion that we approve proposal number two.

1051
01:14:57,599 --> 01:15:14,533
And I would like for you, if you could please come up with a list of equipment throughout all the schools, throughout the district, that's broken what needs to be fixed, and come up with a plan to basically repair this equipment over time.

1052
01:15:15,051 --> 01:15:16,431
Second the motion, Mr. Chairman.

1053
01:15:17,192 --> 01:15:18,452
Motion is seconded.

1054
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:20,773
But point of clarification on that.

1055
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:22,954
I have no problem.

1056
01:15:22,994 --> 01:15:26,235
I just want to have the clarification on proposal number two.

1057
01:15:27,355 --> 01:15:33,197
Does that also, is this one here also the one that we would have to come back to next year that we would have to increase?

1058
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:38,999
We would have to see what the weighted average came out to during our audit of the food service program.

1059
01:15:39,339 --> 01:15:40,540
And it's determined by that.

1060
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,600
So it really does.

1061
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,321
It is based on several factors.

1062
01:15:44,705 --> 01:15:49,487
It depends on our participation, our free and reduced, and then our not free and reduced participation.

1063
01:15:49,727 --> 01:15:50,207
Mr. Mayor.

1064
01:15:50,468 --> 01:15:51,048
Mr. Fellow.

1065
01:15:51,068 --> 01:15:51,588
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1066
01:15:51,668 --> 01:15:52,548
When is the audit?

1067
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:54,489
It's every spring.

1068
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:55,470
Every spring.

1069
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,850
OK, so the audit is past then.

1070
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:57,351
Yes.

1071
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:00,712
On the motion, Secretary will call the roll.

1072
01:16:01,572 --> 01:16:02,333
Mrs. Cuneo.

1073
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:10,536
Yes.

1074
01:16:12,257 --> 01:16:13,257
Mr. Benedetto.

1075
01:16:13,558 --> 01:16:13,878
Yes, indeed.

1076
01:16:14,543 --> 01:16:15,223
Mr. Falco.

1077
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:15,623
Yes.

1078
01:16:15,643 --> 01:16:16,763
Mr. Scarpelli.

1079
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:17,083
Yes.

1080
01:16:17,463 --> 01:16:18,024
Mr. Scari.

1081
01:16:18,064 --> 01:16:18,344
Yes.

1082
01:16:18,364 --> 01:16:19,284
Mayor McGlynn.

1083
01:16:19,664 --> 01:16:19,864
No.

1084
01:16:20,084 --> 01:16:23,925
By a vote of five in the affirmative, one in the negative, the item passes.

1085
01:16:26,525 --> 01:16:30,186
And then Jewel and Maria are going to unroll some good news.

1086
01:16:30,226 --> 01:16:34,606
And while we do that, I will tell you that the last page is the P&L that you requested.

1087
01:16:35,307 --> 01:16:37,967
And that June is estimated, of course.

1088
01:16:38,587 --> 01:16:42,508
And when that is complete, we'll provide you with an end of year for the food service program.

1089
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,241
Thank you very much.

1090
01:16:47,442 --> 01:16:59,611
Our schools at the DESC conference that I just attended to about a month ago recognized two of our schools, the McGlynn and the Columbus, for increasing their participation in the breakfast program.

1091
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:02,954
And they gave us these wonderful banners to hang up in our schools.

1092
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:16,466
Our very own Lunch Mothers from the Roberts School was nominated by the School Nutrition Association for a Super Lunch Hero.

1093
01:17:17,607 --> 01:17:18,428
That's great.

1094
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:19,468
Thank you.

1095
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:24,312
Recommendation to adopt the revised policy on head lice in public schools.

1096
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:27,334
Motion approved by Mr. Skerry.

1097
01:17:27,354 --> 01:17:27,954
Mr. Belson.

1098
01:17:27,974 --> 01:17:33,738
Members of the committee, we have our supervisor of health, Tony Vento, here to go over this with you.

1099
01:17:33,758 --> 01:17:36,360
This was given to you a while ago.

1100
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:40,504
We need to bring it back because obviously it's a topic that comes up periodically.

1101
01:17:40,925 --> 01:17:51,529
We want to be consistent with the best advice we get from the Department of Public Health and all the other associations that deal with this, the Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of School Nurses and the like.

1102
01:17:52,029 --> 01:17:58,752
And it's really important that we minimize student absences and we don't create a sense that something is more

1103
01:18:00,183 --> 01:18:08,866
let's say, dangerous than it is, when we need to keep youngsters in school and we need to give people clear instruction in the school as to how to handle this.

1104
01:18:08,926 --> 01:18:18,969
So I'm going to turn it over to our supervisor to explain it to you a little bit more so that you have a sense of what we need to do in order to get a consistent policy in place.

1105
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,650
Good evening, Mayor and Superintendent Belson and school committee members.

1106
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:26,491
In the school year 2013 to 14, we piloted

1107
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:39,564
a LICE protocol change that focused on keeping students in school if they had presence of NITs, which are LICE eggs.

1108
01:18:40,664 --> 01:18:57,914
And we're looking today to update that and include what's called more of a screening and education program that focuses more on keeping students in school, minimizing the amount of time parents are called out of work to pick up students who have

1109
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:05,261
on head lice and focusing on reducing the stigmatism of lice in the classroom.

1110
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:07,382
It is a common occurrence.

1111
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:11,623
There's no research that supports that lice carry any disease.

1112
01:19:12,723 --> 01:19:16,665
And in fact, the research shows that it's not even spread in the classroom setting.

1113
01:19:17,005 --> 01:19:24,147
It tends to be spread at home or in a camp situation when children are sleeping in close quarters.

1114
01:19:25,388 --> 01:19:36,214
So by focusing on the education, we've developed a number of parent letters and parent information tools, some of which we'd like to send home in the information packets at the beginning of the school year.

1115
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:39,736
We will target screen students.

1116
01:19:39,836 --> 01:19:48,380
So if there are students that are suspected of having lice, we will screen them and then put the efforts into education for the family on how to manage that at home.

1117
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:53,843
But the goal is to keep students in school and focusing on academics.

1118
01:20:02,492 --> 01:20:11,298
So if the classroom has a rug or a pillow or a stuffed animal, that was one of the biggest questions in the past.

1119
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:11,639
Exactly.

1120
01:20:11,759 --> 01:20:27,090
I'd say the classrooms have really rid themselves of rugs and pillows and students are, I mean, you can do group work even though you're not head to head and you can sit in the same area, but you know, it's just kind of common sense procedures.

1121
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,732
Some other things that we do advise the teachers to do,

1122
01:20:30,523 --> 01:20:39,129
is to encourage students to take off their jackets and their hats and put them into their own backpack, rather than hanging them in a cubby area.

1123
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:44,753
And that will reduce the spread as well, once it's in a contained, the code is in a contained environment.

1124
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,074
Thank you.

1125
01:20:47,015 --> 01:20:49,977
Tony, so you just said reduce the spread.

1126
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:56,581
So it reduces the spread, but are you saying if we're encouraging kids to stay in school,

1127
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:05,917
over what it would have been if they weren't in school, it is going to continue to spread.

1128
01:21:06,297 --> 01:21:14,801
Well, Mayor, the lice spreads in situations where students tend to share bedding or share close quarters.

1129
01:21:14,842 --> 01:21:19,304
That's typically in camp, on sleepovers, within the home.

1130
01:21:19,664 --> 01:21:21,805
It has not been shown to spread in school.

1131
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:33,835
So what we're doing, we will look at children that are suspected of having lice, and we'll focus on education with the parent on how to rid them of that.

1132
01:21:36,918 --> 01:21:37,598
Is there a motion?

1133
01:21:39,379 --> 01:21:39,699
Second.

1134
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:40,780

Thank you.

1140
01:21:45,563 --> 01:21:46,364
Mr. Mayor, just one thing.

1141
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:50,477
I know the committee would like to congratulate Tony on the recent marriage of her daughter.

1142

Oh, congratulations.

Negotiations and legal matters.

1153
