[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna give you guys an update on what we've been up to over the past year.

116
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:29,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, when I was looking at my presentation from last time, I'm not sure that we did this last year because of, I'm not sure, I couldn't find it.

117
01:05:29,986 --> 01:05:30,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it two years ago.

118
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:31,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all about remote learning.

119
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:33,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy to kind of turn the page on that.

120
01:05:34,387 --> 01:05:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna introduce some new staff this year that we hired.

121
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:42,110
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, his name is Andrew Theobald, and he's in the picture to the right, actually.

122
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,371
[SPEAKER_02]: He is our new automotive technology instructor.

123
01:05:44,771 --> 01:05:48,072
[SPEAKER_02]: To the right, actually, he is our new automotive technology instructor.

124
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:53,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also hired a metal fabrication instructor, Mr. Curtis Jackson, who's on the left.

125
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:59,333
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went into the space to take pictures of the teachers, the students were more than happy to jump into the picture with them.

126
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:00,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just let it happen.

127
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:05,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's some of the automotive and some of the metal fab students, two great additions to our team.

128
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:11,292
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been doing some renovations.

129
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, no report is usually complete on my end in case I haven't broken down some walls.

130
01:06:17,116 --> 01:06:18,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna fill you in on what we've done.

131
01:06:19,037 --> 01:06:28,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Cosmetology, as you know, the salon opened a year ago, but we finally moved the grade nine and 10 classroom up to the room next to the salon, which actually already had glass windows installed.

132
01:06:29,043 --> 01:06:31,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the freshmen and sophomores can look into the salon.

133
01:06:32,345 --> 01:06:33,706
[SPEAKER_02]: The two teachers are together now.

134
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:45,059
[SPEAKER_02]: We renovated our Make Way for Kids and our early childhood education program, the Make Way for Kids program, which is a nursery school for little tykes on three days a week in the morning.

135
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:51,180
[SPEAKER_02]: We moved them from the cosmetology space downstairs to a ground level floor room.

136
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:58,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a picture that you see there that's completely redone with new carpet walls, window treatments, and some plumbing.

137
01:06:59,242 --> 01:07:00,843
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to the next slide.

139
01:07:03,396 --> 01:07:05,358
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, there's booths that the students work in.

140
01:07:05,618 --> 01:07:09,161
[SPEAKER_02]: They were splintered and old, so we needed to replace all the booths.

141
01:07:09,181 --> 01:07:11,342
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a project that the carpentry students took on.

142
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:16,367
[SPEAKER_02]: They removed all the booths on the left side of the shop and replaced them with brand new booths for the students to work in.

143
01:07:17,187 --> 01:07:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: The room on the right, on the top, is just a picture of the cosmetology-related room.

144
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:25,094
[SPEAKER_02]: The teacher did an incredible job getting it to where it is now.

145
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:29,277
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really see it, but off in the back are the windows that look into the salon.

146
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:33,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bottom right is a picture of graphic design.

147
01:07:33,071 --> 01:07:34,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It was completed last spring.

148
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:37,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are two rooms that have been combined.

149
01:07:37,472 --> 01:07:45,955
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the former cosmetology space, which is now custom desks that were built by the carpentry students and new computers in that space.

150
01:07:48,216 --> 01:07:52,377
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mustang Mall also moved to a new location on our side of the building.

151
01:07:52,517 --> 01:07:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where he was.

152
01:07:57,859 --> 01:07:59,659
[SPEAKER_02]: A quick report on the Skills Capital Grant.

153
01:07:59,739 --> 01:08:06,401
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember correctly, the Skills Capital Grant is awarded to vocational technical schools, and this was our third time receiving it.

154
01:08:06,661 --> 01:08:20,924
[SPEAKER_02]: This time we saw just under $365,000, and this was directly funded for the Construction Craft Laborers Program, as well as our other construction trade programs, electrical, carpentry, and metal fabrication.

155
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:27,485
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just one picture on the left of many pieces of equipment that we got

156
01:08:28,018 --> 01:08:30,659
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my students here to the right, who's in the program, could tell you more.

157
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:40,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We completely outfitted the shop with the type of materials that students would need out in the workforce.

158
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:41,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that.

159
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:42,961
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a couple of pickup trucks.

160
01:08:43,001 --> 01:08:45,642
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lowboy dump trailer.

161
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:49,223
[SPEAKER_02]: We have equipment inside that won't even leave the shop.

162
01:08:49,263 --> 01:08:51,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have other stuff that we're using on job sites.

163
01:08:52,023 --> 01:08:53,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really happy about that.

164
01:08:55,541 --> 01:09:09,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was, I just have to do a special thank you to the teachers in that program, Mr. Danny Kelly, Mr. Ralph Taleva, Mr. Larry Brown, and of course to my amazing administrative assistant, Gina Citrano, who kind of pulled it all together for us on the budget end.

165
01:09:09,848 --> 01:09:10,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to that team.

166
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:18,313
[SPEAKER_02]: We also were recently awarded a Mass Life Sciences grant that we applied for, just under $120,000.

167
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:19,893
[SPEAKER_02]: $20,000 will be put towards professional development.

168
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And the remaining is for supplies and materials for our biotechnology program.

169
01:09:32,546 --> 01:09:43,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't really see it, but what you can see on the left is kind of a, over the last six or seven years, the enrollment shift in our career and technical education.
