1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for joining me today.

2
00:00:01,732 --> 00:00:04,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you just introduce yourself for us, so with your name and pronouns?

3
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:09,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Warren Senders, and my pronouns are he, him.

4
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:10,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:10,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Warren.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:20,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk a lot more about who you are today, but if you could just answer the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford, and what do you like to eat there?

7
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:26,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we rarely go there in person, but we love takeout from Chili Garden in Medford Square.

8
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:35,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm out for walks, I greatly enjoy stopping at Modern Bakery and getting one of their yummy Italian pastries and eating it on the walk home.

9
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,713
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a skill, eating and walking at the same time.

10
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:44,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did recently interview your wife, and you guys were consistent with your favorite restaurant there.

11
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:45,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that.

12
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:50,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I will just say, I have a secret co-host with me today, my baby niece.

13
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's baby noises in the background, please forgive me.

14
00:00:54,336 --> 00:01:00,577
[SPEAKER_03]: But if, yeah, so we, I think people might know you, might know of you as the man with the sign.

15
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:03,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So could you tell us a little bit about what's up with that sign?

16
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:26,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to provide context, every weekday morning between 7.30 and 8.30, I stand, usually with a partner in this project, out on the roadside at Roosevelt Circle, the rotary over the expressway.

17
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:31,258
[SPEAKER_01]: with signs about climate change.

18
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:37,860
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one sign that's a regular sign, it's a big wooden sign that I clamp to the guardrail that says climate change is real.

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have an assortment of other signs that I rotate from day to day so the message changes.

20
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:45,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been doing that every weekday morning.

21
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:55,867
[SPEAKER_01]: with two weeks off during the year, and I take off holidays, since the day after Labor Day in 2015.

22
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:11,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it's an outgrowth of my awareness of climate change as an existential factor in our lives and in the survival of our species and our cultural heritage, and of my

23
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:22,353
[SPEAKER_01]: life training as a musician, which involves maintaining the skill and discipline to do something every day, whether I feel like doing it or not.

24
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:31,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I'm outside on the roadside, I stand with a sign and I do my singing practice.

25
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:49,167
[SPEAKER_01]: So I practice every day for an hour on the roadside, and my practice is of the musical repertoire that I specialize in, which is the repertoire of the Hindustani Khayal, which is a North Indian song form that I've studied for many years.

26
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:57,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And that again, that informs my discipline as a climate activist.

27
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:09,155
[SPEAKER_01]: The work that I do as the carrier or the maintainer or the upholder of a cultural heritage is directly linked to climate activism.

28
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:23,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this stems from, as I think I said, from my own development as a musician and my recognition of the importance of daily practice and focused, disciplined attention.

29
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:33,527
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I actually began a project of doing something every day around the issue of climate change in 2009.

30
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:52,948
[SPEAKER_01]: at the ending, the December 31st of 2009, New Year's Eve, I made a resolution that I would write a letter to the editor on issues of climate change every day.

31
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:56,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did that for four years.

32
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:03,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote what's, it's, I think it's like,

33
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:16,739
[SPEAKER_01]: 1361 or something, I forget what the exact number is, but I wrote a letter a day to newspapers and magazines all around the world on the issues of climate change.

34
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,140
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that every day for four years.

35
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:39,365
[SPEAKER_01]: It just became a part of my day that I would mark out time to write a response to something that was in the news that had to do with climate change, whether it was sometimes it might be a local newspaper in Montana or Alaska or Louisiana or New York or elsewhere in the world.

36
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:43,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it would be a national news magazine or a big major paper.

37
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:53,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So just for example, during that period, I did this for four years and then I stopped because it was making me really depressed.

38
00:04:56,223 --> 00:05:12,717
[SPEAKER_01]: But during that time, I was published twice in the New York Times, once in Time Magazine, in the Washington Post, USA Today, the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald, LA Times, local newspapers all around the country.

39
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:18,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I got published in the Nunatsiak News, which is the weekly newspaper in Greenland.

40
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I got published in Pakistan.

41
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:22,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I got published in

42
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:30,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Brazil, I got published in the Solomon Islands, in Oceania, in newspapers, literally all around the world.

43
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:37,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I became, sort of by accident, one of the most widely distributed climate writers.

44
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:39,955
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were all just letters to the editor.

45
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that for four years, and that was a discipline.

46
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:49,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I stopped at the end of calendar year 2014,

47
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:56,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, end of calendar year 2013, heading into 2014.

48
00:05:57,211 --> 00:06:00,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a period when I was casting about for something new to do.

49
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, I lost my daily discipline for a little while.

50
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:06,757
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2015, I decided I was going to go out with a sign.

51
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:09,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just going to stand there.

52
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:18,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been almost 10 years of doing that, it sounds like.

53
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start my ninth year this Labor Day.

54
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:22,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

55
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:32,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to be able to chalk up 10 years, and then at the end of 10 years, I'm going to decide whether I want to continue it or move on to something different.

56
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:40,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the only activism I do, but it is the most sort of long form of the activist projects that I do.

57
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:56,683
[SPEAKER_01]: In music, the development of technique and artistic perspective and the wisdom of an artist is contingent on doing your daily discipline.

58
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:09,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I apply this to my activism, then it becomes something seen on one day at a time, it's not very much.

59
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:11,730
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that I look at it is,

60
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:29,255
[SPEAKER_01]: if you do a cost accounting of what it would cost to rent a billboard in that space for that many rush hour mornings, it would be in the tens of thousands of dollars easily.

61
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:37,920
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I stand there with a sign, I'm renting it with my body because I have First Amendment rights of freedom of expression.

62
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:39,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a

63
00:07:42,481 --> 00:08:02,172
[SPEAKER_01]: an aging white male, I have certain prerogatives that are granted to me by a fundamentally racially biased society, and if I don't use the privilege that I have, the absolutely unearned privilege that I have as an aging white male, then I don't deserve it.

64
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:13,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't deserve it anyway, but I really don't deserve it if I don't use it as part of work for the betterment of our future generations.

65
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:19,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the signs that I hold up, I have currently eight signs that are in rotation.

66
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:27,031
[SPEAKER_01]: The most fact oriented says it's just quotes from the 2021 IPCC report.

67
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:28,972
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sign says 2021 IPCC report.

68
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:42,971
[SPEAKER_01]: colon, quote, code red for humanity, and then it's got the URL of the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

69
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:55,881
[SPEAKER_01]: On the back of that sign is, in big letters, I think one of the most important mottos and signature principles that any of us who are involved in climate activism has.

70
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:00,305
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says, we must be better ancestors.

71
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:20,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And as someone who believes in intergenerational responsibility, it's our obligation to keep things in order for subsequent generations, and if possible, if we've made a mess, to clean it up so they don't have to.

72
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

73
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:29,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder, well, first I want to know if you've had any reactions from people or like how do people interact with you generally when you're out there?

74
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day, every day.

75
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:44,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And I write about those on my, when I journal, I write this, you can find my journaling on Mastodon under my name, on Instagram under man with sign, on Facebook as man with sign.

76
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do it on Twitter, but no more since Elon Musk took it over.

77
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:51,553
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't believe in supporting fascists.

78
00:09:54,236 --> 00:10:02,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty ambivalent about posting on Facebook, but I've got too many people who follow that.

79
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:12,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time, this being Massachusetts, most of what we get are people going, thank you, yay, and clapping and giving thumbs up.

80
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:19,490
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people who have negative responses.

81
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:25,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We regularly get people who give us thumbs down or another finger upraised.

82
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:31,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people twirl their fingers at their temples to indicate that they think we're cuckoo.

83
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:34,381
[SPEAKER_01]: My visual partner is a guy named Craig Knopf.

84
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:35,421
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in Winchester.

85
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:40,143
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a retired librarian, and he comes out most days, and we're there together.

86
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:42,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally, we have some other people join us.

87
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:51,209
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy who drives by every day at around 8, 13, every morning, and he always goes by and goes,

88
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,151
[SPEAKER_01]: get a job and pay some taxes you effing weirdo.

89
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Except he doesn't say effing.

90
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:00,355
[SPEAKER_03]: He's updating himself for the podcast.

91
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:01,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

92
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:07,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sometimes, sometimes you get some real, some really amazing things.

93
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:22,311
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite was the guy driving a panel truck who actually leaned all the way out the window while the thing was in motion and called me a communist, atheist, Freemason faggot.

94
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:23,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

95
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:24,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

96
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:35,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is like, I don't know how all four of those descriptors managed to make it into one phrase, but okay, you know, I mean, that's clearly like a

97
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's my next T-shirt, I guess.

98
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,966
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, I mean, one day I was out there.

99
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:47,368
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a few years ago, back when we still had blizzards.

100
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:54,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a real howling Dr. Zhivago style blizzard with visibility like way down.

101
00:11:54,732 --> 00:12:00,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got chemical heat packets in my boots and gloves and 16 layers of clothing on there.

102
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:05,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just standing there with my sign singing and the snow was whipping around me.

103
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,099
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody on the road, because visibility is down to practically zero.

104
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And a state policeman pulls over.

105
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,200
[SPEAKER_01]: No siren, but lights flashing.

106
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figure this is it.

107
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,761
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just going to tell me to go home.

108
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:20,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead, the patrolman jumps out.

109
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:29,484
[SPEAKER_01]: The officer jumps out, walks over to me, leans over, puts his head next to mine, takes out his phone, snaps a selfie, gets back in his car and drives off.

110
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's kind of interesting.

111
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:41,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And my state rep Paul Donato, one time he pulls over, gets out of his car and says, I see you every day I brought you a cup of coffee.

112
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, hey Donato got my vote, he's bribed me with a cup of coffee.

113
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,362
[SPEAKER_01]: He would have had my vote anyway.

114
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:57,186
[SPEAKER_01]: This work that I do, I'll go through the other signs that I have, because I think they're interesting.

115
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:04,971
[SPEAKER_01]: All my signs, my portable signs are on foam core, and there's one thing on one side and one on the other.

116
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:14,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next sign that I have on the front, or on one side, it says, let's make a better future together.

117
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:23,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other side of that, it says, and this is my take on the popular bumper sticker, think globally, act locally.

118
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:28,405
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, think in eons, act now.

119
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:40,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe that one of the things that affects our society most in a negative way is our inability to think in long timeframes.

120
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,214
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not temporally literate.

121
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:49,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the things that is a, it's a serious lack.

122
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:53,286
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you see, think of the impact on the next seven generations.

123
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,574
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an organization in San Francisco called the Long Now Foundation.

124
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:09,157
[SPEAKER_01]: that was founded by Stuart Brand, the guy who put together the whole Earth Catalog and who's behind the Clock of the Long Now, which is a 10,000-year clock in the Mojave Desert.

125
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:11,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Well worth looking up.

126
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up the Clock of the Long Now.

127
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,322
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very important project.

128
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:25,089
[SPEAKER_01]: The Long Now Foundation, on all their correspondence, uses a five-digit date, or five-digit year code.

129
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,710
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are in year 02024.

130
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:30,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

131
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:43,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means they don't need to reset any technology for the next 99 or the next 99,000 years.

132
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:45,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it counting up or down?

133
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:48,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, eventually it'll go to the year 10,000.

134
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:49,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

135
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 20,000, there's room for up to 99,000.

136
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:50,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

137
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we finally get to years 100,000, then I guess they'll need to recalibrate.

138
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:00,939
[SPEAKER_01]: But see, that is thinking long term.

139
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:19,822
[SPEAKER_01]: that's recognizing that we human beings exist on the top of a long set of much, much slower timeframes.

140
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:28,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are just a kind of fleeting manifestation of consciousness on the top of these very, very long time cycles.

141
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,832
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, think in eons, act now.

142
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another sign.

143
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:42,167
[SPEAKER_01]: One side says climate chaos increases the likelihood of the next pandemic.

144
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:49,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I started putting that out when we had COVID because people again think, oh, well, COVID, you know, now that's over.

145
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:51,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the rearview mirror.

146
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:52,334
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.

147
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:55,657
[SPEAKER_01]: As climate instability increases,

148
00:15:57,042 --> 00:16:00,284
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of possible disease vectors increases.

149
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And the need for a robust public health infrastructure increases.

150
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:11,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And because there will be more things which are uncontrollable.

151
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:22,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Industrial monoculture, agricultural monoculture is more vulnerable to pests and to plant diseases.

152
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:28,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have genetic diversity in your agricultural stock, then something will survive.

153
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:37,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But if everything is the same type of potato or whatever, then all it takes is one virus, and then you have the Irish potato famine.

154
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:40,439
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is something that we have to be aware of.

155
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:43,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, climate chaos increases the likelihood of the next pandemic.

156
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:46,825
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side, this is my nod to humor.

157
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:51,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, every disaster movie starts with a scientist being ignored.

158
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,951
[SPEAKER_01]: That always gets laughs.

159
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have another sign.

160
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:59,857
[SPEAKER_01]: This is last of the signs for today.

161
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:04,541
[SPEAKER_01]: One side says, weird is the new normal.

162
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if there's one thing that people have been noticing is, gee, the weather's kind of weird recently.

163
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:14,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And weird is the new normal.

164
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:20,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that climate change means that everything's going to get hotter uniformly.

165
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,491
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that everything's going to get weirder.

166
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:32,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that there will be a day in August when for 36 hours, it'll be close to freezing.

167
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:38,182
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the way that the climate patterns have unfolded, and no one expected it.

168
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:39,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's weird.

169
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:44,047
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have 100-year storms and they're happening once every year, that's weird.

170
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:54,535
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have temperature fluctuations that go up and down 40 or 50 degrees from the beginning of the week to the end of the week, that's weird.

171
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird is the new normal, and it has impacts on all of us.

172
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the other side of that is

173
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:04,160
[SPEAKER_01]: my analysis of what needs to be done.

174
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:13,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that says, one, change our conversation, two, change our consumption, three, change our politics.

175
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:18,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So the work that I do on the roadside is changing the conversation.

176
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:23,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can't fix a problem if you can't talk about it.

177
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:24,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And so

178
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:33,800
[SPEAKER_01]: people, especially people in the industrialized West, need to have the difficult conversation about climate change every day.

179
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be part of our daily discourse.

180
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:49,025
[SPEAKER_01]: The news should have a daily ticker of what CO2 concentrations are according to the daily measurements.

181
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:52,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that trend is going up, that's bad.

182
00:18:56,305 --> 00:19:04,730
[SPEAKER_01]: So change the conversation, making discussion of climate issues a normative part of our daily existence.

183
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Change our consumption.

184
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:15,756
[SPEAKER_01]: That means making difficult decisions about buying or not buying things according to what they do as part of their usage of the global resource chain.

185
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:23,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your strawberries in December are being shipped from Brazil, well, don't buy strawberries in December.

186
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:27,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fly gratuitously.

187
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:34,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And be aware of your decisions as a consumer.

188
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:41,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worth noting here that just a little over a hundred years ago,

189
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:54,343
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of a consumer economy in the West had not been fully established, and the word consumption was – it was a synonym for a disease.

190
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:56,966
[SPEAKER_01]: It was tuberculosis.

191
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,109
[SPEAKER_01]: People died of consumption.

192
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:16,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's worth noting that a hundred years ago, the word consumption meant if you had consumption, it meant you were going to die or you were going to live like a really impoverished life where you couldn't get out of bed.

193
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:33,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because tuberculosis was no joke and well we've taken care of tuberculosis thanks to our public health initiatives, but consumption is going to be is going to be killing more people over the next decades and centuries, unless we change our consumption patterns.

194
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally changing our politics which means.

195
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:53,015
[SPEAKER_01]: transforming the way in which our electoral system reflects the will of people and the long-term interests of our human community and the global ecosystem.

196
00:20:53,856 --> 00:21:05,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, our political system has been largely captured by predatory capitalists, and the result is that even when we have

197
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:17,026
[SPEAKER_01]: political actors with good intentions, they are hindered by the structural factors that have made it

198
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:38,150
[SPEAKER_01]: that much more difficult to go forward, things like the Electoral College, which vastly overprivileges the votes, the rural votes of people in Montana against urban voters in New York or Boston or San Antonio or wherever, that privileges white rural votes over black urban votes, for example.

199
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And so,

200
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:51,338
[SPEAKER_01]: This is intended as a form of perspective.

201
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, how shall I put this?

202
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to call for a revolution.

203
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:10,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Revolutions leave an awful lot of people dead.

204
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,632
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a revolution 250 years ago.

205
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:30,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we recognize that patriotism, it's not a static phenomenon.

206
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,561
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a static thing that we subscribe to.

207
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:35,962
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a direction of travel.

208
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:56,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we say if we are patriotic is that we are devoted to the ideals that our country expresses and that the fact that our country fails in those ideals is a spur to us to work harder to get it to accomplish those ideals.

209
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:58,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.

210
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:24,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is really the project of our lives is to try and accomplish a defeat of fascist autocracy and to change the way in which we conduct our political business so that an unelected Supreme Court can't

211
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,454
[SPEAKER_01]: by a judicial fiat wipe out women's bodily autonomy in this country.

212
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:37,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's a scary time for sure.

213
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I like kind of want to relate this back to your comparison to your musical practice, right?

214
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:57,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think I sometimes think about this like nautical metaphor, where like, if you are like, you know, steering a boat, and you said sort of just switch tracks by like a centimeter, yes, in 100 miles, they'll be in a totally different place.

215
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:58,209
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

216
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:03,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckminster Fuller's gravesite reads his epitaph reads trim tab.

217
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:05,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that me?

218
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:14,434
[SPEAKER_01]: A trim tab is the tiny thing on the end of the rudder on a boat, and that adjusts the trim of the boat.

219
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:18,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what makes that one centimeter adjustment.

220
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:19,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

221
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:28,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Bucky Fuller thought of himself as the trim tap that would provide a course correction that would take effect over hundreds of years.

222
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:29,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

223
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:34,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it seems like that's something that we need to be thinking about for climate change, like what you're saying.

224
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:53,070
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's an alternative to a revolution, is there anything that you think would be helpful for people to know or to practice or to try to implement that could be, like you're saying, a daily practice to try to have some change over time?

225
00:24:53,550 --> 00:25:01,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't believe that what I do is in its specifics an example for everybody.

226
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend that you start practicing Hindustani music by the roadside.

227
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:20,584
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I find in my own life is that I'm able to maintain some degree of personal and artistic equilibrium

228
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:23,963
[SPEAKER_01]: when I do these daily disciplines.

229
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:26,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a religious man.

230
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:29,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I was raised by atheist scientists.

231
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:32,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no religious background or upbringing.

232
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:41,688
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a deep believer in the functional power of ritual.

233
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:46,544
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ritualize something, you make it easier to do every day.

234
00:25:47,424 --> 00:26:08,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And if each of us finds tasks and responsibilities that we can carry out every day, and it could be, for me, my everyday task has to do with changing the conversation.

235
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:13,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out there, I'm trying to provide people with food for thought.

236
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:17,496
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people who've driven past me every weekday for the past eight and a half years.

237
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:22,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd like to think they've read those signs at some point.

238
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:39,190
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do get messages from people who say, you know, you've inspired me to talk about climate change with my colleagues, or you've inspired me to put up a sign outside my house, or I decided to join the local chapter of an environmental group.

239
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:43,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things help me go forward.

240
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:50,070
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is an infinite number of possible tasks.

241
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:55,272
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment, the web of life of which we are a part,

242
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:01,384
[SPEAKER_01]: is in need of our loving attention.

243
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:11,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be anything from saying, all right, I'm gonna go out with a pair of grippers and a nail on a stick and just spend an hour a week picking up trash in a park.

244
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's time that you would have otherwise spent watching Netflix.

245
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:22,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, the park is cleaner and so are you.

246
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:37,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that I think about this daily work, you know, in Oceania, people go out on canoes and they do like really long distances in the canoes.

247
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:40,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And the canoes have outriggers.

248
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:45,291
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like a separate thing that's off to one side that helps keep it stable.

249
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:46,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the boat essentially wide.

250
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:55,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And the vigils are like, that's the outrigger on my canoe so that I don't get capsized.

251
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:57,345
[SPEAKER_01]: The news comes in, the news goes out.

252
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:59,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the daily news is terrifying.

253
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:01,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's exhilarating.

254
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:04,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And if all I do is watch the news, then I get caught up in that.

255
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:08,793
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have an outrigger on my canoe, then I don't capsize.

256
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:21,108
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of us need to be engaged in activism, and all of us need to be engaged in politics, and all of us need to be engaged in the work of cultural transmission as well.

257
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:28,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Because activism, politics, and culture.

258
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:36,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture is what we're trying to preserve, along with our natural position in the ecological system.

259
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you so concerned about the environment?

260
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:40,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I live in it.

261
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:43,456
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where I live.

262
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:44,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

263
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:45,983
[SPEAKER_01]: This is home maintenance.

264
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:47,644
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something separate from me.

265
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:51,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be responsible to my home.

266
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:53,649
[SPEAKER_01]: The earth is my home.

267
00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:04,778
[SPEAKER_01]: When going back to Buckminster Fuller toward the end of his life, someone was interviewing him and they said, Mr. Fuller, are you sad that you never had a chance to be in a spaceship?

268
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I am in a spaceship.

269
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:15,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're on a big ball of rock that's going through space at hundreds of thousands of miles an hour.

270
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,880
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's not a spaceship, then what is?

271
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:22,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is that perspective.

272
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:30,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Activism, this is, now you see, once you get me going on this, then there's no getting me off it.

273
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:38,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Activism is work for the greater good, however you see it.

274
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:53,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Greater good means that you look at what you believe to be beneficial for humanity, for our posterity, for our collective survival in the long term, and then you refuse to compromise for that.

275
00:29:55,948 --> 00:30:00,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not going to let a little bad weather push me in off the road.

276
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:01,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be out there.

277
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to force the change in conversation.

278
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to give up.

279
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:08,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I do civil disobedience.

280
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:11,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a member of the Boston chapter of Extinction Rebellion.

281
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:22,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been arrested multiple times for civil disobedience in blocking traffic or doing a sit-in at the governor's office or various different kinds of civil disobedience.

282
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm not going to compromise.

283
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:29,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And if when the judge sentences me to community service, I'll do my community service gladly.

284
00:30:30,177 --> 00:30:31,018
[SPEAKER_01]: That's activism.

285
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:35,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Activism is refusal to compromise in the service of the greater good.

286
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:46,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Politics, and this is the area where a lot of my activist colleagues are misguided, I believe, politics is superficially similar to activism, but it is fundamentally different.

287
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:57,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Politics is about the actual practical application of resources and attention and budget to getting things done.

288
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:08,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And so politics is by definition compromising with your ideological opponents because no compromise is necessary with your ideological allies.

289
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And so politics is all about agreeing to compromise and the lesser evil.

290
00:31:19,297 --> 00:31:32,247
[SPEAKER_01]: The inherent nature of politics is you're not always going to get what you want, and you want to get the best deal possible, and you elect people in order to represent you in the negotiations with your ideological opponents.

291
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:45,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if our politicians are negotiating with fossil fuel executives, the fossil fuel executives might be saying, well, you know, our position is you should let us burn up the planet because it'll make our quarterly reports look good.

292
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:49,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we say no, we know we, we want it to change.

293
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:53,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at some point, you're gonna have to have an agreement, right.

294
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:59,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's inherent in that agreement that I'm not going to get everything that I want.

295
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:03,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Elizabeth Warren says you take the win and then you keep moving.

296
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:09,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Activism, refusing to compromise for the greater good.

297
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:14,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Politics, agreeing to compromise for the lesser evil.

298
00:32:15,408 --> 00:32:21,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And then culture, the chain of culture, the transmission.

299
00:32:23,454 --> 00:32:29,699
[SPEAKER_01]: By training, I learned the style of Hindustani singing called Kayal.

300
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:34,622
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a style that goes back, that has its origins in the 1600s.

301
00:32:37,217 --> 00:32:45,813
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the songs that I sing are 400 years old, and they have been taught from one teacher to a student.

302
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:50,593
[SPEAKER_01]: generation upon generation upon generation.

303
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone 400 years ago taught a student.

304
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:55,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a student?

305
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a student?

306
00:32:56,695 --> 00:32:57,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a student?

307
00:32:57,615 --> 00:32:58,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a student?

308
00:32:58,515 --> 00:32:59,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a student?

309
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:03,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a man named Balakrishna Bua Ichal Karanjikar?

310
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:07,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a man named Anant Manohar Joshi?

311
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a man named Gajanan Rao Joshi?

312
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught a man named Shriram Devastali?

313
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Who taught me?

314
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:25,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I teach you that same song, then you're on the receiving end of a chain of transmission that goes back 400 years.

315
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:36,433
[SPEAKER_01]: The implication is that when you participate in the transmission of culture, then you are engaged in a long form of human communication.

316
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:41,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Culture is how human beings communicate across time and space.

317
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:49,654
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sing a piece of music by Bach, you are engaged in a conversation with Bach.

318
00:33:52,056 --> 00:34:03,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if I teach you a song that's 400 years old, I'm throwing down a message in a bottle that's supposed to last 400 years in the future.

319
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:21,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, this is interesting because I feel like I was expecting our conversation to be mostly about climate change, but I really appreciated your I think the messages about how you how you compare like the visual for you to like something to the canoe and what keeps you kind of grounded.

320
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:31,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is something that I think a lot of us could use right now in terms of like how helpless we might feel with what's going on in the world and how to sort of have like a piece of

321
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:37,448
[SPEAKER_03]: of our world feel like it's contributing to that greater good you're talking about?

322
00:34:38,148 --> 00:34:53,335
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the great problems that all of us experience is that weirdly, as our connectivity expands, our sense of agency seems to diminish.

323
00:34:55,187 --> 00:35:07,171
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're just endlessly buffeted by more news, feel this, feel that, look at this, do this, play this game, listen to this, and our sense of individual agency diminishes.

324
00:35:08,412 --> 00:35:12,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like there's less and less that we actually have responsibility for.

325
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:22,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And what my work is about, and this is, again, going back to that thinking globally and acting locally, is that,

326
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody's had this experience.

327
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:33,536
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when you have to clean up your room and it's a big mess and you don't know where to start?

328
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:38,841
[SPEAKER_01]: The point isn't that, oh, you started in the wrong place.

329
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:46,807
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is that you start somewhere and you establish a little zone of agency.

330
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:53,892
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little space where you have some strength, where you have a sense of coherence of purpose.

331
00:35:55,548 --> 00:36:00,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, you feel just a tiny bit empowered.

332
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:08,159
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, maybe you can feel a little bit more empowered, and you gain a little bit more strength.

333
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I do this work every day, then I gain the kind of,

334
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:24,962
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of temporal mass, if you will, that comes from having done something every day.

335
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:28,905
[SPEAKER_01]: The everydayness of it winds up giving me strength.

336
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:34,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day I write 20 postcards to voters.

337
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:42,457
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not much, but at the end of a week, I've written 140 postcards.

338
00:36:43,738 --> 00:36:45,740
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of a month, I've written 600 postcards.

339
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:54,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that seems powerful to combat that feeling of doom and gloom, I think that maybe a lot of us are feeling, yeah.

340
00:36:54,851 --> 00:37:04,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and linking that with the work of culture, because human beings are storytelling creatures.

341
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:10,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We need stories to make sense of our world, and we need songs.

342
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:14,702
[SPEAKER_01]: There has never been a human species without music.

343
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:22,995
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been some human cultures that have tried to outlaw music.

344
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:25,676
[SPEAKER_01]: The Taliban springs to mind.

345
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:30,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they find with that is outlawing music, it turns out it doesn't work.

346
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:36,401
[SPEAKER_01]: People go on singing no matter what.

347
00:37:37,982 --> 00:37:44,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we derive our strength and our power

348
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:51,441
[SPEAKER_01]: from our shared culture and from our capacity to share culture with one another.

349
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:56,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the nourishment that we need in order to do all the other work.

350
00:37:56,743 --> 00:38:02,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Because face it, activism is very frustrating.

351
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:04,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a climate activist.

352
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:11,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing I ever do will be enough.

353
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a political activist.

354
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:19,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing I ever do will be enough, but we got to do it anyway.

355
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:31,416
[SPEAKER_01]: You do it anyway, and you do it anyway because the music, the culture, the stories, the poetry, Vijaya's work as poet laureate, for example,

356
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:46,389
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things are part of the fabric of our human life and the cultural project that we're engaged in as human beings of sharing our songs and stories with one another.

357
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:50,711
[SPEAKER_01]: is that's one of the other things that brings us together.

358
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:59,278
[SPEAKER_01]: So the third part of this, right, is like, yeah, do some activism every day, do some politics every day, and do some culture every day.

359
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:01,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Sing a song for yourself.

360
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:15,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Find some people to sing with, find some people, join a drum group, join a community chorus, you know, paint, write poems, tell stories.

361
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:23,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And share culture with people, because that's what glues us together as human beings.

362
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,145
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of our social infrastructure.

363
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:42,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think especially in a town like, or a city like Medford, where there is like a big, you know, somewhat of a variety of culture, and a lot of disconnection these days, I think, like, being able to find that common thread throughout, and there's a lot of opportunity for that in Medford, I think.

364
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:49,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like a nice kind of antidote, like, to, you know, I think all of the disconnection that we're feeling.

365
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Human beings crave connection.

366
00:39:53,898 --> 00:39:55,439
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be with one another.

367
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,760
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a social species.

368
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:20,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of our work, not as activists or political agents, but as human beings, lies in recognizing that culture is part of the way that we preserve our values through time and space.

369
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:44,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more that we learn our history as a nation or as different cultural groups and learn about the ways in which these forces intersect, then we can have a meaningful perspective, we can have meaningful stories to tell that we can share with one another.

370
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

371
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering, this has been a really helpful conversation for me and very enlightening.

372
00:40:51,543 --> 00:40:53,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if there's anything else you want to share before we wrap up?

373
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:13,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm working on a long-term musical project where I'm getting contributions from people in different countries all over the world on a setting of a

374
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:19,405
[SPEAKER_01]: phrase of a piece of prose by Isaac Newton.

375
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:33,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been building this over the past couple of years, and it's a long-term project because the very nature of this work is long-term.

376
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:40,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Isaac Newton quote, I think, exemplifies the kind of perspective that I seek to bring.

377
00:41:40,355 --> 00:41:43,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So with your permission, I will sing

378
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:51,523
[SPEAKER_01]: the material, and I'm gonna put on a little drone that's gonna be in the background so that you'll hear that.

379
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:58,527
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the vocal accompaniment sound that I use for my... You hear that?

380
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:00,548
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sound called a tambura.

381
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,190
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the quote from Isaac Newton.

382
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,292
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in three parts.

383
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:11,973
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a medium tempo part, a fast part, and a slow part.

384
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll sing each one twice, and then I'll speak the quote.

385
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:34,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I may seem to the world, but as to myself, I seem like a child playing on the seashore.

386
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:52,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I may seem to the world, but as to myself I seem like a child playing on the seashore.

387
00:42:53,845 --> 00:43:06,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Diverting myself, diverting myself, now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell.

388
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:14,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell.

389
00:43:15,038 --> 00:43:17,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Diverting myself,

390
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:27,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Diverting myself now and then Finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell

391
00:43:29,768 --> 00:43:46,001
[SPEAKER_00]: While the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

392
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:55,788
[SPEAKER_00]: While the great ocean of truth lay all

393
00:43:56,989 --> 00:44:02,014
[SPEAKER_00]: undiscovered before me.

394
00:44:03,255 --> 00:44:21,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I may seem to the world, but as to myself, I seem like a child playing on the seashore, diverting myself, now and then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell,

395
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:27,498
[SPEAKER_01]: while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

396
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:45,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Isaac Newton wrote that over 400 years ago, and it exemplifies what I feel about my responsibilities as an artist, as an activist, as a person engaged in the political struggles and the cultural struggles of my lifetime and my world.

397
00:44:47,214 --> 00:44:55,877
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would like to extend an invitation to anybody in Medford or the surrounding areas who would like to come out and join me on Roosevelt Circle.

398
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:59,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out there every weekday morning, rain or shine.

399
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,939
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let me know, I will bring a sign for you.

400
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:06,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out there 7.30 to 8.30 every morning.

[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be most welcome.

406
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I do lots of music and I teach music for my living.

407
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:32,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in studying music and you think that I might be able to help, well, you know how to reach me.

408
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And Danielle, what a pleasure to talk with you.

409
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:36,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you so much.

410
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:42,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can see, you know, I think there's, it's definitely a very intellectual conversation, but I can also see that it's an emotional one as well.

411
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:47,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just thank you for, you know, sharing this with us and continuing to do the work that you're doing.

413
00:45:49,773 --> 00:45:54,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you find something useful and I hope that your listeners enjoy this.

414
00:45:55,136 --> 00:46:00,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just an old white dude just, you know, taking advantage of my unearned privilege.

415
00:46:00,698 --> 00:46:03,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, feel free to ignore.

416
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a good way to use it.

417
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you so much.

418
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:06,641
