Hi, Larry.

62

OK.

63
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:51,087
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4.

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,947
14 voting members present, one absent, so we have a lovely quorum.

65
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,190
Our first order of business is to approve some minutes.

66
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,373
On the consent agenda, we had four sets of minutes listed.

67
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,694
One was for the 9-18 full committee meeting.

68
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:17,136
One was for the 9-18 communications and community engagement subcommittee meeting.

69
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:25,780
And then the other two was one for the January 23rd communications and community engagement.

70
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,641
Recording stopped.

71
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:28,042
And.

72
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:30,823
Recording in progress.

73
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,299
Thank you, Peter.

74
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:41,466
And then we also had a set of minutes from our OPM selection subcommittee meeting on 2-11.

75
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:50,052
I believe C and D on your agenda actually did not make it into the packet.

76
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:56,997
So I think the first thing that we need to do is make a motion to sever those two and table them.

77
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:02,101
And so I will await a motion.

78
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,390
Motion to approve.

79
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,773
I hear a motion to approve by Mayor Lungo Kern.

80
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:26,596
Seconded by Dr. Galussi.

81
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:28,296
And is there a motion to sever the minutes?

82
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,219
Motion to sever the minutes.

83
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,841
Okay, so motion to sever the minutes by Dr. Galussi, seconded by

84
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,170
seconded.

85
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:47,572

I came back in.

153
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:12,925
I just need my, like, permissions back to be able to, like, unmute myself and turn my video on, because I switched devices.

154
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,106
OK.

00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:14,566

00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:15,667
I'll take care of that.

158

Minutes are approved.

160
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:29,558
We'll get the other two minutes on the next agenda and we'll take care of those then.

161
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:33,310
So we have a couple of things to do this evening.

162
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:39,473
The first is I wanted to provide an update on phase one of the MSBA process.

163
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:41,774
So as you know, we've been in the eligibility phase.

164
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:47,417
We submitted all of our deliverables back in July.

165
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:56,182
And over the course of the rest of the summer and into the fall, we were working with the MSBA to look at and certify our enrollment totals.

166
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:14,445
Those totals that sort of set stage for how big of a high school we're planning for and there was some back and forth between us and the folks who did their own enrollment study and.

167
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:23,248
Then really just sort of get to know Medford and some of our plans around things like housing growth and student.

168
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:35,311
You know, student growth and what we were seeing, so that went, so we had to sort of go back and forth with them and we finished that process in.

169
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:44,213
You know, sometimes we finished our end of that process in August, the had work to do on their end.

170
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:54,577
So they did their work and then they notified us in December that they forwarded us an agreement to sign around the enrollment.

171
00:08:55,097 --> 00:09:03,721
So just by way of some information, we have about 1,200 students right now, and that's been pretty consistent for the high school side.

172
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:04,081
We requested

173
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:20,492
A, an enrollment of 1500 for high school, and we settled on 1395, which is.

174
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:31,642
2, almost 200 students more than our current 1200. so that was a lot of growth, a lot of growth in progress for us, which I think sets us up well for the.

175
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:57,965
you know, the, the future and the kinds of things that we're expecting to see here in Medford, both with, um, attracting students who may be selecting other high schools, um, in part because they go to the building and they see it and they have questions about whether that's the place they want to be, um, as well as, um, providing for, um, expanded, um, families moving into Medford, um, who will want to use the, who will want to use the, um,

176
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,682
uh, the high school as a place to send their Children.

177
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:06,164
So we have some room to grow, which is great and amazing.

178
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:11,508
Um, and, um, we signed that we signed those agreements.

179
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:19,673
Um, we have signed, um, Dr Cushing.

180
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,675
Maybe we could disable the chat as well.

181
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,376
Yep, I will now as well.

182
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:30,861
Um, thank you and, um, we are, uh, we are done.

183
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,244
We are done with the.

184
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:43,695
MSBA module 1 work on Wednesday, the board of the MSBA will hear a recommendation from their staff.

185
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:56,186
to move us on to what they call phase 2 or module 2, which is where we get to start doing the fun things like bringing on the professionals that will help us through this process.

186
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:58,908
And we're really excited about that.

187
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:08,397
So that meeting will happen Wednesday morning, and then there will be meetings to onboard us to MSBA's expectations of the process.

188
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:18,973
Shortly thereafter, our delegation has sent the letter of support on our behalf.

189
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:24,741
So that was signed by Senator Jalen representatives did not Barbara and.

190
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:36,365
So, the is in receipt of that letter of recommendation, and we're just really excited to be able to do this next thing.

191
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:38,326
We're so excited.

192
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:41,628
In fact, that we have already started doing the next thing.

193
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:45,149
So 1 of the meetings that we had earlier this month was.

194
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,811
Of the selection committee who tackled building.

195
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:58,198
The request for services, which is the very 1st document in the next phase of the process.

196
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,402
We will review that tonight with a goal to.

197
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:13,093
Make any amendments that this committee sees fit and get ready to send that to the tomorrow and we're going to send that to them tomorrow.

198
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:13,614
So that.

199
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:26,191
We can be in the queue for their review, which takes about 2 weeks and then we can move forward on an aggressive timeline, which will have us interviewing and bringing in.

200
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:31,996
Um, an owner's project manager here before the end of June.

201
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,618
So, um, it's a, it's a quick time.

202
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:35,979
It's a quick tight timeline.

203
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:41,143
I wish it could be even faster than that because getting the team on board is incredibly important.

204
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:41,483
And that's.

205
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:43,865
You know, that's when the real work can begin.

206
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:50,830
So the educators have sort of done their work so far with setting the stage around what kind of.

207
00:12:51,693 --> 00:13:01,500
Educational opportunities we're trying to provide and now we get to the sort of meaty questions that everyone in the community has, which is, which is really exciting.

208
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:07,304
So that's a quick update on phase 1. are there any questions?

209
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:27,590
Okay, if you think of anything, just let me know, and we will move on from there.

210
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:35,296
So in phase two, our next agenda item is our plans for phase two.

211
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:47,826
I covered some of that already, but the goal is for us to be moving quickly through this process so that we can onboard the team and really get to the meat of the feasibility study.

212
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,128
Oh, Emily, did you have a question?

213
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:57,538
Sorry, yes.

214
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:20,049
I just wanted to ask really quickly if you could tell me about the estimated number for how, so I was reading through and the estimates for how many students would be housed in the building, what the timeline is for that, like how, what the stretch of time was that was anticipated for the building to be used.

215
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,122
Yeah, they that's a great question.

216
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:26,044
So they, they did a study that looked out.

217
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:28,425
I want to say it was about 15 years.

218
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:35,269
And 1 of the things that we went back and forth with them about was exactly that that range.

219
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:35,629
So.

220
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,572
Our enrollment projections within MPS show that.

221
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:47,573
Mostly in agreement in the 1st, 10 to 15 years of the building's life.

222
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:58,316
Or from now, but that, you know, as we looked out past 15 years, that's where we saw the growth that was more significant.

223
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:07,379
So that was part of the conversation that we had, particularly around some of the housing developments that are coming down the pike and.

224
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,522
Not just like the planned projects and the permitted projects, which they ask about explicitly, but also some of the bigger.

225
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:27,125
Ideas and places where we are anticipating there could be substantial transformative projects in the city, like the air rights over Wellington.

226
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:32,086
So those are the kinds of things that we had to go through with them to.

227
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,876
sort of describe and look at.

228
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:47,103
And so we shared our projections with them and our projections sort of carry us much further into time than that original 15 year span.

229
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,744
So we did make some significant progress there.

230
00:15:49,784 --> 00:16:03,093
So I do believe that based on everything that we were able to use as the basis, we will not be out of space the minute we start or even in the first couple of decades.

231
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,364
Um, which is great news.

232
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,937
Any other questions about that?

233
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:20,136
Okay, so in phase two, there's a couple of things.

234
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:27,980
So I've been doing a lot of reading and the OPM selection committee has been doing a lot of reading as well about what phase two entails.

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,963
And it entails bringing on the owner's project manager.

236
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:35,564
MSBA has a very prescriptive process for that.

237
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,365
So I've been reading about that process.

238
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:41,307
The very first step is that we have to draft an RFS.

239
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:42,608
We'll look at that in just a few minutes.

240
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:51,677
And then they will have to review that it takes them a couple of weeks to review it and then they'll give us the green light to go ahead and post it.

241
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,239
It has to be posted.

242
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,901
We have to do a site visit.

243
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:58,565
We will get responses back and.

244
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:06,150
and then bring the list down to a short list, interview candidates, and make a selection.

245
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,114
Once we make a selection, we negotiate the price.

246
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:15,576
At that point, that's not part of the RFS process.

247
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:19,158
It happens afterwards, which was a surprise to me.

248
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,860
That's most of the RFPs that I work on in my world.

249
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,162
They're sort of two things happen at the same time.

250
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:42,299
Um, but this process is a little bit different and, um, once we have made our selection and we have done those negotiations, we then have to bring our selected to a review panel with and they have to give us the green light for that selection.

251
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:49,243
So, um, there is a that those review panel meetings happen on a monthly basis and we are targeting.

252
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:56,187
The June meeting to be all buttoned up and ready to go to get their their approval.

253
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:57,148
So we can move forward.

254
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:08,115
Once the is on board, then we work to bring on the designer, which is the architect so that we can get ready to start the feasibility study.

255
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:16,220
So that's that's sort of the trajectory of this next phase is designer and then we get to we actually get to the fun stuff.

256
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:26,865
But I'm looking forward to having the OPM on board because they will help manage some of the things that we are doing here as a committee, some of the outreach and that kind of thing.

257
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,927
So we will look forward to that.

258
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:34,809
Any questions about phase 2 process?

259
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:43,473
Okay.

260
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:52,118
I am going to share my screen if I am allowed to do that, Dr. Cushing.

261
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,421
You're good to go.

262
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:57,002
Thank you.

263
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:02,396
And I am going to bring up this RFS template.

264
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:08,537
I think that a couple of things to know about this template is, must use this template.

265
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:13,338
This is the, this is part of the process and the requirement from MSBA.

266
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:25,040
And they've done a pretty nice job of being able to describe like what it is that they're asking for communities to provide input to.

267
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:37,317
A little bit hard to look at this document because it is in track change mode.

268
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:37,777
So if that.

269
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,739
Makes you a little bit crazy.

270
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,700
I apologize.

271
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:49,284
That is a that is also a requirement of so that they can quickly and easily find the changes that we've made.

272
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:49,504
So.

273
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:57,812
Here is our RFS, there's a whole bunch of lead-in information here, and then we get to the actual meet.

274
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:18,450
So as you can see, everything that is in bold and in italics, that's where they're asking us to provide input, and everything that's struck out and filled in with comments and track changes that were the result of the work that the OPM Selection Subcommittee did.

275
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:23,809
So this introduction is obviously very boilerplate.

276
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:27,432
We're saying this is Medford, this is Medford High School, that kind of thing.

277
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,414
So those changes have been made.

278
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:37,799
And then there is the other thing that we are asked to talk about here in this introduction.

279
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,020
Oops, sorry.

280
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:48,098
Um, are sort of what we think the total cost of the project could be and this is.

281
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:53,461
An estimate, and it's, I think, an effort to give an understanding of.

282
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,758
How big do we think the scope of this could be?

283
00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:06,261
And so the OPM selection committee identified 200 million to 600 million as a very wide range.

284
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:10,422
It's a wide range because there's a lot of unknown right now.

285
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:17,105
It's also a very wide range because any number of solutions could be viable for us and we don't know yet.

286
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:29,896
Which of those solutions from building something completely new to substantially renovating what we have, we don't yet know how that will shake out.

287
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,897
And that's what the feasibility center is for.

288
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:32,177
So.

289
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:39,942
This is what we came up with and to me, it's just a signal for those folks who are watching that.

290
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:45,925
We understand that there could be any number of solutions here and we are.

291
00:21:46,978 --> 00:22:04,920
Wanting and interested in exploring them all the background is the next section and I will leave this up just for you to read it and I will happily read it out loud to provide a little bit of information about the background of this project.

292
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:13,300
The city of Medford located in the greater Boston area is a dynamic and growing community that places strong emphasis on educational excellence.

293
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:22,044
The district is committed to providing an inclusive and innovative learning environment with a focus on preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world.

294
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:28,688
The Medford high school established in the mid 20th century has served as a cornerstone of the city communities, financial infrastructure.

295
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:35,873
However, over time, the building has become increasingly outdated and no longer meets the evolving needs of students, educators or the broader community.

296
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:45,340
The facilities, aging systems, limited space and lack of modern learning environments have prompted the city to pursue significant renovations and improvements to high school campus.

297
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:57,506
The comprehensive school building committee is comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, including elected officials, city officials, school district representatives and community members with a variety of backgrounds.

298
00:22:57,966 --> 00:23:06,154
The committee's primary mission is to oversee the planning and execution of the high school project, ensuring that it meets academic, social and safety needs of students.

299
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:20,963
The committee has brought support to also pursue expansion of its portfolio of Chapter 74 programs, its early childhood programs, and to co-locate the current Curtis-Tufts program to increase access to student activities for students at the Curtis-Tufts.

300
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:29,507
The district's grade configuration includes elementary schools K-5, middle schools 6-8, and the high school 9-12.

301
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:34,610
The existing high school facility now serves approximately 1,200 students and is expected to see future growth.

302
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:43,275
The Medford High School campus also houses athletic facilities, fine and performing art spaces and administrative offices that serve the school community and the community at large.

303
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:50,460
The district is also pursuing consolidation of our early childhood programming into a single location to alleviate space concerns that are for elementary schools.

304
00:23:51,360 --> 00:24:01,969
As part of an ongoing effort to upgrade the district's infrastructure, the member of public schools submitted a statement of interest to the MSBA, highlighting the need for a comprehensive solution to address the building shortcomings.

305
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:12,938
The accepted SOI serves as a reference for the current project and outlines the key areas of concern, such as structural integrity, accessibility, energy efficiency, and technology integration.

306
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:21,065
The project aim is to not only enhance the learning environment for students, but also to ensure that the school can serve the community for generations to come.

307
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:31,794
This request for services seeks to engage a qualified owners project manager who can contribute to the success of this transformative project, providing expertise and design construction and project management.

308
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:47,730
The goal is to create state of the art educational facility that fosters creativity, collaboration and academic excellence and do the project with substantial community input from the community at large and specifically from the students and staff who will work, learn and thrive in the new building.

309
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:54,777
Questions or comments about anything that you've seen so far?

310
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:05,665
Sounds good.

311
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:16,205
Okay, we'll move on the project description objectives and scope of service have some sort of small things.

312
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:38,562
That we had to fill in and then we were asked to provide some specific information regarding the identified school, including, but not limited to total square footage, site information, age of the building, historical components of the building and or site, if any building conditions and problems, the current grade structure enrollment and MSBA agreed upon enrollment.

313
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:53,354
So, in this section, we've added some information to answer that request, which says the Medford high school and Medford vocational technical high school complex was constructed during the late 60s and opened in the fall of 1970 permits opening in 20.

314
00:25:56,375 --> 00:26:06,364
Until 2017, it has 2 distinct schools, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School in 2017. the Medford school committee voted to merge the 2 schools into 1 comprehensive high school.

315
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:17,794
But despite the forward looking vision aimed at establishing 1 flagship school to serve as the epicenter of public education for the community, the facility is designed for delivery of instruction in a bygone era, namely the early 70s.

316
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:27,322
The challenges yielded by its antiquated design have been exacerbated with increasing severity by infrastructure that ranges from deteriorating to inoperable.

317
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:36,609
MPS envisions Medford High School as a comprehensive high school with a broad array of academic programs and a host of vocational programs sanctioned under Chapter 74.

318
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,513
The 55-year-old aging facility housing MHS is an obstacle to optimal learning conditions.

319
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:53,981
Medford High School currently serves a combined 1210 students in grades 9 to 12. we also support students in project transition aged 18 to 22 over 50% of our high school students are CTE students.

320
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:56,223
Additionally, the Medford.

321
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:07,936
Pre-K program that includes 100 students and a daycare for children's ages two months to five years has an enrollment of 74 students.

322
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:13,259
Together the total enrollment of students at NHS is 84.

323
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:16,700
So we should fix that number.

324
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,701
I will fix that.

325
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:26,025
The district's agreed upon enrollment for the projection for a new Medford High School is

326
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:39,320
3rd 1695 of this figure 1395 or 9 to 12 high school students 200 are pre-k students and 100 are students in the district state care program.

327
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,801
Questions about that section.

328
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:51,004
Okay.

329
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,665
I'm going to

330
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:58,296
Project objectives under consideration by the owner.

331
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:07,839
So this, this section actually was a place where we had a lot of discussion in our subcommittee meeting around, like, what are the things that we want to call out?

332
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,120
We, so we've made this list.

333
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:19,643
I also, in my work to sort of tighten up a few things, did take a peek at a couple of other RFSs from other communities.

334
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,944
So this list is very much open for.

335
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:31,505
Suggestion and questions if we, if there's anything else we want to add that helps people understand sort of what we're trying to do.

336
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:42,668
So we talk about the Northeast collaborative for high performance schools and or the US Green Building Council's lead for schools rating system qualification and analysis of potential.

337
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:51,752
To be in that 0 energy building life cycle costs of operational of operating the school as it relates to future operational budgets.

338
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:55,456
We are interested in a CM at risk delivery method.

339
00:28:55,496 --> 00:29:00,562
Potentially we have identified potential other sites.

340
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:04,547
So there's a vetting process that our is going to need to be aware of.

341
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:12,412
Um, site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property if a new if a new project remains in the current place.

342
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:19,334
So, as, you know, there's 1 way in and 1 way out of Medford high, and that is a significant sort of.

343
00:29:20,054 --> 00:29:24,476
Bottleneck as we flow people in and out of the building, so we would want to be looking at that.

344
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:33,680
Update the survey and existing condition information of buildings on the Medford High site, including any hazardous materials.

345
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,263
So there's any number of things that could happen on the campus that they have to be aware of.

346
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:49,948
Provide design alternatives for renovation, addition renovation, and new construction options for the high school to meet the educational specification of the school building committee and the MSBA.

347
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:57,933
provide a schedule, construction cost estimate, operating cost estimate, and life cycle sustainability analysis for each option.

348
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:09,240
Constraints of the district, it's assumed that school will be in session on this site for the duration of the project, so phase construction and possible use of swing space may be required.

349
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:17,405
Then under that bullet, I think the other things that we've talked a lot about is we will have some extra work to do from a planning perspective.

350
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:23,113
To ensure learning continuity for all students, but particularly for our vocational programs.

351
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,840
We may need to purchase.

352
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:37,716
Modular something to support this project, depending on what happens and we know that that's a thing that we might need to consider.

353
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:51,247
We might need to provide and maintain a, you know, we will need to provide and maintain a secure and positive educational environment during construction and then also sort of seeking somebody that has some experience with phase construction projects.

354
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:51,567
So.

355
00:30:53,649 --> 00:31:00,137
That is sort of the list of things that the OPM selection committee came up with.

356
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:05,584
If there are any other thoughts or suggestions here, I'm happy to take them.

357
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:30,441
Alongside LEED, there's another similar certification that's called WELL certification, W-E-L-L, that is a more kind of holistic look at the health and sustainability of the project that takes the user into account and not just the sustainability of the building.

358
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:33,663
So I think that's something to consider as well.

359
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:36,966
W-E-L-L, Marissa?

360
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:37,186
Yes.

361
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:37,826
Yes.

362
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:37,946
OK.

363
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:38,807
Perfect.

364
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:39,728
I added that.

365
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:48,573
I put a minor edit in the chat just to button up the CM at risk delivery method bullet.

366
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:49,634
OK.

367
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:53,757
Let's see.

368
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:05,607
Updating evaluation of CM at risk delivery method, including a final recommendation.

369
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:06,648
Thank you, Philip.

370
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:07,468
That's great.

371
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:19,450
I'll put a note in there just about the notes of life cycle slash sustainability.

372
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:21,172
I just lost the exact language, but.

373
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:25,855
Um, like, lifecycle analysis versus lifecycle lifecycle costs.

374
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:30,298
Analysis are 2 different things and I'm going to make sure we are stating the 1 that we want.

375
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,740
So I'm just going to put coming in the chat about that.

376
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,803
Okay, great Thank you Libby.

377
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:36,423
Sure.

378
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:49,465
The site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property, just from the property to the public roads or something, just something minor like that.

379
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:54,567
Okay.

380
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:55,647
Thank you.

381
00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:06,391
Then any potential alternate sites, I'd finish that and just say for construction of new high school facility, just to tell them what the alternative sites for.

382
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,639
Okay, thank you.

383
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:23,448
Any other questions there?

384
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:37,718
Okay.

385
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:47,487
So, the next section that requires our attention is the evaluation criteria.

386
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,308
So, in this section.

387
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:57,490
We had a lot of discussion about this as well and you can see that a lot of this does come from.

388
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,125
You know, come from template, the text in green was added.

389
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:15,696
The other thing that we talked a lot about was the point scale and this will be used by the selection committee to rate and evaluate all the bids that we receive.

390
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:19,520
And sort of the.

391
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:25,659
Calculus of how we put this together was to to award.

392
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:32,321
Standard sort of thresholds of points for different things that range from, like.

393
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:41,285
We need to have this, but it's very likely everyone's going to have this skill to the more customized things at higher number of points.

394
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:41,625
So.

395
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:48,246
If you look at this, what you'll see is some 10-point items.

396
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:54,888
To me, those are things that feel very table-stakey.

397
00:34:55,488 --> 00:35:00,569
An OPM who is doing this work all the time is more than likely going to have those things.

398
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:11,512
The 20-point scale steps up a little bit where now there is some variability and discretion in terms of how those things might get delivered.

399
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:15,254
Um, 30 points, uh.

400
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,797
Does talk a little bit more about, um.

401
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:32,788
You know, their, their overall capacity to do these kinds of projects and then, um, you know, sort of some bigger point values around key personnel who will work with us at 40 points as well as.

402
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:38,272
Uh, 50 points for past performance.

403
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:46,067
And I stole this from Arlington, which you can see, so I'll fix that, say Medford.

404
00:35:47,789 --> 00:36:07,185
So the selection committee felt like this sort of point allocation worked, but I would be very curious if there's anyone in the room who has other thoughts or suggestions about that, because now is the time to sort of set that methodology in place.

405
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:20,752
Question, can you add minor points, like 5 or 10 or anything like that for cost evaluation?

406
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:20,812
No.

407
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:33,594
So what we have learned through this process so far is that there is no cost response that comes with bids.

408
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:37,614
So this is a process where we evaluate.

409
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,935
It's a value-based contract.

410
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:49,556
And once you select somebody, then you move into a phase where you negotiate with them and you talk about price.

411
00:36:50,176 --> 00:37:03,041
Having said that, part of the documents that will be delivered with this are all of the public exhibits with MSBA, and it's well on record that we have a certain

412
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:14,383
amount of money set aside for the feasibility study, which we had to break down to say this much is for the OPM, this much is for the designer, and this much is for incidental.

413
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:32,047
So all of that will be well known to people in terms of what our scope and budget is, but my understanding is that all of that price conversation comes after you make your selection first, which is a little bit unusual, but that's how this process works.

414
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:34,306
Bye.

415
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:49,221
I have a question on a section just slightly above, if you don't mind pulling it back up a little.

416
00:37:49,861 --> 00:38:00,708
Above the durations for the feasibility phase and stuff, there's a sentence that says the work is divided into the project phases listed in attachment A of this contract.

417
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:02,749
I clicked on attachment A in the PDF.

418
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:08,212
I didn't see any work, any project phases in that attachment.

419
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:10,374
So I just don't know if I missed it or if

420
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,308
There are a handful.

421
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,870
Yeah, you didn't miss it.

422
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,570
It's not there.

423
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:24,920
There are a handful of other attachments that need to come together with this that are provided by MSBA that are not here right now, but we will have to provide those as well.

424
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,063
Any other questions about the evaluation points and methodology?

425
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:53,387
I know it's a lot of like, need to take in.

426
00:38:55,655 --> 00:39:02,623
The next section does talk about a short list and fill up to your question about cost.

427
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:08,609
This is where I thought that the cost conversation would happen is once you get to the short list and you're evaluating the.

428
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,473
Proposals, and even then, that's not what happens in this process.

429
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:28,545
Basically, once we get down to the short list of candidates and we invite them in for finalist interviews, the scale there is the quality of the reference checks for 30 points and 70 points for the quality of the finalist presentation.

430
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:34,829
And then you have to make a selection before you get into that cost discussion.

431
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:43,575
So that has been edited and updated based on some of the work the team has done since our meeting to get clarification on that.

432
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:55,551
Much of this is boilerplate.

433
00:39:56,752 --> 00:40:07,581
And the next component of what is here is the list of who is on the committee.

434
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:14,166
So we have to name those folks and talk a little bit about some of the details of what we plan to do.

435
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:25,689
In terms of how the shortlist will be done, so we're planning for 2 hour interviews and then how how we will actually negotiate.

436
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:38,081
The price, and so I actually did steal from Arlington from Arlington's in terms of how we will do this, but essentially the chair of the.

437
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:49,716
Uh, review committee, the CFO of NPS, the superintendent and the budget director work together to negotiate a fee with the 1st ranked respondent.

438
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:50,137
So.

439
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:54,000
Um, all the rest of this came from Arlington.

440
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,383
Um, there went through the same process.

441
00:40:57,443 --> 00:41:01,307
So I, um, I have felt good about sort of pulling all of that in.

442
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:06,552
Um, and, um.

443
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,162
Then the next thing that is outlined here is a timeline.

444
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:24,387
So this timeline does assume that it will take the MSBA 2 weeks from Wednesday essentially to do their review.

445
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:27,729
And it takes us about a week to get things posted.

446
00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:41,277
Uh, from a procurement perspective, so I've given us a week of buffer and then have sort of cascaded from there through the series of activities and tried to plan.

447
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:44,641
You'll see there's like, sort of a gap right in here and.

448
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:53,268
That gap is certainly due to April vacation, knowing that that is a really hard time for people.

449
00:41:53,308 --> 00:42:07,260
So I felt okay about that, especially because the OPM review panel meeting that we would be eligible to attend is not until 6-2, so we had plenty of time to navigate that April vacation timeframe.

450
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:15,127
Questions about the timeline?

451
00:42:28,455 --> 00:42:36,880
Okay, just about everything else is sort of filling in the name of our procurement officer.

452
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,403
And, oh, sorry, Phil, did you have a question?

453
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:43,444
That was Paul.

454
00:42:43,504 --> 00:42:44,704
Can you go back up a little bit?

455
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:46,205
Sure.

456
00:42:46,245 --> 00:42:52,309
The part with Fiona, you had some, I just noticed that after her name is actually, yeah.

457
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:53,810
Thank you.

458
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:14,681
And Jenny, I just had some, um, I can take offline, but just some logistics as far as, um, you know, um, how we'll advertise it and how responses and that sort of stuff.

459
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,445
No need to boggle down the whole group, but we can chat about that.

460
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:19,586
Okay, great.

461
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,363
There was a question as well about certifications.

462
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:36,537
So there was a in here, it's asked if we asked us to say what certifications we require and I did a little bit of sleuthing and did talk to our legal counsel as well.

463
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:39,160
And this is.

464
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:54,089
Very similar to what Arlington articulated, so I don't think there's anything particularly specific here that we need to require instead to ask them what their certifications are.

465
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,811
So I would actually if anybody who is.

466
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:05,435
More in this world than I am has any suggestions if there's anything specific there, I'm happy to take those suggestions.

467
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:21,176
Okay.

468
00:44:22,237 --> 00:44:22,978
Let's see.

469
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:26,621
I think that is just about everything that was changed.

470
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:27,802
Oh, Paul?

471
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,963
Scroll back up.

472
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,105
Another one with Diona right there.

473
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:42,373
It's very hard to, I love track changes, but at some point it gets to be like too much.

474
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:48,118
So we'll clean up the formatting and everything once the MSBA weighs in.

475
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,021
And we will provide people our statement of interest.

476
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,422
We will provide them our educational profile and our chapter 74 forms.

477
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:10,465
All of those things will go with the package in addition to the forms and contracts that MSBA requires.

478
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:16,087
So all of that will go with this package when it goes out the door.

479
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:18,868
And that's it.

480
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:22,929
Are there any other questions about this document?

481
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:46,757
OK, so my goal would be for us to take a vote to approve this as amended so that it can go to the MSBA tomorrow and be in queue for them.

482
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:54,510
one day before they move us into the next phase so that we're in line and ready to go.

483
00:45:55,871 --> 00:45:57,911
Is there a motion to do so?

484
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:58,851
Emily?

485
00:46:00,252 --> 00:46:00,652
So moved.

486
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:01,472
Motion to approve.

487
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:07,193
OK, motion to approve by Emily, seconded by?

488
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:08,394
Second.

489
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:09,674
Aaron?

490
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:14,215
I'm going to stop the share so I can find my list.

491
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:20,982
Let's see here.

492
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:23,224
Mayor Lungo Kern.

493
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:25,846
Yes.

494
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:28,347
Dr. Galussi.

495
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:29,368
Yes.

496
00:46:29,948 --> 00:46:30,649
Dr. Cushing.

497
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:31,329
Yes.

498
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,391
Joan Bowen.

499
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:34,231
Yes.

500
00:46:35,012 --> 00:46:35,852
Marta Cabral.

501
00:46:36,653 --> 00:46:36,953
Yes.

502
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:38,855
Libby Brown.

503
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:39,695
Yes.

504
00:46:41,776 --> 00:46:42,757
Marissa Desmond.

505
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:43,778
Yes.

506
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:53,912
Maria dorsey yes thank you here yes thank you can yes emily was our own yes.

507
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:58,355
Nicole ralph yeah and a lot of it.

508
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,430
Luke Prisner, absent.

509
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,931
Jenny Graham, yes.

510
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:13,413
So 14 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, 1 absent.

511
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,034
Motion passes.

512
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:21,518
So I will get this in the queue so that we can move, which is so exciting.

513
00:47:22,658 --> 00:47:33,264
The last thing on our list, as we were working through, as the OPM Selection Subcommittee was working through the creation of this document,

514
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:39,648
We did have some discussion around the size of that committee.

515
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:43,711
So right now, there are three voting members on the committee.

516
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:46,073
It's myself, Dr. Cushing, and Aaron.

517
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:56,480
We have two non-voting members on the committee, Fiona Maxwell, who's our Chief Procurement Officer, and John McLaughlin, who was not able to be here tonight.

518
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:06,428
But we did talk a bit about whether it made sense for there to be 1 or 2 additional folks on this committee.

519
00:48:07,088 --> 00:48:17,977
Probably 2, so that we can keep an odd number just so that the group that is sort of vetting all of this gets just a little bit bigger than it is right now.

520
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:35,173
And I think the vision is that this group would be the group that sort of sits through all of the reviews and certainly does all of the evaluation to bring a recommendation back to this committee before it's all said and done.

521
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:41,074
But that's, I think it will be a significant amount of work.

522
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:47,176
And I am particularly interested in making sure that some of the folks that we put on this committee to

523
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,826
Advise in this process might be good.

524
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:57,839
You know, might be good additions to this group.

525
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:14,749
So the recommendation from the subcommittee was that we add 2 voting members and maybe 1 non voting member to the to the group to make sure that we have enough eyes on this really important decision.

526
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,752
So I bring that back to this group because this group voted on that.

527
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:26,720
Committee initially, so we also would need to vote to make a change.

528
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:32,165
So, I will open that up if there's any questions or comments.

529
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:42,676
I would assume that the.

530
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:48,285
This committee obviously is going to sit in on all of the interviews.

531
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:52,628
The interviews, will they be like during the business day?

532
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:55,630
I think that will depend on the committee.

533
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:06,097
So I think whoever is on the committee, what we will have to do between now and the time this is published is make sure that there is availability and we can block those times.

534
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:10,520
But I think there is some flexibility on that.

535
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:19,323
On that timeline, and I'm sure it's not uncommon for these kinds of things to happen not inside the working day.

536
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,667
So, I think we have some flexibility there.

537
00:50:22,848 --> 00:50:25,651
I just, you know, the timeline will will be.

538
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:30,216
Fast and pretty tight, even if we are doing it after hours.

539
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:44,245
All right.

540
00:50:45,094 --> 00:50:45,474
Thank you.

541
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:47,215
I don't have any questions or comments.

542
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:48,975
Obviously, I'm one of the voting members for that.

543
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:57,817
I'm happy to, if everyone else feels confident about this decision, to increase the total number from at least from three to five, plus that additional non-voting member.

544
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,698
I'm happy to nominate at least one member who I think would be a really good asset.

545
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:10,320
I know that when we had a conversation about who would be best for this committee, I know that their expertise in this area was something that stuck out for a lot of us.

546
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,741
So is this a time to do that or should I wait a little bit longer?

547
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:14,932
Go for it.

548
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:21,158
So, if they are willing, I'd love to nominate Libby Brown to be 1 of the voting members.

549
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:26,844
I mean, I, as I understand it, she has really good knowledge on this type of these types of questions.

550
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:27,144
So.

551
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:32,129
So, there's a motion to add Libby Brown to the committee.

552
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:37,273
2nd, 2nd, by Marissa.

553
00:51:37,313 --> 00:51:37,534
There.

554
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:47,111
Any questions or comments about that motion from the rest of the group?

555
00:51:52,434 --> 00:51:58,298
Just before we take a roll call vote, make sure Libby has the time and is interested.

556
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,740
I wasn't sure if I should speak up, but yes, I'm happy to be involved.

557
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:09,684
I've worked with many OPMs over the years, so I have a good sense of what we're looking for here.

558
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:10,865
Great, thank you.

559
00:52:16,353 --> 00:52:17,934
Well, then I will call the roll.

560
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:20,896
Mayor Longo Kern.

561
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:23,437
Yes.

562
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:25,159
Dr. Galluzzi.

563
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:26,159
Yes.

564
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,660
Dr. Cushing.

565
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:29,021
Yes.

566
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:30,282
Joan Boleyn.

567
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:31,163
Yes.

568
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:32,443
Marta Cabral.

569
00:52:32,864 --> 00:52:33,104
Yes.

570
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:34,305
Libby Brown.

571
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:35,726
Yes.

572
00:52:36,606 --> 00:52:37,467
Marissa Desmond.

573
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:38,688
Yes.

574
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:40,449
Maria Dorsey.

575
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:41,209
Yes.

576
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,690
Brian Hilliard.

577
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:43,731
Yes.

578
00:52:44,491 --> 00:52:45,112
Tracy Keene.

579
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:49,609
Yes, Emily was our oh yes, Nicole morale.

580
00:52:50,429 --> 00:52:53,310
And I'll potty yes.

581
00:52:54,351 --> 00:53:00,914
The president absent jenny graham yes, 14 and the affirmative 0 in the negative one absence welcome Libby.

582
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:03,175
Thank you.

583
00:53:04,106 --> 00:53:16,590
So I do think we are still thinking about one additional voting member and one non-voting member to add to this group.

584
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:23,632
Are there people who are really excited to put their hand in the air and participate in this process?

585
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:31,014
Or I see a hand from member Rousseff who is a non-voting member, so he would be filling the non-voting spot.

586
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:37,937
Are there other folks who are excited about this opportunity?

587
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:47,622
Hearing and seeing none, we'll nominate member Russo.

588
00:53:49,123 --> 00:53:52,225
OK, nomination for member Russo by Mayor Longo Kern.

589
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:53,285
Is there a second?

590
00:53:55,306 --> 00:53:55,727
Second.

591
00:53:57,287 --> 00:53:59,168
Second by Dr. Cushing.

592
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:01,349
OK, roll call.

593
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,230
Mayor Longo Kern.

594
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:04,735
Yes.

595
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:06,135
Dr. Belusy.

596
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:06,896
Yes.

597
00:54:07,436 --> 00:54:08,216
Dr. Cushing.

598
00:54:08,636 --> 00:54:08,916
Yes.

599
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,756
Joan Boland.

600
00:54:11,257 --> 00:54:11,497
Yes.

601
00:54:11,937 --> 00:54:12,757
Marta Cabral.

602
00:54:13,197 --> 00:54:13,477
Yes.

603
00:54:13,857 --> 00:54:14,437
Libby Brown.

604
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:15,177
Yes.

605
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:16,638
Marissa Desmond.

606
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:17,718
Yes.

607
00:54:18,898 --> 00:54:19,678
Maria Dorsey.

608
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:20,359
Yes.

609
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:21,439
Brian Hilliard.

610
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:22,359
Yes.

611
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,039
Tracy Keene.

612
00:54:24,379 --> 00:54:24,680
Yes.

613
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,420
Emily Lozaro.

614
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,020
Yes.

615
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,220
Nicole Morrell.

616
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:28,981
Yes.

617
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:30,381
Erin Olopade.

618
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:30,581
Yes.

619
00:54:32,433 --> 00:54:40,011
Luke pricing are absent Jenny Graham yes, so 14 the affirmative 0, the negative 1 absence welcome Paul.

620
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:41,675
To the team.

621
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:48,368
And so I think there's maybe one more voting member to appoint.

622
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:57,834
And I did have a brief conversation with Dr. Galussi about whether she wanted to be that person.

623
00:54:57,854 --> 00:55:04,018
And I think we would love to have her, but she has a very full plate right now.

624
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:11,963
So I'm totally open to hearing from you, Dr. Galussi, if you have a preference.

625
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,924
No, I mean, I'm happy to step up.

626
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:23,128
I just also wanted to kind of see if there were other people that also wanted the opportunity to participate.

627
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:31,391
But I'm absolutely happy to step up and be a participating member of this committee.

628
00:55:35,113 --> 00:55:42,417
Are there other folks who might want to give Dr. Galluzzi some free time and join us instead?

629
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:55,880
Jenny, if I read Luke Preissner's email correctly this morning, he expressed interest in being part of a group that was making these decisions.

630
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:03,385
So I don't know if he's a voting member or not, but that's the way that I read it, that he was offering his services.

631
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:08,539
I did have a couple of email exchanges with Luke.

632
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:17,024
And what he was referring to was sort of the creation of the document and willingness to help support that.

633
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,226
So I didn't read it that way.

634
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:20,847
And I know he was unable to come.

635
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:26,650
So I would hate to put him on the spot like that.

636
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:29,792
And he did see the agenda.

637
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:32,874
So if he had an inkling of that, I'm sure that he would have let me know.

638
00:56:34,736 --> 00:56:39,863
And I do expect that he will be very active on the communications and community engagement subcommittee.

639
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:45,151
So I didn't know we have a couple of other architects in our midst.

640
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,012
Is that true?

641
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:50,183
I wanna put you on the spot, Brian.

642
00:56:50,263 --> 00:56:52,764
Yeah, I'm one of the guiltiest charged.

643
00:56:53,465 --> 00:56:56,927
It could be of interest, I think I need to dig in a little bit more.

644
00:56:56,947 --> 00:57:00,008
I mean, typically when I was involved, I was on the design end.

645
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:03,350
So, you know, typically just more of the tail end.

646
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:13,576
Not opposed to joining you guys, but I think I just needed to dig in and see if I'm the right kind of person that you're looking for.

647
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,638
So how about a maybe?

648
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:21,300
Okay, well, I think to your point, like, this is the 1st procurement.

649
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,420
This is the selection committee.

650
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,702
There will be another whole procurement to bring on the designer.

651
00:57:27,722 --> 00:57:41,746
And so maybe we ask Dr Lucy to be part of this process and we plan to shift that selection committee to give people a break and pull you in at that time when we are onboarding that designer.

652
00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:43,447
Does that feel better?

653
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:43,987
Absolutely.

654
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:44,327
Sure.

655
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:51,752
And again, I'm happy to stretch if need be, and obviously would love to give anybody relief if they need it.

656
00:57:51,812 --> 00:58:02,138
But I know sort of my skill set, so if there's somebody better than me right now to fill in, but I'm happy to switch horses in the middle of the race too.

657
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,365
Okay, great.

658
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:05,066
Member Graham.

659
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:11,290
Yeah, along the same lines as Brian, I'd be happy to be in on the architect selection.

660
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:17,994
I'm more familiar with the questions and things that would be asked then, as opposed to asking the OPM.

661
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:19,494
Okay, great.

662
00:58:19,715 --> 00:58:24,918
Well, we'll hire you in just a few weeks, hopefully, for that process.

663
00:58:24,998 --> 00:58:30,421
So is there an official nomination to add Dr. Galluzzi to the OPM selection committee?

664
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,082
I'd be happy to nominate her.

665
00:58:32,997 --> 00:58:35,338
Okay, so nominated by Dr. Cushing.

666
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:48,685
I'll second that, and also maybe, Dr. Lucy, if you want to have a conversation with Luke in the meantime, and maybe we could always switch it if it would relieve you from hours of work that you already have a ton of.

667
00:58:48,745 --> 00:58:55,328
So I second it, and I'm open to changing that vote if you get a positive from Luke.

668
00:58:56,289 --> 00:58:56,449
Great.

669
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:02,939
Okay, so to appoint Dr. Galussi, Mayor Lungo Kern.

670
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,200
Yes.

671
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,781

672
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:07,761

673
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:09,062

00:59:43,022 --> 00:59:45,342
Um, so welcome all to the committee.

692
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:51,424
I will reach out to you about availability so we can put some calendar blocks on in the coming days.

693
00:59:52,144 --> 00:59:56,825
Um, so we can get ready for this, um, this next, this next set of steps.

694
00:59:57,845 --> 01:00:02,906
Um, are there any other questions before there is the motion to adjourn?

695
01:00:04,846 --> 01:00:10,567
We'll send you a note and let you know the outcome of the board meeting and on Wednesday.

696
01:00:11,688 --> 01:00:20,176
and we will also prepare a press release from the committee to the community with hopefully good news.

697
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,882
Is there a motion to approve?

698
01:00:26,902 --> 01:00:29,785
