64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,947
[SPEAKER_17]: 14 voting members present, one absent, so we have a lovely quorum.

65
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Our first order of business is to approve some minutes.

66
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,373
[SPEAKER_17]: On the consent agenda, we had four sets of minutes listed.

67
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,694
[SPEAKER_17]: One was for the 9-18 full committee meeting.

68
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:17,136
[SPEAKER_17]: One was for the 9-18 communications and community engagement subcommittee meeting.

69
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:25,780
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other two was one for the January 23rd communications and community engagement.

70
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Recording stopped.

71

[SPEAKER_17]: And.

72
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:30,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Recording in progress.

73
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Peter.

74
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:41,466
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we also had a set of minutes from our OPM selection subcommittee meeting on 2-11.

75
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:50,052
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe C and D on your agenda actually did not make it into the packet.

76
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:56,997
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think the first thing that we need to do is make a motion to sever those two and table them.

77
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:02,101
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I will await a motion.

78
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve.

79
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,773

81
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:28,296
[SPEAKER_17]: And is there a motion to sever the minutes?

82
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to sever the minutes.

83
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,841

162
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:39,473
[SPEAKER_17]: The first is I wanted to provide an update on phase one of the MSBA process.

163
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:41,774
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you know, we've been in the eligibility phase.

164
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:47,417
[SPEAKER_17]: We submitted all of our deliverables back in July.

165
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:56,182
[SPEAKER_17]: And over the course of the rest of the summer and into the fall, we were working with the MSBA to look at and certify our enrollment totals.

166
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:14,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Those totals that sort of set stage for how big of a high school we're planning for and there was some back and forth between us and the folks who did their own enrollment study and.

167
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:23,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Then really just sort of get to know Medford and some of our plans around things like housing growth and student.

168
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:35,311
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, student growth and what we were seeing, so that went, so we had to sort of go back and forth with them and we finished that process in.

169
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:44,213
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, sometimes we finished our end of that process in August, the had work to do on their end.

170
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:54,577
[SPEAKER_17]: So they did their work and then they notified us in December that they forwarded us an agreement to sign around the enrollment.

171
00:08:55,097 --> 00:09:03,721
[SPEAKER_17]: So just by way of some information, we have about 1,200 students right now, and that's been pretty consistent for the high school side.

172
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:04,081
[SPEAKER_17]: We requested

173
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:20,492
[SPEAKER_17]: A, an enrollment of 1500 for high school, and we settled on 1395, which is.

174
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:31,642
[SPEAKER_17]: 2, almost 200 students more than our current 1200. so that was a lot of growth, a lot of growth in progress for us, which I think sets us up well for the.

175
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:57,965
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the, the future and the kinds of things that we're expecting to see here in Medford, both with, um, attracting students who may be selecting other high schools, um, in part because they go to the building and they see it and they have questions about whether that's the place they want to be, um, as well as, um, providing for, um, expanded, um, families moving into Medford, um, who will want to use the, who will want to use the, um,

176
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,682
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, the high school as a place to send their Children.

177
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:06,164
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have some room to grow, which is great and amazing.

178
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:11,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and, um, we signed that we signed those agreements.

179
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:19,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we have signed, um, Dr Cushing.

180
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we could disable the chat as well.

181
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, I will now as well.

182
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:30,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, thank you and, um, we are, uh, we are done.

183
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,244
[SPEAKER_17]: We are done with the.

184
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:43,695
[SPEAKER_17]: MSBA module 1 work on Wednesday, the board of the MSBA will hear a recommendation from their staff.

185
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:56,186
[SPEAKER_17]: to move us on to what they call phase 2 or module 2, which is where we get to start doing the fun things like bringing on the professionals that will help us through this process.

186
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:58,908
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're really excited about that.

187
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:08,397
[SPEAKER_17]: So that meeting will happen Wednesday morning, and then there will be meetings to onboard us to MSBA's expectations of the process.

188
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:18,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Shortly thereafter, our delegation has sent the letter of support on our behalf.

189
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:24,741
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was signed by Senator Jalen representatives did not Barbara and.

190
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:36,365
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the is in receipt of that letter of recommendation, and we're just really excited to be able to do this next thing.

191
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:38,326
[SPEAKER_17]: We're so excited.

192
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:41,628
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, that we have already started doing the next thing.

193
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:45,149
[SPEAKER_17]: So 1 of the meetings that we had earlier this month was.

194
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Of the selection committee who tackled building.

195
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:58,198
[SPEAKER_17]: The request for services, which is the very 1st document in the next phase of the process.

196
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,402
[SPEAKER_17]: We will review that tonight with a goal to.

197
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:13,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Make any amendments that this committee sees fit and get ready to send that to the tomorrow and we're going to send that to them tomorrow.

198
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:13,614
[SPEAKER_17]: So that.

199
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:26,191
[SPEAKER_17]: We can be in the queue for their review, which takes about 2 weeks and then we can move forward on an aggressive timeline, which will have us interviewing and bringing in.

200
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:31,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, an owner's project manager here before the end of June.

201
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,618
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, it's a, it's a quick time.

202
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:35,979
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a quick tight timeline.

203
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:41,143
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish it could be even faster than that because getting the team on board is incredibly important.

204
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:41,483
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's.

205
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:43,865
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's when the real work can begin.

206
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:50,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So the educators have sort of done their work so far with setting the stage around what kind of.

207
00:12:51,693 --> 00:13:01,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Educational opportunities we're trying to provide and now we get to the sort of meaty questions that everyone in the community has, which is, which is really exciting.

208
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:07,304
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a quick update on phase 1. are there any questions?

209
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:27,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, if you think of anything, just let me know, and we will move on from there.

210
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:35,296
[SPEAKER_17]: So in phase two, our next agenda item is our plans for phase two.

211
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:47,826
[SPEAKER_17]: I covered some of that already, but the goal is for us to be moving quickly through this process so that we can onboard the team and really get to the meat of the feasibility study.

212
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Emily, did you have a question?

213
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:57,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, yes.

214
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:20,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ask really quickly if you could tell me about the estimated number for how, so I was reading through and the estimates for how many students would be housed in the building, what the timeline is for that, like how, what the stretch of time was that was anticipated for the building to be used.

215
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they that's a great question.

216
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:26,044
[SPEAKER_17]: So they, they did a study that looked out.

217
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:28,425
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to say it was about 15 years.

218
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:35,269
[SPEAKER_17]: And 1 of the things that we went back and forth with them about was exactly that that range.

219
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:35,629
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

220
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Our enrollment projections within MPS show that.

221
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:47,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Mostly in agreement in the 1st, 10 to 15 years of the building's life.

222
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:58,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Or from now, but that, you know, as we looked out past 15 years, that's where we saw the growth that was more significant.

223
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:07,379
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was part of the conversation that we had, particularly around some of the housing developments that are coming down the pike and.

224
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Not just like the planned projects and the permitted projects, which they ask about explicitly, but also some of the bigger.

225
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:27,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Ideas and places where we are anticipating there could be substantial transformative projects in the city, like the air rights over Wellington.

226
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:32,086
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are the kinds of things that we had to go through with them to.

227
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,876
[SPEAKER_17]: sort of describe and look at.

228
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:47,103
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we shared our projections with them and our projections sort of carry us much further into time than that original 15 year span.

229
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,744
[SPEAKER_17]: So we did make some significant progress there.

230
00:15:49,784 --> 00:16:03,093
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do believe that based on everything that we were able to use as the basis, we will not be out of space the minute we start or even in the first couple of decades.

231
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, which is great news.

232
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions about that?

233
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:20,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so in phase two, there's a couple of things.

234
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:27,980
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've been doing a lot of reading and the OPM selection committee has been doing a lot of reading as well about what phase two entails.

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,963
[SPEAKER_17]: And it entails bringing on the owner's project manager.

236
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:35,564
[SPEAKER_17]: MSBA has a very prescriptive process for that.

237
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,365
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've been reading about that process.

238
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:41,307
[SPEAKER_17]: The very first step is that we have to draft an RFS.

239
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:42,608
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll look at that in just a few minutes.

240
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:51,677
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they will have to review that it takes them a couple of weeks to review it and then they'll give us the green light to go ahead and post it.

241
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,239
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be posted.

242
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,901
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to do a site visit.

243
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:58,565
[SPEAKER_17]: We will get responses back and.

244
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:06,150
[SPEAKER_17]: and then bring the list down to a short list, interview candidates, and make a selection.

245
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Once we make a selection, we negotiate the price.

246
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:15,576
[SPEAKER_17]: At that point, that's not part of the RFS process.

247
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:19,158
[SPEAKER_17]: It happens afterwards, which was a surprise to me.

248
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,860
[SPEAKER_17]: That's most of the RFPs that I work on in my world.

249
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,162
[SPEAKER_17]: They're sort of two things happen at the same time.

250
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:42,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but this process is a little bit different and, um, once we have made our selection and we have done those negotiations, we then have to bring our selected to a review panel with and they have to give us the green light for that selection.

251
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:49,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, there is a that those review panel meetings happen on a monthly basis and we are targeting.

252
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:56,187
[SPEAKER_17]: The June meeting to be all buttoned up and ready to go to get their their approval.

253
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:57,148
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can move forward.

254
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:08,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Once the is on board, then we work to bring on the designer, which is the architect so that we can get ready to start the feasibility study.

255
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:16,220
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's that's sort of the trajectory of this next phase is designer and then we get to we actually get to the fun stuff.

256
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:26,865
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm looking forward to having the OPM on board because they will help manage some of the things that we are doing here as a committee, some of the outreach and that kind of thing.

257
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,927
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will look forward to that.

258
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:34,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Any questions about phase 2 process?

259
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:43,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

260
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:52,118
[SPEAKER_17]: I am going to share my screen if I am allowed to do that, Dr. Cushing.

261
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,421
[SPEAKER_18]: You're good to go.

262
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:57,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

263
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:02,396
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am going to bring up this RFS template.

264
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:08,537
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that a couple of things to know about this template is, must use this template.

265
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:13,338
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the, this is part of the process and the requirement from MSBA.

266
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:25,040
[SPEAKER_17]: And they've done a pretty nice job of being able to describe like what it is that they're asking for communities to provide input to.

267
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:37,317
[SPEAKER_16]: A little bit hard to look at this document because it is in track change mode.

268
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:37,777
[SPEAKER_17]: So if that.

269
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,739
[SPEAKER_17]: Makes you a little bit crazy.

270
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,700
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

271
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:49,284
[SPEAKER_17]: That is a that is also a requirement of so that they can quickly and easily find the changes that we've made.

272
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:49,504
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

273
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:57,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Here is our RFS, there's a whole bunch of lead-in information here, and then we get to the actual meet.

274
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:18,450
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you can see, everything that is in bold and in italics, that's where they're asking us to provide input, and everything that's struck out and filled in with comments and track changes that were the result of the work that the OPM Selection Subcommittee did.

275
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:23,809
[SPEAKER_17]: So this introduction is obviously very boilerplate.

276
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:27,432
[SPEAKER_17]: We're saying this is Medford, this is Medford High School, that kind of thing.

277
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,414
[SPEAKER_17]: So those changes have been made.

278
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:37,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there is the other thing that we are asked to talk about here in this introduction.

279
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Oops, sorry.

280
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:48,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, are sort of what we think the total cost of the project could be and this is.

281
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:53,461
[SPEAKER_17]: An estimate, and it's, I think, an effort to give an understanding of.

282
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:56,758
[SPEAKER_17]: How big do we think the scope of this could be?

283
00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:06,261
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the OPM selection committee identified 200 million to 600 million as a very wide range.

284
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:10,422
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a wide range because there's a lot of unknown right now.

285
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:17,105
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also a very wide range because any number of solutions could be viable for us and we don't know yet.

286
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:29,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Which of those solutions from building something completely new to substantially renovating what we have, we don't yet know how that will shake out.

287
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,897
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what the feasibility center is for.

288
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:32,177
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

289
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:39,942
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what we came up with and to me, it's just a signal for those folks who are watching that.

290
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:45,925
[SPEAKER_17]: We understand that there could be any number of solutions here and we are.

291
00:21:46,978 --> 00:22:04,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Wanting and interested in exploring them all the background is the next section and I will leave this up just for you to read it and I will happily read it out loud to provide a little bit of information about the background of this project.

292
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:13,300
[SPEAKER_17]: The city of Medford located in the greater Boston area is a dynamic and growing community that places strong emphasis on educational excellence.

293
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:22,044
[SPEAKER_17]: The district is committed to providing an inclusive and innovative learning environment with a focus on preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world.

294
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:28,688
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford high school established in the mid 20th century has served as a cornerstone of the city communities, financial infrastructure.

295
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:35,873
[SPEAKER_17]: However, over time, the building has become increasingly outdated and no longer meets the evolving needs of students, educators or the broader community.

296
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:45,340
[SPEAKER_17]: The facilities, aging systems, limited space and lack of modern learning environments have prompted the city to pursue significant renovations and improvements to high school campus.

297
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:57,506
[SPEAKER_17]: The comprehensive school building committee is comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders, including elected officials, city officials, school district representatives and community members with a variety of backgrounds.

298
00:22:57,966 --> 00:23:06,154
[SPEAKER_17]: The committee's primary mission is to oversee the planning and execution of the high school project, ensuring that it meets academic, social and safety needs of students.

299
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:20,963
[SPEAKER_17]: The committee has brought support to also pursue expansion of its portfolio of Chapter 74 programs, its early childhood programs, and to co-locate the current Curtis-Tufts program to increase access to student activities for students at the Curtis-Tufts.

300
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:29,507
[SPEAKER_17]: The district's grade configuration includes elementary schools K-5, middle schools 6-8, and the high school 9-12.

301
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:34,610
[SPEAKER_17]: The existing high school facility now serves approximately 1,200 students and is expected to see future growth.

302
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:43,275
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford High School campus also houses athletic facilities, fine and performing art spaces and administrative offices that serve the school community and the community at large.

303
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:50,460
[SPEAKER_17]: The district is also pursuing consolidation of our early childhood programming into a single location to alleviate space concerns that are for elementary schools.

304
00:23:51,360 --> 00:24:01,969
[SPEAKER_17]: As part of an ongoing effort to upgrade the district's infrastructure, the member of public schools submitted a statement of interest to the MSBA, highlighting the need for a comprehensive solution to address the building shortcomings.

305
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:12,938
[SPEAKER_17]: The accepted SOI serves as a reference for the current project and outlines the key areas of concern, such as structural integrity, accessibility, energy efficiency, and technology integration.

306
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:21,065
[SPEAKER_17]: The project aim is to not only enhance the learning environment for students, but also to ensure that the school can serve the community for generations to come.

307
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:31,794
[SPEAKER_17]: This request for services seeks to engage a qualified owners project manager who can contribute to the success of this transformative project, providing expertise and design construction and project management.

308
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:47,730
[SPEAKER_17]: The goal is to create state of the art educational facility that fosters creativity, collaboration and academic excellence and do the project with substantial community input from the community at large and specifically from the students and staff who will work, learn and thrive in the new building.

309
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:54,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Questions or comments about anything that you've seen so far?

310
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:05,665
[SPEAKER_19]: Sounds good.

311
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:16,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we'll move on the project description objectives and scope of service have some sort of small things.

312
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:38,562
[SPEAKER_17]: That we had to fill in and then we were asked to provide some specific information regarding the identified school, including, but not limited to total square footage, site information, age of the building, historical components of the building and or site, if any building conditions and problems, the current grade structure enrollment and MSBA agreed upon enrollment.

313
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:53,354
[SPEAKER_17]: So, in this section, we've added some information to answer that request, which says the Medford high school and Medford vocational technical high school complex was constructed during the late 60s and opened in the fall of 1970 permits opening in 20.

314
00:25:56,375 --> 00:26:06,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Until 2017, it has 2 distinct schools, Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School in 2017. the Medford school committee voted to merge the 2 schools into 1 comprehensive high school.

315
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:17,794
[SPEAKER_17]: But despite the forward looking vision aimed at establishing 1 flagship school to serve as the epicenter of public education for the community, the facility is designed for delivery of instruction in a bygone era, namely the early 70s.

316
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:27,322
[SPEAKER_17]: The challenges yielded by its antiquated design have been exacerbated with increasing severity by infrastructure that ranges from deteriorating to inoperable.

317
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:36,609
[SPEAKER_17]: MPS envisions Medford High School as a comprehensive high school with a broad array of academic programs and a host of vocational programs sanctioned under Chapter 74.

318
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,513
[SPEAKER_17]: The 55-year-old aging facility housing MHS is an obstacle to optimal learning conditions.

319
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:53,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford High School currently serves a combined 1210 students in grades 9 to 12. we also support students in project transition aged 18 to 22 over 50% of our high school students are CTE students.

320
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:56,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Additionally, the Medford.

321
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:07,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Pre-K program that includes 100 students and a daycare for children's ages two months to five years has an enrollment of 74 students.

322
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:13,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Together the total enrollment of students at NHS is 84.

323
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:16,700
[SPEAKER_17]: So we should fix that number.

324
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,701
[SPEAKER_17]: I will fix that.

325
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:26,025
[SPEAKER_17]: The district's agreed upon enrollment for the projection for a new Medford High School is

326
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:39,320
[SPEAKER_17]: 3rd 1695 of this figure 1395 or 9 to 12 high school students 200 are pre-k students and 100 are students in the district state care program.

327
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Questions about that section.

328
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:51,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

329
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to

330
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:58,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Project objectives under consideration by the owner.

331
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:07,839
[SPEAKER_17]: So this, this section actually was a place where we had a lot of discussion in our subcommittee meeting around, like, what are the things that we want to call out?

332
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,120
[SPEAKER_17]: We, so we've made this list.

333
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:19,643
[SPEAKER_17]: I also, in my work to sort of tighten up a few things, did take a peek at a couple of other RFSs from other communities.

334
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,944
[SPEAKER_17]: So this list is very much open for.

335
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:31,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Suggestion and questions if we, if there's anything else we want to add that helps people understand sort of what we're trying to do.

336
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:42,668
[SPEAKER_17]: So we talk about the Northeast collaborative for high performance schools and or the US Green Building Council's lead for schools rating system qualification and analysis of potential.

337
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:51,752
[SPEAKER_17]: To be in that 0 energy building life cycle costs of operational of operating the school as it relates to future operational budgets.

338
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:55,456
[SPEAKER_17]: We are interested in a CM at risk delivery method.

339
00:28:55,496 --> 00:29:00,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Potentially we have identified potential other sites.

340
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:04,547
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a vetting process that our is going to need to be aware of.

341
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:12,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property if a new if a new project remains in the current place.

342
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:19,334
[SPEAKER_17]: So, as, you know, there's 1 way in and 1 way out of Medford high, and that is a significant sort of.

343
00:29:20,054 --> 00:29:24,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Bottleneck as we flow people in and out of the building, so we would want to be looking at that.

344
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:33,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Update the survey and existing condition information of buildings on the Medford High site, including any hazardous materials.

345
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,263
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's any number of things that could happen on the campus that they have to be aware of.

346
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:49,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Provide design alternatives for renovation, addition renovation, and new construction options for the high school to meet the educational specification of the school building committee and the MSBA.

347
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:57,933
[SPEAKER_17]: provide a schedule, construction cost estimate, operating cost estimate, and life cycle sustainability analysis for each option.

348
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:09,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Constraints of the district, it's assumed that school will be in session on this site for the duration of the project, so phase construction and possible use of swing space may be required.

349
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:17,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Then under that bullet, I think the other things that we've talked a lot about is we will have some extra work to do from a planning perspective.

350
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:23,113
[SPEAKER_17]: To ensure learning continuity for all students, but particularly for our vocational programs.

351
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,840
[SPEAKER_17]: We may need to purchase.

352
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:37,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Modular something to support this project, depending on what happens and we know that that's a thing that we might need to consider.

353
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:51,247
[SPEAKER_17]: We might need to provide and maintain a, you know, we will need to provide and maintain a secure and positive educational environment during construction and then also sort of seeking somebody that has some experience with phase construction projects.

354
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:51,567
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

355
00:30:53,649 --> 00:31:00,137
[SPEAKER_17]: That is sort of the list of things that the OPM selection committee came up with.

356
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:05,584
[SPEAKER_17]: If there are any other thoughts or suggestions here, I'm happy to take them.

357
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:30,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Alongside LEED, there's another similar certification that's called WELL certification, W-E-L-L, that is a more kind of holistic look at the health and sustainability of the project that takes the user into account and not just the sustainability of the building.

358
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:33,663
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's something to consider as well.

359
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:36,966
[SPEAKER_16]: W-E-L-L, Marissa?

360
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:37,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

361
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:37,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

362
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:37,946
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

363
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:38,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Perfect.

364
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:39,728
[SPEAKER_17]: I added that.

365
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:48,573
[SPEAKER_12]: I put a minor edit in the chat just to button up the CM at risk delivery method bullet.

366
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:49,634
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

367
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:53,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

368
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:05,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Updating evaluation of CM at risk delivery method, including a final recommendation.

369
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:06,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Philip.

370
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:07,468
[SPEAKER_17]: That's great.

371
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:19,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a note in there just about the notes of life cycle slash sustainability.

372
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:21,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I just lost the exact language, but.

373
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:25,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like, lifecycle analysis versus lifecycle lifecycle costs.

374
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:30,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Analysis are 2 different things and I'm going to make sure we are stating the 1 that we want.

375
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to put coming in the chat about that.

376
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great Thank you Libby.

377
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:36,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

378
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:49,465
[SPEAKER_13]: The site adjustments required to increase the number of egresses from the property, just from the property to the public roads or something, just something minor like that.

379
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:54,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

380
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:55,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

381
00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:06,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Then any potential alternate sites, I'd finish that and just say for construction of new high school facility, just to tell them what the alternative sites for.

382
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

383
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:23,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions there?

384
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:37,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

385
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:47,487
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the next section that requires our attention is the evaluation criteria.

386
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,308
[SPEAKER_17]: So, in this section.

387
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:57,490
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a lot of discussion about this as well and you can see that a lot of this does come from.

388
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,125
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, come from template, the text in green was added.

389
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:15,696
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing that we talked a lot about was the point scale and this will be used by the selection committee to rate and evaluate all the bids that we receive.

390
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:19,520
[SPEAKER_17]: And sort of the.

391
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:25,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Calculus of how we put this together was to to award.

392
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:32,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Standard sort of thresholds of points for different things that range from, like.

393
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:41,285
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to have this, but it's very likely everyone's going to have this skill to the more customized things at higher number of points.

394
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:41,625
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

395
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:48,246
[SPEAKER_17]: If you look at this, what you'll see is some 10-point items.

396
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:54,888
[SPEAKER_17]: To me, those are things that feel very table-stakey.

397
00:34:55,488 --> 00:35:00,569
[SPEAKER_17]: An OPM who is doing this work all the time is more than likely going to have those things.

398
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:11,512
[SPEAKER_17]: The 20-point scale steps up a little bit where now there is some variability and discretion in terms of how those things might get delivered.

399
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:15,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, 30 points, uh.

400
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Does talk a little bit more about, um.

401
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:32,788
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, their, their overall capacity to do these kinds of projects and then, um, you know, sort of some bigger point values around key personnel who will work with us at 40 points as well as.

402
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:38,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, 50 points for past performance.

403
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:46,067
[SPEAKER_17]: And I stole this from Arlington, which you can see, so I'll fix that, say Medford.

404
00:35:47,789 --> 00:36:07,185
[SPEAKER_17]: So the selection committee felt like this sort of point allocation worked, but I would be very curious if there's anyone in the room who has other thoughts or suggestions about that, because now is the time to sort of set that methodology in place.

405
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:20,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Question, can you add minor points, like 5 or 10 or anything like that for cost evaluation?

406
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:20,812
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

407
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:33,594
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we have learned through this process so far is that there is no cost response that comes with bids.

408
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:37,614
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a process where we evaluate.

409
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,935
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a value-based contract.

410
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:49,556
[SPEAKER_17]: And once you select somebody, then you move into a phase where you negotiate with them and you talk about price.

411
00:36:50,176 --> 00:37:03,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Having said that, part of the documents that will be delivered with this are all of the public exhibits with MSBA, and it's well on record that we have a certain

412
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:14,383
[SPEAKER_17]: amount of money set aside for the feasibility study, which we had to break down to say this much is for the OPM, this much is for the designer, and this much is for incidental.

413
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:32,047
[SPEAKER_17]: So all of that will be well known to people in terms of what our scope and budget is, but my understanding is that all of that price conversation comes after you make your selection first, which is a little bit unusual, but that's how this process works.

414
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:34,306
[SPEAKER_19]: Bye.

415
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:49,221
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question on a section just slightly above, if you don't mind pulling it back up a little.

416
00:37:49,861 --> 00:38:00,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Above the durations for the feasibility phase and stuff, there's a sentence that says the work is divided into the project phases listed in attachment A of this contract.

417
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:02,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I clicked on attachment A in the PDF.

418
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:08,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see any work, any project phases in that attachment.

419
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:10,374
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just don't know if I missed it or if

420
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,308
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a handful.

421
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you didn't miss it.

422
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,570
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not there.

423
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:24,920
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a handful of other attachments that need to come together with this that are provided by MSBA that are not here right now, but we will have to provide those as well.

424
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions about the evaluation points and methodology?

425
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:53,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's a lot of like, need to take in.

426
00:38:55,655 --> 00:39:02,623
[SPEAKER_17]: The next section does talk about a short list and fill up to your question about cost.

427
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:08,609
[SPEAKER_17]: This is where I thought that the cost conversation would happen is once you get to the short list and you're evaluating the.

428
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Proposals, and even then, that's not what happens in this process.

429
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:28,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, once we get down to the short list of candidates and we invite them in for finalist interviews, the scale there is the quality of the reference checks for 30 points and 70 points for the quality of the finalist presentation.

430
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:34,829
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you have to make a selection before you get into that cost discussion.

431
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:43,575
[SPEAKER_17]: So that has been edited and updated based on some of the work the team has done since our meeting to get clarification on that.

432
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:55,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Much of this is boilerplate.

433
00:39:56,752 --> 00:40:07,581
[SPEAKER_17]: And the next component of what is here is the list of who is on the committee.

434
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:14,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have to name those folks and talk a little bit about some of the details of what we plan to do.

435
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:25,689
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of how the shortlist will be done, so we're planning for 2 hour interviews and then how how we will actually negotiate.

436
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:38,081
[SPEAKER_17]: The price, and so I actually did steal from Arlington from Arlington's in terms of how we will do this, but essentially the chair of the.

437
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:49,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, review committee, the CFO of NPS, the superintendent and the budget director work together to negotiate a fee with the 1st ranked respondent.

438
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:50,137
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

439
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:54,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, all the rest of this came from Arlington.

440
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, there went through the same process.

441
00:40:57,443 --> 00:41:01,307
[SPEAKER_17]: So I, um, I have felt good about sort of pulling all of that in.

442
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:06,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and, um.

443
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Then the next thing that is outlined here is a timeline.

444
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:24,387
[SPEAKER_17]: So this timeline does assume that it will take the MSBA 2 weeks from Wednesday essentially to do their review.

445
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:27,729
[SPEAKER_17]: And it takes us about a week to get things posted.

446
00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:41,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, from a procurement perspective, so I've given us a week of buffer and then have sort of cascaded from there through the series of activities and tried to plan.

447
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:44,641
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll see there's like, sort of a gap right in here and.

448
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:53,268
[SPEAKER_17]: That gap is certainly due to April vacation, knowing that that is a really hard time for people.

449
00:41:53,308 --> 00:42:07,260
[SPEAKER_17]: So I felt okay about that, especially because the OPM review panel meeting that we would be eligible to attend is not until 6-2, so we had plenty of time to navigate that April vacation timeframe.

450
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:15,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Questions about the timeline?

451
00:42:28,455 --> 00:42:36,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, just about everything else is sort of filling in the name of our procurement officer.

452
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And, oh, sorry, Phil, did you have a question?

453
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:43,444
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Paul.

454
00:42:43,504 --> 00:42:44,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you go back up a little bit?

455
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:46,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

456
00:42:46,245 --> 00:42:52,309
[SPEAKER_09]: The part with Fiona, you had some, I just noticed that after her name is actually, yeah.

457
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:53,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

458
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:14,681
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jenny, I just had some, um, I can take offline, but just some logistics as far as, um, you know, um, how we'll advertise it and how responses and that sort of stuff.

459
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,445
[SPEAKER_00]: No need to boggle down the whole group, but we can chat about that.

460
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:19,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great.

461
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,363
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a question as well about certifications.

462
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:36,537
[SPEAKER_17]: So there was a in here, it's asked if we asked us to say what certifications we require and I did a little bit of sleuthing and did talk to our legal counsel as well.

463
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:39,160
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is.

464
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:54,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Very similar to what Arlington articulated, so I don't think there's anything particularly specific here that we need to require instead to ask them what their certifications are.

465
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,811
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would actually if anybody who is.

466
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:05,435
[SPEAKER_17]: More in this world than I am has any suggestions if there's anything specific there, I'm happy to take those suggestions.

467
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:21,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

468
00:44:22,237 --> 00:44:22,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

469
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:26,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that is just about everything that was changed.

470
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:27,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Paul?

471
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Scroll back up.

472
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Another one with Diona right there.

473
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:42,373
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very hard to, I love track changes, but at some point it gets to be like too much.

474
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:48,118
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll clean up the formatting and everything once the MSBA weighs in.

475
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,021
[SPEAKER_17]: And we will provide people our statement of interest.

476
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,422
[SPEAKER_17]: We will provide them our educational profile and our chapter 74 forms.

477
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:10,465
[SPEAKER_17]: All of those things will go with the package in addition to the forms and contracts that MSBA requires.

478
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:16,087
[SPEAKER_17]: So all of that will go with this package when it goes out the door.

479
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:18,868
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's it.

480
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:22,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any other questions about this document?

481
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:46,757
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, so my goal would be for us to take a vote to approve this as amended so that it can go to the MSBA tomorrow and be in queue for them.

482
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:54,510
[SPEAKER_17]: one day before they move us into the next phase so that we're in line and ready to go.

483
00:45:55,871 --> 00:45:57,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to do so?

484
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:58,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Emily?

485
00:46:00,252 --> 00:46:00,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

486
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:01,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

487
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:07,193
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, motion to approve by Emily, seconded by?

488
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:08,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

489
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:09,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Aaron?

490
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:14,215
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to stop the share so I can find my list.

491
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:20,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see here.

492
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:23,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

493
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:25,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

494
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:28,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Galussi.

495
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:29,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

496
00:46:29,948 --> 00:46:30,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Cushing.

497
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:31,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

498
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Joan Bowen.

499
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:34,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

500
00:46:35,012 --> 00:46:35,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Marta Cabral.

501
00:46:36,653 --> 00:46:36,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

502
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:38,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Libby Brown.

503
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:39,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

504
00:46:41,776 --> 00:46:42,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Marissa Desmond.

505
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:43,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

506
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:53,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Maria dorsey yes thank you here yes thank you can yes emily was our own yes.

507
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:58,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Nicole ralph yeah and a lot of it.

508
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Luke Prisner, absent.

509
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,931
[SPEAKER_17]: Jenny Graham, yes.

510
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:13,413
[SPEAKER_17]: So 14 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, 1 absent.

511
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

512
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:21,518
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will get this in the queue so that we can move, which is so exciting.

513
00:47:22,658 --> 00:47:33,264
[SPEAKER_17]: The last thing on our list, as we were working through, as the OPM Selection Subcommittee was working through the creation of this document,

514
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:39,648
[SPEAKER_17]: We did have some discussion around the size of that committee.

515
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:43,711
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now, there are three voting members on the committee.

516
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:46,073
[SPEAKER_17]: It's myself, Dr. Cushing, and Aaron.

517
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:56,480
[SPEAKER_17]: We have two non-voting members on the committee, Fiona Maxwell, who's our Chief Procurement Officer, and John McLaughlin, who was not able to be here tonight.

518
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:06,428
[SPEAKER_17]: But we did talk a bit about whether it made sense for there to be 1 or 2 additional folks on this committee.

519
00:48:07,088 --> 00:48:17,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably 2, so that we can keep an odd number just so that the group that is sort of vetting all of this gets just a little bit bigger than it is right now.

520
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:35,173
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think the vision is that this group would be the group that sort of sits through all of the reviews and certainly does all of the evaluation to bring a recommendation back to this committee before it's all said and done.

521
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:41,074
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's, I think it will be a significant amount of work.

522
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:47,176
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am particularly interested in making sure that some of the folks that we put on this committee to

523
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Advise in this process might be good.

524
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:57,839
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, might be good additions to this group.

525
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:14,749
[SPEAKER_17]: So the recommendation from the subcommittee was that we add 2 voting members and maybe 1 non voting member to the to the group to make sure that we have enough eyes on this really important decision.

526
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,752
[SPEAKER_17]: So I bring that back to this group because this group voted on that.

527
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:26,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Committee initially, so we also would need to vote to make a change.

528
00:49:28,962 --> 00:49:32,165
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I will open that up if there's any questions or comments.

529
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:42,676
[SPEAKER_15]: I would assume that the.

530
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:48,285
[SPEAKER_15]: This committee obviously is going to sit in on all of the interviews.

531
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:52,628
[SPEAKER_15]: The interviews, will they be like during the business day?

532
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:55,630
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that will depend on the committee.

533
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:06,097
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think whoever is on the committee, what we will have to do between now and the time this is published is make sure that there is availability and we can block those times.

534
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:10,520
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think there is some flexibility on that.

535
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:19,323
[SPEAKER_17]: On that timeline, and I'm sure it's not uncommon for these kinds of things to happen not inside the working day.

536
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,667
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I think we have some flexibility there.

537
00:50:22,848 --> 00:50:25,651
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, you know, the timeline will will be.

538
00:50:26,352 --> 00:50:30,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Fast and pretty tight, even if we are doing it after hours.

539
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:44,245
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

540
00:50:45,094 --> 00:50:45,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

541
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:47,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have any questions or comments.

542
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:48,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, I'm one of the voting members for that.

543
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:57,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to, if everyone else feels confident about this decision, to increase the total number from at least from three to five, plus that additional non-voting member.

544
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to nominate at least one member who I think would be a really good asset.

545
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:10,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that when we had a conversation about who would be best for this committee, I know that their expertise in this area was something that stuck out for a lot of us.

546
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,741
[SPEAKER_11]: So is this a time to do that or should I wait a little bit longer?

547
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:14,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.

548
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:21,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if they are willing, I'd love to nominate Libby Brown to be 1 of the voting members.

549
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:26,844
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I, as I understand it, she has really good knowledge on this type of these types of questions.

550
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:27,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

551
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:32,129
[SPEAKER_17]: So, there's a motion to add Libby Brown to the committee.

552
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:37,273
[SPEAKER_17]: 2nd, 2nd, by Marissa.

553
00:51:37,313 --> 00:51:37,534
[SPEAKER_17]: There.

554
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:47,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Any questions or comments about that motion from the rest of the group?

555
00:51:52,434 --> 00:51:58,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before we take a roll call vote, make sure Libby has the time and is interested.

556
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure if I should speak up, but yes, I'm happy to be involved.

557
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:09,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with many OPMs over the years, so I have a good sense of what we're looking for here.

558
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:10,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

559
00:52:16,353 --> 00:52:17,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, then I will call the roll.

560
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:20,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

561
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:23,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

562
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:25,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Galusi.

563
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:26,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

564
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Cushing.

565
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:29,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

566
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:30,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Joan Boleyn.

567
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:31,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

568
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:32,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Marta Cabral.

569
00:52:32,864 --> 00:52:33,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

570
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:34,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Libby Brown.

571
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:35,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

00:52:36,606 --> 00:52:37,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Marissa Desmond.

573
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:38,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

574
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:40,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Maria Dorsey.

575
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:41,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

576
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Brian Hilliard.

577
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:43,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

578
00:52:44,491 --> 00:52:45,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Tracy Keene.

579
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:49,609
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Emily was our oh yes, Nicole morale.

580
00:52:50,429 --> 00:52:53,310
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll potty yes.

581
00:52:54,351 --> 00:53:00,914
[SPEAKER_17]: The president absent jenny graham yes, 14 and the affirmative 0 in the negative one absence welcome Libby.

582
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:03,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

583
00:53:04,106 --> 00:53:16,590
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do think we are still thinking about one additional voting member and one non-voting member to add to this group.

584
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:23,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there people who are really excited to put their hand in the air and participate in this process?

585
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:31,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Or I see a hand from member Rousseff who is a non-voting member, so he would be filling the non-voting spot.

586
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:37,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there other folks who are excited about this opportunity?

587
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:47,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing and seeing none, we'll nominate member Ruseau.

588
00:53:49,123 --> 00:53:52,225
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, nomination for member Ruseau by Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

589
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:53,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

590
00:53:55,306 --> 00:53:55,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

591
00:53:57,287 --> 00:53:59,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Second by Dr. Cushing.

592
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:01,349
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, roll call.

593
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,230
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

594
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:04,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

595
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:06,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Belusy.

596
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:06,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

597
00:54:07,436 --> 00:54:08,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Cushing.

598
00:54:08,636 --> 00:54:08,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

599
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Joan Boland.

600
00:54:11,257 --> 00:54:11,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

601
00:54:11,937 --> 00:54:12,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Marta Cabral.

602
00:54:13,197 --> 00:54:13,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

603
00:54:13,857 --> 00:54:14,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Libby Brown.

604
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:15,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

605
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:16,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Marissa Desmond.

606
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:17,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

607
00:54:18,898 --> 00:54:19,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Maria Dorsey.

608
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:20,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

609
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:21,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Brian Hilliard.

610
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:22,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

611
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,039
[SPEAKER_16]: Tracy Keene.

612
00:54:24,379 --> 00:54:24,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

613
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Emily Lazzaro.

614
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,020
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

615
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Nicole Morell.

616
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:28,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

617
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:30,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Erin Olapade.

618
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:30,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

619
00:54:32,433 --> 00:54:40,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Luke pricing are absent Jenny Graham yes, so 14 the affirmative 0, the negative 1 absence welcome Paul.

620
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:41,675
[SPEAKER_17]: To the team.

621
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:48,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think there's maybe one more voting member to appoint.

622
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:57,834
[SPEAKER_17]: And I did have a brief conversation with Dr. Galussi about whether she wanted to be that person.

623
00:54:57,854 --> 00:55:04,018
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we would love to have her, but she has a very full plate right now.

624
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:11,963
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm totally open to hearing from you, Dr. Galussi, if you have a preference.

625
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,924
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, I'm happy to step up.

626
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:23,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I just also wanted to kind of see if there were other people that also wanted the opportunity to participate.

627
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:31,391
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm absolutely happy to step up and be a participating member of this committee.

628
00:55:35,113 --> 00:55:42,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there other folks who might want to give Dr. Galusi some free time and join us instead?

629
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:55,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Jenny, if I read Luke Preissner's email correctly this morning, he expressed interest in being part of a group that was making these decisions.

630
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:03,385
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if he's a voting member or not, but that's the way that I read it, that he was offering his services.

631
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:08,539
[SPEAKER_17]: I did have a couple of email exchanges with Luke.

632
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:17,024
[SPEAKER_17]: And what he was referring to was sort of the creation of the document and willingness to help support that.

633
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,226
[SPEAKER_17]: So I didn't read it that way.

634
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:20,847
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know he was unable to come.

635
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:26,650
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would hate to put him on the spot like that.

636
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:29,792
[SPEAKER_17]: And he did see the agenda.

637
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:32,874
[SPEAKER_17]: So if he had an inkling of that, I'm sure that he would have let me know.

638
00:56:34,736 --> 00:56:39,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do expect that he will be very active on the communications and community engagement subcommittee.

639
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:45,151
[SPEAKER_17]: So I didn't know we have a couple of other architects in our midst.

640
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that true?

641
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:50,183
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna put you on the spot, Brian.

642
00:56:50,263 --> 00:56:52,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm one of the guiltiest charged.

643
00:56:53,465 --> 00:56:56,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be of interest, I think I need to dig in a little bit more.

644
00:56:56,947 --> 00:57:00,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, typically when I was involved, I was on the design end.

645
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:03,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, typically just more of the tail end.

646
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:13,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Not opposed to joining you guys, but I think I just needed to dig in and see if I'm the right kind of person that you're looking for.

647
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about a maybe?

648
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:21,300
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, I think to your point, like, this is the 1st procurement.

649
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,420
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the selection committee.

650
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,702
[SPEAKER_17]: There will be another whole procurement to bring on the designer.

651
00:57:27,722 --> 00:57:41,746
[SPEAKER_17]: And so maybe we ask Dr Lucy to be part of this process and we plan to shift that selection committee to give people a break and pull you in at that time when we are onboarding that designer.

652
00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that feel better?

653
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:43,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

654
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:44,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

655
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:51,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I'm happy to stretch if need be, and obviously would love to give anybody relief if they need it.

656
00:57:51,812 --> 00:58:02,138
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know sort of my skill set, so if there's somebody better than me right now to fill in, but I'm happy to switch horses in the middle of the race too.

657
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great.

658
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:05,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

659
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:11,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, along the same lines as Brian, I'd be happy to be in on the architect selection.

660
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:17,994
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm more familiar with the questions and things that would be asked then, as opposed to asking the OPM.

661
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:19,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great.

662
00:58:19,715 --> 00:58:24,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we'll hire you in just a few weeks, hopefully, for that process.

663
00:58:24,998 --> 00:58:30,421
[SPEAKER_17]: So is there an official nomination to add Dr. Galusi to the OPM selection committee?

664
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to nominate her.

665
00:58:32,997 --> 00:58:35,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so nominated by Dr. Cushing.

666
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:48,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second that, and also maybe, Dr. Lucy, if you want to have a conversation with Luke in the meantime, and maybe we could always switch it if it would relieve you from hours of work that you already have a ton of.

667
00:58:48,745 --> 00:58:55,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So I second it, and I'm open to changing that vote if you get a positive from Luke.

668
00:58:56,289 --> 00:58:56,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

669
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:02,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so to appoint Dr. Galussi, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

670
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

671
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Galussi.

672
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:07,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
