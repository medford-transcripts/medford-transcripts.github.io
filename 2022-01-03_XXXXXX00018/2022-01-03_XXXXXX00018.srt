1
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:09,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Medford Bites listeners, I hope you're all having a happy and healthy beginning to 2022.

2
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:18,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Today on the podcast, you'll hear some updates about City Council from Councilor Nicole Morell and an interview with the owners of Reimagine.

3
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:19,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you enjoy.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole Morell, Medford City Councilor.

5
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:30,672
[SPEAKER_00]: The first guiding question you have is what am I proud of from this year?

6
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I'm most proud of is really

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,685
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting for issues that matter to me and matter to residents, even though it may have been clear that we didn't have the votes to get that issue through.

8
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:51,292
[SPEAKER_00]: So one example is fighting to give ABCD the full funding they requested through their CPA request as far as funding the

9
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:59,098
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency rental assistance program for those facing housing insecurity in Medford as a result of the pandemic.

10
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:11,206
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something that other Councilors really wanted to kind of chunk this money up and make ABCD come back to us, you know, every few months asking for more money, asking for more money as part of that full request.

11
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:11,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know,

12
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:24,009
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, seeing the dire situation we were in and are still in, it made the most sense to just get that money to ABCD, help them facilitate the programs and support residents without adding additional bureaucracy.

13
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,712
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I fought for when it came time for the budget.

14
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:35,026
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing for an increase in the tree budget, which the mayor responded to and increase the budget there.

15
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:39,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also advocating for increased pay for the diversity director position.

16
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,808
[SPEAKER_00]: So these positions got separated out.

17
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:45,349
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have the chief people officer and the diversity director position.

18
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:52,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw in the budget that the diversity director position was the lowest paid, one of the lowest paid, if not the lowest paid,

19
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:54,136
[SPEAKER_00]: directors in the budget.

20
00:01:54,476 --> 00:02:00,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And I advocated for an increase in the salary of that because we can't say we value something and then underfund it.

21
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly this time, diversity and inclusion officers are incredibly in demand.

22
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:12,305
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we actually value this in Medford, we need to pay those positions and demonstrate that, live our values.

23
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:18,528
[SPEAKER_00]: And I attract people that have top talent doing this work who really want to do great work in Medford.

24
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:33,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I also push for monthly updates and information on Medford's fight against the coronavirus and really advocating for sustainability and transportation and walkability issues wherever I could.

25
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:41,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So any project that came before us, whether it was a zoning recodification or there was another large project regarding the old Whole Foods Bakery,

26
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,491
[SPEAKER_00]: saying what are we doing for sustainability?

27
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:47,114
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing for making sure this is pedestrian friendly?

28
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:49,236
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we getting bike lanes out of this?

29
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:53,499
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we getting protected bus stops out of this?

30
00:02:53,619 --> 00:03:01,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And just really seeing every time something came before us, trying to view it through the lens of sustainability, through the lens of a multimodal Medford.

31
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So another issue you talked about is inclusivity.

32
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:10,872
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about inclusivity, I think about speaking and being heard and represented in the chambers specifically.

33
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:14,635
[SPEAKER_00]: as that's where, you know, my job requires me to spend a lot of my time.

34
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:20,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we look at the new term with two new Councilors, I'm really excited about the voices that will join us officially behind the rail.

35
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:38,735
[SPEAKER_00]: So Manfred's first Asian American Councilors serve and a vast increase with, sorry, a vast increase with a renter representation through both Councilors, both new Councilors, as well as different neighborhoods having that South Manfred representation and also having that experience growing up in Wellington.

36
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,617
[SPEAKER_00]: but also what this means for residents.

37
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:51,065
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that this new term offers a much more welcoming space for people to attend when safe to do so, offer their insight and share their unique lived experience.

38
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:55,189
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chambers and the procedures of meetings can be intimidating.

39
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:59,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that's something that we can change in this new term as a new council.

40
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,777
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want us to operate in the way of nothing about us without us.

41
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:05,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've seen

42
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,910
[SPEAKER_00]: recently how that's happened.

43
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:25,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Decisions being made at different levels with, you know, decisions about people, decisions that affect people, and not having those people in the room or part of the process or offering insight to make sure we're doing things right and make sure we're not harming people in the process.

44
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:28,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Another topic you mentioned is charter review.

45
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I remain hopeful for charter review.

46
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,343
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes back in my mind to inclusivity and representation.

47
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:38,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I see, and I'm really excited to see more folks mobilizing around this.

48
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:45,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that it has my support and I'll do everything in my power to see that we get a strong vote on this through the council.

49
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,050
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are other Councilors looking for?

50
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:51,993
[SPEAKER_00]: What concerns do they need to have addressed to get a yes vote on this?

51
00:04:53,053 --> 00:05:02,419
[SPEAKER_00]: as we've seen time and time again as this comes before the council, demonstrating that strong support from the council has an impact on what the statehouse decides.

52
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want this vote to get to them and have, you know, as strong a vote as we can to say this is something

53
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:10,405
[SPEAKER_00]: that the people of Medford want.

54
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:13,248
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that is just simply long overdue.

55
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:15,111
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just good politics.

56
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:24,283
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just good policy to review an operating document that has been unchanged for decades at this point, when the city has vastly changed.

57
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:26,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And priorities for next term.

58
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:36,578
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest priorities, you know, as I said before, the lens I view things through is sustainability and transportation and I view these as two sides of the same coin.

59
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:42,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So a more sustainable Medford is a Medford that we have less emissions and less fossil fuels.

60
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:46,084
[SPEAKER_00]: and less traffic or more ways to get around.

61
00:05:46,504 --> 00:06:04,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing everything I can to support bike lanes and multimodal streets and public transportation and making public transportation easier to take, which, you know, advocating for increased bus service or just the return to the bus service we once had, doing everything we can to make sure that everyone in the city

62
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:09,991
[SPEAKER_00]: has safe pathways to get to the new Green Line extension, they can use that.

63
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:19,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Improving our streets and sidewalks, improving our sidewalks so that people with strollers and wheelchairs and mobility devices can use the sidewalk because

64
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:35,646
[SPEAKER_00]: parking and traffic enforcement so there's not cars blocking the sidewalk or bike lane so that people, regardless of their dependence on vehicles and I know you know different life circumstances require you know different transportation needs but those who

65
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:42,541
[SPEAKER_00]: can not, you know, can avoid using a car, can avoid adding to those emissions, can get around Medford.

66
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:45,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's things to do around Medford on foot.

67
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:58,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just supporting a more sustainable Medford in the sense of climate change or in the sense of individual sustainability, making it a sustainable place for families to live and people without cars and people who can't drive, people who are too young to drive to get around the city.

68
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:03,279
[SPEAKER_00]: So really trying to view everything from the budget to

69
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:11,883
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning changes to ordinances through that lens of how do we make Medford more sustainable and more multimodal.

70
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:20,353
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of stuff comes from that and hearing from more people and hearing from people who have different experiences with traveling throughout the city.

71
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all I have.

72
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:23,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.

73
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:36,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to City Councilor Morell, and congratulations to her and her husband, who recently welcomed their first child.

74
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:39,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Up next is an interview with the owners of Reimagine.

75
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,267
[SPEAKER_02]: On to the interview.

76
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:47,470
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you so much for joining me today.

77
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,251
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could start by saying your names and your pronouns.

78
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:56,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, my name is Teresa Racicot, and my pronouns are they or she, or she or they.

79
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:57,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Either one is fine.

80
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:00,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Mike Denton.

81
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:03,203
[SPEAKER_01]: My pronouns are he, him, ish.

82
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:05,803
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the question, right?

83
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:06,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

84
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:06,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

85
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:14,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first question that I've been asking everybody that I talk to is their favorite place to eat in Medford and what they like to eat there.

86
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,626
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite is Goldilocks Bagels.

87
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:28,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And my favorite thing to eat there is any sort of cheese bagel with egg, bacon, and cheese.

88
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:39,624
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really big breakfast people, so we also live right next to Colette, so we do go to Colette quite often.

89
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:45,729
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm not eating a croissant, a chocolate croissant, I'm getting a quiche.

90
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, delicious.

91
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we actually just got bagels from Goldilocks this morning, so I would have to agree.

92
00:08:53,273 --> 00:09:03,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're sitting here today in your gym, so I wondered if either of you could tell, or both of you could tell a little bit about the gym, the mission that you all have here, and a little bit about that.

93
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:05,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

94
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,419
[SPEAKER_01]: We're Reimagine.

95
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,601
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Reimagine and gyms mushed together.

96
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:14,642
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened

97
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:36,467
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened the gym because we've been involved in the fitness industry for about 20 years, and increasingly over the last decade or so, because this has been a breakfast or dinner table conversation for a long time now, like, we should open our own place one day.

98
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:43,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And we opened, the whole reason behind it was that increasingly over time, we were noticing that

99
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:57,510
[SPEAKER_01]: There are large swaths of the population that are either not being seen by the fitness industry at large, like mainstream fitness, and they're certainly not being made to feel welcome.

100
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:05,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And fitness is not an accessible thing for people, but it's a thing that can make such a powerful difference in people's lives.

101
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:09,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just thought, well, what if we open a place for all of those people?

102
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:15,912
[SPEAKER_01]: A place where we kind of make fitness an enjoyable thing.

103
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:21,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think our slogan on our website is the gym for people who don't like the gym.

104
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:31,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, just to reiterate what Mike said, it's sort of like all of the people that don't see themselves in that mainstream media about fitness.

105
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:39,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just really inclusive here of everyone and from all backgrounds, whether you've ever tried fitness before or not.

106
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:40,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

107
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:51,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say that as a general feel, our goal is to meet people where they're at.

108
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no wrong place to start.

109
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:58,197
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing as too out of shape.

110
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:05,243
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just where you're at now and where you want to go and the fun journey that we'll have getting there.

111
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:10,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I wanted to say.

112
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:27,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess one of our main focuses is sort of making sure that we are meeting you where you're at, but making sure that everything, we're always checking in with people, making sure that everything feels good, that you're feeling it in the muscles that we're intending to use, and there isn't any pain.

113
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:37,243
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big thing, because we want to always move in a place where you feel good about it and your body feels good doing it, regardless of the movement that we are doing.

114
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that kind of brings me to, that reminds me.

115
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:46,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So, secretly, there's two things here that I think are like the secret sauce.

116
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:59,288
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that through what we're doing, we're maybe not so secretly trying to help people develop a better connection and relationship with their bodies.

117
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:13,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, well, because we live in a world and a society that kind of actively discourages distancing yourself from your body or developing feelings of shame around your body and

118
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:22,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And our goal here is to create an environment where we can kind of subvert that expectation by having people feel good about moving in their bodies.

119
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:30,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second element of the secret sauce is that our goal is to build a community of people who are all on

120
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:35,248
[SPEAKER_01]: on a similar journey towards bettering themselves.

121
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:49,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And where I'd like to say we're explicitly trying to subvert that is that bettering yourself is not developing a kind of body you'd see in mainstream magazines.

122
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:54,033
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing inherently better about being in a smaller body.

123
00:12:54,313 --> 00:13:00,475
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just that feeling of growing stronger physically and mentally and emotionally and

124
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:05,705
[SPEAKER_01]: and developing a comfort level with your body and moving in it.

125
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:21,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think to speak to that community part of it, much like you do, we open each sort of small group training, group class with, and even our private personal training, we always check in with how your body is feeling.

126
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:27,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any aches or pains or ouchies we should know about that's gonna affect your workout for that day?

127
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the group setting, we're always like, let's share,

128
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:56,595
[SPEAKER_05]: you know your name because we might not all know each other you know kind of let me know how your body is feeling and how that might influence your workout today if you want to share your pronouns and then we always answer a fun question the other day was prefer to think of it as an important question yes it's fun and important like would you rather be a rhinoceros-sized hamster or a hamster-sized rhinoceros

129
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:04,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So at that part of the building community, and then we also try to, we've done, you know, we've only been open like.

130
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,372
[SPEAKER_05]: 18 months or something like that.

131
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:18,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've planned a couple of community events with our members, where in the fall we did a hayride up in Lowell area, and then we've done a picnic in the park together with everybody.

132
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:28,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So trying to just bolster that community, because I think most people are looking for those kind of things, especially after being stuck at home for so long.

133
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:57,993
[SPEAKER_02]: sure yeah I'm hearing kind of like a mission that is like one maybe connecting helping folks connect to their bodies in a different maybe more like healthy way than what we see about that like I think what we typically see in like mainstream media about like you know what like no pain no gain sort of like striving for this one type of body image right and then also like connecting to the community connecting to a to other people that are searching for that sort of relationship to themselves as well

134
00:14:59,353 --> 00:15:00,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

135
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:08,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And so since I'm in the space and, you know, podcasting is not a visual medium, do you want to describe at all what the space is like for folks?

136
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:13,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe we should start with the exterior.

137
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:22,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we are the only business on Salem Street with a painting of a rainbow wave that goes across the front.

138
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,948
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fitness for everybody.

139
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,165
[SPEAKER_01]: written on the exterior.

140
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:34,166
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have our well-dressed skeleton model.

141
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:36,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Our skeleton's name is Glenn.

142
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:38,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Glenn O'Humeral.

143
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,448
[SPEAKER_01]: For you fitness nerds.

144
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:46,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Glenn also has a fun wig that we got from a Cirque du Soleil show.

145
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:52,650
[SPEAKER_05]: On the outside also is the, there's like two figures of people doing kind of

146
00:15:53,117 --> 00:16:07,534
[SPEAKER_05]: fitnessy moves, but we purposely made them to look more like kind of a regular person, not those traditional fitness shapes that you always see where it's muscularly built people or super thin people.

147
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have our pride flag in the window inside when you walk in.

148
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:24,248
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our trans pride flag and the... I don't know if I can swear, so... We have the important stuff board.

149
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:33,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we hang up all sorts of stuff, whether it's going on internally here or externally out in the greater kind of community.

150
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:37,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after you walk in, it's one big space in here.

151
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:41,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, you know, some dumbbells and kettlebells in the space.

152
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:51,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have off to the left side turf or fake grass that we do some exercises on or use some, I guess,

153
00:16:52,381 --> 00:17:05,317
[SPEAKER_05]: for lack of a better word there's sleds on there so it's for cardio equipment like sort of pushing them back and forth to get your heart rate up and then we have along the right side some big fitness racks where people

154
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,390
[SPEAKER_05]: can do various exercises over there.

155
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:16,480
[SPEAKER_05]: We still work in the pod system, so everyone gets their own pod, and we set up all of their equipment in that pod.

156
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't see the squares on the floor anymore.

157
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,468
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the remnants of the tape.

158
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:37,067
[SPEAKER_05]: When you first look back towards the back of the space, the same friend of ours who painted the windows for us also painted a mural on the wall of what ended up looking like, in her words, a jazz cup.

159
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:39,455
[SPEAKER_05]: if you remember those from the 80s.

160
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:45,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to look it up because I didn't know, but I knew what the look was, but I didn't know what it was called.

161
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:54,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And then kind of looking back, you can just see where we have some TRX hanging on the wall.

162
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:59,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just looks back to, in the back of the studio is where we do a lot of our group fitness classes.

163
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:11,516
[SPEAKER_05]: The group fitness classes we offer vary from like cardio type stuff to body weight and weight training and then some stretching and relaxation classes.

164
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:17,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So you offer group fitness classes, do you also do like one-on-one sessions?

165
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:23,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we have one-on-one personal training and then we have small group personal training which is a max of three people.

166
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:27,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Each person in that small group is doing their own workout.

167
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:32,891
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a program that we've designed for you based on how your body's moving and your goals.

168
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with the personal training.

169
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:44,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the group fitness classes, everyone's doing the same workout, but we do, because we keep them small, we do modify for people and change up.

170
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:53,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if we know that someone's like, oh, you know, I don't have weights at home because we still do stuff on Zoom and in the studio.

171
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,741
[SPEAKER_05]: we can change it up very easily based on what people have or even just how their body is feeling today.

172
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:02,342
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone came in and was like, oh, my knee doesn't feel great.

173
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:04,542
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, great, we won't do any squats with you.

174
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:06,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

175
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:13,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering what the sort of challenges have been in setting your gym up in this way and starting your business.

176
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we opened in August of last year.

177
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So still kind of the

178
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,942
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe just when we were waiting out of the shutdown.

179
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:36,830
[SPEAKER_01]: So it meant that we had to change our original plan quite significantly to accommodate for smaller numbers and more spacing of people.

180
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,512
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, it's all we know.

181
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:49,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a period of time where I think the biggest challenge was helping people to understand that

182
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,947
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a rather safe environment.

183
00:19:54,747 --> 00:20:07,532
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, there's an international, I always get the acronym wrong, it's the International Health Racket and Sports Club Association, or Health and Racket Sport.

184
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:08,332
[SPEAKER_01]: It's IRSA.

185
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:09,413
[SPEAKER_01]: It's IRSA.

186
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:20,017
[SPEAKER_01]: They have done a whole bunch of data collection worldwide, and what's reassuring has been that when there are fitness facilities that have been

187
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:38,357
[SPEAKER_01]: taking precautions, like here we have the great overhead fans that are on constantly when people are here and we maintain spacing and we've taken a test of the, sorry, a temperature of the community, not literally, but I mean

188
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:45,564
[SPEAKER_01]: we collectively decided together that we would stick with mask wearing, even when Medford's mask mandate said it was okay for gyms not to.

189
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:52,910
[SPEAKER_01]: But when gyms do that, they have been a very, very, very small source of COVID spread.

190
00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:00,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the beginning, a big challenge was helping people feel at ease with the idea of coming in here.

191
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a couple of

192
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:07,896
[SPEAKER_01]: nurses who were members early on who accused us of being cleaner than the hospital.

193
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:22,640
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did all of that so that we could let everyone know just how committed we were to the idea that we can still do this fitness thing, but in a way that is quite safe, or a way that feels safe.

194
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:35,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think having this building isn't brand new, but before we moved in, our landlord basically tore down everything inside and then rebuilt it.

195
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:41,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a brand new Havac system with like a special filter that like, you know,

196
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:45,552
[SPEAKER_05]: kills viruses and bacteria and stuff like that.

197
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:53,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have this, the one thing I didn't describe when describing the space, we have this gorgeous like high ceiling with beams.

198
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:54,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really beautiful.

199
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:58,435
[SPEAKER_05]: No one knew it was under the drop ceiling and it's just gorgeous.

200
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:05,796
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we have high ceilings and the fans that push all the air down to the floor and that really brand new Havac system, which is really great.

201
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:07,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Mike said, we just keep

202
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:11,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, everyone still works out in a pod, so we're still, like, distanced.

203
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:18,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when we teach the group classes here, it's a max of four people in the space, and then everyone else would have to be on Zoom.

204
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:31,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we just keep the numbers smaller than need be, just for the comfort of the community, because we've attracted a lot of people who that is really important to them.

205
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

206
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's been the most rewarding part or the most fun part for you both?

207
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:45,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I hesitate only because I'm about to say something cheesy.

208
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:56,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been tremendously gratifying watching all sorts of people grow and develop in ways that have been literally life-changing.

209
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:00,567
[SPEAKER_01]: There's things like

210
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:09,228
[SPEAKER_01]: members who have said, oh my goodness, I caught myself walking up the stairs without limping the other day, like I can go up the stairs without pain.

211
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:21,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Or another member had a, this isn't necessarily a focus of ours, but we did help another member with some fairly significant weight loss goals.

212
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:28,849
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more watching the transformations in people.

213
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:41,156
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's nervousness or hesitation in the beginning or things that they're uncomfortable with and as over time there's a growth of confidence and

214
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:47,876
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been gratifying to just be able to share in that journey with them.

215
00:23:48,596 --> 00:24:11,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, we came in, when we opened in August of 2020, we came in and about, Mike and I were trainers out of our house beforehand, so we came in with some members already, I think it was like 11 or so, but to, after we opened, it was slow, because it was still a pandemic, but like people coming in from the community that we didn't know at all based on

216
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:21,665
[SPEAKER_05]: reading an article in the patch, or just seeing this space, or walking by the windows and seeing our little signs in the window.

217
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:34,949
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just meeting new people in the community that share our same values is also just really great, because there are people that I never would have met otherwise, and that's really awesome.

218
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome.

219
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,086
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned a little bit about your professional background before starting this gym.

220
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:42,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that you want to tell us about kind of?

221
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we should probably share.

222
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:54,502
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent, Teresa a little longer, but the better part of a decade beforehand, we both used to teach flying trapeze.

223
00:24:55,658 --> 00:25:02,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more recently, Teresa was, I mean, taught aerial silks and fabrics.

224
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:06,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Trapeze and a bunch of different kind of aerial apparatus.

225
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:11,448
[SPEAKER_01]: We should give a shout out to Ash Circus Arts in Somerville.

226
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,871
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in Somerville, so it's not Medford, but they're still amazing.

227
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:21,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And while Teresa was doing that, I was doing primarily strength training.

228
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:24,949
[SPEAKER_01]: strength and conditioning work for circus artists.

229
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have a large contingent.

230
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:35,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say a medium-sized contingent of circus artists who train here with us.

231
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:56,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so whether they're, like, they do it recreationally, circus arts, or some of them are, like, perform on a kind of a local and kind of, some of them even branch out further, so it's not just, like, here in Massachusetts or even in New England, but some of them go a little bit further away.

232
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:57,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

233
00:25:57,163 --> 00:26:00,285
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually brings me, reminds me, the

234
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:17,022
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage to our circus background is that both Teresa and I have had some pretty significant injuries that have been also like career trajectory and life altering.

235
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine was a shoulder, Teresa's a hip.

236
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:24,670
[SPEAKER_01]: But the consequence of that is that we both spent a great deal of time

237
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:29,377
[SPEAKER_01]: learning as much as we could about how to manage injuries.

238
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:50,855
[SPEAKER_01]: So a thing that we're able to offer to anyone who comes in is just a background knowing like, oh, if you have a weird body thing or something that's tough to deal with, either we have some experience working with it, or conveniently, we also have a network of physical therapists that we collaborate with

239
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:53,075
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can check in with them.

240
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:53,975
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

241
00:26:54,315 --> 00:27:02,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does make it a lot easier to be like, no, really, there's no wrong place for you to start.

242
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

243
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask a question that's a little more for my own personal curiosity?

244
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:14,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that I've found is like a barrier to gyms is the like locker room bathroom situation.

245
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there like a gender designation for your bathrooms or what's the?

246
00:27:26,151 --> 00:27:32,755
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not fans of the gender binary anyway, so we have two separate bathrooms.

247
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:35,617
[SPEAKER_01]: We generally restrict their use to humans.

248
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,462
[SPEAKER_01]: One is larger than the other.

249
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:42,242
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ADA accessible one.

250
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:46,284
[SPEAKER_05]: We affectionately call them the water closet.

251
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,845
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the smaller of the two and then the walk-in closet.

252
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:51,446
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one's bigger.

253
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:53,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

254
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,867
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also, we don't have a shower.

255
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:55,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

256
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:59,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically our locker rooms are the two bathrooms.

257
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:00,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

258
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:00,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

259
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:01,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.

260
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

261
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

262
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:06,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that I haven't asked you about that you wanted to share with us?

263
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,271
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot about food.

264
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:27,285
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, we do offer nutrition coaching, and our nutrition coaching philosophy is explicitly anti-diet culture.

265
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:47,648
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, for people who do have weight loss goals, we can certainly help with that, but we're not by any means going to espouse a philosophy that, like, life is better in a smaller body because the messaging around that out there is so complicated, and more often than not,

266
00:28:49,737 --> 00:29:07,572
[SPEAKER_01]: the variable isn't a question of like overall body weight but whereas it's a question of of other factors like physical strength and fitness and health and there's there's the the fun byproduct of of uh improving your nutrition and exercise where

267
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:12,967
[SPEAKER_01]: where sometimes the composition of your body will change as you develop muscle.

268
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:28,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And even just, you know, like other health markers of like, you know, that can be important to some people, like improved blood pressure or glucose and all that stuff.

269
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:32,093
[SPEAKER_01]: But during our small group sessions, especially,

270
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:41,084
[SPEAKER_01]: On the surface, I guess maybe it's in part because we're looking to encourage a healthy relationship with food as well.

271
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:45,508
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I think we just have a number of people here who really like food.

272
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:47,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And like to cook.

273
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And like to cook.

274
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:54,995
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some very talented cooks in our membership base or in our community.

275
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not uncommon to be in the middle of a small group training session and talking about

276
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:16,502
[SPEAKER_01]: The Thanksgiving slash National Day of Mourning provided us with a great opportunity to talk about all sorts of things, from great ways to prepare turkey to favorite side dishes.

277
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,503
[SPEAKER_05]: But also sometimes we just get really lost.

278
00:30:19,603 --> 00:30:27,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the questions was, would you rather be in the Matrix universe or the Lord of the Rings universe?

279
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:30,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And the discussions around all of that were pretty in-depth.

280
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:39,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, yeah, we just end up sort of all over the place sometimes.

281
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:44,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes, you know, people come in and they're like, I'm also very focused today, so I'm just going to do my thing.

282
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

283
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:53,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you mentioned a little while ago just that you've noticed being able to connect with people in the community that you might not have otherwise connected with.

284
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:55,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you hoping for like a reverse impact?

285
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:59,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So like an impact that your gym will have on the Medford community?

286
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:27,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I think one thing for us, which is, again, sort of back to the mission, is being able to provide a place for people to come that don't generally see themselves in kind of that fitness mainstream media look, and provide a place for people to think about fitness differently than the messages we always hear.

287
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:45,618
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of create maybe a different story within their own kind of mind and what they say to themselves, and reach more people as well.

288
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:58,809
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still relatively new, a lot of people don't know much about us, but just being able to reach more of the community in the sense of letting them know that there is a different way to do fitness.

289
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:07,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Visually it might look very similar, but how we approach it and how we talk about it is so very different than what you normally hear.

290
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:27,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So being able to just provide, even Mike and I try to post in some of the local Facebook groups for Medford, just free resources for stuff to start to plant that seed of different ways to think about health and wellness than it's generally presented out there.

291
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:36,624
[SPEAKER_05]: help people do that or assist with the, be a guide on their journey to do that, that, that would be great.

292
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:37,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

293
00:32:37,824 --> 00:32:41,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm going to go deep and philosophical.

294
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:56,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people have an opportunity in here to begin thinking more, thinking and feeling more compassionately about their bodies and their own experiences, then

295
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that that's going to change how people show up in the world.

296
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:07,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, there's the part where they get to meet other people from within the community.

297
00:33:07,623 --> 00:33:12,444
[SPEAKER_01]: And there exists the possibility that out there in the world, they'll see those people.

298
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:17,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a different experience of, let's say, Medford as a specific example.

299
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:25,668
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different experience of Medford to be able to go out and see familiar faces rather than wandering in a sea of strangers.

300
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:26,088
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.

301
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:38,675
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, this is intended to be our contribution to that bettering of and changing the world.

302
00:33:38,795 --> 00:33:54,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say bettering where I'll freely admit that my perspective on this one is that what would make the world better is if we're all perhaps more compassionate and understanding of each other and recognizing that

303
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:09,897
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, here, where we're trying to, in various places, explicitly point out that there are a lot of ideas about our bodies and how they function and how we age and develop that we've internalized from messaging

304
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,042
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't serve us.

305
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:23,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't serve the betterment of society, because if we're disconnected from our bodies, it makes it easier to be disconnected from each other.

306
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:29,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if we're feeling more connected with ourselves, it becomes easier to feel more connected to other people.

307
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:38,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since we're explicitly challenging one form of oppression, it kind of

308
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:41,615
[SPEAKER_01]: leaks out into other forms of oppression.

309
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:43,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we hope so.

310
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:44,198
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope.

311
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:54,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Admittedly, there's a, at times, conversation also can skew social justice here.

312
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:55,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

313
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

314
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:56,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

315
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:06,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a, I think that's a really lovely way of talking about the difference between your gym and like, I remember those commercials where I pick stuff up, I put them down.

316
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:07,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

317
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:10,050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I mean, that's a really lovely hope I think for our community.

318
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:16,351
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, we definitely do engage in picking up and putting down heavy things.

319
00:35:18,774 --> 00:35:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Metaphorically and literally, it sounds like.

320
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:23,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.

321
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,726
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, with a dash of rainbows, unicorns, and

322
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:33,344
[SPEAKER_01]: We would totally do more glitter, but it's really tricky to do.

323
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:34,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.

324
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:36,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Imaginary glitter.

325
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:37,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

326
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:38,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you all.

327
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:43,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you both so much for meeting with me today and hopefully we'll see each other in the future.

328
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

329
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:44,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

330
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:56,487
