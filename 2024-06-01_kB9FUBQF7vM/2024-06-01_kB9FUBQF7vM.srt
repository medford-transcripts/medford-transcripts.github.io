1
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:12,992
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a subcommittee meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee dedicated to scheduling and hashing out listening sessions.

2
00:00:13,793 --> 00:00:24,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the purpose of this is just to spend a little bit of time trying to figure out what groups we are specifically going to reach out to, when, what the best times would be.

3
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:29,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So if any of my fellow subcommittee members have any ideas, feel free to take it away.

4
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:44,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to check in on something, which is, I do have a, I have a workshop, an old workshop that I used to give on how to do these kinds of listening sessions.

5
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:47,396
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't sent it because I'm like.

6
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your mic on?

7
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,179
[SPEAKER_01]: It is on, but I'm not talking to it.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been thinking about,

9
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:01,489
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, not getting in trouble with, uh, bidding law.

10
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:09,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I guess what I should do is send a copy to you and the clerk, and then it'll get distributed at the next meeting.

11
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:11,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the appropriate thing to do?

12
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:14,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like how to run one of these sessions.

13
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So sure.

14
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:16,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah.

15
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:26,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I can send it to whoever you direct, and then you're not sending it to a quorum of any committee.

16
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:31,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Just send it to me, ask me to send it to whoever you need me to send it to, and I will take care of sending it.

17
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:34,415
[SPEAKER_01]: and that works for open meeting law?

18
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:35,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

19
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:39,857
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk cannot violate the open meeting law, only the body can violate the open meeting law.

20
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:47,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you were to send it to a quorum of this subcommittee, that could potentially be an open meeting law violation.

21
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:51,843
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were to send it to me and say, could you send it to the rest of this subcommittee, that would not be a violation.

22
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:55,105
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I said, can you send it to all the city councilors?

23
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:56,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, correct.

24
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:57,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Is also okay?

25
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:58,507
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also okay.

26
00:01:59,127 --> 00:01:59,427
Okay, great.

27
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,609
[SPEAKER_04]: If you send it to me directing me to send it to

28
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,045
[SPEAKER_04]: whoever, that's not a violation.

29
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:07,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, okay, good.

30
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:14,572
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the reason why the clerk is in place, because the body can violate the opening law, but the clerk can't.

31
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:19,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the clerk can violate it on behalf of the body, but that's not one of the ways that it happens.

32
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:21,797
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not one of the ways it can happen.

33
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:31,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, and then I will look it over before I send it, because I know it's not exactly designed for what we're doing, but it's kind of like a,

34
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:39,908
[SPEAKER_01]: general like how-to designed for local electoral politics generally.

35
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:43,289
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there kind of a gist that you might have for that?

36
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and and part of that is gonna and I think part of what is recommended in because it's really designed for like one

37
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:55,278
[SPEAKER_01]: City Councilor or one like Mayor or somebody to run them.

38
00:02:56,339 --> 00:03:08,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think one of the things we probably will not adhere to very closely is that really the meetings are designed to be not public, not open to anyone.

39
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:11,238
[SPEAKER_01]: They're designed to be like safe spaces for a specific community.

40
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we will not be doing that.

41
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,584
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have ours be more public, which is fine.

42
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:30,235
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that if you really want to understand, for example, the Haitian community, you go to a Haitian church, you don't have it be like any random person from Medford could show up.

43
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:31,617
[SPEAKER_01]: You have it be like a community.

44
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:38,402
[SPEAKER_01]: of people that knows each other and you know in a place where they usually congregate.

45
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:46,488
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing is going to be a little bit different but I think it'll also be, it'll still have a little bit of that kind of flavor of a

46
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:55,331
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a space where people feel comfortable because we're going to go through the community liaisons, we'll have it like at the senior center because we're going to these places.

47
00:03:55,371 --> 00:04:01,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, it will lend itself a little bit more towards people opening up, which is the idea.

48
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:06,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like for people to feel comfortable that they can open up about what their lives are like.

49
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

50
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think feel free to send that to all of the council when you have that figured out.

51
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:18,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, this is only three of us, so we don't need to have the chair recognize some of this.

52
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:22,386
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I apologize, I was just realizing I didn't really answer your question.

53
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:23,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Your question was more about the gist.

54
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:24,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said what we weren't going to do.

55
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:30,829
[SPEAKER_01]: But the gist is the purpose is not for us to be like, here are policies that we want to know about.

56
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,710
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose is really for us to ask more

57
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:39,678
[SPEAKER_01]: general questions about what their lives are like.

58
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:44,600
[SPEAKER_01]: But ideally, we've talked to someone in that community beforehand.

59
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:56,624
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a conversation, like whoever's going to facilitate a conversation talks to somebody beforehand who can say like, hey, this community is probably going to want to talk about X, Y, or Z. So we have some idea.

60
00:04:56,644 --> 00:05:01,206
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just sort of randomly asking questions about their lives, but we know a little bit about them.

61
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just give one example.

62
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:12,289
[SPEAKER_01]: before COVID, I was running a campaign for, you know, the first couple of months before COVID hit.

63
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:28,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And then COVID hit and I couldn't do these listening sessions, but I did get a chance to speak to someone from a particular community who, and you know, it was, I was wishing that I could have a listening session, but I didn't end up having one because of COVID.

64
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,894
[SPEAKER_01]: But the person that I talked to really helped me to understand that

65
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people in that community were health care workers.

66
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:41,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them were working with the elderly.

67
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:53,779
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the impact on that community of COVID specifically was really devastating because the number of their patients who were dying, the number of

68
00:05:54,332 --> 00:06:02,374
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the other people that they knew who were also, you know, nurses and caretakers who were dying of COVID.

69
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:05,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was really an eye-opener for me.

70
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:12,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And to think about like how to ask those questions and really understand like what could be done from a policy perspective.

71
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:19,979
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously that's like a, that was a critical time and a really unusual thing, but I wouldn't have known

72
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:26,166
[SPEAKER_01]: about that particular aspect if I hadn't talked to someone who knew that community really well first.

73
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:30,069
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing sort of what to ask is always good.

74
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:38,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with the community liaisons especially, we'll be able to talk to the liaisons themselves and maybe get some of that from those folks.

75
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:42,701
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be easy because they work for the city and we have access to those people.

76
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:43,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be a nice conversation.

77
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay, so go ahead and send around that.

78
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:55,583
[SPEAKER_05]: That sheet, but so, I guess, in terms of.

79
00:06:56,283 --> 00:07:01,765
[SPEAKER_05]: How that work, how that works out sort of in practice, I'm just kind of thinking of the upcoming 1 on the.

80
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:06,947
[SPEAKER_05]: 31st that Councilor was are on our schedule to go to.

81
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that's sort of just in the context of like a.

82
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,669
[SPEAKER_05]: senior center's regular coffee hour.

83
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:25,413
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm thinking about right now is just in terms of organizing the listening sessions and what they'll actually look like when we're going to them.

84
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:35,276
[SPEAKER_05]: For certain groups, if it's like a super organized listening session, like people were brought together for that specific purpose, I imagine that could work out.

85
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:39,618
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's two city councilors who are showing up to a regularly scheduled coffee hour,

86
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:45,980
[SPEAKER_05]: go into like a chitchat sort of a thing as well, which, yeah, go ahead.

87
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,482
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually would, I think that the senior center is a really good opportunity.

88
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:57,364
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was talking to seniors on the campaign trail, I'm sure you also have like stories on the campaign trail, you know, we all do.

89
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:05,966
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they had very particular concerns that are things we can address, concerns about transportation specifically, like how to get from one part of the city to another.

90
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:10,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks in West Medford talked about the, you know, commuter rail,

91
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:18,330
[SPEAKER_01]: not being ADA compliant, like at that one particular place and how difficult that made their ability to use that.

92
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:26,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we don't have control of the commuter rail, but as city councilors, it is something that we can, you know, push the state legislators for.

93
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:31,312
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wouldn't go in and talk about whether they have job opportunities.

94
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:31,793
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

95
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there are things you do and don't talk about.

96
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:37,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, it can definitely be tailored toward

97
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:48,137
[SPEAKER_01]: seniors and talking specifically and asking them questions to sort of bring out like, how is Medford serving you?

98
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,682
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the senior center, so we don't want to get them complaining about the senior center itself.

99
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:58,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to be delicate about that particular aspect.

100
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,408
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there are a lot of things that Medford can do.

101
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:22,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And even maybe some conversations, I know like Arlington, because I met my mom, they have a really great like senior, you know, I forget what they call it, but it's like the senior center, it's like a community center for elderly, Council on Aging or something like that.

102
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:25,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have tons of programming.

103
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard seniors talk about lack of programming.

104
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,124
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to talk about the sidewalks, you know?

105
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:41,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so I think there are like very directed questions that we can have to understand how Medford can serve seniors better.

106
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:46,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really, I think it's a great one to try out this,

107
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:51,860
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted, facilitated conversation rather than just a chitchat.

108
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,940
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would do if I were there.

109
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:04,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so what I'm, okay, I'm just, I'm just sort of thinking about the logistics that we'll be going through when we actually schedule these things.

110
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:13,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's, so we definitely need a, you know, a point person in the communities, which obviously we have five community liaisons.

111
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:19,855
[SPEAKER_05]: agreed to discuss seniors, vets, and then high school and tough students as well.

112
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:28,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking that probably the flow of these things is going to be, we scheduled the next one, which May 31st in this case.

113
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:35,232
[SPEAKER_05]: The Councilors that go there take notes, they report back at the next resident services and public engagement committee meeting.

114
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:50,465
[SPEAKER_05]: what they discussed, just try to offer as succinctly as possible, maybe 10 minutes during a session, what was talked about, what people were telling them, and then schedule the next one.

115
00:10:55,194 --> 00:11:00,175
[SPEAKER_05]: and then just kind of keep doing that for about, you know, the rest of the term, so.

116
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, let me, if I may.

117
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I agree with everything that's been said.

118
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:11,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I had a quick question for Councilor Callahan before we, like, moved into the more specific stuff about scheduling.

119
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:24,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for the file that you are thinking about sending around, does that have kind of guidelines of how we should run these meetings, like, best practices for developing questions and structuring the meeting?

120
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:26,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it does.

121
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:37,497
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it is designed for like one elected official to be doing these rather than like a group that so therefore no open meeting law, you know, we don't, it doesn't consider any of those things.

122
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me just take a peek.

123
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:51,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just, is it okay to just pass it around, like email to everybody in this meeting and just include it in the minutes as a, uh, if I send it to you right now, can you send it to us to look at right now?

124
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wonderful, thank you so much.

125
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:56,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, that makes me happy.

126
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:00,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just share it on your screen, or yeah, just share it with me.

127
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:02,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I could put it on the screen in Zoom or something.

128
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:04,256
[SPEAKER_05]: That's helpful.

129
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:13,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess this is... How do I share it on the... Email it to me, or if you want to join the Zoom, but...

130
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:23,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Whichever.

131
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on.

132
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:39,836
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're working on that, I think something to think about is who's going to be the one thinking about the questions that we want to center these conversations around.

133
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:53,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously we'll work with liaisons to do it, but I think it might make sense for each of these meetings if one of us were the lead for each meeting, and then to have that person work with, for example, a community liaison or the director of

134
00:12:53,423 --> 00:13:01,287
[SPEAKER_03]: council of aging or something and work on work on those questions at least to center the discussion a little bit.

135
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:10,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea that one person is the point person and they're the facilitator and they meet with the person beforehand to figure out what the question to be.

136
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:11,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

137
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that makes a lot of sense.

138
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:18,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's that's basically the the stuff I had

139
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:27,797
[SPEAKER_03]: The logistics I thought we should work out first before we talked about all the other groups that we want to work with.

140
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know who is going to be present at the senior center listening session?

141
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:39,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Should be myself and Councilor Lazzaro.

142
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the last resident services meeting, it was agreed that

143
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:53,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the chair would just check in with everybody and figure out who's available for what it becomes.

144
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:57,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we 2 Councilors would be sent to each of these sessions.

145
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:06,899
[SPEAKER_05]: It becomes a little bit of a. Problem and set theory to not violate open meeting law with 2 Councilors because.

146
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:14,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, only 1 person from this subcommittee can actually attend those while the subcommittee still exists.

147
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:15,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Then.

148
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:20,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro or Councilor can just attend.

149
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they have a little bit more flexibility not being on the subcommittee.

150
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:26,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And then.

151
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:44,056
[SPEAKER_05]: then Council President Bears and then Council Vice President Collins are also even have even more freedom to go to any of the listening sessions, just not being on the resident services meeting.

152
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:51,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It becomes a little bit more constrained with us three being on this subcommittee because no two of us can attend.

153
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Councilor Callahan.

154
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:59,259
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe that we would actually, after this meeting, where I think we should

155
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like your suggestion about one person kind of owning.

156
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:09,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should also maybe divvy up the work tonight for how to reach the different, it's only nine groups.

157
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:11,808
[SPEAKER_01]: We just split it up between the three of us.

158
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:18,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, I would actually really like to disband this subcommittee because I think it makes it very difficult.

159
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,435
[SPEAKER_01]: No two of us can ever talk about it.

160
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:22,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we will have,

161
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:30,000
[SPEAKER_01]: more ability to get things done if I can call one of you and say, hey, did you call this person or not?

162
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it just makes more sense to me if we disband this after tonight.

163
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

164
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:40,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to have at least one meeting of the subcommittee together so we can work out these logistics.

165
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:46,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we were being very cautious also with a lot of the subcommittee work, but I think the work that

166
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:56,997
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of what we are currently talking about if Mr. Clerk you can correct me on this is scheduling related and so it's not necessarily it's not subject to open meeting law.

167
00:15:57,277 --> 00:16:02,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe yeah I believe that scheduling is an exemption from the open meeting law so you can you can discuss scheduling.

168
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:11,283
[SPEAKER_04]: because you would necessarily, you may necessarily need to speak with a quorum of the committee to hash out schedules.

169
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:14,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe that is why scheduling is exempt.

170
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:14,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

171
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:15,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

172
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:22,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think tonight is helpful to orient ourselves since we haven't had a meeting explicitly on it yet.

173
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's easier to work on this in a smaller group.

174
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:28,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would be willing to support the

175
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,050
[SPEAKER_03]: the motion to stand after if we feel that we're in a good space.

176
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,430
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

177
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:50,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So Councilor Callahan, once you email the document when you're ready, but in the meantime, is there any other business other than figuring out who specifically is going to reach out to which groups?

178
00:16:51,537 --> 00:16:54,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you had the list of nine.

179
00:16:55,359 --> 00:17:06,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's seniors, seniors, vets, high school and tough students, and then the five reps, the five community liaisons.

180
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:12,477
[SPEAKER_05]: So which is Portuguese, Haitian, Arabic, Spanish, and I forget what the fifth group.

181
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:14,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

182
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,420
[SPEAKER_02]: African American.

183
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:24,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent it to Adam, sorry, the clerk.

184
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:29,158
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we can take a little peek at it before we leave today.

185
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:35,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, okay, so you just sent it, so I'll wait a little bit for the email once it does come through.

186
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:43,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there'll be overlap with, so this is going back to the groups that we should reach out to if this is okay.

187
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:56,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there will be overlap with the working with the communities on African American communities, but I do think reaching out to the West Medford Community Center would make sense as well.

188
00:17:56,871 --> 00:18:05,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing as it's, I mean, it is more of a neighborhood thing, but obviously they're very tied in with the historically black community in West Medford.

189
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's a meeting we work with to

190
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:16,785
[SPEAKER_03]: folks on using the space of the West Medicare Community Center, but working with the community to do it.

191
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:30,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think there's potential, I would say we should do this further down the line when we have more experience with these meetings, but reaching out to Asian American communities can be really good.

192
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:38,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the city is talking about, the city is trying to, oh great, the city

193
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:45,787
[SPEAKER_03]: The city is currently applying for grant money to get an Asian American liaison.

194
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,888
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, applying for grants is different from having the money.

195
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:55,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think we should give it a few months, see where we're at with that application process.

196
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:08,234
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't work, I know community activists in neighboring communities, like Malden, for example, that have been working with Chinese American communities in both Malden and Medford.

197
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:24,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have experience doing this, the listening session model in Malden, and so perhaps they would have contacts of how to do that here in Medford, especially since a lot of the Asian American community is concentrated in East Medford near Malden, so it might make sense to work with them.

198
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I think another way to reach the Asian-American community is through the ICCM, the mosque in the city.

199
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:38,174
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a really large Pakistani and Bangladeshi population and a lot of them frequent the mosque.

200
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:42,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So putting them on the list to work with, I think, would also make a lot of sense.

201
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, are you getting these extras?

202
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting them on the list?

203
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:53,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was- Should we have a spreadsheet or something?

204
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,158
[SPEAKER_01]: We write these down somewhere.

205
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:56,743
[SPEAKER_01]: and the date that we have them on.

206
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, this might be useful.

207
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:00,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I apologize.

208
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:06,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I was recording some of that, but I started looking through the document that you sent, which I just received just now.

209
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:13,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would appreciate if Councilor Tseng would forgive my lapse in attention.

210
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right, I can send you the list of additions after the meeting as well.

211
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might make sense for the chair to have a spreadsheet, but if we're disbanding this and we're going back to the Res Services Committee, then three of us can't share on it, unless it's for scheduling.

212
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:35,934
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it just becomes a little more complicated.

213
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:40,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the chair holds the document and the chair organizes, basically.

214
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:42,437
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's okay with you.

215
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:52,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so, so far I have- And we can, from this subcommittee, if you want, we can meet with the president.

216
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:58,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we already have nine groups, so we can, any additions, we can always be like, people committee, we would like to add these.

217
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:58,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

218
00:20:58,768 --> 00:20:59,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote.

219
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:00,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And then- Yes, yeah.

220
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on it goes, so.

221
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

222
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to put these on the list now, but I totally agree.

223
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:13,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, so I have 10 groups total because Justin, Councilor Tseng just added Asian American communities to the list.

224
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, ICCM.

225
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:14,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Asian.

226
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:27,588
[SPEAKER_03]: ICCM and then this may overlap with the communities on for African American communities, but the West Central Community Center got that.

227
00:21:29,252 --> 00:21:35,259
[SPEAKER_03]: That might just end up, you know, we might talk to the community liaison and she might suggest that we just fold it into one.

228
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would make a lot of sense.

229
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:42,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And then... Unless she thinks two in different parts of the city.

230
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:42,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

231
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:43,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Which would also make sense.

232
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should defer to, you know, or work with her on that.

233
00:21:48,574 --> 00:22:04,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think next year, at some point, once we really have things down pat, we can think about neighborhoods that aren't necessarily represented on the City Council or haven't had the Habitat City Council representation in a while.

234
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:10,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I know with this new make of City Council, a lot of the neighborhoods that have traditionally been left out are now represented.

235
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I think,

236
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:23,884
[SPEAKER_03]: A few of our Councilors may have experienced, especially when you're in a place like Wellington, a lot of folks there do feel left out.

237
00:22:23,904 --> 00:22:28,987
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't had a Councilor representing them for three and a bit years.

238
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to find something to set up there would make a lot of sense, but I do think it would be logistically more complicated and more involved.

239
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:44,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why I suggested something that we hold off until we feel much more comfortable.

240
00:22:44,752 --> 00:22:58,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually do have a graphic that shows where historically city council has been represented in the past.

241
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:01,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

242
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:02,510
Yep.

243
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,290
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

244
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:16,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think it would be productive to try to figure out what the next couple of listening sessions we're going to try to schedule over the next couple of months after the senior center and who's going to take charge of them would be?

245
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:20,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take the nine that we already decided and split them up between the three of us.

246
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:23,215
[SPEAKER_01]: The eight left aside from the three of us.

247
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Just split them up between the three of us.

248
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:30,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just for scheduling purposes, as soon as we talk to somebody, we'll pay you.

249
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they'll overlap naturally.

250
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:37,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of them will be like, oh, let's do something two, three months from now.

251
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we're scheduling, we'll have a moment to check in and make sure that they're not too late.

252
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:43,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that makes sense.

253
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:56,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we reach out to, for example, a community, as I would say, between the months of July and October, which months, is there a good time for us to do a meeting like this?

254
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think, naturally, they'll respond, and we can continue as the chair.

255
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:07,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so in terms of assigning who's going to handle which, I think there are a few obvious ones that I can think of.

256
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would handle vets.

257
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:12,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Justin would handle high school.

258
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:18,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Tufts would be handled by our esteemed counsel, Vice President Collins.

259
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:21,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought the three of us are doing all this.

260
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:21,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the three of us.

261
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:23,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, okay.

262
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:27,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking about Tufts because she's an alum and I can't think of anybody else.

263
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:28,574
[SPEAKER_05]: You would do Tufts?

264
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:30,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do Tufts, yeah.

265
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to do anything.

266
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:33,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the community liaison.

267
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:39,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just a few of the... I was just trying to think of the more obvious.

268
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:41,948
[SPEAKER_01]: The two high school sites and Tufts, that's already three.

269
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:44,945
[SPEAKER_03]: the two high school sites.

270
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:50,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, because we had... I thought it would be pretty interesting to do those separately.

271
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:51,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be interesting.

272
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:54,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we can work on it.

273
00:24:54,908 --> 00:25:02,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think with the high school TEFs, thinking about the community liaisons, there's so many of them, so we can split them up.

274
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:06,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know a few of them very well, so I can work with them as well.

275
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:08,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do Portuguese.

276
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:09,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

277
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:12,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the Arabic speaking and the Haitian speaking ones very well.

278
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

279
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:20,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And will you send this out in the meeting minutes?

280
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm just, I'm just writing them down for my own.

281
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

282
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:26,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like trying to.

283
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

284
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:37,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So Justin, oh wait, so sorry, Justin, you said the Asian speaking community liaison addition to high school students and tough students.

285
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:39,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

286
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:40,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

287
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:41,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Arabic.

288
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, but you said, is there an Asian American liaison?

289
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:49,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so what I was saying, sorry, you might have missed this because you were working on the thing.

290
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:52,694
[SPEAKER_03]: The city is currently in the process of applying.

291
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,375
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I heard that.

292
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have an Asian liaison yet.

293
00:25:56,496 --> 00:25:57,876
[SPEAKER_05]: But that adds to number 10.

294
00:25:58,096 --> 00:25:58,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So would you?

295
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:12,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was saying that after we get used to running these meetings, hopefully we'll have one in place in Medford by then.

296
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we don't, then I can work with local nonprofits that do have roots, ties to Asian American groups in Medford and Malden to try to set something up.

297
00:26:23,423 --> 00:26:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's something down the line.

298
00:26:26,424 --> 00:26:27,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do both.

299
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do the Spanish-speaking community liaison.

300
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:37,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do the Black African-American community liaison and also the West Medford Community Center and I'll work with both of them to see whether we want one or two.

301
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:42,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that leaves the Haitian community liaison, I believe.

302
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:44,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm happy to do that.

303
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:45,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

304
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:51,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, which one was that?

305
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:51,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Haitian.

306
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:52,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

307
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:55,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you said... I did say it, but you can work on that as well.

308
00:26:55,988 --> 00:27:01,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean... Yeah, I think he thought you said Asian-American, but you probably said Haitian-American.

309
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, okay, that was... Yeah, that's the confusion.

310
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:03,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so, sorry.

311
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So Haitian is you, unless you want to give it to me, either way is fine.

312
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:11,414
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see how to copy who we end up with, if it's really you, but then... Yeah.

313
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:13,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we... Yeah.

314
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:13,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

315
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:14,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

316
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:19,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I'll leave Anna with Haitian because Justin already has three.

317
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:28,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now the divisions I have between the nine original groups that were assigned were, Emily has already scheduled something with the seniors.

318
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin has high school students, tough students, and the Arabic community liaisons.

319
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:38,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I have vets, veterans, and the Portuguese community liaison.

320
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:42,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And Anna has Spanish speaking, African American,

321
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:46,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Haitian and the West Medford Community Center community liaisons.

322
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:48,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that sounds good.

323
00:27:48,039 --> 00:28:03,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the one group that I would add into this list from the kind of like from the list I mentioned was just ICCM because I think that's a more concrete group that would be easier to set up with versus the some of the ideas with like Asian Americans or whatever.

324
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:05,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also mention that like I have

325
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:12,293
[SPEAKER_01]: where I've had a long ongoing conversation with Kuliyan from the Bangladeshi community.

326
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:18,076
[SPEAKER_01]: He is supposed to be working on setting up one of these for me, a listening session literally just like this.

327
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:21,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if we want to, I think we loop him in.

328
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:22,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

329
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:28,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he is interested and already was planning on it.

330
00:28:33,985 --> 00:28:34,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

331
00:28:34,305 --> 00:28:35,246
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot of sense.

332
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:36,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you want to take point on that?

333
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:37,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

334
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:38,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

335
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:39,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

336
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:41,733
[SPEAKER_01]: If I am, then maybe you take Haitian.

337
00:28:42,314 --> 00:28:42,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

338
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:43,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

339
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:46,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that leaves Justin with four, me with two.

340
00:28:46,338 --> 00:28:53,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if we're trying to divide it equally among the groups.

341
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:54,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

342
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:56,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you want to do the Haitian.

343
00:28:56,914 --> 00:29:05,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Whomiyoon and also Foxy and Nicole pretty well, so, and I've been talking to Whomiyoon about it, so I'll work with Whomiyoon in ICM.

344
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:14,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I've been doing the West Country Community Center a bunch, so I'm happy to be doing that one as well as the Aftermarket Community Day event.

345
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:16,489
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

346
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:17,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

347
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:18,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

348
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:25,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So the final listing, Anna has Spanish speaking, African-American, uh, the West Medford community center, ICCM.

349
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:35,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the vets, Portuguese community liaison and Haitian community liaison, Justin high school students, tough students, Arabic speaking community liaisons.

350
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:38,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously council is already scheduled something with the seniors.

351
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:39,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

352
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:41,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.

353
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

354
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:42,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

355
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:44,589
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

356
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:48,791
[SPEAKER_05]: That appears to be that.

357
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:55,394
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there any other order of business in the seven minutes between now and the start of the Committee of the Whole meeting?

358
00:29:56,238 --> 00:29:58,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I super quick talk to you guys through this doc?

359
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sure.

360
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Continuous Town Halls.

361
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:06,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually had to cut out a bunch of other stuff out of this particular document.

362
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:08,064
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like a portion of it.

363
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:13,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's anything that's like, oh, see the XYZ earlier in this document, it's not there, don't worry.

364
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:19,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I left in just this little introduction about the model that you will find humorous.

365
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like, oh, you know,

366
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:25,533
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on a slate of candidates on a single platform.

367
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:27,274
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh yeah, I recognize that.

368
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:39,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also left in what is called the pitch, just because, I don't know why I left it in there, but I know it happens later, I mention it later, so I think that's why I left it in there.

369
00:30:39,524 --> 00:30:50,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, starting on page four is where we start talking about the continuous time hauls, and you can see that before doing it, you choose the constituency, you contact the group leader, you set a time and location,

370
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:55,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you work with that group's leadership to come up with questions, right, that relate to the concerns of the group.

371
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:57,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the event.

372
00:30:57,914 --> 00:31:03,696
[SPEAKER_05]: This does seem to be kind of getting into more like campaign strategy in certain parts of the document.

373
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:10,960
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's not really like, we fit it into like a raising small dollar donations workshop.

374
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:16,745
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the pieces, including like house parties were another piece, there were different other pieces.

375
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:19,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So just don't worry about that stuff.

376
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:28,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I would have pulled all that stuff out, but in this particular case, it's more just for the part that's like starting at page four.

377
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:29,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

378
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:36,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be possible to have what, to get like an edited version of the document where you kind of just take in the listening session stuff and then leave out the.

379
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:37,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

380
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:37,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

381
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

382
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:40,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do that.

383
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:40,867
Cool.

384
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:44,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like a short intro, so people kind of understand what's going on.

385
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it should really be 70% listening.

386
00:31:49,041 --> 00:32:03,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that, like, you know, this sort of 30% helping to educate people, because a lot, like, the idea is that a lot of these people, maybe if they don't vote in city politics, have no idea what, how it even might affect their lives.

387
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:09,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And so helping them to sort of understand how they can become more involved in the community, how can they become more involved

388
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:18,787
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, politically and people that they know can run for office or get involved like that, I think is a helpful part of it if it comes up, but we don't have to do that.

389
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:29,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I assume naturally quite a lot of, you know, what we'll hear will be simple requests that we can teach them how to use CClick fixed form or something like that.

390
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:32,646
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.

391
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:39,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if we could get an edited version of this for the for the council members, I think that's great.

392
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:39,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

393
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:42,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your for your research.

394
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:42,692
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

395
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:43,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

396
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:44,874
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

397
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:52,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we need to turn any thing that was discussed so far in this committee into an official motion?

398
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:54,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are we?

399
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

400
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, to disband this committee, I think is not a bad idea.

401
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:08,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that should be in the subcommittee since the subcommittee, I mean, I should be in the full committee since the full committee created the subcommittee.

402
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:08,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

403
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

404
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:10,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

405
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:12,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

406
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:19,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so otherwise, yeah, I have, I wrote down who's assigned to what and yeah, do we have any motions on the floor?

407
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:20,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion.

408
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:21,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

409
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:22,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

410
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:24,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion to adjourn.

411
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:28,466
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to adjourn.

412
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

413
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:30,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

414
