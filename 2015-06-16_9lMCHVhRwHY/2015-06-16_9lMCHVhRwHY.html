    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=6.054s">Good</a>  morning, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=9.055s">Good</a>  morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=11.296s">If</a>  I could, I'd just like to welcome everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=16.218s">And</a>  before we move on, I'd like to introduce a few of the elected officials or their representatives who are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=23.0s">I</a>  saw City Councilor Rick Caraviello is with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=26.461s">Here</a>  I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=28.542s">City</a>  Councilor, former Budget Director Stephanie Ucchini-Burke is here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=34.863s">representing,</a>  oh, Congresswoman Catherine Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=40.686s">We</a>  have Wade Blackman and Kelsey Perkins here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=43.767s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=45.548s">And</a>  representing District Attorney Marion Ryan, Denise Duren is right behind everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=52.051s">So</a>  thank you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=53.231s">This</a>  is a very exciting day for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=56.473s">And</a>  it's taken a little time for four parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=60.174s">Cummings</a>  Property, Tufts University, MBTA, the City of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=64.506s">to</a>  look at the number of details involved in this proposed project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=69.009s">And</a>  we've all come together on a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=72.072s">This</a>  is the beginning step where we will unveil that proposal, but then begin a public process for review by the community as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=81.799s">But</a>  as we look at the project, we had an interest in it because it does a number of things here in the community, not the least of which are improvements to pedestrian safety, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=93.677s">financial</a>  packages for the community, better walkways and access to the neighborhoods, the opportunity to have a brand new beautiful educational building that'll have access to community groups, and also, hopefully, by having the educational building right on the top of that station, it'll be another attraction to just take the train to school and get off and go up to the second and third floor and take your classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=122.292s">So</a>  we have come to agreement <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=124.067s">And</a>  at this time, we're going to go through two or three speakers, and then I'll sum up the community benefits at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=132.589s">And</a>  hopefully by the end, you'll have a full understanding of the entire program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=136.35s">So</a>  our first speaker is the president of Tufts, Tony Monaco. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=141.272s">Now,</a>  Tony and I have worked together since 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=144.092s">And</a>  over that four-year period of time, we have built a great relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=149.674s">I</a>  have served with four presidents of Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=154.074s">And</a>  I think when it comes to negotiations, Tony and I are most alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=158.676s">We</a>  look at each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=160.336s">I</a>  tell him what the needs are in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=161.877s">He</a>  tells me what the needs are in the university. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=164.538s">And</a>  then in a very short period of time, we are able to work out an agreement that maybe we're not both very happy with, but we know that we got a good agreement on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=177.523s">One</a>  that's good for the university, one that's good for the city, one that's good for the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=183.05s">So</a>  I'd like to present my dear friend, President Tony Monaco.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=192.718s">Thank</a>  you Mayor McGlynn for bringing us all together for this press conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=196.501s">I'm</a>  so grateful to the Mayor, over 28 years he's been a true friend to Tufts and today's announcement is yet another example of our very strong partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=206.787s">We're</a>  also enormously proud of our alumnus Bill Cummings and his wife Joyce. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=211.089s">Today</a>  we're unveiling another of his visionary projects that benefits both Tufts and his hometown of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=219.214s">I</a>  also want to thank Frank DiPaola. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=221.375s">The</a>  MBA team has worked collaboratively with us and I appreciate their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=228.12s">Tufts</a>  is excited to have this opportunity to work with the City of Medford and the MBTA on the construction of a new public transit station in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=237.662s">We</a>  believe this transit station will support our efforts to reduce the number of cars that come to campus on a regular basis, a sustainable outcome we can all support. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=248.905s">As</a>  always, we are delighted to have Medford as our partner in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=253.635s">We</a>  will work closely with the city and its residents on this project as it goes through the permitting and neighborhood discussions before construction can begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=263.758s">We</a>  are honored through the generosity of Bill and Joyce Cummings and the Cummings Foundation that we have this opportunity to add an important building to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=273.84s">Bill</a>  and Joyce have been wonderful friends to Tufts and to the greater community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=278.041s">Their</a>  philanthropy has been transformational to our university, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=282.804s">and</a>  non-profit organizations across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=286.906s">This</a>  visionary project will enhance public spaces for community use and also help knit together our campus, which is located on both sides of the railroad right-of-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=298.15s">We</a>  plan a building that will be a home for outward-reaching academic endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=302.912s">It</a>  will improve our access to the Tufts Health Science Campus in downtown Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=309.049s">We</a>  are still considering how best to use this academic space, but I can state now that there will be no wet labs nor student housing in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=319.014s">We</a>  also see the new academic building as a place where the Tufts community and the Medford community can come together and interact. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=326.677s">For</a>  example, we will design the building with meeting spaces which will be available for use by the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=333.74s">The</a>  building plans also include commercial space on the first floor which might be used for a coffee shop for tea riders, neighbors, faculty, staff and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=344.164s">We</a>  also hope to move forward on a design and permitting for a footbridge that will link the new building to the top of the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=351.346s">It</a>  will benefit members of the Tufts community and our visitors and will be open to the public during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=357.688s">It</a>  will help make our campus more accessible, meaning a real challenge for our campus on a hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=363.585s">and</a>  will route pedestrians away from the already busy Boston Avenue-College Avenue intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=370.23s">We</a>  are pleased to support the City of Medford by contributing to a community fund which will be used to improve things throughout the City. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=378.156s">We</a>  have also agreed to make annual payments to the City related to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=383.58s">I</a>  want to take this opportunity to thank Mayor McGlynn, the City of Medford and our neighbors for their cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=390.201s">We</a>  appreciate their willingness to work with us as we continue to refine our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=395.805s">Neither</a>  the Tufts Building nor its amenities would be possible without the significant work of the MBTA that they've already done on the College Ave Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=405.012s">The</a>  MBTA has been a true partner as this project has developed and we look forward to completion of our building when the T Station opens at the end of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=414.119s">It</a>  is a very exciting project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=418.217s">And</a>  I look forward to the day we can all assemble again to dedicate the vision of Bill Cummings, which is finally brought to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=425.839s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=436.062s">Our</a>  next speaker is Frank Capalla, who is the interim director of the MBTA, general manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=442.304s">I</a>  suggest, if anyone in this room has a problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=446.008s">You</a>  call Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=448.212s">Because</a>  I think of the one public servant that I've called the most over my 28 years, and it's Frank DiPaolo. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=457.15s">whether</a>  he was at the MWRA working with us on environmental issues, whether he was the highway administrator who we worked on numerous issues with, whether he was the interim director of Secretary of Transportation, where I found myself in his office on many occasions, and now he has just taken on the chore of straightening out one of the most difficult <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=480.607s">issues</a>  to straighten out in the history of public transportation in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that is getting the MBTA back on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=490.68s">He</a>  is a gentleman who is very reasonable to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=497.189s">It's</a>  always, tell me the problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=499.442s">and</a>  we'll figure out what his solution is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=502.284s">He's</a>  good for the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=504.025s">He's</a>  good for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=505.526s">He's</a>  good for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=507.007s">I</a>  thank him for his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/9lMCHVhRwHY&t=508.168s">Thank</a>  you, Paul.</p>
