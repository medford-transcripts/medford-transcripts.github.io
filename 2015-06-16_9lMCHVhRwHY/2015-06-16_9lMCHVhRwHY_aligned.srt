1
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:08,975
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,216
Good morning.

3
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:15,697
If I could, I'd just like to welcome everybody here.

4
00:00:16,218 --> 00:00:22,560
And before we move on, I'd like to introduce a few of the elected officials or their representatives who are here.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,361
I saw City Councilor Rick Caviello is with us.

6
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,282
Here I am.

7
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:32,683
City Councilor, former Budget Director Stephanie Ucchini-Burke is here with us.

8
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:40,245
representing, oh, Congresswoman Catherine Clark.

9
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:43,647
We have Wade Blackman and Kelsey Perkins here with us.

10
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:44,907
Thank you for being here.

11
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:51,530
And representing District Attorney Marion Ryan, Denise Duren is right behind everybody here.

12
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,211
So thank you all for being here.

13
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,452
This is a very exciting day for all of us.

14
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,774
And it's taken a little time for four parties.

15
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:03,896
Cummings Property, Tufts University, MBTA, the City of Medford,

16
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:08,849
to look at the number of details involved in this proposed project.

17
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,351
And we've all come together on a proposal.

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:21,198
This is the beginning step where we will unveil that proposal, but then begin a public process for review by the community as we move forward.

19
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:33,047
But as we look at the project, we had an interest in it because it does a number of things here in the community, not the least of which are improvements to pedestrian safety,

20
00:01:33,677 --> 00:02:01,632
financial packages for the community, better walkways and access to the neighborhoods, the opportunity to have a brand new beautiful educational building that'll have access to community groups, and also, hopefully, by having the educational building right on the top of that station, it'll be another attraction to just take the train to school and get off and go up to the second and third floor and take your classes.

21
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,513
So we have come to agreement

22
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:11,729
And at this time, we're going to go through two or three speakers, and then I'll sum up the community benefits at the end.

23
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:15,650
And hopefully by the end, you'll have a full understanding of the entire program.

24
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,511
So our first speaker is the president of Tufts, Tony Monaco.

25
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:23,892
Now, Tony and I have worked together since 2011.

26
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:29,514
And over that four-year period of time, we have built a great relationship.

27
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:33,075
I have served with four presidents of Tufts University.

28
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:37,675
And I think when it comes to negotiations, Tony and I are most alike.

29
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:39,396
We look at each other.

30
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:41,837
I tell him what the needs are in the community.

31
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:43,838
He tells me what the needs are in the university.

32
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:56,763
And then in a very short period of time, we are able to work out an agreement that maybe we're not both very happy with, but we know that we got a good agreement on both sides.

33
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:02,285
One that's good for the university, one that's good for the city, one that's good for the quality of life.

34
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:12,678
So I'd like to present my dear friend, President Tony Monaco.

35
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:15,881
Thank you Mayor McGlynn for bringing us all together for this press conference.

36
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:25,789
I'm so grateful to the Mayor, over 28 years he's been a true friend to Tufts and today's announcement is yet another example of our very strong partnership.

37
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:30,909
We're also enormously proud of our alumnus Bill Cummings and his wife Joyce.

38
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:38,393
Today we're unveiling another of his visionary projects that benefits both Tufts and his hometown of Medford.

39
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:40,935
I also want to thank Frank DiPaola.

40
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:46,718
The MBA team has worked collaboratively with us and I appreciate their hard work.

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:56,982
Tufts is excited to have this opportunity to work with the City of Medford and the MBTA on the construction of a new public transit station in our neighborhood.

42
00:03:57,662 --> 00:04:07,885
We believe this transit station will support our efforts to reduce the number of cars that come to campus on a regular basis, a sustainable outcome we can all support.

43
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:12,626
As always, we are delighted to have Medford as our partner in this project.

44
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:22,597
We will work closely with the city and its residents on this project as it goes through the permitting and neighborhood discussions before construction can begin.

45
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:32,980
We are honored through the generosity of Bill and Joyce Cummings and the Cummings Foundation that we have this opportunity to add an important building to our community.

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,421
Bill and Joyce have been wonderful friends to Tufts and to the greater community.

47
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,902
Their philanthropy has been transformational to our university,

48
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:45,965
and non-profit organizations across the Commonwealth.

49
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:57,150
This visionary project will enhance public spaces for community use and also help knit together our campus, which is located on both sides of the railroad right-of-way.

50
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,312
We plan a building that will be a home for outward-reaching academic endeavors.

51
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:07,594
It will improve our access to the Tufts Health Science Campus in downtown Boston.

52
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:17,833
We are still considering how best to use this academic space, but I can state now that there will be no wet labs nor student housing in the building.

53
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:25,977
We also see the new academic building as a place where the Tufts community and the Medford community can come together and interact.

54
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:32,760
For example, we will design the building with meeting spaces which will be available for use by the community.

55
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,783
The building plans also include commercial space on the first floor which might be used for a coffee shop for tea riders, neighbors, faculty, staff and students.

56
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:50,426
We also hope to move forward on a design and permitting for a footbridge that will link the new building to the top of the hill.

57
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:56,528
It will benefit members of the Tufts community and our visitors and will be open to the public during the day.

58
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:02,850
It will help make our campus more accessible, meaning a real challenge for our campus on a hill.

59
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:09,189
and will route pedestrians away from the already busy Boston Avenue-College Avenue intersection.

60
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:17,215
We are pleased to support the City of Medford by contributing to a community fund which will be used to improve things throughout the City.

61
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:22,419
We have also agreed to make annual payments to the City related to the building.

62
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,445
I want to take this opportunity to thank Mayor McGlynn, the City of Medford and our neighbors for their cooperation.

63
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:34,744
We appreciate their willingness to work with us as we continue to refine our plan.

64
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:44,172
Neither the Tufts Building nor its amenities would be possible without the significant work of the MBTA that they've already done on the College Ave Station.

65
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:54,079
The MBTA has been a true partner as this project has developed and we look forward to completion of our building when the T Station opens at the end of 2020.

66
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,782
It is a very exciting project.

67
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:05,379
And I look forward to the day we can all assemble again to dedicate the vision of Bill Cummings, which is finally brought to fruition.

68
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,619
Thank you very much.

69
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:20,684
Our next speaker is Frank Capalla, who is the interim director of the MBTA, general manager.

70
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:25,145
I suggest, if anyone in this room has a problem,

71
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:26,729
You call Frank.

72
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:36,585
Because I think of the one public servant that I've called the most over my 28 years, and it's Frank DiPaolo.

73
00:07:37,150 --> 00:08:00,027
whether he was at the MWRA working with us on environmental issues, whether he was the highway administrator who we worked on numerous issues with, whether he was the interim director of Secretary of Transportation, where I found myself in his office on many occasions, and now he has just taken on the chore of straightening out one of the most difficult

74
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:09,879
issues to straighten out in the history of public transportation in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that is getting the MBTA back on track.

75
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,568
He is a gentleman who is very reasonable to work with.

76
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:18,751
It's always, tell me the problem,

77
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,684
and we'll figure out what his solution is.

78
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,985
He's good for the Commonwealth.

79
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,006
He's good for our city.

80
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:26,787
He's good for this project.

81
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,148
I thank him for his leadership.

82
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:30,150
Thank you, Paul.

83
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,782
Thank you, Mayor McGlynn, President Monaco, and Mr. Cummings.

84
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:45,584
The MBTA is extremely excited to be part of this public-private partnership.

85
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:51,127
The Green Line extension is not just a new light rail line going through Somerville and Midland.

86
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:59,551
It also represents a transforming endeavor and an opportunity to shape our community in a positive way for generations to come.

87
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:13,317
Partnerships such as these attract private investment to public expenditures and provide an opportunity to enhance public infrastructure in communities in a way that the MBTA could not accomplish alone.

88
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,328
Tufts and the City of Medford have been exemplary partners.

89
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:27,190
The GLX project has been underway for some time now, and the plans from the City and from Tufts have been thoughtfully integrated into the project team's work.

90
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:38,853
It is a requirement that this project have no negative impacts to the Green Line project schedule or overall budget, and Tufts and the City of Medford have fully met that requirement.

91
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:40,533
To be clear,

92
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:49,482
Tufts has committed to fund any and all improvements that the MBTA will build on their behalf and all improvements required in order to enable their plans.

93
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:56,248
Tufts project will not require any additional funds from the Commonwealth to complete the Green Line project.

94
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:03,874
Tufts has also committed to maintaining and securing the plaza around the station and all pathways leading to the station.

95
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:08,378
This is a significant commitment and will result in a savings to the MBTA.

96
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:09,179
We thank you for that.

97
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:17,727
The agreement between Tufts and the MBTA commits Tufts to cover all additional project costs implemented on the University's behalf.

98
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:31,559
It also commits Tufts to a maintenance and security obligation for the station and the area around the station, and enables a 99-year lease of the air rights above the public right-of-way granted to Tufts.

99
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:39,189
We are very much looking forward to the fulfillment of many years of planning and execution that will bring the Green Line to Medford.

100
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:49,214
The Green Line project and this partnership will benefit all Medford citizens and help make the area around the College Avenue Station a vibrant and livable place.

101
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:49,934
Thank you.

102
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,902
What do you say about this next guy?

103
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,685
I like to say he was a mentor kid.

104
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:28,523
Grew up on Salem Street, Cherry Street, down in the neighborhood where he had a good friend who was someone else who had success, great success in life, and he's known as the father of Festival Sound, Mr. Hanley, who you may know or may not know, but he was a gentleman who actually laid out Woodstock, and he had a dream about

105
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:38,779
If someone was sitting in the front row of a concert or someone was sitting way back, that they would have the same sound, they would hear the same music that came out.

106
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,701
And I've seen the two of you together and I say it's amazing.

107
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:45,945
Out of that neighborhood, two icons that have just achieved so much.

108
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:50,168
Bill has never forgotten where he has come from.

109
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:55,572
With the Cummings Foundation over the years, there are a number of recipients here

110
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:07,451
the last few years for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, we needed a final $100,000 towards the $1.1 million to build it, and the foundation was there.

111
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:14,979
The Kathy Granara Scary Pancreatic Walk Run for research is

112
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:21,791
closing in on a mark of raising a million dollars, a commitment that siblings made to their dying sister.

113
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:28,395
And as of the other day, Mr. Cummings, with your generosity too, I want to tell you that they're now at $860,000.

114
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:32,057
So after this year's run, they're probably going to hit their million.

115
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:35,380
And again, you've done a tremendous amount to make that happen.

116
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,743
And the preservation of the Brooks Estates, a piece of real history in the community where

117
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:43,594
Funding has been shot over the course of the last seven, eight years.

118
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:47,497
We're serving in the greatest economic recession since the Great Depression.

119
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:49,678
But this man has been there.

120
00:12:50,499 --> 00:13:02,568
And now he's looking to education and to providing greater opportunities for those who will benefit from this building and go on locally to greater heights in life.

121
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:04,089
He's a good man.

122
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,651
Joyce, we're so happy that you're here too.

123
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:12,032
I've never seen Bill without Joyce at his side at a number of events.

124
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,655
And we thank you for everything that you have done.

125
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:17,538
Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Cummings.

126
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:35,863
The thing about Billy Hanley is especially interesting because we did both start off on Cherry Street and Farragut Avenue.

127
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:45,351
And I was dumbstruck one time when I saw my buddy Billy showing up on the History Channel.

128
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:47,533
History?

129
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:55,540
And all the innovative work he did in sound amplification on huge sites, and Bill was

130
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:04,158
He was a graduate of Bedford Vocational High School, and just carried that to a real art form, and is still doing it today, by the way.

131
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:12,324
He lives up in Merrimack, New Hampshire, just over the line, and is active in a lot of ways.

132
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:19,289
The other thing we most recently did, by the way, was supporting the Boys and Girls Club.

133
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,433
And in the process, I was surprised to find that the Bedford Boys and Girls Club is in the

134
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,993
the basement of the old Medford High School.

135
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,175
Shabani or Auditorium Basement?

136
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:31,356
It's now called the Jean Mack Genesee.

137
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:32,857
Okay.

138
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:35,058
And sure enough, there's a Boys and Girls Club.

139
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:37,960
We put a fond spot in our hearts for Boys and Girls Clubs.

140
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,463
Now all of the schools that I attended in Medford are gone.

141
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:49,528
I attended Curtis School on Parrot Street.

142
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:53,611
The Swan School on

143
00:14:54,365 --> 00:15:02,331
Washington Street and Park Street, Roberts Junior High School after that, and of course Medford High School.

144
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:08,175
And the only place that I attended school in Medford that fortunately is still there is Tufts University.

145
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:18,683
The only place I can still come back and really feel connected there.

146
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:35,485
The project that you're seeing here in the artwork is all from CBT Architects, John Burt from Zecharis Architects, and they've done a marvelous job with that.

147
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,506
And it certainly is impressive.

148
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:38,747
It's impressive to me.

149
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,828
I can show you what we normally work with.

150
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:50,253
And a couple of projects that we did here, a project we did in Redford.

151
00:15:51,348 --> 00:16:00,830
And this is 196 Boston Avenue, the before and after views of the building, which is partially occupied and leased by Tufts University.

152
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,411
And this is the type of thing that we typically do.

153
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:08,392
Right now, we do a little more, much more variety of that.

154
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:12,393
But that's a little more simple.

155
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,558
But we've done a lot, oftentimes, by keeping it simple and keeping it basic.

156
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,112
And it's really exciting to be a part of this great project, which was originally proposed

157
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:34,070
with a bridge over Boston Avenue, probably in about your third year of your administration, Mr. Mayor.

158
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:41,756
And thank you for helping make sure it got done before you were decided that you were going to take a couple of years off.

159
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:43,698
A couple of years and I'll be back.

160
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,124
So thank you all very much and it's nice to be with you all here today and as we see the rest of this come to

161
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:56,810
come to fruition, and we can't get it there too soon.

162
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,676
It would like to go down next month, probably, but we're going to be barred from that for a little while longer.

163
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:07,903
But we're there ready to go whenever you're ready to have us.

164
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:11,588
So we're very anxious, and thanks all again.

165
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,450
And thank you for your generosity, Mr. Cummings.

166
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,594
196 Boston Ave set a new tone in the community when Mr. Cummings did that building over.

167
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:43,058
And we had many of the people from the biopharmaceuticals in different areas that were now coming to the community.

168
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:47,461
And one company from Italy came and relocated here.

169
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:53,324
And as soon as that happened, then in other parts, a company came from Spain, and then a company came from China.

170
00:17:54,198 --> 00:18:00,043
And it opened up new doors here in terms of employment and opportunities for people in our community.

171
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:02,545
So we thank you for everything and all of your leadership.

172
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:08,250
Let's look at some of the community benefits, just so people have an understanding.

173
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:17,157
Some of them have been mentioned, but one of the first things is going to be enhanced public spaces and plazas around the station, which will be maintained by Tufts.

174
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:22,482
I've always said, if Tufts builds something, they build it right, and they maintain it.

175
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:30,881
They've always made sure that anything they've done in terms of development is A number one, and I don't think anyone will ever question that.

176
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,782
And this is going to be a big public benefit.

177
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:40,346
They have tufts right in there, not only with maintenance, but also with their police department.

178
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:41,967
Improved access to the station.

179
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:52,220
will include more accessible walkways and enhanced pathway to the adjacent Burrigan and Sunset neighborhood, which was long in discussion of the neighbors and residents of that area.

180
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,581
It would be a great improvement.

181
00:18:54,061 --> 00:19:05,625
And I know it hasn't been mentioned, I know it may not be part of the plan, but there is, you have it here, this one, there is a plan for a bridge over Lawsonette where you can walk out of the building

182
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:08,476
right onto the campus.

183
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:11,097
And that will be another part of a public hearing.

184
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:15,578
But that would certainly enhance pedestrian safety.

185
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:18,119
Sidewalks and crossings, obviously, will be improved.

186
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,301
Community-oriented retail space adjacent to the new station.

187
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:26,682
And community space in the new building.

188
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:35,853
Significant community benefits will include a payment of $500,000 to the city of Medford spread in the following way.

189
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:36,453
Some $150,000 on April 15, 2016.

190
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:37,854
$150,000 on April 15, 2017.

191
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:38,654
A sum of $200,000 on April 15, 2018.

192
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:43,997
That half a million dollars will be used for improvements in neighborhoods throughout the community.

193
00:19:56,866 --> 00:20:03,692
I won't be here to determine how those funds will be spent, but I am creating the fund to make sure that it's being spent for that reason.

194
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:21,908
In addition to that, we will also receive, this August 1st, $25,000 that will be used for an issue that has been before the Council in the past, and the Council has suggested that I go and generate the money myself and do this.

195
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:27,456
but it's to help make Medford, which is a very welcoming community, a little more welcome.

196
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:38,781
When we go through the different parts of the community, and we put up the Welcome to Medford signs, and the goal is to have, like, if you're in North Medford, you say, Welcome to Medford, Fulton Heights.

197
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:42,803
If you're around Tufts, Welcome to Medford, Stearns Village.

198
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:50,707
If you're in West Medford, Welcome to Medford, Village of Brooks, and break down the different areas and the neighborhoods of the city so people

199
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,285
become familiar with them.

200
00:20:53,305 --> 00:21:02,268
There will be another payment of $25,000 in the month of December that will go towards the fund, the maintenance fund for the Crystal Campbell Peace Guide.

201
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:16,351
That $25,000 will be added to a trust fund that we're establishing from an event we ran on March 12th, which we had a goal of raising $15,000 at that event.

202
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:20,032
And as many of you who look around the room who were there are involved in it,

203
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:24,580
You know that $15,000 in a matter of two hours grew to $145,000.

204
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,342
And Tufts was also a very big part of that event.

205
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:39,446
The goal would be to put all of that money into a trust fund that's not used for seven years, and then hopefully in all perpetuity, it would help to maintain that garden for future years.

206
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:47,270
I think that's about...

207
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:53,362
That's about it on the public improvements, which obviously are very significant.

208
00:21:53,722 --> 00:22:02,148
Now the next step will be to move forward on starting the public process so that people can have public input on what they want to see in their community.

209
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,210
We look forward and hope everything goes well.

210
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,793
Any questions for anybody from up here?

211
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:10,295
Thank you very much.
