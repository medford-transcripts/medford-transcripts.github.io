00:00:01,053 --> 00:00:06,857
Welcome back to the next edition of Coffee Chat with the Kingsleys.

2
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:16,943
Nathan's back today as I talk about my third element of my platform, which is oversee a community-informed, comprehensive, permanent superintendent search.

3
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:19,030
What questions do you have about that?

4
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,512
Why is the superintendent so important to the district?

5
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:25,836
Yeah, so the superintendent's role in the district is the overall manager.

6
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,598
They're the leader of the district.

7
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:28,819
They set the direction.

8
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,982
They make the day-to-day decisions.

9
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:35,064
They're key.

10
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:37,006
Their leadership makes all the difference.

11
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:40,389
What the school committee does is they do governance.

12
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:47,416
They set policy, but then they hire and supervise and set priorities for that leader.

13
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:55,744
So the school committee's job is to bring in the right superintendent that's going to be able to make the decisions we need to move Medford forward.

14
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,306
I hear that.

15
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:00,929
What are your qualifications in a right superintendent?

16
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,586
Yeah, so what I think, Medved, is such a good question.

17
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:05,166
And there's two things.

18
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:14,009
So the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has a really comprehensive rubric of what it means to be effective as a superintendent.

19
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,071
Now, I have been evaluated on that rubric before when I was working in Malden, and I hold my superintendent's license.

20
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:24,533
So I know more than most, you know, the collection of skills and responsibilities.

21
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:34,555
But it has to do everything with being a strategic thinker, doing change management, being willing to hold people accountable.

22
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:39,578
And when systems aren't working, being willing to say that, but then work towards a solution.

23
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:44,621
Interesting.

24
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:45,782
Yeah.

25
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:50,064
And so right now we have an interim superintendent.

26
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,606
So most of the time when you run for school committee,

27
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:57,235
you don't know if there will be a superintendent search within the next two years.

28
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:05,537
Well, because we have an interim, we know that we will absolutely have to offer a new permanent contract this next year.

29
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:15,260
So I think it's really important for the perspective of somebody who has that training and that background to be in the room as we have those discussions over the next year.

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,920
I hear that.

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,861
What sort of discussions are we talking about?

32
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:32,852
in terms of deciding what the search process will look like, what perspectives do we want from the community in determining what our priorities are, deciding what's important in our who we hire, and then ultimately making that hiring decision.

33
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:37,315
Interesting.

34
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:39,176
Isn't it just?

35
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,080
Okay, that's another edition of Coffee Talk.
