35
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,614

36
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:44,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we have one primary item on our agenda tonight.

37
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:49,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is site plan review of 121 Riverside Ave.

38
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:53,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me go to my next obligatory step which is to read the public notice to you.

39
00:02:55,266 --> 00:03:00,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Metro Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on November 10 2022 at 6pm.

40
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:11,946
[SPEAKER_02]: We assume remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review submitted by metric housing authority to increase the number of apartments from 200 to 2000 222.

41
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:22,586
[SPEAKER_02]: on lot 010-121 Riverside Avenue in Medford.

42
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:45,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Project is subject to a site plan review per the city of Medford zoning ordinance, which states the residential projects containing six or more units, which this certainly qualifies for, including conversions of existing dwellings constitute a quote major project as defined in the ordinance requiring site plan review by the community development board.

43
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:54,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that out of the way, let me turn this over to the proponents.

44
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:00,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would like to take the floor and start the presentation to the board tonight?

45

50
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:18,301

51
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:22,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Should we let everyone introduce themselves, or do you want to just get into the presentation?

52
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the floor is yours.

53
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:29,584
[SPEAKER_02]: We always like to get right into the presentation, but if you'd like to have folks say hello real quick.

54
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:35,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, well, let me have at least everyone who's going to be presenting this evening just say hello.

[SPEAKER_17]: So will we have the ability to, so we have a presentation for you for, can we give Dan Chen the ability to share the presentation?

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, should be, should be all set.

67
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:19,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a choice.

68
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Try share.

69
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:22,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

70
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:22,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

71
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:30,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

72
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:36,525
[SPEAKER_17]: So as I stated before, I'm Gabe Ciccariello, the director of modernization procurement with the Medford Housing Authority.

73
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:40,987
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been in public housing for about 20 years.

74
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:50,112
[SPEAKER_17]: 15 of those years were with the Somerville Housing Authority, and I've been acting as a director of modern procurement for Medford for the last five years.

75
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:55,815
[SPEAKER_17]: We are here before you tonight regarding the proposed

76
00:05:56,995 --> 00:06:01,037
[SPEAKER_17]: comprehensive and transformative modernization of the salt and salt building.

77
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:03,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan, if you wanna go to the next slide.

78
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,864
[SPEAKER_17]: So then a little bit about the housing authority for those that aren't familiar with what the Medford Housing Authority is and what we do.

79
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:22,589
[SPEAKER_17]: We are a local housing authority established under Mass General Law 121B, and we provide housing and related services within the city of Medford.

80
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:28,387
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're governed by an executive director who serves at the pleasure of our five member board of commissioners.

81
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:39,458
[SPEAKER_17]: And our housing authority portfolio consists of, we have 840 deeply affordable public housing units within eight developments all in the city of Medford.

82
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,940
[SPEAKER_17]: Six of our developments are elderly disabled developments.

83
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,441
[SPEAKER_17]: The other two are family developments.

84
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,963
[SPEAKER_17]: We administer just over a thousand section eight vouchers also.

85
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:55,746
[SPEAKER_17]: 987 of those are housing choice vouchers and 15 of Massachusetts rental vouchers.

86
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,570
[SPEAKER_17]: So what is Salt and Stall?

87
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,872
[SPEAKER_17]: It was built in 1968.

88
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:06,734
[SPEAKER_17]: It's our flagship building.

89
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:15,380
[SPEAKER_17]: It's located at 121 Riverside Ave, right across the street from City Hall and highly visible from Route 93.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody that drives 93, you see this building, you can't miss it.

91
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:24,487
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an 11 story high rise that's been owned and operated by the Medford Housing Authority.

92
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:36,522
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's currently 200 existing units of elderly and disabled federal public housing 180 of our units of one bedroom currently in 20 or two bedroom units and.

93
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:44,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Our main administrative function and maintenance function all works out of 121 Riverside out of Salt and Stall.

94
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,753
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an administrative force of about 30 full-time employees.

95
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:58,498
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have a fair amount of part-time employees and resident coordinators that assist the Medford Housing Authority with their day-to-day function.

96
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,121
[SPEAKER_17]: As I stated, our maintenance function also works out of Salt and Stall.

97
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:07,663
[SPEAKER_17]: We have about a 15-person full-time maintenance crew.

98
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:18,807
[SPEAKER_17]: And Edgeley Hall, which is the Medford Housing Authority's largest community center, is also located at 121 Riverside Ave.

99
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:26,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Not only serves our residents, it serves other Medford Housing Authority residents within our portfolio and also the greater community.

100
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:29,303
[SPEAKER_17]: It gets a lot of use.

101
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:40,692
[SPEAKER_17]: We hold things from flu clinics, like I said, not only for our residents, but for the greater Medford community, COVID clinics, food programs, exercise classes.

102
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:43,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a very busy building.

103
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,735
[SPEAKER_17]: It gets a lot of use.

104
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:51,260
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I said, the community room serves a great function to our residents and also the greater Medford community.

105
00:08:54,802 --> 00:09:02,449
[SPEAKER_17]: So the current building conditions, as you can see in these pictures, the building from far away looks okay.

106
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,572
[SPEAKER_17]: But when you get up close, it's far from okay.

107
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:11,997
[SPEAKER_17]: So as you can see in these pictures, the majority of the brick is scaled and pitted.

108
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:19,063
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had to vacate several units because of severe water intrusion.

109
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:24,126
[SPEAKER_17]: So the building's structural beams need to be reinforced.

110
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:29,907
[SPEAKER_17]: The exterior masonry wall, as we say, is severely deficient, has cracks and leaks.

111
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,249
[SPEAKER_17]: The ventilation system is poor.

112
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,710
[SPEAKER_17]: The plumbing and electrical is all original to the building.

113
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:44,966
[SPEAKER_17]: The fire protection systems are not functioning properly and need to be upgraded to just get up to today's code, to be code compliant.

114
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:52,972
[SPEAKER_17]: The unit bathrooms, they have bathtubs in them, which are not great for accessibility for elderly disabled people.

115
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And the kitchen's in poor condition and they warrant replacement.

116
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:03,626
[SPEAKER_17]: The common area corridors are not properly ventilated, as you stated, and they do not meet ADA requirements.

117
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:09,849
[SPEAKER_17]: And a portion of the units need to be upgraded to become fully ADA accessible and code compliant.

118
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:25,718
[SPEAKER_17]: But with this transformative kind of modernization, all of the units that we're going to be modernizing will be, we're getting rid of the tubs to put the showers so our residents and future residents can age in place better.

119
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,974
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry about the dog.

120
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:33,015
[SPEAKER_17]: So what is proposed?

121
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:41,058
[SPEAKER_17]: So we just signed a guaranteed maximum with our seam at risk contractor for $103.2 million.

122
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:51,882
[SPEAKER_17]: As you can see, we're looking to replace, you know, for it to be transformative, replacing the exterior of the facade with a new building envelope and new windows.

123
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:02,985
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to be modernizing the unit interiors, bathrooms, kitchen finishes, and common spaces, and the replacement of the obsolete plumbing and electrical systems.

124
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:09,048
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're also looking to bring central air conditioning and heating and modernizing the elevators.

125
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:15,912
[SPEAKER_17]: And with new residential amenities, upgrading the community spaces and outdoor roof deck for the residents.

126
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:21,495
[SPEAKER_17]: We're adding fire protection upgrades and installing a fire command center.

127
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:35,131
[SPEAKER_17]: And by messing around with the unit configurations a little bit in the unit layouts, we're gonna be able to add 22 new deeply affordable units within the building.

128
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:42,515
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not adding square footage, but just messing around with the unit configurations, we're gonna be able to go from 200 units to 222 units.

129
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:43,695
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the project timeline.

130
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:55,536
[SPEAKER_17]: So as I stated, we just entered into our GMP with our contractor.

131
00:11:55,957 --> 00:12:03,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Our financial closing is anticipated to happen before the end of January and construction will start soon thereafter.

132
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,540
[SPEAKER_17]: So early February, we are looking to start construction.

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,881
[SPEAKER_17]: With the construction anticipated end date, hopefully May, it'd be June, 2025.

134
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:16,422
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking at a 30 month construction duration.

135
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:22,656
[SPEAKER_17]: And so for our existing residents that are on site, the resident relocation process.

136
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:28,417
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're looking to get up to 70 vacant units during construction.

137
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:30,418
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not going to happen right away.

138
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:34,599
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be a phased ease kind of progression.

139
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,400
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're hoping by maybe the summer or the fall of 2023, we get up to 70 vacant units.

140
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:50,928
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've been working for the last year with our residents on temporary relocation options, and all residents were presented with three options.

141
00:12:51,568 --> 00:13:00,634
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the options is to move within the building, because I stated it's gonna be phased construction, starting from the top of the building and working our way down.

142
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:07,458
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're looking to vacate the top two to three floors to start, and there'll be residents living in the floors below.

143
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:19,976
[SPEAKER_17]: And so there's three options to stay within the building, to move to another MHA elderly disabled property, or to take a mobile Section 8 voucher.

144
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:24,478
[SPEAKER_17]: And all residents have the right to return to self-install when construction is complete.

145
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:29,549
[SPEAKER_17]: And kind of our processes are how we communicate with our residents.

146
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,752
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a variation of methods.

147
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,595
[SPEAKER_17]: We have robocalls that are translated in multiple languages.

148
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,878
[SPEAKER_17]: We send out regular newsletters.

149
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:43,263
[SPEAKER_17]: We have hard copy notices that are also translated that are dropped off at resident stores.

150
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:48,869
[SPEAKER_17]: We have monitors in our lobbies, like large kind of television screen type monitors.

151
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:54,091
[SPEAKER_17]: where we post notices, we update residents, you know, there's just lots of information.

152
00:13:54,151 --> 00:14:05,034
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a screen that scrolls, so the residents are always kept comprised of what's going on, not only in their building, but in other Medford Housing Authority properties and other things going on within the community.

153
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:11,489
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to pass this on now to Steve Sawyer.

154
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:12,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

155
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

156
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Sawyer with GM2.

157
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:23,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, would it be possible, sometimes it's easier for me when I present the site to have control and point and zoom and stuff.

158
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:28,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be okay if I could take over and share my screen or is that a problem?

159
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:30,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, that should work just fine.

160
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:31,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

161
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:31,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Dan?

162
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:32,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, perfect.

163
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:32,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

164
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:41,392
[SPEAKER_08]: All set?

165
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:42,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

166
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

167
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:56,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here's our site, Riverside Ave to the north, Interstate 93 to the east, Mystic River to the south, Clippership Drive, I believe there's an apartment building to the west.

168
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:06,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, the site access is an enter only and exit only, counterclockwise circulation around the site.

169
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:14,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as part of the building improvements, we're going to be reconfiguring the parking and improving the access, the vehicle access on the property.

170
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,510
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to maintain the two curb cuts.

171
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not going to be changed.

172
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:31,302
[SPEAKER_04]: There is currently a front drop-off area that is going to be improved with a tabletop area flush, so it's all flush entering into the building here, ADA compliant with no curb.

173
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:38,749
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also going to be added a 20-foot wide fire lane here in the front.

174
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:46,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a paver surface, so decorative and appealing, but it provides access for fire truck.

175
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:50,041
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a mountable curb here, so the

176
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:57,851
[SPEAKER_04]: normal drivers would know not to drive over it, but it's easily mountable for a fire truck, fire apparatus.

177
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, as far as the parking, the parking now is on the outs.

178
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:03,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It parks to the right.

179
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,003
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be shaving this down a bit.

180
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:06,964
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need the width.

181
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:09,867
[SPEAKER_04]: maintaining parking here.

182
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be centralizing some parking down to the south.

183
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:23,216
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, actually what I did here, you can see in the red, the slight faint red, that's the existing parking and curb line.

184
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:27,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So currently the circulation loops way down towards the river and runs back.

185
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:32,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to tighten that up, keep it tight to the building, better access for fire, more

186
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,746
[SPEAKER_04]: more centralized access to the building.

187
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:41,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We are adding a rear building drop-off area here at that location.

188
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:46,299
[SPEAKER_04]: This large parking field here is existing.

189
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:49,423
[SPEAKER_04]: We are expanding in a couple locations very slightly.

190
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,125
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to change.

191
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:57,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there'll be sidewalk improvements and pedestrian circulation improvements.

192
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:05,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that Curtis will address and Ben and Curtis will address later as far as the overall pedestrian circulation.

193
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And when one of the comments from the engineering was about ADA along Riverside, currently these have tactile and looks like they've been replaced recently.

194
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,031
[SPEAKER_04]: The exit though, those are not compliant.

195
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:25,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be bringing those up, bringing those compliant as part of that project.

196
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:36,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as any of the frontage, any of our frontage that's non-compliant will be working, we'd be making those improvements to bring it in ADA accessible compliance.

197
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:44,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

198
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,250
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't good.

199
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:55,424
[SPEAKER_08]: My, my fingers should say boom.

200
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Just bear with me a second, hopefully it'll come back.

201
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:04,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's not good.

202
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, just bear with me, I'm gonna reboot my Adobe, sorry.

203
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:24,398
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, I can share while you talk.

204
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:25,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

205
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:28,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to get to my next slide.

206
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on a second.

207
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:37,204
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

208
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess that ain't going to work, unfortunately.

209
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, all right.

210
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:47,833
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as far as stormwater, as you can see, so what we're doing here on the property on the.

211
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:55,058
[SPEAKER_04]: On the East side on the East side, I'm sorry on the West side on the entry side, we've pulled the parking back.

212
00:18:55,618 --> 00:19:00,701
[SPEAKER_04]: A bit the edge of payment back currently there's just it's only.

213
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:08,163
[SPEAKER_04]: catch basins at a daisy chain that pretty much fire the water right out into Mystic River untreated.

214
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:15,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're going to do, if you zoom in, you can see that the heavy green is the new drainage.

215
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:20,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're providing new deep sump catch basins along at the entry.

216
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:25,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see there's a new catch basin on the west curb line.

217
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,849
[SPEAKER_04]: The left curb line is a new catch basin.

218
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:44,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're doing is these catch basins will be a deep sump that removes the heavy sediment, and we're tying into the existing drainage as a 15-inch concrete pipe that runs down along the west property line as we work towards the Mystic River.

219
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:54,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So that you'll see if you work down a little further down and see the next catch basin on as you work, work down South work to the South.

220
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:58,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that catch catch base will be offline.

221
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:02,487
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be another catch base and offline deep some for sediment removal.

222
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:14,511
[SPEAKER_04]: At the very end, you'll see there's a, the last structure that's gonna be added will be a, they call it a swirl particle separator.

223
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It's enhanced removal.

224
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:24,877
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be installed prior to the water being discharged to a new, to the swale.

225
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:26,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, that's a paved swale.

226
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,059
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't provide any treatment.

227
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:32,082
[SPEAKER_04]: It just shoots the water right out into Mystic Ave, I mean, into Mystic River.

228
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:33,523
[SPEAKER_04]: untreated.

229
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be a vegetated swale.

230
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:51,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll direct the water into this now, into this bioretention area here, where the water will be held, treated, infiltrated, and then during the larger events, it'll be directed back out to the swale and then into the Mystic River.

231
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:58,427
[SPEAKER_04]: This system is going to be designed, is designed to treat all of the pavement, full treatment for the paved areas.

232
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:18,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, as you're aware, there'll be DCRs working to put a trail along the top of the bank, and we'll be tying in, they're going to be making some improvements where the stormwater ties, where the stormwater flows into the river, we'll be tying into their improvements.

233
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:27,798
[SPEAKER_04]: On the east side, you can see there's another large basin that's going to take the eastern half of the site.

234
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:38,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of that site's all sheet flow, flows over the parking through a swale and then into that basin at the bottom of the site.

235
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:44,867
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be installing a new overflow structure that will convey the water into the Mystic River.

236
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:45,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again,

237
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:59,570
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the paved areas will be removing the full 80% TSS removal and recharge of stormwater back into the ground.

238
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:07,752
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing of note, I think one of the comments that Owen had mentioned was resource areas.

239
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:12,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that you may be aware we're actually in front of the Conservation Commission now.

240
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:17,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So they really delved in detail into the stormwater.

241
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:21,275
[SPEAKER_04]: We did get some comments from conservation.

242
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:23,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We are responding to those comments.

243
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:26,116
[SPEAKER_04]: These systems will be updated.

244
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:32,698
[SPEAKER_04]: These systems will be updated to address their comments.

245
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:34,779
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't change.

246
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they might grow slightly.

247
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, they're going to remain in both of the locations and operate as

248
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,822
[SPEAKER_04]: operate as shown in the intent on this plan.

249
00:22:46,382 --> 00:23:00,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in the comments, Owen, the city engineer, agreed with the approach, but he said prior to building permit, he'd be looking for detailed stormwater calcs, which actually were submitted to the Conservation Commission.

250
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be submitting revised calculations

251
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:14,933
[SPEAKER_04]: probably on Monday, and I'm going to forward him a copy for review so that he'll be reviewed concurrently with the Conservation Commission.

252
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:22,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as the water utility up and off of Riverside, we're going to be providing, you can see the blue

253
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,123
[SPEAKER_04]: there's going to be a new fire and potable water.

254
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:36,507
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the comments was that we couldn't do tapping sleeves.

255
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:41,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Owen asked for a triple gate, that has been added here.

256
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:51,517
[SPEAKER_04]: What it is, you add a gate on the existing line to the left and to the right, so you can isolate if there's issues left or right of our system, the building can stay in service.

257
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:54,279
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the items that Owen had brought up,

258
00:23:54,819 --> 00:24:02,968
[SPEAKER_04]: was providing a looped water system around the entire building for fire service.

259
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,891
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not providing that.

260
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:09,374
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the comments that we disagreed with.

261
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:14,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, there's four hydrants at the front of the building, and there's fire connections all around the building.

262
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:22,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And this design, the access, and the fire connections have been reviewed and vetted by the Medford Fire Department.

263
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're on board, or they're OK with the design as is.

264
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this time, we don't see the need to go through the expense of looping a water line around the entire building.

265
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:39,902
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a tremendous expense that's not necessary at this time.

266
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:44,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I'm trying to keep it brief.

267
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:48,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll stop my presentation now and then take questions at the end.

268
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:50,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

269
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:50,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

270
00:24:51,727 --> 00:24:54,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Next is landscape architect Curtis.

271
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

272
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:08,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So the main sort of landscape interventions here are improving sort of the building entry points.

273
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:16,441
[SPEAKER_05]: creating some amenity space for the residents and as well as the Riverside area.

274
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:22,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll sort of dive into each of these after the overview.

275
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:36,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So overall, the permeability of the site is being increased from 78,000 square feet of permeable area currently to over 80,000.

276
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,701
[SPEAKER_05]: or from 42% of the site area to 43% of the site area.

277
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:53,423
[SPEAKER_05]: We are planting, so we're, of the pervious space, most of it currently is lawn.

278
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:57,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of lawn, and there's some mulch beds.

279
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:04,825
[SPEAKER_05]: There may have been planting in the past, but there's a few sort of scraggly yews that are yew shrubs that are left

280
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:12,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're putting in over 15,000 new square feet of planting beds.

281
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:17,082
[SPEAKER_05]: We're adding 53 trees to the site.

282
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:19,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of these will be beside

283
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:33,388
[SPEAKER_05]: paved surfaces, so we're targeting that heat island effect, and those trees that are adjacent to paved surfaces will have structural soils, so we are going for healthy, large trees that will survive the long term.

284
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:47,697
[SPEAKER_05]: The focusing on the building entries, a lot of the improvements are aimed at accessibility and drainage.

285
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,800
[SPEAKER_05]: The current condition, many of the approaches to the building were not accessible.

286
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,182
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not compliant with, or at least not compliant with ADA or MAAB.

287
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:05,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Either non-compliant slopes or residents have to navigate drive aisles.

288
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:08,050
[SPEAKER_05]: to get to the building entries.

289
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:15,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of the building, the two main building entries at the front and at the back will be flush conditions.

290
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:25,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So residents can be dropped off and they don't have to navigate a curb or even a ramp to get to the door.

291
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:28,752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a flush condition from the drop off to the door.

292
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:34,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, also at these sites, um, you know, that's where we're concentrating our planting.

293
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:45,651
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have, uh, seating for residents, both fixed seating and, um, movable seating, um, or, or sort of tables and chairs.

294
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:51,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we're, we're seeing these sites as maybe opportunities for residents to socialize outside to gather.

295
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:51,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

296
00:27:55,552 --> 00:28:05,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking of gathering, we also have a small sort of resident amenity space adjacent to the Edgeley Hall.

297
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:14,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So the idea is that this sort of community space can open up and still outside, we're gonna have outdoor grills there, some more seating opportunities.

298
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So improvements for residents and users of that space.

299
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to the Riverside area,

300
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:30,183
[SPEAKER_05]: We are moving the bocce courts, which are a city of Medford amenity.

301
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:35,207
[SPEAKER_05]: They are being moved closer to the river.

302
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:40,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna maintain the dedicated parking spots for the bocce courts.

303
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:48,998
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be reconstructed as per the originally constructed size for the courts.

304
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: We are adding seating.

305
00:28:53,452 --> 00:29:05,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we'll offer opportunities for seating around that site where we are concentrating, uh, planting around the bocce courts, some trees to, to get some shade.

306
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:16,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and really we see these bocce courts as we're, we're tying it in to the, the clipper ship connection path along, uh, along the river.

307
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:20,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see it at the site as sort of a node along this path where, um,

308
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:34,779
[SPEAKER_05]: users of the path will hopefully stop and stay and visit the site and use the bocce courts.

309
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:48,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to note that within the 200 foot sort of buffer of the boundary, the vast majority of the

310
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,687
[SPEAKER_05]: planting is native.

311
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:55,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a small clump of hydrangeas that we're not married to.

312
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,612
[SPEAKER_05]: If people have an issue with that, we're happy to change it out.

313
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:05,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the planting there, 95% of the planting is native shrubs and grasses mainly.

314
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I too want to keep it brief.

315
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:13,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to respond to any questions going forwards.

316
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:16,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

317
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:21,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will move to the building with Ben Wilson.

318
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, thanks again for having all of us.

319
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:44,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna address primarily the pedestrian circulation and how we're sort of treating the site and the pedestrian connectivity.

320
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,022
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'll get into some of the exterior envelope issues.

321
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:51,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Next.

322
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:59,049
[SPEAKER_15]: So starting with the site, this is the existing site plan.

323
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:07,935
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to point out a couple of the major obstacles that we came across when we started working on this project.

324
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:09,936
[SPEAKER_15]: almost a year ago.

325
00:31:09,956 --> 00:31:28,410
[SPEAKER_15]: The first issue was really the biggest and most obvious was the access to the maintenance facility that is operating out of this building, which is in that corner, that Northeast corner.

326
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:35,515
[SPEAKER_15]: And all of the access, vehicle access into that area is from this larger paved area to the right.

327
00:31:36,674 --> 00:31:46,761
[SPEAKER_15]: And that created a situation where there's a lot of conflict between traffic and pedestrians coming from any of the parking areas.

328
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:52,765
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that was our first sort of, oh no, what do we do?

329
00:31:52,825 --> 00:32:00,030
[SPEAKER_15]: The second one is at the front of the building, one of the big challenges that Medford Housing

330
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:16,780
[SPEAKER_15]: put in front of us is that this existing drive loop here that looks like and should be a nice functional driveway for drop-off type of access is also the fire lane.

331
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,780
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there was a real conflict.

332
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:28,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time an emergency vehicle comes in here, it would create a backup of traffic circulation and people double parking and all of a sudden it's,

333
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:29,735
[SPEAKER_15]: a log jam.

334
00:32:29,795 --> 00:32:32,356
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was an area we wanted to address.

335
00:32:32,976 --> 00:32:46,361
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the third item that I'll just kind of mention is that the southern portion of the parking that extends out past the botchy courts and creates this loop around sort of an outer loop of parking.

336
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:54,083
[SPEAKER_15]: It was felt that that aspect of the parking one removed vehicles away from the building

337
00:32:54,865 --> 00:33:02,109
[SPEAKER_15]: but it also creates a buffer between the residents and the waterfront amenity.

338
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:09,294
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're trying to create more of an expansion of the site outward that way, that direction.

339
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:20,480
[SPEAKER_15]: So moving to our proposed plan, addressing the maintenance vehicle problem, that was easy.

340
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,122
[SPEAKER_15]: We convinced the housing authority to

341
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,407
[SPEAKER_15]: move their maintenance department somewhere else.

342
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:46,438
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was a relatively simple fix, and that the space that was the full maintenance department is now mechanical equipment and a smaller building specific maintenance, which accesses off of the driveway instead of the pedestrian area.

343
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,100
[SPEAKER_15]: The parking is all now,

344
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:58,423
[SPEAKER_15]: circulating so that it feeds to identifiable walkways.

345
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:19,035
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the other problems from the original plan is there was no very clearly defined, unless they really painted out pathways, but there was a lot of sort of open no man's land of asphalt, and we're trying to create more of a identifiable circulation that really could be more functional.

346
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:31,349
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see Steven mentioned the passage past the west side of the building where we've flipped the driveway and the parking.

347
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,790
[SPEAKER_15]: So now the parking is on the building side of the drive aisle.

348
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:40,711
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is also the area where there's an entry into the administrative wing.

349
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:42,392
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see in that corner.

350
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:51,261
[SPEAKER_15]: So their administrative offices are accessed from that point and the parking then serves for that sort of dual purpose.

351
00:34:52,201 --> 00:35:06,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Another sort of simple benefit that we gained out of the parking modifications is that the nine spaces that correspond with the botchy courts are actually adjacent to the botchy courts instead of across the drive while.

352
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:10,969
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're kind of trying to get things to be more defined and isolated.

353
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:35,410
[SPEAKER_15]: The two entry areas of the building, we really do have sort of a double entrance on this building and they're connected on the inside of the building through the lobby space, but the entry from the north, we're trying to reduce to bus traffic and foot traffic from town, as well as the use of Uber and drop-offs.

354
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:50,444
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we've emphasized on the south side of the building, a more resident oriented, this is where your front door is as a resident using, that has vehicle access.

355
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:59,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Another drop off was mentioned by both Steven and Curtis, the flush paving tabletop access to it.

356
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:01,072
[SPEAKER_15]: And

357
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:15,338
[SPEAKER_15]: The last thing I'll comment on in terms of circulation and pedestrian flow is the connection from the public right-of-way to the right-of-way of the riverfront.

358
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:42,144
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've maintained a sort of a continuous walkway surface that on the east side of the building, there were dense pointing, that access, and it's a nice wide, very public kind of sidewalk that accesses from the public right-of-way of Riverside Drive Avenue to the past the bocce courts and to the Clippership Trail.

359
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:52,632
[SPEAKER_15]: with a couple of separate spurs to try and tie in some additional options as walkers might prefer.

360
00:36:53,552 --> 00:36:59,313
[SPEAKER_15]: So pedestrian-wise, I think that's really where we tried to target it.

361
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:12,636
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just a slightly different view, giving you a sense of the resident entry area with the drop-off and the maintenance buildings, and you can see it kind of projects out into that space.

362
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:22,430
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we really been able to, and the current maintenance use of that building with the beam being specific to the building will be quite light.

363
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:31,675
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, you know, the circulation of the parking can channel on sidewalk and a simple crosswalk into the building area.

364
00:37:33,736 --> 00:37:42,582
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think next slide, this slide is really just the ground level of the building to show you how the two different entries

365
00:37:43,461 --> 00:38:00,233
[SPEAKER_15]: the South side and the North side really sort of tied together into a common space, trying to sort of bring that outdoor public sense or community sense into that center area of the building in the elevator and mail area.

366
00:38:00,993 --> 00:38:16,584
[SPEAKER_15]: And the South wing on that you can see is the Edgerly Hall spaces that are multi-use type of spaces that's quite a large space and has a fairly significant capacity.

367
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:20,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And before you go, Dan, I'll just quickly comment on the parking.

368
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:23,629
[SPEAKER_15]: We started with 153 parking spaces and the

369
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:31,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a breakdown in the presentation here.

370
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:36,438
[SPEAKER_15]: of what was resident, what's office.

371
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:41,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So existing, we had 70 resident users, 27 visitors.

372
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,641
[SPEAKER_15]: The bocce courts were a lot of nine spaces.

373
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:49,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Office and business for the building itself was eight spaces.

374
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:57,785
[SPEAKER_15]: And then staff for the Medford Housing Authority was 33 spaces and that left nine unassigned spaces.

375
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,253
[SPEAKER_15]: And of all of those, 12 of those are accessible.

376
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:15,423
[SPEAKER_15]: So moving to the new, and was I just reading the new plan, we actually picked up a few parking spaces by some more efficient use of area and everything.

377
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:18,665
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're up by seven parking spaces.

378
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:23,669
[SPEAKER_15]: But as was mentioned, we're adding 22 units to the building.

379
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:26,171
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're adding 22 apartments at a 0.5,

380
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:34,334
[SPEAKER_15]: ratio, we are looking to add 11 spaces required.

381
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:49,029
[SPEAKER_15]: So what that does is it reduced, well, we maintain the 70 listed here because that's the number of residents that actually have the vehicles that are

382
00:39:49,949 --> 00:40:02,853
[SPEAKER_15]: being driven at the time, but the code required spaces, we're about six spaces over what's required by code at this point.

383
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:12,976
[SPEAKER_15]: So moving on from the plan, I think we can address other pedestrian questions that you may have.

384
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,697
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I covered the main points.

385
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:25,772
[SPEAKER_15]: There were a number of questions related to how we approach the exterior of the building, the envelope modernization.

386
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:28,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Go on to the first slides.

387
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:36,516
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'll start with here is just kind of a recap of the challenges.

388
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:38,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there was a couple of comments made about

389
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:42,870
[SPEAKER_15]: thinking that the condition of the building was really pretty good.

390
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:54,198
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we got into the project, there's some significant issues of, we knew there were problems with water and sometimes that can be pretty easily addressed.

391
00:40:54,739 --> 00:41:02,865
[SPEAKER_15]: But the extent of the water problems is pretty dramatic.

392
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:04,426
[SPEAKER_15]: There are areas that are,

393
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:15,969
[SPEAKER_15]: water is penetrating through into the structure and energy wise is really quite a very inefficient system.

394
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:27,293
[SPEAKER_15]: The water penetration has been such a long lasting problem here that we've created some pretty serious structural

395
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:34,624
[SPEAKER_15]: issues of corrosion in particular related to the balconies.

396
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:54,317
[SPEAKER_15]: The framing members from the balconies, which were structurally actually undersized to begin with, have actually been in some cases reduced by 20% in terms of steel thickness, just from corrosion related issues.

397
00:41:55,755 --> 00:42:00,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Water is penetrating in through the concrete systems and right into the floor areas.

398
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:18,062
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other aspect of the envelope that we have determined our strategy here is to remove all of the brick masonry infill, or most of the brick masonry infill, also conditioned.

399
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:25,168
[SPEAKER_15]: But in terms of the upper floors of the towers, we'll be removing almost all of that brick infill.

400
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:37,243
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason that we're doing that, rather than trying to repair and patch and protect, is that structurally the masonry walls were not reinforced.

401
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:44,785
[SPEAKER_15]: and they were not connected to the structural frame of the building, the concrete beams that are exposed on the outsides.

402
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:57,068
[SPEAKER_15]: So that deficiency essentially makes the masonry walls non-functional structurally from a structural design standpoint.

403
00:42:57,668 --> 00:43:06,910
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to go into the building and actually add brace framing to accommodate the requirements of the current code and the new loads.

404
00:43:07,928 --> 00:43:14,206
[SPEAKER_15]: that we are also removing that all of that masonry from a standpoint of

405
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:16,933
[SPEAKER_15]: making a much more effective envelope.

406
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:20,235
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's really some benefits in doing that.

407
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:30,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And we removed the balconies because the cost of replacing them, which would be what would be required is way outside of our reach of our budget.

408
00:43:31,582 --> 00:43:42,249
[SPEAKER_15]: So the building design, the way we've approached this is we're proposing a fiber cement panel system that's on a rain screen.

409
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:56,075
[SPEAKER_15]: And what that means is that there's a framing system attached to the building, the wall substrate, and there's a waterproofing barrier and the insulation is applied outside of that waterproofing barrier.

410
00:43:56,956 --> 00:44:06,845
[SPEAKER_15]: And what that does is it allows the building to be insulated in a continuous way and without thermal bridges and whatnot.

411
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:12,661
[SPEAKER_15]: and the system drains and ventilates itself.

412
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:20,627
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're essentially, we're adding about five or six inches of wall material to the outside face of the building.

413
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:25,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we are referring to as a rain screen.

414
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:34,098
[SPEAKER_15]: And the panel system is, you may be familiar with fiber cement panels that are made more locally

415
00:44:35,478 --> 00:44:44,465
[SPEAKER_15]: by the name of, I won't use any names actually, that could get me in trouble, but there are low grades of fiber cement panel and there are high grades.

416
00:44:44,545 --> 00:44:52,110
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we're dealing with is what's considered a high density through body color fiber cement panel.

417
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So the panel has the coloration through the entire panel.

418
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:02,317
[SPEAKER_15]: And the intent is that it's a much higher grade

419
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:14,717
[SPEAKER_15]: longer lasting durable panel that can really can withstand the weather exposure of this environment here with a 12 to 11 story building as it is.

420
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:30,570
[SPEAKER_15]: And the effort and some cost savings in the project and in dealing with the design that we have, the end walls of the big wide design, we have gone to an EFA system and

421
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:45,737
[SPEAKER_15]: quite often the Ephesus is kind of frowned upon, but the beauty of it is that it really works almost exactly like that rain screen, except the water protection is a little better off on the exterior.

422
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:50,138
[SPEAKER_15]: It still drains and it's still the same kind of insulation system.

423
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:52,599
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not a flammable foam.

424
00:45:53,298 --> 00:46:00,405
[SPEAKER_15]: like many people have seen EFIS applied on, but it's a mineral wool type of system.

425
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:06,972
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're doing is really using the more costly panel system and the rain screen

426
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:11,155
[SPEAKER_15]: around where all the windows are on all faces of the building.

427
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:27,010
[SPEAKER_15]: And then sort of using a cut section or a cap at the ends of the wires with this larger panel, you know, larger scale kind of panel on the ends, it's Ephus.

428
00:46:27,632 --> 00:46:36,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And then at the base, when that all comes down to the base, the base is where we're treating as more of a monolithic, different treatment of panels.

429
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:51,462
[SPEAKER_15]: So the detail of the panels breaks down into larger, as you would call a rusticated aspect of scale at the grade level.

430
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:54,003
[SPEAKER_15]: So working with joints, with panel joints,

431
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:05,175
[SPEAKER_15]: that are more related to the openings of the walls and the scale of that first floor level, which is a little taller.

432
00:47:07,216 --> 00:47:15,601
[SPEAKER_15]: So the general concept then is that the detail and the pattern is contained on the window walls.

433
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:17,141
[SPEAKER_15]: They wrap the corners.

434
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:21,804
[SPEAKER_15]: You have these corner windows that alternate floors.

435
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,191
[SPEAKER_15]: and give it sort of a variety of scales.

436
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:31,092
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think I'll stop here.

437
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:37,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I've probably talked too much already, but we can answer questions as they come on this.

438
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:46,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at the very end, we have received multiple questions

439
00:47:48,237 --> 00:47:54,986
[SPEAKER_03]: response or agency comments and questions we have tried to sort of address them here.

440
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:57,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll very quickly go through.

441
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,812
[SPEAKER_03]: We have received comments from the fire department.

442
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:02,896
[SPEAKER_03]: We have received comments from the engineering division.

443
00:48:03,977 --> 00:48:10,924
[SPEAKER_03]: the Health Department and Medford, the Housing Planning CPA Coordinator, as well as Historic.

444
00:48:11,464 --> 00:48:17,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as we've categorized the questions on the left, we have provided responses rather than going in.

445
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,911
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at, you know, 6.54 today.

446
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:20,312
[SPEAKER_03]: The gist is that we have

447
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:33,624
[SPEAKER_03]: The project is meeting, if not, and are well aware of what is all the constituents requirements at this project.

448
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:39,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're happy to jump in and answer any questions, the team, full teams here tonight.

449
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,591
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

450
00:48:58,642 --> 00:49:03,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will open up to any questions from the board here.

451
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:05,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

452
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:16,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Ordinarily, we'll go to city staff, if there are any city staff in attendance tonight who would like to post questions or comment on the development.

453
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:25,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, anyone in the queue for us tonight?

454
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:26,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

455
00:49:27,858 --> 00:49:28,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that I'm aware of.

456
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have a public comment time.

457
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:35,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get there.

458
00:49:35,884 --> 00:49:44,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that a board member would like to say or ask just just to clarify from a big picture point of view or can we see what the public has to say.

459
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:50,975
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Amanda Do we have some members of the public would like to speak tonight.

460
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:56,327
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm pulling up our inbox to check.

461
00:49:56,507 --> 00:50:05,477
[SPEAKER_14]: But if anyone is here tonight who would like to speak, feel free to use the raise your hand function or put a note in the comments.

462
00:50:05,557 --> 00:50:07,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to call on you.

463
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:13,066
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just going to give folks one minute to do that while I check our inbox for any messages.

464
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:31,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And while she's doing that, I'll read the email address of ocd at medford-ma.gov would be the one to use if you'd like to send a quick email, which we would read and have as part of the record if you send one to Amanda now.

465
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:38,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, so I'm not seeing any messages yet and I'll let you guys know if that changes.

466
00:50:38,776 --> 00:50:42,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also not seeing any hands or notes in the comments.

467
00:50:45,715 --> 00:50:51,621
[SPEAKER_13]: While you're doing that, I don't believe that we have received that response document from the MHA.

468
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:56,465
[SPEAKER_13]: So the board members, I mean, you put it up on the screen, but the board hasn't seen any of your responses.

469
00:50:58,227 --> 00:51:00,970
[SPEAKER_13]: We would love it if you could send that over to us.

470
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:03,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll speak for the team.

471
00:51:04,075 --> 00:51:22,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the intent tonight was to gather any comments that was going to be presented here and to hear your thoughts and then have a comprehensive response and then send over to Medford in terms of whether there's any additional questions that came from tonight's presentation.

472
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:29,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, any updates there?

473
00:51:32,395 --> 00:51:34,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, we're all clear.

474
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:35,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

475
00:51:37,096 --> 00:51:46,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go forward then and open it up to a board members who would like to start things off with some questions for the team tonight.

476
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would like to go first.

477
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:55,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I can go.

478
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:56,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

479
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:00,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your presentation tonight.

480
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:07,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems like a nice project to upgrade this building.

481
00:52:08,653 --> 00:52:10,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have, I don't have much to say.

482
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:18,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I read the memo from the historic commission.

483
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:27,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously, I sort of agree with what they're saying nobody really wants to do Ephesus.

484
00:52:29,577 --> 00:52:31,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a little unfortunate.

485
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:46,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, I think your concept of using it in non sort of conspicuous locations is a good one.

486
00:52:47,682 --> 00:52:57,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I would question whether the short ends of the building which have are the best locations for that

487
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:14,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I was also wondering, we didn't get too much into the plans, but it seems like all the exterior balconies are gonna be removed, and in place of those, there'll just be a blank wall, which happens to be the walls where the APHIS is going.

488
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:18,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe you can talk about that a little bit.

489
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:23,107
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing sort of regarding the facade is I see you put pretty,

490
00:53:24,762 --> 00:53:28,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a little bit of a. Elaborate pattern on facade, which I think, um.

491
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:30,164
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, has some visual interest.

492
00:53:30,425 --> 00:53:33,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I I'd actually like you maybe just say a few words about.

493
00:53:34,947 --> 00:53:36,527
[SPEAKER_07]: The concept behind that.

494
00:53:37,168 --> 00:53:41,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and then just maybe one further comment on that.

495
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,430
[SPEAKER_07]: About.

496
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Color sort of seems like you're

497
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:05,986
[SPEAKER_07]: visually have any kind of problem with, but having lived that close to Route 93 for almost 20 years, I can tell you that the building is gonna get filthy.

498
00:54:07,806 --> 00:54:11,728
[SPEAKER_07]: And that color will not stay that color.

499
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:16,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So white seems like an odd choice to me, that close to the highway.

500
00:54:19,712 --> 00:54:21,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I think,

501
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:24,278
[SPEAKER_07]: The landscape plan seems really nice.

502
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:41,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if the connections to the bike path or the future bike path or river path could be maybe a little more deliberate.

503
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:46,631
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do thank you for sort of highlighting those.

504
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:49,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the bocce court is a great solution.

505
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:53,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

506
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:54,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too much.

507
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:55,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

508
00:54:58,732 --> 00:54:59,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

509
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:02,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben, you want to take the comments on the facade?

510
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:08,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, maybe you could share the elevation sheets.

511
00:55:14,242 --> 00:55:16,904
[SPEAKER_15]: And I appreciate your comments.

512
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,765
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you're right.

513
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:21,827
[SPEAKER_15]: We all kind of cringe at the idea of the aethos, but it was

514
00:55:23,511 --> 00:55:31,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, we had a pretty, pretty serious budget challenge when we, when we got to, uh, close to the end of design here.

515
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:39,063
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, we found ourselves in really, really struggling to get the project within budget.

516
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:43,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, as you know, the bid market right now is really quite.

517
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Unpredictable and kind of crazy.

518
00:55:46,548 --> 00:55:51,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so I'll just, I'll comment on the, on the.

519
00:55:52,178 --> 00:55:54,299
[SPEAKER_15]: end wall concept, it does change.

520
00:55:56,461 --> 00:56:06,507
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing we didn't try to do is be true or attempt to replicate that existing building in its form and design.

521
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:16,194
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very much of a clear grid and frame, frame and infill type of high rise now.

522
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:18,235
[SPEAKER_15]: And we really sort of stepped back from that

523
00:56:18,968 --> 00:56:28,533
[SPEAKER_15]: And in losing the balconies, it was a change in that quality.

524
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:48,242
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think what we're proposing on these end walls, the idea is that each of these corner apartments, we're trying to maintain a pretty consistent quantity of window exposure for each apartment.

525
00:56:48,841 --> 00:57:01,046
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, and we have this wraparound window on every other floor and that sort of helps kind of make it makes a scale transition as you come around the end of the building.

526
00:57:01,646 --> 00:57:13,151
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the panels increase in size and the sense of floor to floor scale changes because of that every other floor strategy.

527
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:16,853
[SPEAKER_15]: And the apartments that don't have that wraparound corner

528
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,576
[SPEAKER_15]: they get a kitchen window.

529
00:57:20,256 --> 00:57:31,061
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's sort of this trade-off, but we're trying to keep the sort of democratic fairness of what individual apartments have as an amenity.

530
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:42,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, we lost that balcony texture on the ends, and we're sort of treating it in a, taking a different strategy on how it works.

531
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:49,415
[SPEAKER_15]: The, I'll say a little more about the APHIS on the ground floor.

532
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:53,337
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we did, because that was also another fairly large area.

533
00:57:53,757 --> 00:57:59,439
[SPEAKER_15]: We could apply it to the existing masonry and it's not 12 stories in the sky.

534
00:57:59,499 --> 00:58:05,401
[SPEAKER_15]: So it may not, we don't have to worry about the seismic stability of that masonry.

535
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:07,842
[SPEAKER_15]: So we utilized that masonry for

536
00:58:08,462 --> 00:58:16,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and, uh, you know, we have a, uh, if it's application as well, and the again the idea of the panels, the sense of the panels being larger.

537
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:24,655
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, sort of, you know, we have a steel base to it so that the grade level is pretty well protected.

538
00:58:25,396 --> 00:58:26,036
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um.

539
00:58:27,858 --> 00:58:31,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm I'm quite comfortable with the with how it can

540
00:58:38,698 --> 00:58:59,576
[SPEAKER_15]: And one thing, just as an add, that detailed panel work that we're playing with, we are also applying to the fascias of the two entries, front and back, as well as this on the left-hand side there, Dan, can you point to that?

541
00:59:00,857 --> 00:59:06,742
[SPEAKER_15]: The mechanical space on the left, over at the left, south end, no, the south end of the building.

542
00:59:08,073 --> 00:59:10,793
[SPEAKER_15]: these mechanical screens that are shown here.

543
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:27,096
[SPEAKER_15]: And in this image here, they haven't been completely modeled, but we sort of use that detail of the window facade to create these screens that are a little more of a, you know, it's a decoration, if you will.

544
00:59:27,717 --> 00:59:35,558
[SPEAKER_15]: And then around the front side of the building, the same thing with the screen that screens the trash enclosure.

545
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:52,298
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd also have sort of that, and in this rendering, again, it's not complete, it doesn't have the detail, but it would have the color and patterning translate more from the window walls down to that panel.

546
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:56,940
[SPEAKER_15]: So it sort of identifies, in this case, identifies more of the entry of the building.

547
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,862
[SPEAKER_15]: From the other side, it identifies the sweep around the end of the building.

548
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:34,438
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's kind of key to the, and one other comment is that the front facade that you see underneath on the right-hand side, which is the front exposure of the administration area, actually, that is also fiber cement so that you have that sort of finished quality of the fiber cement carrying across that whole front facade, and you don't have the ephus at your,

549
01:00:35,222 --> 01:00:35,822
[SPEAKER_15]: at your hand.

550
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:41,303
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can go back to, Dan, I'm sorry, one more comment.

551
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:46,664
[SPEAKER_15]: If you go back to that first axiometric you had from the back.

552
01:00:48,365 --> 01:00:59,187
[SPEAKER_15]: The other comment I just wanted to put out there is that what we have done is also now the, go back to the other side, southeast side.

553
01:00:59,287 --> 01:01:02,248
[SPEAKER_15]: We added, no, southeast, that one right there.

554
01:01:03,983 --> 01:01:09,126
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a roof terrace, a common area roof deck on the second floor.

555
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:17,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've expanded the common area of the second floor lobby space with an adjacent laundry room.

556
01:01:17,229 --> 01:01:23,212
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there's more of a community area at the second floor level that spills out onto this roof deck.

557
01:01:23,952 --> 01:01:28,815
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we found in a couple of recently completed projects is that the residents

558
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:32,727
[SPEAKER_15]: a real valuable space to the residents because it is private.

559
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:52,678
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of a gesture in replacement of their loss of their own balconies, but it is something that does get used and it is part of their community as opposed to something at grade that maybe feels a little less protected.

560
01:01:59,898 --> 01:02:03,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I got all of your answers, Klaus.

561
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:06,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think you did.

562
01:02:06,882 --> 01:02:10,204
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the color class?

563
01:02:10,224 --> 01:02:11,065
[SPEAKER_07]: You brought up the color.

564
01:02:11,785 --> 01:02:12,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

565
01:02:12,826 --> 01:02:23,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the color, I think in a couple of those renderings, it's lighter than the actual materials that we have selected.

566
01:02:23,593 --> 01:02:26,594
[SPEAKER_15]: I think these elevations are a little closer.

567
01:02:27,515 --> 01:02:28,936
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a combination of grays.

568
01:02:29,644 --> 01:02:33,665
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're working on the color still right now.

569
01:02:34,205 --> 01:02:43,148
[SPEAKER_15]: And to some degree, we're under a little bit of mercy of the manufacturer that's ultimately provided by the bidder.

570
01:02:43,168 --> 01:02:48,790
[SPEAKER_15]: And being a public bid, we have that little bit of lack of control on that.

571
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:52,371
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're working on that color selection.

572
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:58,453
[SPEAKER_15]: But the idea is that there's some reference to the brick of the neighborhood and the adjacent buildings.

573
01:02:59,329 --> 01:03:03,653
[SPEAKER_15]: and a sort of more of a richness in the pattern.

574
01:03:04,153 --> 01:03:16,124
[SPEAKER_15]: And in this elevation, it really doesn't show the darker of the grays we're pushing to get something that's really quite, actually the sill of the big windows is a fairly dark band.

575
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:24,110
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're gonna work more of that darker tone into the full pattern so that there's, it gives a little more richness and almost effective shadow.

576
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:25,011
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

577
01:03:28,107 --> 01:03:29,967
[SPEAKER_15]: there are some bugs.

578
01:03:29,987 --> 01:03:35,729
[SPEAKER_15]: We're still finishing on the color and the pattern, getting the costs and everything in line.

579
01:03:35,749 --> 01:03:40,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

580
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:53,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess my only follow-up comment is, you know, before I asked the question, I was sort of under the impression that the ephus was going sort of on the ends and then maybe on those inside corners.

581
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:57,163
[SPEAKER_07]: seems really risky to do it at the ground floor.

582
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to get destroyed.

583
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:09,430
[SPEAKER_07]: But I suppose that's MHA's maintenance problem going forward.

584
01:04:11,511 --> 01:04:23,198
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, and I just encourage you to keep looking at the color because I suppose you mentioned why you're removing the balconies.

585
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:48,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you're as unhappy about that move as, as I am, because it's, it seems like it was a really nice amenity I'm looking at, you know, street view of the image and it does seem like there are those balconies are fairly well used with furniture and plants and things and I just beyond the functional and.

586
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:56,212
[SPEAKER_07]: use of those for the residents.

587
01:04:57,132 --> 01:05:13,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I worry that their removal is gonna really flatten that building to a point that it's gonna be pretty conspicuously flat and uninteresting.

588
01:05:13,783 --> 01:05:20,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, I would just ask you to just keep thinking about that, maybe think about maybe some sort

589
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:46,872
[SPEAKER_07]: expanded patterning and neafness areas that may sort of add to the complexity and the look of those ends, because obviously those, you know, without the multicolored panels, those ends are going to be very flat and they have those tiny little windows, which are obviously either kitchen or bathroom windows.

590
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:49,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

591
01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:51,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

592
01:05:53,235 --> 01:06:04,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I just jump in and ask a couple of questions I think there are relevant to places and that's operable windows is there a chance for some fresh air in the units in lieu of having a balcony.

593
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:14,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yes, they all have the apartments would have, I guess, for four to five operable windows.

594
01:06:16,457 --> 01:06:34,391
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have been using a awning or casement tilt out that has a very simple mechanism that elderly people can operate that gives them a full four inch opening that's controlled, but is quite effective.

595
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:42,357
[SPEAKER_15]: And the windows are, there's a fair amount of an increase of glass area as well.

596
01:06:44,177 --> 01:07:09,239
[SPEAKER_15]: all of the, even the bedrooms are larger windows, but the kitchen and what was, what's replacing what was a kitchen door, solid kitchen door and a window the same size as the bedroom window is now a rather dramatic improvement of a large almost picture window with some operable windows up and down, you know,

597
01:07:09,737 --> 01:07:12,299
[SPEAKER_15]: down to 18 inches from the floor with a large sill.

598
01:07:12,899 --> 01:07:28,069
[SPEAKER_15]: So our strategy, we've been in situations with other projects where we had to get rid of balconies, in some cases infilling balconies that were recessed and other cases where they're projecting.

599
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:43,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, when we are in that situation, the goal is to give extensive daylight and extensive airflow, because ultimately that's what most of these people want from their balcony.

600
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:47,112
[SPEAKER_15]: And the results have been pretty positive.

601
01:07:47,975 --> 01:08:06,779
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's hard to lose balconies, but I think if you are in the design world, you can also understand all of the thermal and waterproofing issues that are constantly a problem with balconies.

602
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,800
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're at this stage with this building now because of that.

603
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:17,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, that's what, you know, these balconies have gotten to the point where they are so bad that

604
01:08:18,213 --> 01:08:24,687
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, they started off questionable and now they're really at risk.

605
01:08:24,707 --> 01:08:29,457
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think this is a wise move in the end.

606
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:32,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that information.

607
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:37,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in what class was saying, part of the historical commission as well.

608
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:39,914
[SPEAKER_02]: The first floor.

609
01:08:41,555 --> 01:08:50,481
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been showing us a picture of the large building and we don't usually see buildings this large in our board meetings but it will focus on the color on the upper floors.

610
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:57,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen, I think I've seen different renderings of what the first floor is going to feel like to the pedestrian on the ground.

611
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:10,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of give us the one that's most realistic or just give us a shot with that or no, is that not possible?

612
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:14,121
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little bit of a challenge because of where our

613
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:24,107
[SPEAKER_15]: our renderings, you know, what we were doing was doing nice renderings back when we were in sort of schematic and DD.

614
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:28,930
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the time we got to the CDs and working through value engineering, we

615
01:09:29,489 --> 01:09:33,191
[SPEAKER_15]: we're finding ourselves at a loss for good rendering.

616
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:41,554
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'll say is that I think, you know, Dan, maybe you could pull up the Axon images.

617
01:09:42,575 --> 01:09:46,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are probably the best to speak to.

618
01:09:46,396 --> 01:09:51,478
[SPEAKER_15]: We had hoped to be able to expand the,

619
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,967
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the east side of Edgerly Hall, which is sort of attached to the resident entrance?

620
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:06,378
[SPEAKER_15]: We had hoped to expand that and create more of an arcade along the side of the building.

621
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:11,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just, we didn't have the funds to do that.

622
01:10:11,401 --> 01:10:18,224
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you go to the East side, I think that's the other side there.

623
01:10:18,644 --> 01:10:19,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're right there.

624
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:29,590
[SPEAKER_15]: So in lieu of that, we've been working with the access of the windows along these

625
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:34,844
[SPEAKER_15]: these lower levels that are exposed to streets.

626
01:10:34,904 --> 01:10:47,990
[SPEAKER_15]: We're also trying to reuse the existing window openings on the ground floor because those windows were put in quite recently and serve the functions that they're serving quite well.

627
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:51,391
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're kind of working within that framework.

628
01:10:53,412 --> 01:10:58,895
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of what you're seeing in these images are,

629
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:24,108
[SPEAKER_15]: a little bit harsh because there's no reference to the site, but there's really just a few pathways that go into these active areas with, for instance, this east wall here, there's really just two doorways that are serving Edgerly Hall that have access to them, and then that's landscaping on either side.

630
01:11:24,128 --> 01:11:24,168
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

631
01:11:27,002 --> 01:11:38,886
[SPEAKER_15]: we're trying to sort of buffer some of the aphid surfaces that have human direct contact potential.

632
01:11:38,987 --> 01:11:51,931
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think if you go to the west side, Dan, I'm not sure if I'm answering your questions very well, but the entry around the,

633
01:11:54,218 --> 01:11:56,899
[SPEAKER_15]: around the west side, Dan, the other one.

634
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,140
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there you go.

635
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:10,102
[SPEAKER_15]: The area around the, this is the administrative wing entry.

636
01:12:10,862 --> 01:12:15,203
[SPEAKER_15]: And that area there, that box around that, that would be fiber cement mill.

637
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:20,564
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're kind of pushing where the people are coming closest to the building, which is the doorknob.

638
01:12:21,286 --> 01:12:25,591
[SPEAKER_15]: pushing the aphids away from those spots as much as we can.

639
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:30,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was at least one that had some red.

640
01:12:32,518 --> 01:12:43,209
[SPEAKER_15]: I purposely pulled that back because that color was an earlier scheme that I apologize, we didn't have that updated.

641
01:12:44,242 --> 01:12:44,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

642
01:12:44,762 --> 01:12:55,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so again, back to Dr. Kleist's comment, we're really working through those color issues and the APHIS because that was the last transition we had to make is the last color selection we're making.

643
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:57,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

644
01:12:57,489 --> 01:12:58,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, is it paintable?

645
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:02,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, it does have different color treatments, does it not?

646
01:13:02,853 --> 01:13:03,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

647
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:03,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

648
01:13:03,653 --> 01:13:07,095
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, it's effectively a very heavy

649
01:13:07,821 --> 01:13:10,343
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, paint surface.

650
01:13:11,784 --> 01:13:22,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Our intent with these large surfaces, and this may address some of the issue of these, we were, you know, we're architects, we like big flat, you know, monolithic shapes and forms and stuff like that.

651
01:13:23,352 --> 01:13:31,378
[SPEAKER_15]: So these end walls, what we were conceiving is that there'd be just very subtle changes of tone

652
01:13:33,224 --> 01:13:36,886
[SPEAKER_15]: of the same color throughout all of the IFAS panel.

653
01:13:37,487 --> 01:13:47,754
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a little bit of a variegation or, you know, float in the color between panel to panel.

654
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:57,520
[SPEAKER_15]: And one that helps facilitate if you do have to do repair work, you don't, you know, you're not having spots everywhere.

655
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,063
[SPEAKER_15]: And secondly, I think it creates this kind of an interesting

656
01:14:03,143 --> 01:14:10,248
[SPEAKER_15]: tonal quality to a big surface like that.

657
01:14:10,328 --> 01:14:13,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Other board members have questions they'd like to pose to the group.

658
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:25,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Chair, could I pause for a second because I see we have a hand raised from a member of the public, Roberta Cameron.

659
01:14:25,418 --> 01:14:28,380
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering if you felt like now was a good time.

660
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:29,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

661
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:34,841
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, Roberta, if you'd like to speak, share your name and address for the record.

662
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:45,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Roberta Cameron, and I'm at 12 North Street, and I'm here representing the Community Preservation Committee as chair of Community Preservation Committee.

663
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:50,126
[SPEAKER_12]: We have funded- Welcome.

664
01:14:50,707 --> 01:14:50,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes?

665
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:51,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

666
01:14:52,307 --> 01:14:53,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, thank you, thank you.

667
01:14:54,268 --> 01:15:00,271
[SPEAKER_12]: So Community Preservation Committee has a couple of concerns about this site.

668
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:04,033
[SPEAKER_12]: We have in the past funded two projects.

669
01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:10,225
[SPEAKER_12]: that are on the property of the site.

670
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:18,054
[SPEAKER_12]: One was the creation of the bocce courts, and the other was, what was the name of the project?

671
01:15:18,134 --> 01:15:21,538
[SPEAKER_12]: It was stormwater improvements to,

672
01:15:25,575 --> 01:15:35,781
[SPEAKER_12]: to design stormwater improvements that would improve the quality of the water that's being sent into the river from the site.

673
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:51,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's my understanding that the design of the site plan for this, the design of the parking is going to interfere with both of the projects that the city has funded in the past.

674
01:15:54,182 --> 01:16:04,679
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanted to see to suggest that we should be looking for ways that we can avoid the

675
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:30,077
[SPEAKER_12]: the destruction of either of these assets that we've invested city money in to date to avoid having to move the bocce court or remove the bocce court and to preserve the area that is under the auspices of that study for stormwater improvements.

676
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:36,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And that in order to do that would require a change in the parking

677
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:39,984
[SPEAKER_12]: area that has been designed.

678
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:50,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know whether a reduction in parking could solve this or if there's any other way that parking could be oriented on the site.

679
01:16:51,667 --> 01:17:03,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly, if there's the possibility that not as much parking as has been designed for is needed to serve the site, that it would be preferable to

680
01:17:06,115 --> 01:17:12,037
[SPEAKER_12]: to be able to protect these assets that the city has invested in by moving the parking.

681
01:17:12,538 --> 01:17:16,699
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean by removing some of the parking, reducing the amount of parking.

682
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:25,303
[SPEAKER_12]: But if not, to be able to find a design that will protect the site would be our preference.

683
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:31,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there someone from MHA's team who could respond to Ms.

684
01:17:31,217 --> 01:17:33,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Cameron's questions and concerns?

685
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:37,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, Mr. Chair, I could do that.

686
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I got my screen back.

687
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:43,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I could actually let me share.

688
01:17:43,562 --> 01:17:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some pictures and such.

689
01:17:46,023 --> 01:17:46,404
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

690
01:17:46,644 --> 01:17:56,188
[SPEAKER_15]: And while you're doing that, Stephen, I just would also like to just say that we actually did study a number of different

691
01:17:57,247 --> 01:18:03,551
[SPEAKER_15]: possibilities that would allow the bocce court to remain in the location that it currently is.

692
01:18:04,411 --> 01:18:13,977
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was, I mean, if you can kind of see that it's in the plan that's on the screen there, the bocce courts are sort of pushed way up into the middle of that site area.

693
01:18:13,997 --> 01:18:23,443
[SPEAKER_15]: And it became a rather challenging trying to, the solution for that became

694
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:30,633
[SPEAKER_15]: a little bit awkward and quite awkward and difficult to work around.

695
01:18:30,693 --> 01:18:39,638
[SPEAKER_15]: So we did do a pretty significant effort at trying to maintain it.

696
01:18:40,318 --> 01:18:53,085
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the long run, the design intent of bringing it closer, bringing the bocce courts closer to the river, we felt were worth that investment of moving them.

697
01:18:56,627 --> 01:19:00,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and as far as the, you know, my understanding, so we...

698
01:19:01,395 --> 01:19:04,117
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of the conservation commission, Heidi Davis is the chair.

699
01:19:04,137 --> 01:19:06,780
[SPEAKER_04]: She's intimately familiar with that.

700
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:14,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the CPC project for stormwater, there is nothing, you know, nothing, nothing's been constructed right now.

701
01:19:14,987 --> 01:19:19,050
[SPEAKER_04]: This area here at the, at the bottom is just a paved swale.

702
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:25,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And my understanding that we're going to convert that swale sort of a linear, linear improvement of a, uh,

703
01:19:27,197 --> 01:19:30,799
[SPEAKER_04]: convert the paved swale to a grass or vegetated swale.

704
01:19:31,339 --> 01:19:36,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We are actually doing that as part of the design and also we're

705
01:19:38,177 --> 01:19:42,179
[SPEAKER_04]: redirecting the water to a large bio-infiltration area here.

706
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:51,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So just for purposes, there's a grass swale that I had designed in a project to get an idea.

707
01:19:51,725 --> 01:19:56,828
[SPEAKER_04]: You have some uptake and some vegetation at the bottom, grass sides.

708
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: This swale would be a little bit wider.

709
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,392
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's a little narrower than what we'd be providing.

710
01:20:03,372 --> 01:20:05,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Also integrated into our design is the

711
01:20:06,174 --> 01:20:10,620
[SPEAKER_04]: is a forebay and an infiltration, a bio-infiltration area.

712
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:21,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be a sort of a stone area that you detain and infiltrate and clean the water prior to overtopping it into a bio-filtration area.

713
01:20:21,574 --> 01:20:23,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working with the landscape architect now

714
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding the planting right now, I think we have some switch grasses, some milkweed.

715
01:20:29,762 --> 01:20:31,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a project that I had done.

716
01:20:31,103 --> 01:20:41,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it's in the fall, the grasses have all turned, but it ends up being a very natural, very natural low impact design.

717
01:20:42,112 --> 01:20:45,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Heidi Davis, who was aware

718
01:20:46,123 --> 01:20:55,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Of I think of that CPC project, I am not sure where if it was ever if any money was spent on it as of yet, maybe on the design.

719
01:20:55,377 --> 01:20:56,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

720
01:20:56,919 --> 01:21:00,224
[SPEAKER_04]: But her comment was that what we're providing here.

721
01:21:01,005 --> 01:21:07,149
[SPEAKER_04]: is basically the intent of what that CPC funding was directed to do.

722
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:11,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll end up actually paying for it in providing these improvements.

723
01:21:12,852 --> 01:21:26,480
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd actually greatly appreciate and accept any CPC funding as part of this low impact design green infrastructure to be applied towards this portion of our stormwater, which I believe was part of that CPC project.

724
01:21:28,181 --> 01:21:29,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.

725
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:49,662
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a fair question that could be brought to the committee of whether if you're if what you're going to design is consistent with what we funded in the past, then.

726
01:21:52,700 --> 01:22:03,450
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be possible to explore the CPA award of that $40,000 being able to contribute toward the design of this system.

727
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:11,217
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a conversation that could be brought to the CPC via Daniel Evans.

728
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:16,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

729
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:30,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you heard enough about the budget court they did address it earlier in the presentation tonight I just didn't know if you had follow up or maybe you would like to hear more of what they said earlier in terms of its relocation and the other things they're doing to that area.

730
01:22:32,793 --> 01:22:34,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to hear that or ask them?

731
01:22:35,135 --> 01:22:35,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, perhaps.

732
01:22:35,975 --> 01:22:39,317
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize for coming late to your meeting, but it would be helpful.

733
01:22:39,718 --> 01:22:40,138
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

734
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:41,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't saying it to be condescending.

735
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:44,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure you get the information you're looking for.

736
01:22:45,521 --> 01:22:52,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the team is more than prepared to give you some info that's relevant.

737
01:22:52,226 --> 01:22:57,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan, maybe you could put up the landscape plan, I think is maybe the best way to show that.

738
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:01,612
[SPEAKER_05]: You want me to talk to that, Ben, or you got it?

739
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:09,894
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll start and if I lose words, jump in.

740
01:23:10,915 --> 01:23:15,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Roberta, I think what we, let's see, can you pan a little bit to the right?

741
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:27,209
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the right page, just... Yeah, if you can pan to the right, okay, here we go.

742
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:29,951
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we...

743
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:43,086
[SPEAKER_15]: liked about this strategy is it, it one is it, it allowed us to get the parking closer to the building, or as much as much as possible, get get closer to the building.

744
01:23:43,746 --> 01:24:00,612
[SPEAKER_15]: And and what it also does is it allows us to expand some of the space around the bocce courts, so that we have a larger sort of gathering space over to the on the just to the left of the court, man, just to the left of the court there.

745
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:14,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that area there is sort of identified and prepared for some sort of, you know, a gathering place possibly in the future, a structure or some furnishing.

746
01:24:15,642 --> 01:24:26,088
[SPEAKER_15]: And so more of a gathering space and the tie-in to the river walk, the clipper ship walk ends up being something that's a little more

747
01:24:27,337 --> 01:24:34,004
[SPEAKER_15]: obvious and integrated into that public space of the bocce courts.

748
01:24:34,484 --> 01:24:49,498
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other benefit has come with this move is that it puts the parking of the spaces allotted to the bocce court directly adjacent to the bocce court and the clipper ship block there.

749
01:24:53,185 --> 01:24:55,746
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can say that.

750
01:24:56,066 --> 01:25:00,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you have some other thoughts, Curtis, about planting?

751
01:25:03,649 --> 01:25:17,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just note that we have tracked down the landscape architects who designed the original bocce courts, and we are reproducing their construction details and material specifications.

752
01:25:18,885 --> 01:25:28,848
[SPEAKER_05]: to whatever extent possible, we are trying to reproduce the bocce courts as they were constructed initially, so.

753
01:25:29,368 --> 01:25:36,450
[SPEAKER_11]: May I ask what is the cost to reproduce the bocce courts?

754
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:38,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have a breakout of that.

755
01:25:38,711 --> 01:25:42,672
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can probably get it, find it, or have them do it.

756
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,093
[SPEAKER_15]: It was included in the

757
01:25:47,998 --> 01:25:50,901
[SPEAKER_15]: in the overall, all of the site hardscape work.

758
01:25:52,843 --> 01:26:10,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I don't have an objection in principle to the design, but it's simply the investment that we've made then being unmade is the principle that the

759
01:26:11,848 --> 01:26:14,290
[SPEAKER_12]: that our committee has a concern about.

760
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:17,893
[SPEAKER_17]: So Roberta, let me speak to that a little bit.

761
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:24,077
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know so far the MHA had covered 100% of the construction costs.

762
01:26:24,117 --> 01:26:26,479
[SPEAKER_17]: We have not received reimbursement yet for that.

763
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:30,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me speak with Jeff, our executive director, to see if

764
01:26:31,423 --> 01:26:38,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, let me just speak to him about if it's more regarding the financial commitment from CPC.

765
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:43,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, we have not got reimbursement we have covered 100% of the construction costs.

766
01:26:45,215 --> 01:26:49,458
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that sounds very weird because when we do CPA projects.

767
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually the invoices are given directly to the city and the city pays them directly.

768
01:26:57,034 --> 01:27:05,278
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we covered the cost because there's something regarding, we haven't finalized the Bocce court agreement with the city yet.

769
01:27:05,598 --> 01:27:07,259
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was holding things up.

770
01:27:07,799 --> 01:27:14,042
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have, it's a couple of years old and we have covered the cost for that in the last two years, but no, we have not.

771
01:27:14,582 --> 01:27:26,468
[SPEAKER_17]: I think some A and E fees may have been covered and it's so long ago, but I'm pretty positive and I'll get confirmation that we have paid for all of the construction costs.

772
01:27:28,044 --> 01:27:29,645
[SPEAKER_17]: and have not gotten reimbursement for those.

773
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:38,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just like to say, I think I'm on CPC as well as a community development board representative.

774
01:27:38,952 --> 01:27:51,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this project is just highlighting that we probably need to speak amongst the CPC if there's mechanisms that can be put in place in the process to ensure that any funds

775
01:27:55,534 --> 01:28:07,256
[SPEAKER_10]: invested in projects if there needs to be sort of like a look ahead or understanding of future projects and like how you actually deal with situations like this.

776
01:28:08,637 --> 01:28:17,038
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels like it's a bigger discussion because there could be, I think there has been other past projects that this has happened and there could be more.

777
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:21,859
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's more like communication and figuring out a mechanism to handle this

778
01:28:22,259 --> 01:28:24,120
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I agree.

779
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,780
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no bigger fan of the bocce courts.

780
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,582
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we try to use them on lunch breaks once in a while on Friday afternoons.

781
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:33,102
[SPEAKER_17]: And we love them.

782
01:28:33,162 --> 01:28:36,323
[SPEAKER_17]: I knew this was going to be a contentious issue.

783
01:28:36,543 --> 01:28:37,643
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't want to lose them.

784
01:28:37,663 --> 01:28:40,184
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I feel like it's an improve.

785
01:28:40,204 --> 01:28:43,405
[SPEAKER_17]: We're trying to make them better, incorporate them more into the community.

786
01:28:44,765 --> 01:28:50,347
[SPEAKER_17]: But we understand the CPC's point of view that we we made an investment towards this.

787
01:28:52,067 --> 01:29:09,097
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I said, this wasn't taken in jest or lightly, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out how we can keep them right once we made a decision that they needed to be moved, how best can we construct these and make them better than what the initial intention was.

788
01:29:15,905 --> 01:29:18,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'll repeat that.

789
01:29:18,747 --> 01:29:19,888
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't done lightly.

790
01:29:19,908 --> 01:29:25,332
[SPEAKER_08]: In principle, I agree wholeheartedly with you.

791
01:29:31,236 --> 01:29:32,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

792
01:29:33,818 --> 01:29:34,919
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I wanted to bring.

793
01:29:37,713 --> 01:29:53,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I would invite you to, as I said, submit a request through Danielle Evans to consider using the award for the stormwater improvements toward this project.

794
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:58,178
[SPEAKER_12]: We can see whether that's that's a possibility, it would make sense.

795
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:08,465
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we'll have to have a discussion amongst ourselves about what to do about this investment.

796
01:30:09,806 --> 01:30:10,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

797
01:30:12,188 --> 01:30:12,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

798
01:30:12,548 --> 01:30:23,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, did we have any other participants non board non presentation participants for tonight.

799
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Not yet, no, I'll let you know if that changes.

800
01:30:26,902 --> 01:30:27,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, very good.

801
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:47,901
[SPEAKER_13]: David, usually I let the board ask their questions first, just in case there's, you know, occasionally like I might have something that they didn't ask, but it occurs to me that there's been something confusing in some of the materials that is my field, my original field, so I thought I should just ask that now.

802
01:30:48,522 --> 01:30:50,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure, go for it.

803
01:30:50,663 --> 01:31:02,667
[SPEAKER_13]: It appeared to be, so this building has solar thermal on the roof and some of the images appear to show solar panels of some sort, which I assumed on the roof would just be that staying.

804
01:31:03,328 --> 01:31:07,269
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also saw what appeared to be some on the lower roof.

805
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:13,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm curious, what is your plan with the solar thermal and or solar panels?

806
01:31:13,512 --> 01:31:16,713
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could just explain that and clear up the discrepancies.

807
01:31:17,675 --> 01:31:20,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'll take that.

808
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:35,380
[SPEAKER_15]: The solar system is being taken down because the entire roof is being reworked, both from a roofing standpoint as well as from equipment standpoint.

809
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:45,023
[SPEAKER_15]: We're adding to the roof a fair amount of equipment that is serving the ventilation of the building.

810
01:31:46,918 --> 01:32:06,287
[SPEAKER_15]: energy recovery ventilators and that equipment that is, it's actually in response to one of the other questions that was raised by, I think the health department in terms of what are we doing for air quality as a building adjacent to an interstate.

811
01:32:06,507 --> 01:32:13,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we are trying to do is bring all of the fresh air intake for the building from the roof level, which is,

812
01:32:14,576 --> 01:32:28,485
[SPEAKER_15]: significantly higher than the highway, the interstate output of fumes, and the higher you go, the cleaner the air is, just in general.

813
01:32:29,805 --> 01:32:43,354
[SPEAKER_15]: But back to the solar, because of that loss up on the roof, what we've done is we've reduced some of the equipment, some of the panels, we've shifted some of the panels on the roof, we've reduced

814
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:52,154
[SPEAKER_15]: the panels on one wing and are relocating what was being eliminated from the roof to the lower roof.

815
01:32:52,954 --> 01:32:56,495
[SPEAKER_15]: So there will be the two areas of solar panels.

816
01:32:57,675 --> 01:33:08,159
[SPEAKER_15]: So essentially the same level of equipment or collection quantity and just a different distribution.

817
01:33:09,053 --> 01:33:12,095
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are solar thermal shown on the lower ones.

818
01:33:12,495 --> 01:33:19,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that I am less familiar with the technical behind solar thermal, but I do realize that there is fluid that runs through them.

819
01:33:20,099 --> 01:33:28,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's much more complicated in my mind than relocating solar PV, although I've never done it, so I wouldn't know.

820
01:33:29,723 --> 01:33:30,004
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.

821
01:33:30,024 --> 01:33:31,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

822
01:33:32,165 --> 01:33:36,907
[SPEAKER_15]: It will require some new equipment, but it is reasonably doable.

823
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:38,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's good to hear.

824
01:33:38,721 --> 01:33:45,027
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, I have to say that I've always been very concerned about people living directly next to the highway.

825
01:33:45,547 --> 01:33:51,172
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the idea that you're working on the air intake being so high up to provide

826
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,101
[SPEAKER_13]: clean, fresh air is very reassuring actually.

827
01:33:57,462 --> 01:34:04,724
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the only argument I could ever hear for why you wouldn't want operable windows on a lot of this building is because of its proximity to the highway.

828
01:34:05,044 --> 01:34:14,427
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's so hard for people to live with inoperable windows that I'm glad you found a balance with that and that you'll be bringing in clean air from the roof.

829
01:34:14,887 --> 01:34:18,508
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe there's some opportunity for resident education

830
01:34:19,202 --> 01:34:34,351
[SPEAKER_13]: that they may not realize this, but that the air that comes in through their ventilation system may actually be, if they ever have trouble with asthma or air quality, better for them than what comes through their own windows.

831
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:43,356
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't seem logical, particularly to somebody who has grown up with the idea that fresh air comes in through the window.

832
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:46,018
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

833
01:34:48,408 --> 01:34:56,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia do they have a, is this the type of project that would have a requirement for additional solar or solar ready roof or we at that.

834
01:34:58,068 --> 01:35:11,195
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think there would be an argument, but frankly, the fact that there's solar thermal on the building, I think complies in spirit, if not to the exact letter here.

835
01:35:12,455 --> 01:35:17,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Normally, what we would ask for is a study that shows whether or not solar is suitable.

836
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:25,342
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm fairly confident, I mean, that any study would say if you remove the solar thermal, you could put the solar PV on.

837
01:35:25,742 --> 01:35:28,163
[SPEAKER_13]: but that doesn't make logical sense to anybody.

838
01:35:28,303 --> 01:35:33,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And we don't actually ask anyone to remove equipment to put solar PV on.

839
01:35:34,086 --> 01:35:39,829
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more that we don't like a wide open empty roof with nothing that could actually have PV on it.

840
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,911
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't get too technical, right?

841
01:35:43,951 --> 01:35:45,751
[SPEAKER_13]: People know those terms now these days.

842
01:35:45,771 --> 01:35:48,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, just checking.

843
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:54,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, back to the board members.

844
01:35:55,361 --> 01:35:55,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions?

845
01:35:55,741 --> 01:35:58,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question, comment, please.

846
01:35:59,103 --> 01:35:59,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

847
01:36:01,505 --> 01:36:11,531
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I can provide these in a more, I think the best maybe way to answer these questions maybe is in this order.

848
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:16,634
[SPEAKER_18]: So I heard a little chatter that the first floor is publicly accessible.

849
01:36:17,295 --> 01:36:21,137
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was wondering, looking at the first floor plan, it looks like there are

850
01:36:22,017 --> 01:36:25,959
[SPEAKER_18]: some restrooms and maybe some areas that are labeled common spaces.

851
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:30,081
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was just wondering, you know, how accessible is the first floor?

852
01:36:30,161 --> 01:36:34,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it just a lobby or are those areas included as well?

853
01:36:35,624 --> 01:36:44,609
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I also had a question about the lawn in the bioretention slash infiltration basin.

854
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:46,069
[SPEAKER_18]: And

855
01:36:47,652 --> 01:36:54,474
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just referring to the drawings that were submitted, the site plan review drawings 9-20-22 that were submitted on sheet L-102.

856
01:36:56,394 --> 01:37:03,496
[SPEAKER_18]: I've just seen lawn fail in a couple of buyer retention basins because, you know, the possibility of being submerged underwater.

857
01:37:04,457 --> 01:37:13,219
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm wondering if that's also another appropriate area to include more shrub planting or some more wetland resistant plants there.

858
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:24,260
[SPEAKER_18]: And my last comment slash question was if there's any possibility to provide trash cans along the proposed DCR path along Mystic River.

859
01:37:25,662 --> 01:37:25,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

860
01:37:29,363 --> 01:37:32,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take the first question.

861
01:37:33,164 --> 01:37:44,068
[SPEAKER_15]: The first floor, I think if I understand what you mean by accessible, do you mean ADA accessible, or do you mean access to public?

862
01:37:45,309 --> 01:37:45,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

863
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:47,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I did mean publicly accessible.

864
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:50,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand the confusion there.

865
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:53,612
[SPEAKER_15]: The first floor is about one third

866
01:37:55,736 --> 01:38:01,219
[SPEAKER_15]: maintenance and building systems use, or maybe less than that, maybe a quarter.

867
01:38:01,799 --> 01:38:12,265
[SPEAKER_15]: And about a third of it is administrative space that is Medford Housing Authority operational offices, central offices.

868
01:38:12,946 --> 01:38:20,790
[SPEAKER_15]: So this area on the bottom of the page there, the office looking area, that's the Medford Housing Authority's

869
01:38:21,475 --> 01:38:26,016
[SPEAKER_15]: primary office with the entrance at the southwest corner.

870
01:38:26,996 --> 01:38:41,459
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, and there's a kitchen, if you move up in the cursor there, that area there is a community kitchen, which is in place to serve the Edgerly Hall.

871
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:47,780
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Edgerly Hall is the piece of the long wing to the right and,

872
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:58,547
[SPEAKER_15]: That we, it's actually a bigger space currently, and we had to break it up a little bit because of structural bracing that has to come down to the grade level.

873
01:39:00,027 --> 01:39:05,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And so functionally we have a sort of modifiable with with partitions and, and

874
01:39:07,999 --> 01:39:12,463
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we've created a couple smaller usable spaces.

875
01:39:12,523 --> 01:39:18,628
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is all, it's all Medford Housing Authority space property.

876
01:39:19,209 --> 01:39:26,995
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's publicly accessible, but it's controlled by, access is controlled by Medford Housing Authority.

877
01:39:27,596 --> 01:39:33,241
[SPEAKER_15]: The center portion between, I should say the portion on the top of the plan there, that's all the,

878
01:39:36,085 --> 01:39:37,626
[SPEAKER_15]: maintenance area and equipment.

879
01:39:37,746 --> 01:39:41,329
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's a cluster of offices right there.

880
01:39:41,349 --> 01:39:55,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are a couple of maintenance offices, as well as some of the operational offices for the housing authority for the resident services types of access.

881
01:39:57,041 --> 01:40:12,016
[SPEAKER_15]: So that center area there, there's some public restrooms, there's a mail space and a fairly large lobby that's circulation with some seating areas and a couple of TV locations and that type of thing.

882
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:15,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Now access into that lobby is controlled.

883
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:26,503
[SPEAKER_15]: There's those two points of access, one on the north side of the building, one on the south side of the building, left and right.

884
01:40:26,683 --> 01:40:41,446
[SPEAKER_15]: The direct public access is into the vestibule where they have to get released in by a resident or employee.

885
01:40:43,298 --> 01:40:46,380
[SPEAKER_15]: So does that answer that question of accessibility?

886
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

887
01:40:47,961 --> 01:40:49,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, it definitely does.

888
01:40:49,062 --> 01:40:49,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

889
01:40:49,503 --> 01:41:02,993
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe that the Medford Housing Authority uses the Edgerly Hall for various functions that are sometimes outreach programs or for programs that are related to some of their other facilities.

890
01:41:03,053 --> 01:41:12,660
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have people coming from all around the city, from other Medford housing facilities that come to programs

891
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,641
[SPEAKER_15]: or functions at this space.

892
01:41:18,743 --> 01:41:23,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is one of the reasons why we've actually have maintained some of our parking overflow.

893
01:41:24,186 --> 01:41:26,947
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a little bit of excess parking beyond code.

894
01:41:27,528 --> 01:41:35,472
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is one of the reasons we have done that because there are times when they have functions within Edgeley Hall.

895
01:41:36,063 --> 01:41:44,395
[SPEAKER_15]: with other housing sites and they often, they max out the parking capacity.

896
01:41:48,421 --> 01:41:52,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I guess I can, I can address the infiltration areas.

897
01:41:53,025 --> 01:42:03,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, yeah, so the submitted the stormwater report initially, the design was for infiltration, basically a bio infiltration areas, basins.

898
01:42:04,594 --> 01:42:07,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we did do test bits out there and.

899
01:42:07,737 --> 01:42:09,838
[SPEAKER_04]: In the areas of the 2 basins, it's good.

900
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:12,420
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's decent gravel fill.

901
01:42:13,261 --> 01:42:18,926
[SPEAKER_04]: in the groundwater is substantially below, I think it's like five, four or five feet below the bottom of our basins.

902
01:42:19,907 --> 01:42:26,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's good well draining material underneath the basins.

903
01:42:27,093 --> 01:42:32,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you can see the test pit locations on that.

904
01:42:33,107 --> 01:42:50,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So 1, 1 thing that, you know, this system actually, it's under quite a bit of scrutiny between Owen, the city engineer, Heidi, Heidi Davis, um, who's with the DP, um, as the chair of the conservation commission and also the DEP, um, this is subject to the mass stormwater regulations.

905
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:58,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So as such, um, there's a, it's kind of a convoluted, uh, convoluted, um,

906
01:42:59,168 --> 01:43:07,675
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of gray area on the regulations, that infiltration basins are not allowed within 50 feet of a waterway.

907
01:43:09,336 --> 01:43:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So that being said, we're in the process of redesigning those bases from infiltration basins to bioretention areas.

908
01:43:18,244 --> 01:43:24,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, given the good soils below, they'll drain and it'll readily drain from underneath.

909
01:43:27,148 --> 01:43:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be working with Curtis as far as, I'm still confident that these will drain dry, what you need to be very careful of.

910
01:43:34,635 --> 01:43:41,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done plenty of rain gardens slash or infiltration areas by retention areas that are lawn and they work.

911
01:43:41,581 --> 01:43:43,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I had some pictures I probably could have brought up.

912
01:43:43,802 --> 01:43:46,044
[SPEAKER_04]: They look great.

913
01:43:46,525 --> 01:43:49,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are particularly in areas where you have decent gravel underneath.

914
01:43:50,628 --> 01:44:00,241
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times where I've got into trouble is actually with the rain gardens is the actual material that compost sort of that filter soil media.

915
01:44:00,842 --> 01:44:06,389
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta be very careful about putting too much compost in it, very careful about overcompacting it.

916
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:18,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what ends up happening is, if it's not installed properly, that media, that soil media, ends up being quite impermeable, and your basins don't drain.

917
01:44:19,372 --> 01:44:22,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm acutely aware of that, and need to be very careful.

918
01:44:22,873 --> 01:44:34,335
[SPEAKER_04]: If we do go to a bioretention media, I typically like to not put as much compost in it, just for the fact that you need to be very careful of that soil media becoming impermeable.

919
01:44:34,955 --> 01:44:38,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking to, you know, I, I want them to drain.

920
01:44:39,616 --> 01:44:42,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, I want them to drain within 72 hours for sure.

921
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:47,558
[SPEAKER_04]: More, so I'd like to drain drain after storm event within 24 hours.

922
01:44:48,979 --> 01:44:52,260
[SPEAKER_04]: But so those are this those basins right now.

923
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm currently.

924
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:56,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Really looking at them for the fact that we're converting from.

925
01:44:58,254 --> 01:45:00,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't call them an infiltration basin.

926
01:45:00,556 --> 01:45:07,422
[SPEAKER_04]: A bioretention area still infiltrates, but it's called something different, and it basically slows the water down as it passes into the ground.

927
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:15,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be updating the stormwater calcs and resubmitting to the DEP and to the Conservation Commission and to Owen, the city engineer.

928
01:45:16,751 --> 01:45:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: But I appreciate the comment.

929
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:21,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen that where they do clog and they end up wet.

930
01:45:21,876 --> 01:45:25,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, I've seen it on a couple of occasions.

931
01:45:26,277 --> 01:45:31,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And mostly that's because of over compaction of that soil media when it's installed.

932
01:45:38,701 --> 01:45:39,041
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

933
01:45:40,321 --> 01:45:43,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, George, what was your last question?

934
01:45:43,422 --> 01:45:44,042
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, yeah.

935
01:45:44,483 --> 01:45:47,583
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it was a trash can along DCR path.

936
01:45:50,947 --> 01:45:52,588
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let Gabe answer that one.

937
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:57,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know we currently have some trash cans by the bocce courts.

938
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:06,973
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's something I think we can definitely take care of, maybe put one at each end of our property stores and that.

939
01:46:10,994 --> 01:46:14,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're on the subject, what is the timeline of

940
01:46:16,109 --> 01:46:19,332
[SPEAKER_07]: that path versus this project.

941
01:46:20,093 --> 01:46:21,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Alicia knows a little bit better.

942
01:46:21,635 --> 01:46:21,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

943
01:46:22,916 --> 01:46:24,958
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually checked again recently.

944
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:32,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So the DCR has every expectation that it is going to go out to bid this winter and built in the spring.

945
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:35,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the bid documents.

946
01:46:36,889 --> 01:46:42,092
[SPEAKER_13]: What it's waiting for is a final easement agreement to be signed with 99 Riverside.

947
01:46:42,572 --> 01:46:47,215
[SPEAKER_13]: When I checked last week, they were still trying to get that easement agreement.

948
01:46:48,536 --> 01:46:54,059
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the only thing that is holding up bidding out that project and going to construction.

949
01:47:02,325 --> 01:47:02,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be

950
01:47:03,857 --> 01:47:05,117
[SPEAKER_07]: the entirety of it, yes?

951
01:47:05,877 --> 01:47:12,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and just to be clear, we could ask the lawyers for 99 Riverside why this is taking so long.

952
01:47:14,339 --> 01:47:16,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Not like the DCR lawyers.

953
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:17,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

954
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:25,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that would be the whole thing from the end here by Clippership all the way into Riverbend Park on the other end.

955
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,801
[SPEAKER_08]: George did you have some more follow up.

956
01:47:39,684 --> 01:47:40,305
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry.

957
01:47:40,725 --> 01:47:40,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

958
01:47:40,925 --> 01:47:41,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

959
01:47:44,587 --> 01:47:45,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

960
01:47:45,648 --> 01:47:47,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Another board member.

961
01:47:47,449 --> 01:47:58,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I had one question, whether I'm not sure but if if noise was an issue given the different materials of the building compared to what it is now given the 93 is right there.

962
01:48:01,455 --> 01:48:08,381
[SPEAKER_15]: someone could address that.

963
01:48:08,822 --> 01:48:12,405
[SPEAKER_15]: We're adding a fair amount of material on the outside.

964
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:18,411
[SPEAKER_15]: What's replacing the masonry is just metal stud framing with sheathing and drywall.

965
01:48:19,472 --> 01:48:25,998
[SPEAKER_15]: However, the insulation on the exterior is a, I don't know if you're familiar with mineral wool,

966
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:29,042
[SPEAKER_15]: insulation is five inches of mineral wool.

967
01:48:29,762 --> 01:48:44,849
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a, so we're going for as, as much exterior, you know, thermal performance as possible, but it's also extremely good thermal, I mean, acoustical absorption kind of quality.

968
01:48:45,569 --> 01:48:51,312
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, I will admit, it's not exactly the same as, as the masonry.

969
01:48:52,240 --> 01:49:08,883
[SPEAKER_15]: And it may be that it actually performs better in some sense because of the reflective quality of the panels versus the masonry that is more of a coarse surface.

970
01:49:09,323 --> 01:49:21,265
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will say that I'm curious because the question came up and I think it's a very reasonable question and I think we'll be following up on that.

971
01:49:21,968 --> 01:49:26,350
[SPEAKER_15]: but I'm quite confident in the performance of that exterior rain screen.

972
01:49:28,851 --> 01:49:33,694
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a significant panel of acoustical absorption.

973
01:49:37,856 --> 01:49:49,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And the window systems are equivalent to what is currently there, which is a double pane, fairly commercial grade, heavy aluminum system.

974
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:59,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Will this building be going for any sort of LEED or other kind of certification?

975
01:50:00,255 --> 01:50:10,702
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be going for an Enterprise Green Communities certification, which is a program that's designed specifically for

976
01:50:12,664 --> 01:50:18,313
[SPEAKER_15]: affordable housing and multifamily affordable housing in particular.

977
01:50:19,495 --> 01:50:27,288
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's very much designed and modeled after LEED program.

978
01:50:28,071 --> 01:50:49,877
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I believe, I'm not sure Natalie, if you'll know, but I believe just passing, they don't have different grades of performance, but just meeting the passing performance for enterprise green communities is equivalent to, I believe a silver in their lead ranking.

979
01:50:49,897 --> 01:50:51,817
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have to go through and do a comparison of,

980
01:50:55,663 --> 01:50:58,125
[SPEAKER_15]: of the enterprise to lead, I believe.

981
01:51:06,631 --> 01:51:10,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Anna is a good you have some more follow up.

982
01:51:10,854 --> 01:51:11,775
[SPEAKER_16]: No, the only other thing.

983
01:51:11,795 --> 01:51:20,862
[SPEAKER_16]: I know they mentioned the water loop that they didn't agree with the city comments but I was wondering if there are other comments that.

984
01:51:23,214 --> 01:51:33,317
[SPEAKER_08]: the team didn't agree with or that weren't going to be met.

985
01:51:33,418 --> 01:51:49,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I can speak for the, I think as far as the engineering comments, uh, engineering board of health, uh, that water loop was the only, only comment that we didn't concur with that, that we took exception to and wouldn't be incorporating into the, into the site, at least the site civil and stormwater.

986
01:51:53,482 --> 01:51:59,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that could you just explain to the, to the uneducated on that on that topic.

987
01:52:00,649 --> 01:52:06,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's a fire safety, kind of a question or water availability question.

988
01:52:06,475 --> 01:52:13,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And are they, are they looking for it to be a certain way but you've got a covered like, give us, give us your read.

989
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:24,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, so I think Owen's comment in speaking with the owner, he was talking about putting a hydrant.

990
01:52:24,544 --> 01:52:27,026
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having a hydrant in the back of the building, right?

991
01:52:27,106 --> 01:52:33,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But as part of the building design, I'm not as far as there is fire connections that are.

992
01:52:34,928 --> 01:52:39,512
[SPEAKER_04]: the buildings, well, number one, the building's all sprinkled, it's sprinkled fire protection.

993
01:52:39,992 --> 01:52:53,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also there's a system that the Siamese connections or fire department connections on the rear of the building that they can hook up to right on the building, right at the bottom of the building where they'd hook hoses to fight the fire from that location.

994
01:52:54,622 --> 01:53:01,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as far as Owen's comment was, well, what if there's a fire and a car catches on fire?

995
01:53:02,002 --> 01:53:10,004
[SPEAKER_04]: We said, well, it's about 400 feet of laying length from the, probably 300 feet of hose length from the nearest hydrant, which isn't too bad.

996
01:53:11,444 --> 01:53:27,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't believe, I don't know if those connections aren't, I think they have to hook up to the connections to energize those connections for, you know, they'd have to hook up and energize the connection if they're gonna pull a hose to fight a fire off in the rear.

997
01:53:27,909 --> 01:53:28,929
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really no,

998
01:53:29,988 --> 01:53:37,689
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, health safety, you know, as far as safety of people in the building, it was more for some sort of remote, remote fire out, out in the rear.

999
01:53:38,450 --> 01:53:44,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that was, you know, that would, there was a specific, uh, comment from the city engineer, not the fire department.

1000
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:56,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, and he actually said, well, if the fire department's okay with it, he's he'd be, he'd go, he wouldn't be asking for it with the current design.

1001
01:54:01,773 --> 01:54:06,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to see if that was something that was in his written comments, or maybe he told you as you've been working with him.

1002
01:54:08,157 --> 01:54:10,359
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the written, I think it was one of his written comments.

1003
01:54:11,099 --> 01:54:15,182
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a comment about the looping the water, a water loop around the building.

1004
01:54:15,642 --> 01:54:20,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it started off by, there was a, there's one fire connection in one

1005
01:54:22,332 --> 01:54:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a one fire and potable water connection, which there's currently there's 2 separate, but we'd be the typical typical connections to a building or there's 2 separate.

1006
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: You provide a fire connection and a. Yeah, there is the existing building has 1 water.

1007
01:54:43,268 --> 01:54:49,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the existing building has one water service from the 12-inch main located in Riverside.

1008
01:54:50,991 --> 01:54:59,435
[SPEAKER_04]: The engineering division recommends a water loop around the building and recommends providing additional hydrants on the site.

1009
01:55:00,155 --> 01:55:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two hydrants on the site.

1010
01:55:02,296 --> 01:55:03,276
[SPEAKER_04]: They're at the front of the building.

1011
01:55:05,415 --> 01:55:24,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But our feeling is, and I believe as far as the fire department agrees, or they do agree, is that what they have is there's two on Riverside on either corner, and then there's hydrants on the front of the building too.

1012
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:37,243
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right about there.

1013
01:55:44,808 --> 01:55:55,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's connections on the building itself where the fire department can hook up in the rear of the building.

1014
01:55:58,508 --> 01:56:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that meeting, Owen agreed.

1015
01:56:01,189 --> 01:56:09,111
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, well, if the fire, he would not push it if the fire department was okay, is okay with the design as is, he wouldn't ask for it.

1016
01:56:09,572 --> 01:56:10,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is quite expensive.

1017
01:56:11,232 --> 01:56:21,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an insignificant cost to loop an eight inch ductile ion pipe around the building.

1018
01:56:21,655 --> 01:56:26,597
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking, it's gonna end up being around a thousand feet.

1019
01:56:28,602 --> 01:56:37,120
[SPEAKER_04]: of ductile pipe, which, you know, given the cost these days, it's a significant, significant added cost to the project.

1020
01:56:41,217 --> 01:56:43,379
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may, I would just add, it's not just a cost.

1021
01:56:43,479 --> 01:56:54,068
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not be used for that because fire department specifically told us that it would like to access the front of the building, which they have two connections, which they would connect to the building at that location.

1022
01:56:54,669 --> 01:57:00,854
[SPEAKER_00]: They would never go on the farthest possible location to connect because they only have connections at all three sides of the building.

1023
01:57:02,155 --> 01:57:06,198
[SPEAKER_00]: They always want to be closest to the building, the first entrance to the building, not to

1024
01:57:06,999 --> 01:57:07,579
[SPEAKER_00]: loop around.

1025
01:57:07,619 --> 01:57:21,228
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're creating their main goal when we met with the fire department was actually to create that specific access lane for their trucks because they've seen through the years that people are jamming exits and they cannot access the building.

1026
01:57:22,428 --> 01:57:23,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to interrupt.

1027
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:25,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That's helpful.

1028
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:25,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1029
01:57:29,152 --> 01:57:33,195
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'll respond to your question, David.

1030
01:57:33,215 --> 01:57:33,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1031
01:57:34,355 --> 01:57:35,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Or maybe it was

1032
01:57:36,268 --> 01:57:43,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Dean has other questions that we are in disagreement with.

1033
01:57:44,174 --> 01:57:48,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe there are any other questions that we actually disagree with.

1034
01:57:49,057 --> 01:57:57,083
[SPEAKER_15]: I think some of the questions from the historic commission on the envelope and some of those are a little more subjective.

1035
01:57:57,183 --> 01:58:05,849
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be submitting to you all of these responses and we can respond further as needed.

1036
01:58:07,483 --> 01:58:10,346
[SPEAKER_15]: But I believe we addressed them all.

1037
01:58:11,127 --> 01:58:15,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the board ready to vote if they had the responses tonight?

1038
01:58:15,071 --> 01:58:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

1039
01:58:16,152 --> 01:58:17,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that's where you were going.

1040
01:58:17,353 --> 01:58:20,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

1041
01:58:20,777 --> 01:58:22,218
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to ask that question.

1042
01:58:25,293 --> 01:58:27,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a number of questions.

1043
01:58:27,255 --> 01:58:31,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Christy, if you'd like to go before me, I'm happy to yield the floor.

1044
01:58:31,518 --> 01:58:31,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1045
01:58:31,818 --> 01:58:47,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll just jump in and say, if the board would like us to review each of the responses to the questions or comments we received in writing, we can do that as well, if that would be helpful for the board to take action tonight, rather than having to revisit it in the future.

1046
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:51,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1047
01:58:53,993 --> 01:58:57,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me a sense, I think Gabe put up a timeline.

1048
01:58:57,415 --> 01:59:02,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's pretty long construction schedule, obviously a very large project.

1049
01:59:02,858 --> 01:59:04,359
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the community going to see?

1050
01:59:04,439 --> 01:59:07,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the building going to be like fully scaffolded for a year and a half?

1051
01:59:07,901 --> 01:59:10,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what does that look and feel like to the public?

1052
01:59:11,944 --> 01:59:21,289
[SPEAKER_17]: So we were originally looking at fully scaffolding the building, but we're going now with a combination in the areas where

1053
01:59:22,864 --> 01:59:24,625
[SPEAKER_17]: There's like the first floor roofs.

1054
01:59:26,367 --> 01:59:33,011
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to go with scaffolding, but we're trying to implement mass climbers throughout the majority of the building.

1055
01:59:33,071 --> 01:59:41,317
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how we are going to, as he stated, work from the top of the building down using a mass climber system.

1056
01:59:41,578 --> 01:59:47,302
[SPEAKER_17]: But there will be sections of the building that will have some scaffolding around it.

1057
01:59:50,656 --> 02:00:02,389
[SPEAKER_02]: the on the your landscaping plans there's some sort of storage yard or something that's adjacent to the parking lot to closest to 93.

1058
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:05,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us a little more on that?

1059
02:00:07,895 --> 02:00:11,900
[SPEAKER_17]: So in Bend, so that's an existing condition that is

1060
02:00:13,583 --> 02:00:22,212
[SPEAKER_17]: where are kind of we have large trash containers located there for just, you know,

1061
02:00:23,405 --> 02:00:27,666
[SPEAKER_17]: large items and we have vacancies, a lot of residents will leave furniture behind.

1062
02:00:27,706 --> 02:00:34,048
[SPEAKER_17]: So we put couches back there, electronics for weekly or monthly pickups, depending on what the material is.

1063
02:00:34,068 --> 02:00:38,429
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we also have some vehicle storage.

1064
02:00:38,569 --> 02:00:39,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that what we're referring to?

1065
02:00:40,009 --> 02:00:40,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1066
02:00:41,709 --> 02:00:44,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan, could you go to page 11 on the video or 12?

1067
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:46,371
[SPEAKER_15]: 12, I'm sorry.

1068
02:00:46,671 --> 02:00:48,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Now as I look at Google Earth, I see it.

1069
02:00:49,227 --> 02:01:05,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so David, what we're proposing is that the, what is currently the space that's used now with for, as Gabe mentioned, it's equipment storage.

1070
02:01:05,713 --> 02:01:08,954
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some, I think it's for the entire,

1071
02:01:12,804 --> 02:01:32,978
[SPEAKER_15]: the entire campus of properties for MHA, you know, waste, recycling, equipment, et cetera, that zone is going to become, actually is an extension of this parking lot, which adds, I think, about seven or eight spaces.

1072
02:01:33,998 --> 02:01:36,940
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if you go to page 12 on the,

1073
02:01:39,880 --> 02:02:03,913
[SPEAKER_15]: on the PDF or page 13 on the PDF, what we've done is we've, so that area that what was the storage area becomes parking spaces and we've extended the storage area, which is it's a gravel, but I believe it's non-permeable into that area there.

1074
02:02:05,433 --> 02:02:06,794
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've actually pulled it.

1075
02:02:07,075 --> 02:02:15,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently, it splits the property line division between the highway department and Saltonstall.

1076
02:02:16,363 --> 02:02:25,811
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we're doing is getting it so that that space is entirely on the property of the MHA.

1077
02:02:26,872 --> 02:02:27,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

1078
02:02:30,636 --> 02:02:30,736
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1079
02:02:32,538 --> 02:02:42,182
[SPEAKER_02]: The, on the other side, so now West, it looks now like the parking lots all just sort of come together.

1080
02:02:42,302 --> 02:02:43,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a fence there.

1081
02:02:43,902 --> 02:02:55,947
[SPEAKER_02]: This design would actually give you a little bit of landscaping, buffering MHA from the senior center and the other residents to your West.

1082
02:02:57,777 --> 02:02:58,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.

1083
02:02:59,978 --> 02:03:01,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do pull the pavement back.

1084
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:03,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a few feet.

1085
02:03:05,281 --> 02:03:10,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Curtis, I think you can sneak in a little bit of landscaping along that edge now.

1086
02:03:11,804 --> 02:03:13,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I can hold on.

1087
02:03:13,665 --> 02:03:17,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I still have that up.

1088
02:03:18,068 --> 02:03:18,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1089
02:03:26,782 --> 02:03:27,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, hold on.

1090
02:03:27,563 --> 02:03:28,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me share.

1091
02:03:34,169 --> 02:03:40,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so if you look, so here's the red line is the current edge of pavement.

1092
02:03:40,576 --> 02:03:48,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see we pulled, we now have additional landscape area that we've added on that edge.

1093
02:03:48,744 --> 02:03:50,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1094
02:03:52,684 --> 02:03:54,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the gazebo underutilized?

1095
02:03:55,066 --> 02:03:59,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that it's going away, not anyone's favorite these days.

1096
02:04:03,233 --> 02:04:05,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the gazebo is really just...

1097
02:04:07,036 --> 02:04:15,620
[SPEAKER_17]: birdhouse kind of residents, it's weird, they'll pull up lawn chairs and congregate outside the gazebo sometimes.

1098
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:24,223
[SPEAKER_17]: We find that all of our developments, especially at our elderly disabled developments, all of our residents like to congregate in the front of the building.

1099
02:04:24,583 --> 02:04:29,366
[SPEAKER_17]: They like to see the comings and goings of people when the mailman arrives and everything.

1100
02:04:29,426 --> 02:04:30,266
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very rare.

1101
02:04:30,946 --> 02:04:33,149
[SPEAKER_17]: to see our residents congregating.

1102
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:38,195
[SPEAKER_17]: You could build something beautiful in the rear of the site, they want to be out front.

1103
02:04:38,335 --> 02:04:43,101
[SPEAKER_17]: So at our 22 Alston Street development, we had a gazebo in the rear of the building.

1104
02:04:43,641 --> 02:04:47,946
[SPEAKER_17]: No one ever used it, we're tearing that down, we're building a new one in the front of the building because everyone just

1105
02:04:48,507 --> 02:04:53,750
[SPEAKER_17]: pulled up lawn chairs and bring up their kitchen chairs and just sit in the front of the building.

1106
02:04:53,830 --> 02:04:58,153
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like you learn these kind of traits after a while.

1107
02:04:58,353 --> 02:05:11,200
[SPEAKER_17]: So it is trying to get the residents to also, we're trying to as, as we stated earlier, create spaces like right outside the community center, right outside Edgeley Hall to kind of bring them closer into the building.

1108
02:05:11,741 --> 02:05:15,364
[SPEAKER_17]: so they don't have to travel as far either for some of the more disabled residents.

1109
02:05:16,444 --> 02:05:19,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And your roof deck, obviously, as well.

1110
02:05:20,087 --> 02:05:20,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1111
02:05:20,887 --> 02:05:21,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1112
02:05:24,099 --> 02:05:30,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you're adding a little bit of green space, at least we're not losing any overall, and putting in a lot of trees.

1113
02:05:31,665 --> 02:05:39,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the area in the back where the gazebo is now, you're pulling back some asphalt, you're adding more lawn.

1114
02:05:40,352 --> 02:05:41,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Will there be more trees in that area?

1115
02:05:41,914 --> 02:05:43,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be kind of an open lawn?

1116
02:05:43,475 --> 02:05:45,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't quite sure because some of the renderings differ.

1117
02:05:49,949 --> 02:06:01,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just, I'm just trying to get a sense of it because I think more and more, you know, if we get these enhancements and the river becomes more of a front facing feature to the city than a back of the house feature, you know, it would be great.

1118
02:06:01,898 --> 02:06:08,963
[SPEAKER_02]: The more vegetation you're putting there, the more paths and just more you beautify it, the better.

1119
02:06:09,584 --> 02:06:09,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1120
02:06:10,745 --> 02:06:16,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the, the, uh, and I'm sure you're all familiar, but there's, we are

1121
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:28,653
[SPEAKER_15]: looking at potentially a future development building in that general area.

1122
02:06:29,033 --> 02:06:33,874
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've addressed that landscape more as sort of an open space.

1123
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:41,536
[SPEAKER_15]: We've planted and populated with some trees around the

1124
02:06:42,461 --> 02:06:48,262
[SPEAKER_15]: the periphery that's adjacent to the primary walkway that passes through here.

1125
02:06:48,342 --> 02:07:03,666
[SPEAKER_15]: So trying to create somewhat of an LA through here and really are just leaving this as essentially as a lot of this site is currently, which is lawn.

1126
02:07:04,646 --> 02:07:10,908
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know if you have anything you can say about that, Curtis, other than

1127
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:18,592
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we sort of trying to minimize the scope of work in that area currently.

1128
02:07:18,612 --> 02:07:35,628
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, you know, it may be something that we, as time rolls, we may take a different strategy, but I think this is kind of a clean and non-invasive sort of approach.

1129
02:07:38,678 --> 02:07:58,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and the extent of planting, we sort of wanted to walk the line between, you know, providing as much interesting planting as we can, but at the same time, we don't want to overwhelm the sort of maintenance staff at the MHA.

1130
02:07:59,732 --> 02:08:02,554
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that, you know, the lawn is pretty straightforward.

1131
02:08:02,614 --> 02:08:04,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy to, you know, get out there with the

1132
02:08:05,013 --> 02:08:15,760
[SPEAKER_05]: with the mowers, but the planting beds, you know, a mix of grasses and perennials and shrubs can, sometimes it can be a little more challenging for maintenance staff.

1133
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:31,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So we, you know, we did have earlier versions where there was a lot more planting, but some of these properties that, you know, it's a double-edged sword, some of those beds may, you know, not be maintained properly.

1134
02:08:32,359 --> 02:08:38,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we have scaled it back, um, pulled it back towards the building, kept it tight to the pads.

1135
02:08:38,442 --> 02:08:41,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's easily accessible, easily maintained.

1136
02:08:42,704 --> 02:08:52,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and you know, we'll ideally, um, you know, look good for, uh, the indefinite future.

1137
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:08,673
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned solar, do you put charging infrastructure in a facility like this?

1138
02:09:08,693 --> 02:09:10,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense for staff and residents?

1139
02:09:13,956 --> 02:09:14,657
[SPEAKER_15]: We did not.

1140
02:09:14,677 --> 02:09:21,481
[SPEAKER_15]: At some point, I'm sure it would make sense, but we do not have that.

1141
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:42,668
[SPEAKER_15]: The capacity of the building had gone up significantly because we've gone to more internalized equipment and upgrade on elevators, et cetera.

1142
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:47,153
[SPEAKER_15]: But we did not add any charging stations.

1143
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:55,712
[SPEAKER_17]: charging stations for vehicles, is that?

1144
02:09:56,272 --> 02:09:56,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1145
02:09:56,772 --> 02:09:57,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1146
02:09:57,672 --> 02:10:07,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's not part of this project, but I have been in discussions and I know there are some, a lot of great government incentive, like rebate programs going on for those.

1147
02:10:08,837 --> 02:10:15,020
[SPEAKER_17]: So it may be something that we'd definitely consider putting in in the future, but it is not a part of this project.

1148
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:19,041
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we have the ability to, and we have the residents that,

1149
02:10:21,597 --> 02:10:25,223
[SPEAKER_17]: that would like that, it's definitely something we would entertain.

1150
02:10:25,523 --> 02:10:34,438
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I said, I have been in discussions with a few vendors that do provide those electronic vehicle charging station.

1151
02:10:35,434 --> 02:10:44,222
[SPEAKER_13]: David, if I might, I'll just reach out to our office because you've been in my office is managing grant opportunities and stuff.

1152
02:10:44,703 --> 02:10:52,550
[SPEAKER_13]: You're likely eligible for a lot of what we're eligible for, and should be happy to share what we've been working like what we've found and been working on.

1153
02:10:56,375 --> 02:11:05,040
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually did find that we now have to staff in City Hall that own charging own electric cars, and do not have chargers at home.

1154
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:10,062
[SPEAKER_13]: And the fact that we had a charger at City Hall was an incentive for them.

1155
02:11:10,082 --> 02:11:12,844
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just put it out there.

1156
02:11:13,564 --> 02:11:17,066
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but yeah reach out to my office and with you.

1157
02:11:25,333 --> 02:11:27,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions or numbers.

1158
02:11:29,495 --> 02:11:31,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one really silly question.

1159
02:11:31,296 --> 02:11:33,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, really silly question.

1160
02:11:33,517 --> 02:11:34,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't be silly.

1161
02:11:36,138 --> 02:11:39,559
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting rid of the white picket fences.

1162
02:11:43,141 --> 02:11:43,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

1163
02:11:45,402 --> 02:11:45,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Completely.

1164
02:11:45,902 --> 02:11:49,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1165
02:11:50,384 --> 02:11:51,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1166
02:12:01,489 --> 02:12:05,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, absent any more questions, board members, how are we feeling about things?

1167
02:12:10,465 --> 02:12:18,869
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got one kind of category that's a little bit open, although we can work around it, which is the response to the various department letters.

1168
02:12:19,989 --> 02:12:37,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like the MHA team is, other than the Waterloo question, which would need to be satisfied to the fire department's satisfaction, it seems like they're prepared to accept the recommendations and requirements of the city departments.

1169
02:12:38,857 --> 02:12:43,359
[SPEAKER_02]: They've certainly provided a lot of additional information we haven't had a chance to read yet.

1170
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:51,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on how we're feeling about the project tonight?

1171
02:12:52,023 --> 02:12:53,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to see more?

1172
02:12:54,284 --> 02:12:56,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to ask more questions at another event?

1173
02:13:00,526 --> 02:13:03,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for me, I'm intrigued by, you know,

1174
02:13:05,910 --> 02:13:11,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben's responses and the things that he talked about that they were going to continue to study.

1175
02:13:14,735 --> 02:13:20,077
[SPEAKER_07]: That being said, I have every expectation that they'll do that.

1176
02:13:22,601 --> 02:13:25,622
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know where other people land on that.

1177
02:13:26,402 --> 02:13:44,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they have a little bit of work to do in response to the things that were brought up tonight, but whether it merits another meeting, I'm not sure.

1178
02:13:45,627 --> 02:13:47,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Other members, how are we feeling?

1179
02:13:57,890 --> 02:14:02,992
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they've answered most of our questions I think we could probably move forward.

1180
02:14:05,052 --> 02:14:06,933
[SPEAKER_16]: There doesn't seem like there's that much outstanding.

1181
02:14:06,953 --> 02:14:11,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree I think we can move forward.

1182
02:14:14,637 --> 02:14:23,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so oftentimes we'll ask for you to come back and so we can get a view or see how you might be responding with some of our comments or input.

1183
02:14:23,842 --> 02:14:27,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can have, you know, that's a nice step for us.

1184
02:14:27,484 --> 02:14:35,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We, I think, feel good about our contribution when we see the improvements that you've made and the responses that you provided.

1185
02:14:35,748 --> 02:14:37,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel, however, that

1186
02:14:38,169 --> 02:14:50,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much you're going to be able to do because you have things out to bid and you're waiting on contractors that are discussing about colors and features at the ground floor being one example.

1187
02:14:50,063 --> 02:14:54,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that that's something you're going to have clarity on in two weeks or four weeks.

1188
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:57,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that fair to say?

1189
02:15:02,182 --> 02:15:11,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I think that in, uh, in within, within a few weeks, we'll have, we'll have, we will have some clarity.

1190
02:15:11,724 --> 02:15:25,947
[SPEAKER_15]: I think part of the, uh, uh, process we need to do is, is complete, get, get internal MHA buy-in and agreement with any adjustments we make in the, in the design.

1191
02:15:25,967 --> 02:15:30,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I mean, I think that, you know, I don't, I don't think we're going in

1192
02:15:32,393 --> 02:15:35,074
[SPEAKER_15]: in a whole flip-flop of direction.

1193
02:15:35,114 --> 02:15:40,097
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're kind of on a path that we're all pretty comfortable and sound with.

1194
02:15:40,197 --> 02:15:56,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, I think some of the comments have been great, you know, and it's always helpful to have that review process and be happy to engage your group as you choose.

1195
02:15:57,344 --> 02:15:58,685
[SPEAKER_15]: I could bore you silly, I'm sure.

1196
02:16:02,442 --> 02:16:05,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all enjoy this stuff, so it's all good.

1197
02:16:05,164 --> 02:16:18,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But okay, I mean, I suppose if you deviated enough, you'd have to come back to us anyway, but I imagine you're not talking about, at least at this point, anticipating any significant deviation from where you're at and what you've presented.

1198
02:16:21,053 --> 02:16:24,235
[SPEAKER_02]: That being the case, do we have any conditions?

1199
02:16:24,315 --> 02:16:27,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, sometimes you take notes for us on that as we go.

1200
02:16:29,492 --> 02:16:32,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, let me share my screen really quickly.

1201
02:16:32,973 --> 02:16:42,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Board members feel free if we're going to try to identify maybe some potential conditions to attach to an approval.

1202
02:16:44,618 --> 02:16:52,601
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I just took a couple notes here, and folks, please feel free to jump in if I've missed something.

1203
02:16:54,129 --> 02:17:03,554
[SPEAKER_14]: I just I remember discussion about potential for adding some trash cans, maybe at the entrances to the connections to the clipper ship connector.

1204
02:17:03,575 --> 02:17:16,262
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was talk of pursuing an enterprise green community certification, complying with the recommendations of all the letters and I'll make a note here.

1205
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:25,466
[SPEAKER_14]: um, accepting the, um, the loop waterline mitigation, um, from city engineer.

1206
02:17:25,486 --> 02:17:32,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, but yeah, if, if folks have other things on here too.

1207
02:17:32,712 --> 02:17:36,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Amanda, that top part is left over from like the last meeting, right?

1208
02:17:36,675 --> 02:17:37,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1209
02:17:37,236 --> 02:17:42,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I was, I had pulled that in case anybody wanted to suggest that, um,

1210
02:17:44,736 --> 02:17:47,957
[SPEAKER_14]: that the applicant come back, but it sounds like perhaps not.

1211
02:17:55,559 --> 02:17:58,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, accepting the, what do you call the water loop?

1212
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:12,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Amanda, the Enterprise Green Communities, I believe, and maybe either Margaret or Natalie can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it's

1213
02:18:13,946 --> 02:18:16,368
[SPEAKER_15]: a requirement for the financing.

1214
02:18:16,408 --> 02:18:21,711
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it is a part of the project.

1215
02:18:25,333 --> 02:18:26,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Natalie, can you confirm that?

1216
02:18:27,755 --> 02:18:28,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1217
02:18:29,616 --> 02:18:31,257
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice is slipping away.

1218
02:18:32,137 --> 02:18:37,120
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we will be seeking Enterprise Green Community Certification.

1219
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:41,343
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that the state looks as part of their low-income housing tax credits.

1220
02:18:42,675 --> 02:18:46,357
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't have that in place of course before getting the building permit.

1221
02:18:47,538 --> 02:18:51,281
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that once the project is completed, you would get.

1222
02:18:52,552 --> 02:19:04,496
[SPEAKER_13]: So actually, let me clarify, check something, because we put conditions on projects that some of which have to be done before the building permit, but others that have to be done for the occupancy permit, right?

1223
02:19:04,536 --> 02:19:09,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Like sometimes we require a certain number of trees and that doesn't happen until afterwards.

1224
02:19:10,157 --> 02:19:18,220
[SPEAKER_13]: But I haven't tried to do an Enterprise Green Community certification, but I am pursuing LEED certification on our library.

1225
02:19:18,647 --> 02:19:27,714
[SPEAKER_13]: that building has been open and occupied, has had an occupancy permit for a year, and we are still working on the documentation for the LEED certification.

1226
02:19:28,335 --> 02:19:36,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that Enterprise Green Community Certification something that you would have before you would be seeking an occupancy permit?

1227
02:19:37,842 --> 02:19:39,183
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can answer that.

1228
02:19:39,243 --> 02:19:40,344
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer would be no.

1229
02:19:41,742 --> 02:19:56,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we can do is provide evidence of the process that we go through to be considered for enterprise green communities we do an application up front and then we will be doing a follow up report at the end of the project.

1230
02:19:57,725 --> 02:20:04,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we certainly can provide the applications as part of the building permit fee the copy of that.

1231
02:20:04,827 --> 02:20:09,848
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how the board feels about it but I'd love to see those documents for myself.

1232
02:20:10,939 --> 02:20:21,129
[SPEAKER_13]: For the, I know Gabe knows this, but for the rest of your team, I'm the planning director, but I'm also the sustainability director, and I started as our energy coordinator in the city.

1233
02:20:22,230 --> 02:20:22,931
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1234
02:20:22,971 --> 02:20:26,554
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get you the full checklist.

1235
02:20:35,192 --> 02:20:38,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, I think it's the water loop around the building.

1236
02:20:39,679 --> 02:20:43,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Accepting installation of the water loop around the building.

1237
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:15,333
[SPEAKER_02]: How do folks feel about a recommendation not to increase the parking.

1238
02:21:21,457 --> 02:21:24,480
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't have to follow it but as a recommendation.

1239
02:21:29,363 --> 02:21:33,326
[SPEAKER_07]: David, the only thing that I'm thinking is that they're in, they're increasing the number of units.

1240
02:21:41,092 --> 02:21:51,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But Gabe, what percentage of your... Let me ask it a different way.

1241
02:21:52,215 --> 02:21:54,055
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your typical parking ratio?

1242
02:21:55,696 --> 02:22:00,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Amanda, you're sharing your whole screen, so we can see the window you switched into.

1243
02:22:00,917 --> 02:22:02,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry.

1244
02:22:02,197 --> 02:22:04,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me get out of there.

1245
02:22:10,383 --> 02:22:16,584
[SPEAKER_17]: We generally plan for one parking space for every two units.

1246
02:22:20,685 --> 02:22:28,927
[SPEAKER_17]: It's so weird, certain developments, there is a higher percentage or we have a wait list for parking.

1247
02:22:29,527 --> 02:22:39,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Salt and stall, the parking is adequate right now, but there's so much turnover in elderly disabled housing.

1248
02:22:40,523 --> 02:22:50,690
[SPEAKER_17]: One month, you can have X amount of residents with permit parking passes, and three months later that changes because of, like I said, there's just a lot of turnover.

1249
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:56,713
[SPEAKER_17]: But in general, we try to plan for one parking space for every two units.

1250
02:22:57,474 --> 02:22:58,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do we have now?

1251
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:05,042
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe we're meeting that, right Ben?

1252
02:23:05,062 --> 02:23:08,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I believe it's basically meeting code.

1253
02:23:08,744 --> 02:23:16,608
[SPEAKER_15]: We have our notation that we shared earlier is more specific to how it's actually being used.

1254
02:23:17,508 --> 02:23:26,213
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's, but it's ultimately the numbers reflect the one for two units.

1255
02:23:26,775 --> 02:23:37,578
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'll add to what Gabe was just saying is that there's something sort of inversely happening here with the elderly population.

1256
02:23:37,598 --> 02:23:44,900
[SPEAKER_15]: The fewer cars there are, the fewer residents that have cars, the more likely they're having visiting nurses.

1257
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:52,842
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the visiting, the needs for visitor parking seems to kind of go inversely with that count.

1258
02:23:53,742 --> 02:23:55,383
[SPEAKER_15]: But it seems that with that,

1259
02:23:56,572 --> 02:24:07,534
[SPEAKER_15]: one space per two units works well with the population that's been going through Salt and Stall over the years.

1260
02:24:07,754 --> 02:24:10,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So is the new layout taking into account the new units?

1261
02:24:12,495 --> 02:24:13,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yeah.

1262
02:24:14,036 --> 02:24:17,216
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're adding 10 spaces?

1263
02:24:17,636 --> 02:24:20,177
[SPEAKER_15]: We're adding 11 spaces effectively.

1264
02:24:21,357 --> 02:24:25,578
[SPEAKER_15]: We're adding seven spaces to the actual current count

1265
02:24:26,362 --> 02:24:31,646
[SPEAKER_15]: but we had an overflow of I think nine spaces previously.

1266
02:24:31,766 --> 02:24:43,296
[SPEAKER_15]: So in effect, we have added for the additional units and we've reduced our overflow by four spaces.

1267
02:24:43,316 --> 02:24:47,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that make sense?

1268
02:24:49,801 --> 02:24:50,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1269
02:24:50,602 --> 02:24:52,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So David, are you suggesting you'd like to

1270
02:24:54,088 --> 02:25:00,370
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it sounds like they've got a pretty good pulse on on what their needs are but yeah.

1271
02:25:01,090 --> 02:25:04,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think, I think we should keep the parking they have.

1272
02:25:06,732 --> 02:25:08,253
[SPEAKER_13]: If I might say that.

1273
02:25:10,033 --> 02:25:16,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sorry, just just quickly I was just gonna say that, you know, to me, there's plenty of parking in the vicinity.

1274
02:25:20,054 --> 02:25:31,184
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I might add something that's been coming up that you might say that there's a lot of parking in the area, but the city is very actively looking to redevelop those other lots.

1275
02:25:31,325 --> 02:25:43,476
[SPEAKER_13]: We put out a press release about that last week, but we've also been in conversations with the senior center and the visitors to the senior center, and they are very concerned about parking.

1276
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:46,901
[SPEAKER_13]: and that if we redevelop lots, they will not have adequate parking.

1277
02:25:47,281 --> 02:26:00,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So if there was ever at a point that the housing authority had excess parking, I think there'd be a lot of interest from the senior center to figuring out a space sharing situation.

1278
02:26:02,684 --> 02:26:06,925
[SPEAKER_13]: They're very, very tight and really do not have adequate parking for the senior center.

1279
02:26:08,346 --> 02:26:09,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like for the,

1280
02:26:10,136 --> 02:26:13,757
[SPEAKER_07]: five or seven or whatever parking spaces we're talking about here it's not worth it.

1281
02:26:14,317 --> 02:26:15,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1282
02:26:19,538 --> 02:26:24,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other in, in terms of the linkage fees.

1283
02:26:25,679 --> 02:26:33,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not something that, you know, at least I know you know in other communities don't usually impact affordable housing.

1284
02:26:36,081 --> 02:26:39,122
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean I guess you have a question on whether it's even applicable.

1285
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:41,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm 99% sure that.

1286
02:26:44,673 --> 02:26:58,257
[SPEAKER_13]: I am certain because actually when I look at, when we do our linkage fee calculations, we always take out their deed restricted affordable housing and the linkage fees apply to only the market rate units.

1287
02:26:58,917 --> 02:27:02,858
[SPEAKER_13]: So because of that, I'm confident it doesn't apply here.

1288
02:27:04,298 --> 02:27:11,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Literally it applies, but then you subtract all the affordable units, which is a hundred percent of the unit.

1289
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:15,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and then the net effect is that it comes out to zero net zero.

1290
02:27:15,483 --> 02:27:19,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't have my book in front of me with my numbers but I'm confident.

1291
02:27:20,466 --> 02:27:20,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1292
02:27:21,646 --> 02:27:22,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1293
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:35,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay board members so unless we have additional thoughts conditions to add to our, our list.

1294
02:27:38,022 --> 02:27:43,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Good entertain a motion to approve with conditions, or otherwise.

1295
02:27:44,544 --> 02:27:50,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve with conditions.

1296
02:27:53,606 --> 02:27:56,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And those conditions are old Mandy took away the screen.

1297
02:27:59,027 --> 02:28:03,788
[SPEAKER_18]: As, as, as was listed on was listed.

1298
02:28:04,778 --> 02:28:09,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent to provide evidence of its pursuit of an enterprise green community certification.

1299
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:23,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Provide traffic cans at the path connections to the clipper ship connector path and shall comply with recommend the letters from the relevant authorities and other departments.

1300
02:28:25,183 --> 02:28:25,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, excellent.

1301
02:28:27,024 --> 02:28:28,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's proceed then.

1302
02:28:29,044 --> 02:28:30,885
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion and second with our

1303
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call vote.

1304
02:28:36,781 --> 02:28:38,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1305
02:28:38,342 --> 02:28:38,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1306
02:28:39,543 --> 02:28:39,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1307
02:28:40,764 --> 02:28:43,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy down.

1308
02:28:43,745 --> 02:28:44,366
[SPEAKER_02]: George Fisher.

1309
02:28:49,068 --> 02:28:50,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm an eye as well.

1310
02:28:52,748 --> 02:28:55,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to everyone who presented tonight and participated.

1311
02:28:55,329 --> 02:29:01,911
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely appreciate all of you being here and Gabe, thank you for leading the group.

1312
02:29:02,031 --> 02:29:06,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought your initial introduction was excellent and very informative.

1313
02:29:07,212 --> 02:29:14,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think everyone did a nice job just in terms of your presentation and helping the board understand what the project is all about.

1314
02:29:14,294 --> 02:29:15,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You're obviously very well prepared.

1315
02:29:16,675 --> 02:29:20,178
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of things taken off my question list from your presentation alone.

1316
02:29:20,258 --> 02:29:23,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a it's a credit to all of you.

1317
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:23,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1318
02:29:26,563 --> 02:29:26,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1319
02:29:27,263 --> 02:29:27,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1320
02:29:27,604 --> 02:29:28,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

1321
02:29:28,204 --> 02:29:28,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1322
02:29:28,524 --> 02:29:31,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a great evening.

1323
02:29:31,787 --> 02:29:32,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1324
02:29:36,271 --> 02:29:43,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, friends on the board was going to suggest if folks are okay with this to

1325
02:29:46,163 --> 02:30:04,175
[SPEAKER_02]: to defer the vote on the minutes from the October 26 meeting, more involved meeting, I haven't had a chance to read them quite as much as I'd like to, maybe others are feeling the same way, but if you don't mind, if we can punt that one to our next meeting.

1326
02:30:04,195 --> 02:30:06,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1327
02:30:07,777 --> 02:30:08,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, excellent.

1328
02:30:09,198 --> 02:30:13,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry to interrupt, just for the sake of formality, can we have a motion?

1329
02:30:15,543 --> 02:30:16,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a motion on the minutes.

1330
02:30:16,903 --> 02:30:19,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, motion to continue it to the next meeting.

1331
02:30:19,324 --> 02:30:21,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, if someone can present one of those, that would be great.

1332
02:30:22,805 --> 02:30:24,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I will make a motion to continue the meeting.

1333
02:30:25,286 --> 02:30:25,807
[SPEAKER_02]: In a second.

1334
02:30:30,448 --> 02:30:31,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we have a second?

1335
02:30:32,769 --> 02:30:33,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, I'll second.

1336
02:30:34,589 --> 02:30:34,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1337
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:38,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote, starting with Deanna.

1338
02:30:39,011 --> 02:30:39,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1339
02:30:40,051 --> 02:30:41,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And Klyce.

1340
02:30:41,992 --> 02:30:42,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1341
02:30:43,152 --> 02:30:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kristen.

1342
02:30:44,593 --> 02:30:44,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1343
02:30:45,645 --> 02:30:46,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, George.

1344
02:30:46,165 --> 02:30:47,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1345
02:30:48,047 --> 02:30:49,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm an eye as well.

1346
02:30:49,388 --> 02:30:55,092
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will continue that discussion in those minutes until our next regular scheduled meeting.

1347
02:30:57,614 --> 02:31:02,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of meetings, Amanda, am I to the point where we should be talking about our upcoming meetings?

1348
02:31:03,478 --> 02:31:07,761
[SPEAKER_14]: What a great segue.

1349
02:31:09,322 --> 02:31:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a segue now and then.

1350
02:31:11,730 --> 02:31:12,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Well done.

1351
02:31:13,310 --> 02:31:16,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so I kind of, I wanted to confirm with the group.

1352
02:31:18,352 --> 02:31:29,555
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we had talked tentatively sort of about the potential for holding a meeting December 1st, the first Thursday of December.

1353
02:31:31,135 --> 02:31:43,438
[SPEAKER_14]: As of right now, there's nothing that's been submitted that would be on the agenda, so it may not even be the case that we need this meeting, although there's a couple weeks between now and then.

1354
02:31:44,639 --> 02:31:49,200
[SPEAKER_14]: But I kind of wanted to confirm with the folks here to see that that was still available to them.

1355
02:31:51,301 --> 02:31:56,162
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the event that, you know, nothing is submitted to us, we would just cancel it.

1356
02:31:59,858 --> 02:32:01,940
[SPEAKER_02]: folks feeling good about the first.

1357
02:32:06,063 --> 02:32:09,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool, okay.

1358
02:32:09,545 --> 02:32:11,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a minute, you said December 1st?

1359
02:32:12,227 --> 02:32:14,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so, yeah, the first Thursday.

1360
02:32:14,789 --> 02:32:17,952
[SPEAKER_14]: First Thursday, yeah, I'm not available.

1361
02:32:18,612 --> 02:32:18,892
Okay.

1362
02:32:19,313 --> 02:32:19,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1363
02:32:22,615 --> 02:32:23,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry if I messed that up.

1364
02:32:24,176 --> 02:32:26,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that I responded yet.

1365
02:32:27,938 --> 02:32:28,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember.

1366
02:32:29,679 --> 02:32:33,942
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't put it on our calendars I think we were planning it out.

1367
02:32:34,422 --> 02:32:34,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1368
02:32:38,125 --> 02:32:38,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm available.

1369
02:32:38,925 --> 02:32:45,650
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about George, whatever, whatever works to get warm.

1370
02:32:51,172 --> 02:33:00,434
[SPEAKER_02]: George is in, and I'm feeling like Jackie is so solid that she would almost undoubtedly be available on the first for us, right?

1371
02:33:00,634 --> 02:33:02,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday, I don't think, was a tough one for her.

1372
02:33:02,334 --> 02:33:05,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Wednesday, I think, where she had some questions.

1373
02:33:06,775 --> 02:33:14,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's okay, I don't want to be rude to Christy if you, because you're- Oh, no, don't, that's fine.

1374
02:33:15,056 --> 02:33:15,616
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

1375
02:33:15,636 --> 02:33:16,416
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1376
02:33:17,976 --> 02:33:19,657
[SPEAKER_02]: She's calling me business.

1377
02:33:21,623 --> 02:33:23,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Amanda has a date to work with that way.

1378
02:33:24,184 --> 02:33:24,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1379
02:33:24,825 --> 02:33:26,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1380
02:33:26,946 --> 02:33:27,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

1381
02:33:27,606 --> 02:33:37,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, again, nothing is submitted that would lead me to believe that we need something in place for later that month.

1382
02:33:40,092 --> 02:33:49,697
[SPEAKER_14]: And David and I had talked about like, you know, what about the 15th holding it, but now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not even sure.

1383
02:33:50,325 --> 02:34:01,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we could like revisit that over email or even if we have the December 1st meeting, if something comes up.

1384
02:34:01,808 --> 02:34:08,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the activities light enough that maybe we don't even need to put it on the calendar.

1385
02:34:09,010 --> 02:34:09,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, right.

1386
02:34:09,931 --> 02:34:10,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1387
02:34:12,451 --> 02:34:13,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just go ahead and do that then.

1388
02:34:14,172 --> 02:34:14,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1389
02:34:16,274 --> 02:34:20,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we were going to perhaps look to flipping the calendar to 2023.

1390
02:34:21,417 --> 02:34:25,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And Emily spoke with me offline about her class schedule.

1391
02:34:26,019 --> 02:34:32,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was thinking Wednesdays would work best for her next year and in the spring semester in particular.

1392
02:34:32,742 --> 02:34:39,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jackie, I think had some question about Wednesday or like she needed to start later or something, but they're both not here.

1393
02:34:39,146 --> 02:34:43,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like that's a conversation we should save for a future meeting as well.

1394
02:34:45,061 --> 02:34:53,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a question to this group is traditionally we've been meeting around six o'clock most nights.

1395
02:34:53,706 --> 02:35:04,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, would need to confirm with Jackie, but I think that she in the past has been able to make Wednesday's work if we start at 6.30.

1396
02:35:05,373 --> 02:35:10,056
[SPEAKER_14]: And so kind of want to see if that's a possibility for the folks here.

1397
02:35:13,403 --> 02:35:15,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to say that Thursdays work way better for me.

1398
02:35:17,268 --> 02:35:23,775
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can do Wednesdays.

1399
02:35:24,096 --> 02:35:27,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do the 630 question I can answer with that's fine.

1400
02:35:27,499 --> 02:35:29,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's six or 630 is fine for me.

1401
02:35:30,483 --> 02:35:31,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, same for me.

1402
02:35:34,649 --> 02:35:38,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah, let's, maybe we'll continue this offline.

1403
02:35:38,612 --> 02:35:46,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I can send out like a when to meet or a doodle poll or something just to gauge people's availability and preferences.

1404
02:35:47,858 --> 02:36:03,569
[SPEAKER_14]: But sounds like potentially maybe Wednesday, 6.30, or we talked to, or we could, we had talked last time about like, if we had, you know, one, the first Thursday and the third Wednesday of each month,

1405
02:36:04,818 --> 02:36:06,679
[SPEAKER_14]: to kind of split the difference a bit.

1406
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:14,144
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can, I'll lay it out over email and we can figure it out there.

1407
02:36:15,065 --> 02:36:15,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that sounds good.

1408
02:36:15,865 --> 02:36:17,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be really for, we're talking 2023.

1409
02:36:18,147 --> 02:36:23,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our December 1st date and then hopefully we have our next meeting in the new year.

1410
02:36:24,531 --> 02:36:24,731
Yep.

1411
02:36:25,711 --> 02:36:26,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

1412
02:36:28,153 --> 02:36:31,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other general updates or anything?

1413
02:36:32,940 --> 02:36:34,060
[SPEAKER_02]: that we want to cover.

1414
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:37,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, you usually have a note or two for us, but if you don't, that's fine.

1415
02:36:38,021 --> 02:36:39,142
[SPEAKER_14]: I have one last thing.

1416
02:36:39,162 --> 02:36:46,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Y'all may have seen an email from me earlier today about conflict of interest training.

1417
02:36:49,224 --> 02:36:55,546
[SPEAKER_14]: This will be less relevant for George and Emily, who are newer members and so had to do this as part of

1418
02:36:56,157 --> 02:36:57,058
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of onboarding.

1419
02:36:58,499 --> 02:37:12,573
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want to check out that email, it has some details about how every two years, all city affiliated staff, of which you guys are considered as appointees from the mayor,

1420
02:37:13,550 --> 02:37:15,171
[SPEAKER_14]: have to undergo this training.

1421
02:37:16,552 --> 02:37:20,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So feel free to reach out to us if you have questions about that.

1422
02:37:21,054 --> 02:37:22,455
[SPEAKER_14]: It's laid out a bit in the email.

1423
02:37:23,655 --> 02:37:30,299
[SPEAKER_14]: And our office manager, Teresa Dupont, is happy to go over it in more detail.

1424
02:37:30,339 --> 02:37:31,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I copied her on that thread.

1425
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:34,321
[SPEAKER_14]: So please feel free to reach out to me or to her.

1426
02:37:34,341 --> 02:37:37,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you give us an idea of

1427
02:37:40,362 --> 02:37:41,663
[SPEAKER_07]: How long is this going to take?

1428
02:37:41,703 --> 02:37:42,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1429
02:37:42,723 --> 02:37:43,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, that's fair.

1430
02:37:45,085 --> 02:37:45,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, do you remember?

1431
02:37:46,006 --> 02:37:48,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I probably honestly have to do mine soon again.

1432
02:37:48,267 --> 02:37:52,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you that my feeling is that it takes on the order of 20-ish minutes.

1433
02:37:54,242 --> 02:37:57,584
[SPEAKER_13]: depending how familiar you are with all of it, if you have to read it all or not.

1434
02:37:59,265 --> 02:38:08,291
[SPEAKER_13]: The key thing to know for it is that you are considered a municipal employee for the purposes of this training.

1435
02:38:08,451 --> 02:38:14,555
[SPEAKER_13]: When it talks about employees, that means you, because that's not obvious to people who are appointed to boards.

1436
02:38:16,876 --> 02:38:18,657
[SPEAKER_13]: But it does, I think it takes about 20 minutes.

1437
02:38:18,777 --> 02:38:23,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, Amanda, it is my understanding that Emily and George were not sent it.

1438
02:38:23,928 --> 02:38:38,477
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that we recently realized is that there was some confusion and that the person who was passing these out didn't realize that employee included appointed people and thought that board members were exempt from this.

1439
02:38:38,557 --> 02:38:39,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is not true.

1440
02:38:41,279 --> 02:38:41,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1441
02:38:42,119 --> 02:38:43,400
[SPEAKER_13]: I will double check with them then.

1442
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:46,842
[SPEAKER_13]: That is one of the reasons why it's being circulated now.

1443
02:38:46,902 --> 02:38:51,745
[SPEAKER_13]: We realize that for a period of time, new appointees were not receiving it at all.

1444
02:38:54,484 --> 02:39:06,995
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and if you're wondering if you have done it recently for the city of Medford, it's incredibly likely you have not, because it was not sent to all boarding commission members with the new administration.

1445
02:39:07,015 --> 02:39:09,157
[SPEAKER_13]: So now we've been here two and a half years.

1446
02:39:10,018 --> 02:39:15,403
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like I did it way in the past but

1447
02:39:17,109 --> 02:39:27,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Mark Romley used to send it to all staff and boards and commissions, and it got lost in his transition with leaving that it didn't get picked up with somebody.

1448
02:39:32,257 --> 02:39:34,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I asked 20 minutes.

1449
02:39:40,028 --> 02:39:48,070
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can take a lot longer if you really wanna study every question and think about it and dwell on it, but it doesn't need to.

1450
02:39:52,411 --> 02:39:55,032
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have one update that's not related to that, if you want.

1451
02:39:55,512 --> 02:39:58,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want you all to know with zoning, what's going on.

1452
02:40:00,053 --> 02:40:06,815
[SPEAKER_13]: So the thing that's making me very happy right now is that our new building commissioner is being,

1453
02:40:08,595 --> 02:40:16,561
[SPEAKER_13]: He cannot handle that we do not have a GIS-based official zoning map, and it is within his purview to help fix this problem.

1454
02:40:17,021 --> 02:40:19,363
[SPEAKER_13]: It was something that just kept getting kicked down the road.

1455
02:40:19,723 --> 02:40:32,113
[SPEAKER_13]: So he is very actively working, and he's connecting with our GIS staff to get an official digitized, the version that's online, to get it officially digitized in GIS.

1456
02:40:32,573 --> 02:40:35,115
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully that will be coming pretty soon.

1457
02:40:36,612 --> 02:40:45,298
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unclear exactly how long it's gonna take, but he's on board to get this done, and our city engineer is, and they would be the ones who would adopt it.

1458
02:40:45,778 --> 02:40:50,082
[SPEAKER_13]: That process does not involve any changes, so it doesn't go to you or the council.

1459
02:40:50,542 --> 02:40:58,168
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a matter of taking the hand-drawn map and certifying that the digital version reflects the hand-drawn map.

1460
02:40:59,634 --> 02:41:00,374
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's coming.

1461
02:41:01,115 --> 02:41:15,990
[SPEAKER_13]: And the city council met about hiring a zoning lawyer, and I met with them in a committee of the whole, and they understand that they actually want planning to be done with this, and that they don't just want a lawyer but they need a planner and a lawyer.

1462
02:41:17,091 --> 02:41:19,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll likely need to get quotes.

1463
02:41:19,773 --> 02:41:29,260
[SPEAKER_13]: And they and the mayor have also agreed on a process where the city council president and I are jointly drafting a scope.

1464
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:31,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm drafting a scope and providing it to her.

1465
02:41:33,343 --> 02:41:38,467
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's gonna have like a base scope and then like additional things we could be doing.

1466
02:41:39,208 --> 02:41:44,572
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are looking to hire a lawyer and a planner together

1467
02:41:45,126 --> 02:41:54,362
[SPEAKER_13]: jointly between our office and the city council, so they would work for both of us, we would both speak to them directly to move forward.

1468
02:41:54,927 --> 02:42:08,260
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do think that we can move forward some very simple changes to the zoning pretty rapidly, possibly even before bringing a specific, a particular zoning lawyer on board for very minor changes.

1469
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:20,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we're looking at sort of a bunch of, you know, things that need a real study, things that need a little bit of analysis, and then things that are, you know,

1470
02:42:20,968 --> 02:42:22,909
[SPEAKER_13]: more, you know, simpler.

1471
02:42:23,369 --> 02:42:32,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're trying to put together a scope to then hire a planner and a consultant to work on this together and move that forward in the very near future.

1472
02:42:32,272 --> 02:42:43,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I have gotten some example scopes from other communities that we're looking at, just to sort of, because we haven't hired somebody other than for the comprehensive plan in a long time.

1473
02:42:44,508 --> 02:42:55,853
[SPEAKER_13]: and the comprehensive plan consultants are putting some best practices and some examples of stuff into the implementation section of the plan for us.

1474
02:42:55,973 --> 02:42:59,374
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is also coming and they'll be reviewing scope.

1475
02:42:59,814 --> 02:43:07,077
[SPEAKER_13]: If anybody is aware of similar, like starting to do more wholesale updates, broad changes to zoning,

1476
02:43:07,628 --> 02:43:16,191
[SPEAKER_13]: and thinks we should look at what that community did, their process, or their scope, or what they hired, I'm happy to get that.

1477
02:43:16,832 --> 02:43:19,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to take recommendations on that as well.

1478
02:43:20,913 --> 02:43:30,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Right off the bat, we're looking at some of the stuff Arlington's done recently, because they've done some types of changes that feel like in line with what's really coming.

1479
02:43:30,938 --> 02:43:38,162
[SPEAKER_13]: from us, and they're acting city planner happens to be on our comprehensive plan committee, because she's a Medford resident.

1480
02:43:39,262 --> 02:43:42,244
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you for the updates.

1481
02:43:45,285 --> 02:43:51,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn, perhaps I will make that much in a second, I will second it.

1482
02:43:52,169 --> 02:43:53,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the roll call.

1483
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:54,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Chrissy doubt.

1484
02:43:55,190 --> 02:43:55,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1485
02:44:01,399 --> 02:44:01,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1486
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:05,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a yes as well.

1487
02:44:06,063 --> 02:44:14,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much everybody tonight for your efforts and we'll see you virtually on December 1st, right?

1488
02:44:16,393 --> 02:44:17,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Possibly, yes.

1489
02:44:18,595 --> 02:44:19,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1490
02:44:19,936 --> 02:44:20,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all.

1491
02:44:20,917 --> 02:44:21,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good evening.

1492
02:44:21,718 --> 02:44:22,399
[SPEAKER_10]: See you later.

1493
