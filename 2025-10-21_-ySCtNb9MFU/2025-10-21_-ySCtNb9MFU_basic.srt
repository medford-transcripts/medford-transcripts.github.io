While our district's average score has changed little year over year, our high-needs students are falling further behind. In 2024, one in four high-needs student wasn't meeting grade level expectations. In 2025, that number grew, representing one more student per classroom slipping below grade level. A one-point change in data represents dozens of students, real kids, who need more support.
