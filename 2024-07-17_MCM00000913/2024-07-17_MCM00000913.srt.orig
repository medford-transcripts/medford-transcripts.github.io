[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, we are gonna take two cases out of order.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start with 360 Salem Street, and then move to 280 Mystic Avenue, and then take the other cases in order.

3
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:41,054

00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:45,036

00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:45,616

[SPEAKER_03]: And Yvette is not on?

25
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:02,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

26
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:08,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis, could you read 360 Salem Street?

27
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:14,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that?

28
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, not anymore.

29
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:21,945
[SPEAKER_06]: 360 Salem Street, case number A-2024-15.

30
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:37,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant and owner Habit OpCo LLC is petitioning to convert a two-unit commercial condominium at 360 Salem Street into a medical office use, which is an apartment two zoning district, thereby requiring a special permit under the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table A, Table of Use and Parking Regulations.

31
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:42,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dennis.

32
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a motion?

33
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

34
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Jamie.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,270
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we're gonna try that again.

36
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:13,633
[SPEAKER_12]: So the board received a letter from the applicant requesting to withdraw.

37
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:24,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And my understanding is also that the applicant sent a letter to city council stating that they intend to explore other locations.

38
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,918
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't intend to come back to this location.

39
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:29,774
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a lot of resident interest about this.

40
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:34,617
[SPEAKER_12]: So from my perspective, the board has heard no testimony on this case.

41
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:42,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I see no reason, in light of what we have heard as a board, to oppose the request to withdraw.

42
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:47,423
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I would like to make a motion to accept the withdrawal.

43
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a second?

44
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:54,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

45
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:56,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mary.

46
00:03:58,831 --> 00:03:59,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

47
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:01,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

48
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre?

49
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:03,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

50
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:05,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary?

51
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:07,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

52
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:09,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris?

53
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:11,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

54
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:13,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie?

55
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:20,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

56
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Five ayes, that case is withdrawn.

57
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,781
[SPEAKER_03]: 280, Mystic Ave.

58
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:51,739
[SPEAKER_06]: 280 Mystic Avenue, case number 40B-2024-01, the resumption of consideration of the petition of Combined Properties Incorporated for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40B, for multifamily eight-story apartment development located in approximately 3.2 acres of land at 278 to 282 Mystic Avenue.

59
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:02,025
[SPEAKER_06]: This proposal will be developed as an approximately 378 units consisting of a mix of one, two, and three-bedroom apartments, with 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low- or moderate-income households.

60
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dennis.

61
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:11,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand we've had a request to withdraw this case as well.

62
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:12,592
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

63
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:14,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Any discussion?

64
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:18,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

65
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:24,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so for this case, we did hear some testimony.

66
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,651
[SPEAKER_12]: The board did receive this letter requesting a withdrawal.

67
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:39,995
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is that if the applicant intends to withdraw due to the economics of the project, if they were to reapply, they would have to go through the process all over again.

68
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:45,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And so similar to the last one, I see no reason to, you know,

69
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:48,673
[SPEAKER_12]: to do anything other than accept the request to withdraw.

70
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:53,854
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would like to motion to accept the withdrawal for 280 Mystic Avenue.

71
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:56,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded.

72
00:05:58,555 --> 00:05:59,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andre.

73
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:01,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote.

[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

76
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:06,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris?

77
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:08,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

78
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:09,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

79
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:11,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

80
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:11,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre?

81
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:13,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

82
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie?

83
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:15,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

84
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, five eyes.

85
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,051
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you.

86
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that case is 28 missed.

87
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Gav is withdrawn.

88
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:33,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just want to confirm, uh, Jim Trani.

89
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you on the call?

90

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the call trying to get the volume to go.

91
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:43,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jim.

92
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:58,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to the next case, we will have Mike, Yvette, Andre, Mary, and myself vote on that one.

93
00:06:58,064 --> 00:06:58,725
[SPEAKER_03]: 28 Winford Way.

94
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:05,725
[SPEAKER_06]: 28 Winford Way, case number A-2024-07.

95
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:16,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant and owner Anthony Monaco is petitioning for a variance in the Chapter 94 City of Medford zoning to install a fence over six feet tall at 28 Winford Way, which is not allowed for the City of Medford zoning ordinance Chapter 94 sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 4.2.5.

96
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:16,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dennis.

97
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:18,759

[SPEAKER_13]: So, you guys can go ahead.

117
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:39,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we left off at the last meeting.

118
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:45,485
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not have adequate description of the plans to reduce the height of the fence.

119
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:57,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had continued so that the neighbors and the owner and developer could meet to go over the proposed plan to bring that to this meeting.

120
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:58,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

121
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:18,627
[SPEAKER_13]: so uh the neighbors is here right now uh miss lisa suggest us the last meeting to reduce the fence or the regional size the regional high so we can do that if everyone agreed over here so uh wayne is here lisa

122
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:27,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And I assume everybody included on the issues is here to solve the problem as soon as possible.

123
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,597
[SPEAKER_13]: My plan is to solve right away, right now.

124
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,680
[SPEAKER_13]: If everyone agree, we can do that.

125
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so as I understand it, there had not been any meetings with the neighbors?

126
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:41,627
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was

127
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I was there.

128
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,331
[SPEAKER_13]: I knocked the house on Fred.

129
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:52,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Fred is the back neighbor.

130
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:58,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Lynn's house or Wayne's house over there, but nobody answered.

131
00:09:59,057 --> 00:09:59,878
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's the point.

132
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:07,222
[SPEAKER_13]: But I went there to try to meet him, but nobody answers.

133
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:14,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, do we have proposed plans for the changes to the fence?

134
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:22,549
[SPEAKER_13]: The plan, the proposal is to reduce what Lisa suggested, asking us to do that.

135
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,530
[SPEAKER_13]: We can do that, so reduce to a regional size, regional height.

136
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,270
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the suggestion, it's the plan to do that.

137
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have anything to show?

138
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,052

[SPEAKER_13]: You guys have some email I can send to you guys?

158
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you guys hear me?

159
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:50,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you.

160
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:52,232
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have screen sharing rights now.

161
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:01,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Screen.

162
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys receive?

163
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:39,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can see that.

164
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:43,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I have one more picture here.

165
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:44,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me share.

166
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me share one more.

167
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,999
[SPEAKER_13]: It's easy to guys see what we do.

168
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,159
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

169
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:02,339
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

170
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:02,262
[SPEAKER_13]: I got you.

171
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:03,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys receive the second one?

172
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see that.

173
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:07,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you zoom in?

174
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:09,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very small on the screen.

175
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:16,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's a small screen, but I can explain to you guys.

176
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,662
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have 26 posts over there.

177
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:36,147
[SPEAKER_13]: So the original defense now, it's a match in some posts of the right side of the property.

178
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,368
[SPEAKER_13]: So we start with the first post.

179
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:42,329
[SPEAKER_13]: It's close to the lean.

180
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:44,339
[SPEAKER_13]: the Lisa property.

181
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:58,268
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have 106 inches and our proposal you took or take 25 inches and everywhere in the whole post.

182
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:06,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's our proposal, remove and we reduce to original size of the fence.

183
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys follow me?

184
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:26,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to, I cannot visualize what you're showing us right now.

185
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:37,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean the, so you're bringing all of the fence down to six feet, six and a quarter feet.

186
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:42,573
[SPEAKER_13]: What'd you say again?

187
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:43,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

188
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, this is Andre.

189
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:57,134
[SPEAKER_14]: On the screen, I could maybe see it a little bit better on the computer.

190
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:12,763
[SPEAKER_14]: It's bringing the fence down 25 inches across the board everywhere, but it was still varied from something like 91 inches to 77 inches or something like that.

191
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:17,266
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not six feet.

192
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:19,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Not six and a quarter around.

193
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:22,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

194
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:34,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and as I understand that you mentioned that you tried to speak with the neighbors, but there was no engagement with the neighbors at this point.

195
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:48,334
[SPEAKER_13]: I think

196
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Lisa wanna share something.

197
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:56,108
[SPEAKER_13]: She's hands up.

198
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's give the opportunity to her to tell something.

199
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:08,133
[SPEAKER_10]: May I speak?

200
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:10,655
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Lisa DeFabritas, one of the voters.

201
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:14,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's time to speak or you want me to wait.

202
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,878
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we haven't opened it up for public comment yet.

203
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I didn't think so.

204
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:19,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

205
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll open it up to the board for any questions to the applicant.

206
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:29,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is Andre.

207
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:33,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have a question.

208
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:34,846
[SPEAKER_14]: So last month,

209
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:46,725
[SPEAKER_14]: We gave you an additional month to talk to the neighbors and to present us with some plans in advance so that we could see that.

210
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:51,990
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to ask you why that didn't happen.

211
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:10,807
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

212
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,832
[SPEAKER_13]: My microphone is not very good, so you guys ask me something or no?

213
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:19,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, this is Andre, one of the board members.

214
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,111
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked you last month.

215
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:41,065
[SPEAKER_14]: We some of our board members did not want to extend this, but we voted to give you an additional month's extension so that you could show us everything, send the materials in advance so that we could see it for the fence and also that you could talk to the neighbors.

216
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:44,608
[SPEAKER_14]: The neighbors seem to express a willingness that

217
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:49,350
[SPEAKER_14]: talking to you but they needed to have the information.

218
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,212
[SPEAKER_14]: We as a board need to have the information.

219
00:21:52,672 --> 00:22:07,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm disappointed that that hasn't happened and that there was only one attempt to walk by and knock on a neighbor's door and that this information we didn't get and neighbors didn't see it until yesterday.

220
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:08,020
[SPEAKER_14]: The point is,

221
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:16,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Over there has a fence.

222
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,375
[SPEAKER_13]: The house needs a fence.

223
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I think everyone agreed with this.

224
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:22,659
[SPEAKER_13]: The house has a fence.

225
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:31,688
[SPEAKER_13]: One neighbor, one specific neighbor, ask us, make the big complaint with how big is the fence.

226
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,189
[SPEAKER_13]: We are here to solve.

227
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,590
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so easy.

228
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:36,152
[SPEAKER_13]: What she want to do?

229
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know what I mean?

230
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:40,282
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the thought?

231
00:22:40,722 --> 00:22:42,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, reduce the size.

232
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:43,785
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, we are here to reduce.

233
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:45,346
[SPEAKER_13]: It's as simple as that.

234
00:22:45,366 --> 00:23:05,642
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need to spend more time with you guys, from you guys, from the city hall, from my time, from the owner of the house time, from the Lisa's time, because everybody needs to do something maybe more important and then discuss about the fans.

235
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:06,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know what I mean?

236
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:13,647
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, she's very upset about the fence.

237
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:15,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's very good.

238
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,149
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so easy.

239
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:17,730
[SPEAKER_13]: What does she want to do?

240
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do it.

241
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,731
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so easy to solve.

242
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:21,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know what I mean?

243
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:29,977
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need monthly and monthly and monthly meetings to solve a problem like this.

244
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:32,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Mr. Costa, I agree with you 100%.

245
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:36,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to be wasting our board's time on this either.

246
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:38,920
[SPEAKER_14]: This should have been resolved a long time ago.

247
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,722
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we wanted you to resolve it with the neighbors and then come to us and tell us that it's resolved.

248
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:53,724
[SPEAKER_14]: But we can't resolve it here at the meeting, especially when you're showing us fence heights that are over the legal limit.

249
00:23:55,296 --> 00:24:03,424
[SPEAKER_13]: So, okay, but the original size, if she agreed right now to say, okay, Yuri, okay, I agree.

250
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the other neighbors.

251
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:06,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we agree.

252
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:10,571
[SPEAKER_13]: We can go there tomorrow and solve the problem forever.

253
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:11,631
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

254
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:12,532
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my point.

255
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:26,262
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need, because I went there, I knocked the house, nobody answered one time, two times, because everyone over here on this meeting has something to do.

256
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:27,422
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

257
00:24:27,703 --> 00:24:32,086
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, we have the very good opportunity to solve.

258
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:36,349
[SPEAKER_13]: If Liz had said, OK, my dream is

259
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:38,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Reduce the fans.

260
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Lisa, let's reduce the fans.

261
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,311
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's all very simple guys.

262
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:48,734
[SPEAKER_13]: So sorry about the guys, but gentlemen and ladies, it's so simple to solve.

263
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know what I mean?

264
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:54,957
[SPEAKER_13]: We are here to serve you guys.

265
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:01,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Jamie just acknowledged me, so I'm gonna speak.

266
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I wish it were that simple.

267
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:23,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, currently, the board has three letters from three neighbors, all of which say either they aren't okay with the proposal as it stands, or they have spent a lot of time on this and are on vacation and can't make it to the meeting and

268
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:29,754
[SPEAKER_12]: aren't, don't want the board to act tonight and would be open to yet another continuation.

269
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:34,933
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a mixture of no's or please don't act on this tonight.

270
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:36,034
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not that simple.

271
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:51,462
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, but I do agree with the proponent that, you know, since we have one of the neighbors here who would like to speak in the public portion of the hearing, maybe we just open the public portion of the hearing and get an update from them.

272
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:54,284
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as a board, I'm sure we'll have enough information to decide this.

273
00:25:54,424 --> 00:25:55,805
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be my recommendation.

274
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

275
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and open it for the neighbors.

276
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:06,357
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could raise your hand and I'll zoom.

277
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:12,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

278
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:14,327
[SPEAKER_10]: May I go?

279
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:15,549
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Lisa Deferidis.

280
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:16,290
[SPEAKER_10]: May I speak?

281
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:18,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

282
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

283
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:26,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I am literally at a loss for words at everything I've heard so far.

284
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,285
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like, it's laughable and at the same time offensive to all of us neighbors.

285
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:34,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll tell you why.

286
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:36,389
[SPEAKER_10]: This is, as you said, now the third meeting.

287
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:42,919
[SPEAKER_10]: This matter of the complaints against the fence has been ongoing for one year with City Hall.

288
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,809
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been started off with the City Hall going out to the owner to tell them to bring the fence down.

289
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it was letters.

290
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:52,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it was fines.

291
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:57,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And then nothing, nobody, not an owner contractor just ignored everything.

292
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:05,618
[SPEAKER_10]: And we got to the point that the city hall was, gave the, served the owner and the contractor's letters that they're taking them to court to get them to comply.

293
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,719
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how the variance request was finally submitted after almost a year.

294
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:19,325
[SPEAKER_10]: This is now our third meeting, and all of us neighbors are very exhausted to be here every once a month and having to go through this.

295
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:20,626
[SPEAKER_10]: This is so unnecessary.

296
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:25,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to add, I've sent the board two emails in the past two days and pictures.

297
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope all of you have had a chance to look at those.

298
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:34,578
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you already stated he reached out to the neighbors.

299
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:41,809
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's laughable because he only texted the neighbors, two neighbors, the two of us, three of butters.

300
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:47,374
[SPEAKER_10]: He texted two abutters yesterday for the first time.

301
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:53,595
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a whole month after your instructions after the last meeting to reach out and try to resolve this.

302
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:57,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I have never been contacted.

303
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:58,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I work from home.

304
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:01,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I have cameras around my house.

305
00:28:01,737 --> 00:28:02,917
[SPEAKER_10]: No one came to my house.

306
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:07,058
[SPEAKER_10]: No one left a note on my door saying, hey, we'd like to meet with you and talk with you.

307
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:08,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we all meet with the neighbors?

308
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:09,499
[SPEAKER_10]: We all live here.

309
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,481
[SPEAKER_10]: No one reached out.

310
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:19,433
[SPEAKER_10]: The texts that went on yesterday were between two of the voters excluding me and I'm the one who initiated this whole thing.

311
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:20,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

312
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:24,300
[SPEAKER_10]: And even my two other neighbors who are on this zoom call now.

313
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:31,405
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them I spoke with directly, and the other one indirectly, are very offended as I am.

314
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:36,128
[SPEAKER_10]: After two months that these people still wait to the last second.

315
00:28:36,568 --> 00:28:41,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting back to the bottom line defenses, their proposal, they come at the last minute.

316
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:43,492
[SPEAKER_10]: No one seen anything.

317
00:28:43,952 --> 00:28:45,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Say, hey, come, what do you think?

318
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at the hype, make a mob.

319
00:28:47,154 --> 00:28:48,255
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think would be good?

320
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:58,942
[SPEAKER_10]: You know something, I took pictures yesterday and I sent it to the board because on my side of the fence, not their side, the owner's, the stain is already getting discolored.

321
00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:02,704
[SPEAKER_10]: The wood is starting to look crap because they did a shitty job and then shitty wood.

322
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:08,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And I sent you pictures because they only stained half of the backside of the wood.

323
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:10,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I've showed, I sent you pictures showing that.

324
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:11,870
[SPEAKER_10]: That wood's going to rot.

325
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:28,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you really think these people, if I agree to keep an extra foot or two feet above my fence to look at their wood, that I can trust that they'd even maintain that wood so that it wouldn't start looking ugly and discolored and rotted wood?

326
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:29,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

327
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:30,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said in my email,

328
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:38,865
[SPEAKER_10]: If my fence was even six inches higher than their fence, do you really think they'd be happy with that?

329
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:43,088
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fact that you already mentioned, like, oh, this is easy.

330
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are they complaining?

331
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

332
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,813
[SPEAKER_10]: You built a fence that you know better.

333
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:48,934
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a contractor.

334
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:51,396
[SPEAKER_10]: You built a fence that was over cold.

335
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:54,017
[SPEAKER_10]: what is non-compliant and out of code.

336
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,098
[SPEAKER_10]: You never got permission from the city.

337
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:02,920
[SPEAKER_10]: You never responded in one year to all the letters and the calls from City Hall.

338
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And now you've been told two times by this board in two different meetings to reach out.

339
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:12,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you just direct any information through the chair, not directly to the applicant?

340
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:13,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, thank you.

341
00:30:13,664 --> 00:30:19,126
[SPEAKER_10]: So the contractor was instructed two different times in two different meetings to reach out to the neighbors.

342
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:23,867
[SPEAKER_10]: You made it very clear to them last month, and they never did.

343
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:27,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I have never been contacted by the owner or the contractor.

344
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:36,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the owner has been on the zoom call since the beginning, never speaks never shows his face has the contract to talk and then they sit here now at the last minute.

345
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:37,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, let's all talk it.

346
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:45,589
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not a meeting for us to pass yourself, they had two months to do this, and they only contacted two neighbors.

347
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,591
[SPEAKER_10]: two days ago, and they never contacted me.

348
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:49,731
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sorry.

349
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:53,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I put in my email to all of you, this is disrespectful.

350
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:55,293
[SPEAKER_10]: This is wasting our time.

351
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:59,835
[SPEAKER_10]: It's offensive to everybody, to the board, to our neighbors, and all of us.

352
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:08,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And my neighbor, Jenny Schnabel, who's on the line, and Lynn and Wayne are on the line,

353
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:24,472
[SPEAKER_10]: And when the letter you said that he wouldn't make a decision, meaning he wouldn't make a decision, and I'll let my neighbor Jenny confirm that, meaning his email to you was he wasn't going to make a decision to agree to it to more than six feet, but he supports the six feet.

354
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,194
[SPEAKER_10]: But he just would not agree to anything higher.

355
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,036
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what his intended email to you was about.

356
00:31:31,576 --> 00:31:32,917
[SPEAKER_10]: So my request is this.

357
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:35,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the fence down to six feet.

358
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:38,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to look at his fence that's starting to look discolored.

359
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:39,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I have my fence.

360
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,161
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you guys have a code, six feet.

361
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:46,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So nobody has to look at somebody else's eyes or other discolored fence.

362
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:47,703
[SPEAKER_10]: This is ridiculous.

363
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:49,304
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just so disrespectful.

364
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:50,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very upset, as you can see.

365
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:58,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I hope, I really ask the board, I hope this concludes this evening, because this is a waste of everybody's time.

366
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:09,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I said, no one, contractor owner, has done nothing, not once, to reach out to us, and particularly me, haven't heard a peep.

367
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:10,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

368
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Lisa.

369
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you just give your address quickly?

370
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry?

371
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you give your address?

372
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm 32 Winford Way, so I'm 32.

373
00:32:21,346 --> 00:32:23,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though it's 28, there's no 30.

374
00:32:23,427 --> 00:32:25,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm literally the next door.

375
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:26,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

376
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:30,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Chamber, can I tell something?

377
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:34,192
[SPEAKER_03]: We're open for public comment for the neighbors right now.

378
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other neighbors that would like to speak?

379
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:44,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the Amigos have their hand raised.

380
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:46,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

381
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr Chairman to the board.

382
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Lennon Wayne Amico 24 Alden Lane.

383
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:53,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just a couple of comments.

384
00:32:53,657 --> 00:32:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I agree with what Lisa saying.

385
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre, thank you for your support and clarification as to what the applicant is now proposing.

386
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:23,678
[SPEAKER_02]: we uh you guys were very specific at the last meeting you requested a plan be submitted indicating what the applicant what was desiring to do and then coordinate with the neighbor i'm not disputing uh the applicants a contractor might have tried to knock on the door i can't say whether he did or not we didn't speak with him tuesday of this week my wife received an email chain

387
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:27,279
[SPEAKER_02]: from, I believe it was Yuri or his representative.

388
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa is correct, she was not included on that to my understanding.

389
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:34,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Fred and myself, Fred and Lynn were, excuse me.

390
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically the email, the text chain said, could you guys please confirm that you're okay with the proposal?

391
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:44,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And our response was, what proposal?

392
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:45,888
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen anything.

393
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:54,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, this plan that you see on the screen that Andrea, someone was sharing, was sent around to us.

394
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,989
[SPEAKER_02]: We are happy to see that something is being proposed, but honestly, I don't want to debate this with my neighbors during this public hearing.

395
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:09,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the opportunity to discuss it with Lisa and Fred and Jenny, etc., to determine what we all feel is the appropriate height.

396
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:27,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's the board's choice what they decide to do tonight, but we are extremely upset that this was brought to us 24 hours ahead of this meeting, and now tonight we're supposed to all agree without having an opportunity to calmly talk about this with the neighbors and decide what's best for everybody.

397
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:28,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

398
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:35,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the fence goes up to 92 inches.

399
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:39,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's still in various spots.

400
00:34:41,075 --> 00:35:09,069
[SPEAKER_01]: various heights and you know we can't like you've given him a lot of time to come up with something my son is in the house he's there almost every day no one has knocked on our door no one has left us a letter no one has done anything to to try to be neighborly and we've all lived in that neighborhood i grew up there i mean we all are neighbors we all have gotten along we've never had any kind of situation like this in the past and yes it could have very easily been taken care of if they did the right thing with coming to the

401
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:13,019
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to the neighbors and finding out what they thought.

402
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:18,462
[SPEAKER_01]: But giving us 24 hours notice, people have a lot of medical things going on and just life.

403
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:26,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just not fair to put on us 24 hours ahead of time and say, send me a text saying it's OK.

404
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:27,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's OK?

405
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:28,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

406
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were very clear what you needed.

407
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:33,572
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a whole month to get in touch with us.

408
00:35:34,392 --> 00:35:35,413
[SPEAKER_01]: No one did till 24 hours before.

409
00:35:38,695 --> 00:35:39,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to say.

410
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:41,877
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very frustrating at this point to everybody.

411
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:43,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

412
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your statement.

413
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:49,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go back.

414
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:51,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other neighbors that want to make a comment?

415
00:35:53,424 --> 00:35:56,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, this is- Oh, you're muted.

416
00:35:57,547 --> 00:35:58,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you unmute again?

417
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:02,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Jennifer Schnabel.

418
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:06,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the neighbors at 22 Alden Lane, the back neighbor.

419
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:20,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't part of the email or text chains that went on, but I'm familiar with everything that Lynn has been saying and Lisa has been saying.

420
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:25,992
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be happy to talk about it.

421
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:42,462
[SPEAKER_00]: We would still be happy to talk about it in person, to look at it all together, but being able to make that decision with the information that we received only recently isn't enough time to be able to say, yes, we're okay with it.

422
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,063
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I have to say.

423
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:46,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

424
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:48,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

425
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:53,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else from the public that wants to make a comment?

426
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:58,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is Lisa DeFabritis again at 32 Winford Way.

427
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, but I'm tired.

428
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:05,740
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a year, and I feel very disrespected, offended by everybody on the owner and contractor.

429
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not willing to have this discussion anymore.

430
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:11,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to look at the fence.

431
00:37:11,323 --> 00:37:13,984
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already getting discolored.

432
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:18,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not willing to compromise.

433
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,667
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the fence down to six feet.

434
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:20,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a fence.

435
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:24,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want something over my fence that's different than mine.

436
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:26,788
[SPEAKER_10]: The other two abutters don't have a fence.

437
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:29,529
[SPEAKER_10]: So for them, it might be OK for them, as they mentioned.

438
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:31,409
[SPEAKER_10]: But they still feel it's way too high.

439
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:34,050
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too high for them.

440
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,950
[SPEAKER_10]: But they don't have a fence.

441
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,211
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a contrast between their fence and the owner's fence.

442
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:42,211
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, it does.

443
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:49,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So as far as I'm concerned, I strongly and I feel, I'm sorry, I want the fence down to six feet per code.

444
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:50,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

445
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:55,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Lisa.

446
00:37:56,094 --> 00:38:02,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody, any other public comment?

447
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:04,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's Lynn again, 24 Alden Lane.

448
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:17,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we want to be in compliance, like if the back neighbors decide that they, if Jen and Fred decide they want, whatever, we wanna be in the same area as they are.

449
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:21,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really have to discuss it because no one has discussed it with us.

450
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:28,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we don't have a fence on our side, but this is getting ridiculous, and we want to also be with our neighbors.

451
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:29,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we want to be at the same height with them.

452
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,990
[SPEAKER_01]: We want everything to look uniform.

453
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,011
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always done stuff together as a neighborhood.

454
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not anything different than what we've ever done.

455
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:40,393
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never come across this, but we want to be with Fred's fence height also.

456
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,974
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to look, what's the word I'm looking for, conforming?

457
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:43,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, uniform.

458
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:44,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Uniform.

459
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:45,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

460
00:38:56,468 --> 00:39:00,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, any other comment from any other individuals from the public?

461
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that has not spoken?

462
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So, can I tell something?

463
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come back to you, Yuri.

464
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:14,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure nobody else has anything to add.

465
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:15,463
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

466
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:23,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Yuri, go ahead.

467
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:45,733
[SPEAKER_13]: okay let's let's solve this now now exactly now so lisa reduce to six it's a good enough for you to six feet yeah which is the height of my my fence awesome awesome awesome okay just yes or no so wayne reduce to six that's good for you

468
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:54,420
[SPEAKER_10]: So Wayne, he's asking to the six feet, which is.

469
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm sorry, this meeting is not for you to discuss what to do.

470
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:01,926
[SPEAKER_03]: The plan was supposed to be in place.

471
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:03,347
[SPEAKER_03]: This meeting is for a decision.

472
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:08,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had the, do you have anything you want to add from a data perspective, Yuri?

473
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:11,813
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I just want to solve now.

474
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:13,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Not for discussion between you and the residents.

475
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:15,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, sounds good.

476
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:22,921
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you, Council Chambers, if you say, Yuri, reduce over there, I can do that tomorrow.

477
00:40:23,582 --> 00:40:24,122
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

478
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:31,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to solve, just we not lose time, lose time, lost the time, lost the time every month.

479
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:32,669
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

480
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:36,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

481
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:38,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a motion?

482
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:42,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

483
00:40:44,913 --> 00:40:45,433
[SPEAKER_03]: seconded.

484
00:40:46,454 --> 00:40:47,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andre.

485
00:40:48,294 --> 00:40:49,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Yvette.

486
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:53,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Andre.

487
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:57,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Mary.

488
00:40:57,337 --> 00:41:00,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Mike.

489
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:02,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jim.

490
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:03,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

491
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie.

492
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I right.

493
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,621
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in deliberation.

494
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:11,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Any comments from the board discussion?

495
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:19,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Mike.

496
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:23,365
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very clear at the last meeting.

497
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:36,632
[SPEAKER_12]: My guidance was talk to the neighbor, and if they're amenable to a fence height over six foot, great, present some plans, we'll consider it.

498
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:40,894
[SPEAKER_12]: The lot is irregular in some portions, not on that side.

499
00:41:42,615 --> 00:41:45,397
[SPEAKER_12]: We got a proposal more than six feet,

500
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Neighbor wasn't talked to, neighbor doesn't like it, neighbor wants six feet.

501
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:51,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Six feet is allowed by right.

502
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:55,099
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not in favor of the proposal.

503
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:05,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think the applicant has met the standard approved to establish a hardship to allow a fence of this height on all portions of their property.

504
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

505
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else from the board?

506
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:17,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, says Andre.

507
00:42:18,157 --> 00:42:22,519
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really see another possible decision other than just enforcing the six foot height.

508
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:28,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, you know, I would note that there are there are places where the neighbor has posts that go above the six foot height.

509
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:39,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would expect that the neighbor would also, uh, take those posts down to six feet because I don't want to continue this, uh, problem any further.

510
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:45,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andre.

511
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:49,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other comments from the board?

512
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:52,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also in agreement with that as well.

513
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see it go down to six feet.

514
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:03,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in agreement with everyone on the board, the sentiments right now.

515
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:11,602
[SPEAKER_13]: So, okay for me.

516
00:43:12,142 --> 00:43:14,283
[SPEAKER_13]: We start the job tomorrow.

517
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

518
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:19,793
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in deliberation now, it's just for the board speakers.

519
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:22,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like it.

520
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:26,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna motion to approve the requested fence height variance.

521
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second that.

522
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:35,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, for the board, we have a motion to approve.

523
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:43,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind that for the roll call vote, if you disagree with the motion to approve, you would want to vote nay.

524
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:46,093
[SPEAKER_03]: If you support, you would want to vote yay.

525
00:43:46,597 --> 00:43:47,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, hold on.

526
00:43:47,137 --> 00:43:48,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you just go through this one more time?

527
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,181
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is to approve.

528
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:57,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you do not agree with the motion to approve, you want to vote nay.

529
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:04,909
[SPEAKER_12]: So to be clear, a yay is grant the variance, a nay is deny the variance.

530
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:07,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

531
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,873
[SPEAKER_14]: But the variance is for above the six feet, right?

532
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:11,454
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to be clear.

533
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:15,997
[SPEAKER_14]: We're denying the variance, then that's the six feet.

534
00:44:18,032 --> 00:44:21,354
[SPEAKER_12]: denying the variance amounts to the bi-right, which would be six feet.

535
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:21,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

536
00:44:22,055 --> 00:44:22,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

537
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:23,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Just want to be super clear.

538
00:44:23,876 --> 00:44:28,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

539
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:29,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Andre?

540
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:32,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Nay.

541
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:35,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary?

542
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:37,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Nay.

543
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:39,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

544
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:40,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Nay.

545
00:44:42,068 --> 00:44:42,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim?

546
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:43,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Nay.

547
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie?

548
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:45,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Nay.

549
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,772
[SPEAKER_03]: motion, the variance is denied.

550
00:44:54,336 --> 00:44:55,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody for your patience on that.

551
00:44:57,138 --> 00:45:04,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Dennis, can we... Excuse me, Mr. Chair, just, Mr. Chair.

552
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:17,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you just to be really clear, to make sure that the proponent understands the decision, can someone, maybe Dennis or somebody follow up with Yuri just to explain that?

553
00:45:19,146 --> 00:45:19,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

554
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:20,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

555
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:26,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Yuri, we'll follow up with you just to explain the results of the decision.

556
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:32,096
[SPEAKER_13]: And that will be... All right, so the point is...

557
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:37,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Yuri, reduce and we solve the problem right now, right?

558
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:41,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now you're limited to a six foot fence.

559
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:42,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

560
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:43,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

561
00:45:43,862 --> 00:45:44,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

562
00:45:44,723 --> 00:45:49,447
[SPEAKER_13]: So everybody can take care about our life and their life.

563
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:51,248
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and let's go ahead.

564
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Easy, easy.

565
00:45:55,431 --> 00:45:56,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

566
00:45:57,152 --> 00:46:00,795
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank you guys so much for a patient, for the time, for everything.

567
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:05,351
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

568
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:08,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

569
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:10,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to the next case.

570
00:46:10,215 --> 00:46:11,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yvette, have you been able to join?

571
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:11,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

572
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Next case, 65, Sydney.

573
00:46:17,781 --> 00:46:18,101
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

574
00:46:35,315 --> 00:46:36,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me to read it?

575
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:49,341
[SPEAKER_03]: For anybody that has joined that was looking to hear anything on 360 Salem Street, that application was withdrawn.

576
00:46:50,662 --> 00:46:53,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We voted and accepted the withdrawal without prejudice.

577
00:47:04,142 --> 00:47:05,903
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, 65 Sydney Street.

578
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:20,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant and owner Matthew Salamone is petitioning for a variance in the Chapter 94 City Method Zoning to construct a shed over 200 square feet at 65 Sydney Street, which is too close to the existing house and the side plot line, which is not allowed for the City Method Zoning Chapter 94, Section 4.3.2.

579
00:47:24,557 --> 00:47:25,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dennis.

580
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

581
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:31,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Matthew Salamone.

582
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Matthew.

583
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and present the information you have for us.

584
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:41,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, the shed is under 200 square feet.

585
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:51,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to make that clear because when I started building this almost two years ago, I was doing some research online.

586
00:47:51,403 --> 00:48:01,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time, I thought I had read if it's under 200 square feet with no electricity and no plumbing, it's within the code.

587
00:48:02,023 --> 00:48:10,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I've since found out through Dennis and multiple visits at City Hall that each city has its own code regardless to what the state code is.

588
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:18,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I didn't think any permit or any permission needed because it was under 200 square feet.

589
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:22,239
[SPEAKER_05]: But that, I guess, is a Massachusetts general law.

590
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,581
[SPEAKER_05]: So two summers ago, I went to build this shed.

591
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:29,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did it because I just wanted to be able to store

592
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:35,728
[SPEAKER_05]: yard stuff, barrels and everything to make the house look better on the outside.

593
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:39,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought siding to match the house.

594
00:48:39,831 --> 00:48:42,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought fencing to match the next door neighbor's fence.

595
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:47,515
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it was completed, it just looked like a shed that matched the house and everything.

596
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:53,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was about three quarters of the way done and we got a cease and desist order.

597
00:48:56,283 --> 00:49:01,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And since then, I found out a lot of stuff that I didn't know about permit and zoning.

598
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:07,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've spoken to Dennis multiple times.

599
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:13,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I've drawn a map of the property and the distances and stuff.

600
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:22,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess what I've come to find out is because of the space on the side of our yard, I'm about two and a half feet off of

601
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:25,454
[SPEAKER_05]: what is allowed by MEDFED.

602
00:49:26,074 --> 00:49:35,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So the shed is already up, the foundation, the walls, the roof, it just needs the siding and the door put on, but I haven't been able to finish it.

603
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:40,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's nowhere else on our yard on either side in the back to put it.

604
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:50,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So my request now that I have all the information is for a variance of two and a half feet from the property line.

605
00:49:51,634 --> 00:50:03,986
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, our property line actually goes beyond our fence, but when you measure it out, it's just about two and a half feet, I guess, off of the seven and a half foot that's required.

606
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:07,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, this has been going on for almost two years.

607
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:14,756
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it was misinformation, you know, a lot of it on my part, but even since I've had the information,

608
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:21,163
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've done multiple times to try to get this resolved.

609
00:50:22,164 --> 00:50:30,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last time I was in his office and he told me to fill out the form and apply for the permit and do the drawing and stuff.

610
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did.

611
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were supposed to have a meeting last month.

612
00:50:32,856 --> 00:50:33,477
[SPEAKER_05]: But I.

613
00:50:34,518 --> 00:50:39,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I was supposed to be informed of it or if I was supposed to ask, but I didn't know.

614
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:42,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only reason we weren't there for the last month's meeting.

615
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:44,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're here.

616
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:46,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping we can resolve this.

617
00:50:47,027 --> 00:50:51,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, the shed is under 200 square feet, no electricity, no plumbing.

618
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:57,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be able to put the yard tools, the barrels, the picnic table, the summer chairs in it.

619
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:03,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So the house looks neat and there's nothing on the side of the house, because we have short chain link fence.

620
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:05,308
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything stored on the side of the house, you can see.

621
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:07,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it.

622
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:11,191
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you, Mr. Salamone.

623
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:15,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Opening up to any questions from the board members for the applicant.

624
00:51:21,877 --> 00:51:24,739
[SPEAKER_03]: For board members on Zoom, go right ahead.

625
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:33,106
[SPEAKER_03]: No questions at the moment?

626
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:45,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, can you hear me?

627
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:54,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so my question is, have you talked with your neighbor on that side about their thoughts on the position of the shed?

628
00:51:55,336 --> 00:51:59,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe I saw an indication one way or the other in your application whether the neighbor

629
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:05,565
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, has a stance on the Shad, whether they support having it there.

630
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:20,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, so since this has gotten to this stage over the last three or four months, I've seen and talked to the neighbor multiple times.

631
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:32,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing has been brought up about the shed or anything, but this is a neighbor that is a single mother that I've known since I grew up when this house belonged to my great aunt and my father before I bought it.

632
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:34,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I snowblower house, I do her grass.

633
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:43,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine she has a problem because I talk to her regularly in passing and she's never said anything.

634
00:52:43,348 --> 00:52:50,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, last year she dropped me a $50 Home Depot card in my mailbox because I snowblow her driver in a walkway.

635
00:52:52,682 --> 00:53:09,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't spoken to anybody about it, but the only neighbor that is next to me is somebody who, you know, I think that we know well, and I do a lot to help out in all the bushes that are on both of our property I maintain and everything.

636
00:53:09,128 --> 00:53:12,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't see that being a problem.

637
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:15,770
[SPEAKER_05]: The neighbor across the street, I don't know.

638
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:17,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know,

639
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:20,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody said anything when they put up an eight foot fence.

640
00:53:21,172 --> 00:53:27,754
[SPEAKER_05]: The other neighbor across the street house has been condemned for three or four years and he still lives there and nobody talks to him.

641
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:30,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the house looks like it's from Jumanji.

642
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:33,736
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not really anybody who could complain, I think.

643
00:53:36,156 --> 00:53:36,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

644
00:53:36,837 --> 00:53:40,578
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I'm hearing is maybe the immediately abutting neighbor

645
00:53:41,947 --> 00:53:50,273
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't specifically tell you, yes, I like the shed there, but you have a good relationship with them and interact with them often.

646
00:53:50,413 --> 00:53:55,576
[SPEAKER_12]: And they've had well over a year to complain and to your knowledge, they have no issues with it.

647
00:53:58,414 --> 00:53:59,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

648
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:14,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Disregarding all the other stuff, the immediate abutting neighbor to the left of the house is, well to the right of the house, is somebody who I see in passing regularly and I help out with seasonal stuff at her house and they have never said anything

649
00:54:14,973 --> 00:54:17,234
[SPEAKER_05]: for or against, it's never even been brought up.

650
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And just as like an added, not only did I get siding to match the house, I bought fencing to match the new fence they put up a couple of years ago.

651
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:29,041
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like streamlined, it looks like it's one fence going across.

652
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

653
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:42,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions from the board or do we have the building commissioner on if you wanna make any comments?

654
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, you had your hand up.

655
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to say something?

656
00:54:52,758 --> 00:54:56,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Building Commissioner?

657
00:54:57,603 --> 00:54:58,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead, Chris.

658
00:54:58,945 --> 00:54:59,645
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

659
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:03,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I just wanted to say that Michael asked my question.

660
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:03,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

661
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:12,093
[SPEAKER_15]: I was only gonna comment that we have basically two different codes in play here.

662
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:21,095
[SPEAKER_15]: The building code does not require a building permit per se, but Medford zoning ordinance does require a setback as an accessory structure.

663
00:55:21,195 --> 00:55:22,315
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is the root of this.

664
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:27,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Commissioner.

665
00:55:29,477 --> 00:55:30,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just add that,

666
00:55:32,676 --> 00:55:39,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It may have not been the best way to go about it, but the research I did, I didn't know about that.

667
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:56,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, I'm talking Google searches for Massachusetts and stuff, but it was just, all I really got out of it, which now I know isn't the totality of it, is that, you know, if it has electricity or plumbing, or if it's over 200 square feet, there's more to it.

668
00:55:56,368 --> 00:56:05,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The zoning part of it, I didn't find out till later, you know, after we had already put it up, you know, and that's my fault.

669
00:56:09,415 --> 00:56:09,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

670
00:56:12,981 --> 00:56:17,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have any other questions from the board at the moment, so I'll open it for public comment.

671
00:56:46,122 --> 00:56:48,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, no public comment that I can see.

672
00:56:49,104 --> 00:56:49,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a motion?

673
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:55,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

674
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:57,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

675
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mary.

676
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

677
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:04,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

678
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:05,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre?

679
00:57:05,475 --> 00:57:06,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

680
00:57:08,017 --> 00:57:08,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim?

681
00:57:09,238 --> 00:57:09,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

682
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:10,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary?

683
00:57:11,871 --> 00:57:11,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

684
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:16,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chris?

685
00:57:18,194 --> 00:57:18,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

686
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:19,715
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

687
00:57:20,415 --> 00:57:21,535
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in deliberation.

688
00:57:21,996 --> 00:57:27,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for verification for voting, Mike, Andre, Jim, Mary, and Chris will be voting on this case.

689
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody from the board go right ahead.

690
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I should have probably asked this during the question period, but I do.

691
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:56,496
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trying to look at the photos and Google Maps just to see, you know, my only, I guess, concern here and just question for the proponent is it looks like.

692
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,432
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something you're going like has a pretty big opening.

693
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:07,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, are you like driving a lawnmower and snowblower up into it?

694
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:12,978
[SPEAKER_14]: And and if so, doesn't it looks like it's blocked by a fence in front.

695
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:17,101
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you getting those things in there?

696
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:40,573
[SPEAKER_05]: okay um so i can see why it would look like that but remember it's not finished um so the fence that's there is going to be the white fence to match the neighbors and i was going to put a hinge on it i actually it's a step down about two feet into the yard from that point there's like a little retaining wall and i already put like a um

697
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:58,952
[SPEAKER_05]: a concrete uh little ramp and that's just to walk the push mower and like stuff in from the front so we don't have to go over the deck in the back i don't have a riding lawnmower or anything but i knew getting like the lawnmower snowblower the table and chairs

698
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:02,938
[SPEAKER_05]: because the back is very narrow over the fence.

699
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:06,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, over the porch and in that way is too hard.

700
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:13,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plan was from the front yard with the new white fence to be able to open it and go down and right back up into the shed.

701
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:15,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

702
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:17,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not finished.

703
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:19,816
[SPEAKER_05]: It, it was going to be like a barn style door.

704
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:20,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

705
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:30,279
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one thing that I didn't see in the pictures that I couldn't tell, and we didn't really, the only, the butter that you didn't really talk about was in the property behind you.

706
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:32,639
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the fence behind you look like?

707
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's no fence.

708
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:41,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So like our chain link fence runs the length of our property in the back.

709
00:59:41,922 --> 00:59:42,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And

710
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:50,161
[SPEAKER_05]: The, I guess, the house that you would be talking about the closest one there.

711
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:55,076
[SPEAKER_05]: is like probably 30 feet from our fence.

712
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:57,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it comes off the Fells way.

713
00:59:57,418 --> 01:00:02,923
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a long driveway and then like a backyard, but they don't have a fence.

714
01:00:03,023 --> 01:00:04,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just our chain link fence.

715
01:00:05,044 --> 01:00:09,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you go to the neighbor, they have like a wooden fence.

716
01:00:09,908 --> 01:00:13,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Their wooden fence goes to our chain link fence that's been there forever.

717
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really know.

718
01:00:15,553 --> 01:00:15,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

719
01:00:16,093 --> 01:00:19,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And that house behind you is what it looks like a three story

720
01:00:19,762 --> 01:00:21,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

721
01:00:21,923 --> 01:00:25,205
[SPEAKER_05]: In the last, like maybe five years, it was completely gutted inside out.

722
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:27,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a three family now.

723
01:00:27,346 --> 01:00:29,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.

724
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:32,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I used to know the owner, but they've long passed.

725
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:37,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I think it's a three family and I don't know.

726
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:38,911
[SPEAKER_05]: We've never had any interaction with them.

727
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:39,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

728
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:40,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

729
01:00:40,072 --> 01:00:41,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you for clarifying all that.

730
01:00:42,073 --> 01:00:42,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm.

731
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:51,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

732
01:00:53,508 --> 01:01:12,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so for the board to grant a variance for something like this, we need to establish that due to the shape, topography, or soil conditions of the lot or structures, there would be a hardship in a literal application of the zoning ordinance.

733
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:37,225
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I just want to note that in this case, the lot is relatively small, and the position of the primary structure is such that there aren't many, if any, locations that I can see for a shed like this to be placed without running into an issue with the side yard setback.

734
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:39,766
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think that

735
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,631
[SPEAKER_12]: literal enforcement in this case would present a hardship.

736
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:50,193
[SPEAKER_12]: And furthermore, it seems the neighbor doesn't mind.

737
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the fence seemed sorry.

738
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:58,116
[SPEAKER_12]: The shed seems to be, uh, you know, a reasonable design and construction.

739
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:03,358
[SPEAKER_12]: So So, yeah, I think this might may meet the standard for a variance in this case.

740
01:02:05,919 --> 01:02:06,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

741
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:11,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else from the board?

742
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:13,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, go ahead.

743
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr Chairman.

744
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with everything that's been said thus far, and I even would note that the applicant, uh, you know, I made the roof so that it drains onto his property and not the abutting property.

745
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:32,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's, uh, you know, looking to be a good neighbor.

746
01:02:33,272 --> 01:02:37,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I would feel a little more comfortable if there were some letters from at least one of the

747
01:02:40,187 --> 01:02:57,741
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, saying, you know, we have no problem with this, uh, for our purposes as a board and, uh, you know, to alleviate as well, the applicant for many, um, undo, uh, problems in the future.

748
01:02:57,761 --> 01:03:02,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be good to see that on the record as part of the record.

749
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:07,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chris.

750
01:03:12,101 --> 01:03:12,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other board members?

751
01:03:17,262 --> 01:03:19,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I would agree with Mike's perspective on the variance.

752
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:28,186
[SPEAKER_03]: The lot is small, and the positioning of any size shed is gonna end up on a setback on any neighbor's side here.

753
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:32,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate Mr. Salamone's honesty up front.

754
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, did your due diligence as best you could.

755
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair awaits a motion.

756
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:44,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll motion to approve the variance for 65 Sydney.

757
01:03:45,366 --> 01:03:45,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second.

758
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

759
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jim.

760
01:03:53,472 --> 01:03:53,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre?

761
01:03:54,673 --> 01:03:54,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

762
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:56,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim?

763
01:03:57,595 --> 01:03:57,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

764
01:03:59,236 --> 01:03:59,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary?

765
01:03:59,496 --> 01:04:01,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

766
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:02,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris?

767
01:04:03,899 --> 01:04:04,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

768
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:05,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

769
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:06,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

770
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

771
01:04:08,601 --> 01:04:11,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Five affirmative, the variance is granted.

772
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:16,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Salamone, you're good to proceed.

773
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:31,876
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so Matthew, I have to write up the decision, so it'll take me a little bit of time to get that to you, but once I get that in hand, then it'll get filed in the clerk's office, and then once that passes 20 days in the clerk's office, you'll be able to get the actual full building permit and go right ahead, so.

774
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:36,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Dennis, sorry, should I come and see you in a couple weeks?

775
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:38,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you notify me?

776
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:41,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd say so.

777
01:04:42,973 --> 01:04:46,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a holler when it's filed and send you a copy.

778
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:51,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from then we can work on the timing for the filing for the permit.

779
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I appreciate it.

780
01:04:53,398 --> 01:04:57,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so the board knows, as soon as everything's okay, we're gonna get it finished right away.

781
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,921
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been waiting a long time with a almost built shed.

782
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be done right away.

783
01:05:03,194 --> 01:05:04,936
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

784
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:07,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

785
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:07,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

786
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:15,389
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, the next case, 160 Forest Street.

787
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:33,389
[SPEAKER_06]: One 64th Street after Pamela Schaefer's position for various chapter 94 city met for zoning to install fence over 6 feet tall one 64th Street which started with city met its own ordinance chapter 94 section 4.2 point 4.5.

788
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:40,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Dennis just a process voting members for the site will be Mike Andre Jim Mary and myself.

789
01:05:43,212 --> 01:05:46,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a representative for the applicant and the applicant.

790
01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:52,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you name and address for the record and you can proceed.

791
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:55,794
[SPEAKER_11]: So sorry Pamela Schaefer 164th Street.

792
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:04,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you go ahead.

793
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:16,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a lot which is the backyard to my home and it's on the corner of Forest and I'm so sorry I forget the name of the side street behind me.

794
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:27,849
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that corner is the lot where I want to put the eight-foot fence.

795
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:31,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, there's a four-foot fence in that same area already.

796
01:06:31,431 --> 01:06:36,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm putting in a pool, which I've already received the permit for, a swimming pool.

797
01:06:36,653 --> 01:06:46,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And so with that process going in the four-foot just really concerns me because it's right on the sidewalk of people being able to go over it or have access.

798
01:06:47,218 --> 01:06:47,938
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really wanted

799
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:58,502
[SPEAKER_11]: The 8 foot fence, and I know that there's an issue with the corner and traffic is why there's sometimes an issue, but the traffic is coming from the opposite direction.

800
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:01,183
[SPEAKER_11]: So it won't block the view of people pulling in and out.

801
01:07:08,647 --> 01:07:10,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else that I need to tell you.

802
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:13,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have any.

803
01:07:14,712 --> 01:07:18,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to go through any of the documents that were sent showing the lot lines?

804
01:07:20,097 --> 01:07:25,621
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have any questions that the survey was done just recently for the permit for the pool.

805
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:32,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a survey that shows the lot lines and also where the current fences, the fence would be in the same placement, but just higher.

806
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:39,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll bring we'll bring that up real quick.

807
01:07:41,813 --> 01:07:46,236
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're bringing that up, I'll proceed to let the board ask any questions of the applicant.

808
01:07:50,759 --> 01:07:53,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is Andre, Mr. Chair.

809
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:56,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not a six-foot fence?

810
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:57,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Why go to an eight-foot fence?

811
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:08,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, just my concern with the sidewalk being right there, I just wanted that extra height to just be confident that there's no access.

812
01:08:13,043 --> 01:08:17,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really cool that my lot on both sides, the sidewalks right there.

813
01:08:17,605 --> 01:08:37,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I will just note that an eight-foot fence, it looks like when I just look at it, there's a tree on the sidewalk, public tree, and with an eight-foot fence would be hitting the branches there.

814
01:08:40,236 --> 01:08:44,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I think that tree is actually in my yard that you're looking at.

815
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,362
[SPEAKER_11]: The only large tree is in my yard in that area.

816
01:08:50,264 --> 01:08:51,525
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the inside of the fence.

817
01:08:54,027 --> 01:08:55,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Right at it, but on the inside.

818
01:08:55,568 --> 01:08:59,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

819
01:08:59,911 --> 01:09:00,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

820
01:09:00,852 --> 01:09:01,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you're welcome.

821
01:09:01,553 --> 01:09:03,174
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no other large trees in the area.

822
01:09:04,175 --> 01:09:05,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the plot plan.

823
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:05,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put that up now.

824
01:09:06,737 --> 01:09:06,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

825
01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:32,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the survey.

826
01:09:32,558 --> 01:09:35,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, just having a technical.

827
01:09:35,118 --> 01:09:37,139
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll continue with the questions for now while we get that up.

828
01:09:41,308 --> 01:09:41,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, go ahead.

829
01:09:43,268 --> 01:09:45,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this is a question for the building commissioner.

830
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:56,511
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that there's two parts of the zoning code that could be triggered by a request like this.

831
01:09:56,711 --> 01:09:59,012
[SPEAKER_12]: One is the fence height.

832
01:09:59,172 --> 01:10:06,253
[SPEAKER_12]: And so because this is a corner lot, most portions of the fence are within 15 feet of the,

833
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:13,974
[SPEAKER_12]: road, and so it's four foot rather than six foot is the standard.

834
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:33,521
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also the portion of the ordinance that pertains to corner visibility, which is a bit more technical and a little bit harder to back of the envelope measure, because that's to do with, I think, like two and a half foot from the curb and then a seven foot plane or something like that.

835
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:38,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you happen to know if there's a certain height

836
01:10:41,455 --> 01:10:47,118
[SPEAKER_12]: max height where this fence would start to trigger the corner visibility requirements as well?

837
01:10:48,739 --> 01:11:00,206
[SPEAKER_15]: I recall right it says any point between two and a half and seven feet has to be unobstructed back 20 feet from the intersection of the two curb lines.

838
01:11:01,547 --> 01:11:07,350
[SPEAKER_15]: So it could trigger that back corner of the back of the lot between Clifton and Lawrence, yes.

839
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,383
[SPEAKER_12]: But do you know the highest it could go without triggering that?

840
01:11:17,744 --> 01:11:27,931
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my understanding, if I recall, that you're just not allowed to obstruct between 2 and 1 half and 7 feet, not obstruct the view in those dimensions for a portion off the corner of the lot going back 20 feet.

841
01:11:28,011 --> 01:11:34,696
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'd have to basically skew the fence off or literally remove it at that corner and come back into the yard further.

842
01:11:36,017 --> 01:11:36,257
[SPEAKER_15]: I see.

843
01:11:36,517 --> 01:11:36,697
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

844
01:11:37,518 --> 01:11:37,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

845
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:40,220
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I mentioned that corner

846
01:11:41,737 --> 01:11:53,782
[SPEAKER_11]: sorry, just because the traffic's coming from, if you're exiting Clifton Street and the corner would be on your right that I'm looking to fence, then the traffic will be coming from the left.

847
01:11:57,103 --> 01:12:03,746
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I was explaining that would help or eliminate that obstruction concern.

848
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:12,913
[SPEAKER_15]: My only concern is Clifton seems to be a dead end.

849
01:12:12,933 --> 01:12:14,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

850
01:12:14,695 --> 01:12:14,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

851
01:12:15,155 --> 01:12:19,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Traffic is going to be coming out to Lawrence wanting to take a right turn onto Lawrence.

852
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:20,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

853
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,241
[SPEAKER_15]: And your fence could obstruct their view.

854
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:23,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

855
01:12:24,843 --> 01:12:25,583
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was saying.

856
01:12:25,603 --> 01:12:28,926
[SPEAKER_11]: The traffic will be coming from the left when they take a right onto Lawrence.

857
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:32,048
[SPEAKER_11]: So they'll be looking in the other direction of the fence.

858
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:37,313
[SPEAKER_11]: So it wouldn't obstruct that view because the traffic's coming from the opposite direction.

859
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:40,990
[SPEAKER_11]: when you're pulling out?

860
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:45,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Based on the way the law currently reads it, it's a concern.

861
01:12:45,232 --> 01:12:45,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

862
01:13:05,766 --> 01:13:07,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions from the board for the applicant?

863
01:13:18,681 --> 01:13:27,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I know we're trying to bring up the plot plan, the survey, but I will open it up to public comment.

864
01:13:31,253 --> 01:13:35,417
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody from the public wants to speak on this case, please raise your hand and zoom.

865
01:13:45,607 --> 01:13:49,050
[SPEAKER_09]: This I have something I'd like to say, but I can't figure out how to raise my hand.

866
01:13:49,131 --> 01:13:49,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

867
01:13:49,611 --> 01:13:54,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I see Sarah Willis on zoom.

868
01:13:54,956 --> 01:13:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

869
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:55,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

870
01:13:55,837 --> 01:13:57,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, my address.

871
01:13:58,219 --> 01:13:58,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

872
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at 168 4th Street.

873
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:13,991
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just have like two concerns are really and so the first one is related to the visibility of traffic because from Clifton you can turn left or right.

874
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:18,435
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not, you know, a one directional turnout.

875
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:22,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is one concern that we do have.

876
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:49,377
[SPEAKER_09]: you know not thinking that over six feet is really necessary um uh if six is the kind of the standard um so not sure why another two feet would be needed especially if visibility on that corner would be an issue um especially with people pulling out and pedestrians being there as a pedestrian you can't see around that corner if that fence is high um so it's a little bit um

877
01:14:49,737 --> 01:14:57,745
[SPEAKER_09]: from a safety, from a walking standpoint, and as someone who walks the neighborhood quite frequently, you know, I do think about those things.

878
01:14:58,806 --> 01:15:10,016
[SPEAKER_09]: The other piece is, you know, we've lived on this corner for about five years now, and we haven't been able to see any sort of

879
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:24,723
[SPEAKER_09]: regular goings in and out of the property in terms of like, is the pool for like, if there was a family living there and there's a pool for a family, you know, you see kids, you see, you know, people coming in and out pretty regularly.

880
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:26,604
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not the case.

881
01:15:26,764 --> 01:15:29,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that just makes a red flag in my mind.

882
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:51,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that this pool is not going to be for commercial use, like, for an Airbnb or for the new apps where you have pool and you can rent pools by the day, because that then brings in a, like, parking traffic, people from outside who aren't, you know, Medford neighbors into the neighborhood.

883
01:15:51,121 --> 01:15:54,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those were just the two concerns that I wanted to raise today.

884
01:15:54,904 --> 01:15:55,925
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be it.

885
01:15:58,633 --> 01:15:59,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you miss was I can.

886
01:16:00,314 --> 01:16:05,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously we're here to speak with specifically regards with the height of the fence and also the concern for the corner visibility.

887
01:16:07,138 --> 01:16:10,280
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually cannot make any decision with regards to the pool itself.

888
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:11,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

889
01:16:12,061 --> 01:16:12,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

890
01:16:16,503 --> 01:16:18,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other public comments.

891
01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:29,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Jamie, we did have on a butter letter.

892
01:16:29,264 --> 01:16:31,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if Dennis should read that, it's pretty short.

893
01:16:31,305 --> 01:16:35,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Or email.

894
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:43,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike will read that and he's got it open.

895
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:49,794
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so this is already in the public record, but just reading it for those listening.

896
01:16:50,776 --> 01:16:58,203
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's from a Joseph Toomey at 67 Clifton Street to whom it may concern.

897
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:04,709
[SPEAKER_12]: I received a postcard in the mail stating there will be a hearing on a proposed fence over six feet at 164th Street.

898
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:08,032
[SPEAKER_12]: I was informed the proposed fence would be eight feet in height.

899
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:13,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to be on record opposing an eight foot fence due to safety concerns at Clifton Street.

900
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:18,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I also believe an eight foot fence would take away from the beauty of the Lawrence Estates neighborhood.

901
01:17:18,855 --> 01:17:22,580
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no opposition to the proposed fence being six feet in height.

902
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:28,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Joseph Toomey, 67 Clifford Street, Clifton Street, sorry.

903
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:31,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

904
01:18:03,341 --> 01:18:06,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I motion to close public comment and enter deliberation.

905
01:18:07,643 --> 01:18:08,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a second?

906
01:18:10,444 --> 01:18:10,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded.

907
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:12,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Anders.

908
01:18:13,466 --> 01:18:13,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

909
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:15,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

910
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre?

911
01:18:16,087 --> 01:18:17,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

912
01:18:18,268 --> 01:18:18,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim?

913
01:18:18,508 --> 01:18:19,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

914
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:20,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary?

915
01:18:20,789 --> 01:18:22,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

916
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie?

917
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

918
01:18:25,851 --> 01:18:26,752
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in deliberation.

919
01:18:28,908 --> 01:18:37,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the board, we are discussing initially the variance request for an eight foot fence.

920
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:43,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have to address the concern for the corner visibility at Clifton and Lawrence.

921
01:18:49,394 --> 01:18:51,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Any comment, any discussion from the board?

922
01:18:56,256 --> 01:18:57,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is Andre.

923
01:18:58,691 --> 01:19:03,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I, I understand, uh.

924
01:19:04,215 --> 01:19:09,779
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the 4 foot fence all the way around the pool is doesn't give a lot of privacy.

925
01:19:09,799 --> 01:19:13,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so I'd be willing to consider a 6 foot fence.

926
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:17,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I think that an 8 foot fence is.

927
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,286
[SPEAKER_14]: A little superfluous.

928
01:19:20,366 --> 01:19:20,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It's.

929
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:23,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see why that would be necessary.

930
01:19:23,944 --> 01:19:31,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it does have an adverse impact on the rest of the neighbors.

931
01:19:31,889 --> 01:19:43,736
[SPEAKER_14]: The corner piece, I think that I could be convinced to go along with a variance for a six foot fence at the corner.

932
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:48,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andre.

933
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:48,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

934
01:19:50,357 --> 01:19:50,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

935
01:19:51,377 --> 01:20:08,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I'm sympathetic to the observation that if you are looking to turn right from Clifton street, you're looking essentially across the street.

936
01:20:08,885 --> 01:20:16,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, so you have the whole other lane of the street and you have a reasonable angle to see if a car is coming in that direction.

937
01:20:17,735 --> 01:20:25,279
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think, especially a very large fence, could potentially impede visibility for those turning left.

938
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:30,122
[SPEAKER_12]: And there certainly are plenty of routes in that area where you'd want to turn left.

939
01:20:31,003 --> 01:20:44,751
[SPEAKER_12]: It does look like someone could potentially safely drive out to the edge of the fence, look left, make sure there's not a pedestrian, and maybe inch out, and then

940
01:20:45,873 --> 01:20:47,454
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, check on the right hand side.

941
01:20:47,535 --> 01:21:04,610
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being a dead end road with not a lot of traffic, I'm not as concerned about the traffic, but I don't see any real hardship or legitimate basis for an eight foot fence in this case.

942
01:21:06,652 --> 01:21:10,216
[SPEAKER_12]: The lot is unique in that it's a

943
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:18,441
[SPEAKER_12]: corner lot on three sides and one of those sides where the fence is proposed is a dead end road.

944
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:25,284
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think there's some argument to be made that four ft around shouldn't be the standard.

945
01:21:26,084 --> 01:21:29,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but barring some weird topography

946
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:35,749
[SPEAKER_12]: The vast majority of Medford residents with pools have six foot fences.

947
01:21:35,909 --> 01:21:44,553
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't really see any hardship justifying an eight foot fence, whether that's for privacy reasons or safety reasons or anything else.

948
01:21:44,653 --> 01:21:47,255
[SPEAKER_12]: So I could get behind six foot.

949
01:21:47,775 --> 01:21:52,357
[SPEAKER_12]: The residents who spoke seem to support six foot rather than four foot.

950
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:55,979
[SPEAKER_12]: But I definitely am not supportive of eight foot.

951
01:21:58,486 --> 01:21:59,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

952
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:01,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the commissioner's hand raised.

953
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:01,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioner.

954
01:22:02,755 --> 01:22:03,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I just want to clarify.

955
01:22:04,496 --> 01:22:08,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Four foot is what's required by building code for a barrier to a pool.

956
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Six foot is a zoning issue.

957
01:22:12,423 --> 01:22:15,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything above and beyond this where the variance process would kick in.

958
01:22:15,926 --> 01:22:18,969
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we talk about those two different numbers, that's where they come from.

959
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,851
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have some concern.

960
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:26,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Without having talked to the traffic engineer, I did not receive any paperwork on this case.

961
01:22:26,895 --> 01:22:28,937
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sort of going by what you're telling me.

962
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:42,086
[SPEAKER_15]: I may suggest you talk to the city's traffic engineer about that corner and how the flow of traffic works there before you grant a variance to allow fence to block that corner.

963
01:22:43,187 --> 01:22:44,068
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my comments for now.

964
01:22:46,159 --> 01:23:00,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, if I may, through you, my understanding, though, is because this is a corner lot and the fence is within 15 foot of the road, that that also triggers the forefoot.

965
01:23:00,749 --> 01:23:07,073
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think my understanding is anything above forefoot is in need of zoning release.

966
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if I'm wrong about that.

967
01:23:11,515 --> 01:23:14,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I don't have the book with me at this point in time to verify.

968
01:23:14,877 --> 01:23:19,460
[SPEAKER_15]: It was my recollection that they want a clear view from two and a half feet to seven feet tall.

969
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,563
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would have to research that and get back to you on that.

970
01:23:25,104 --> 01:23:25,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

971
01:23:25,525 --> 01:23:27,406
[SPEAKER_12]: So also, again, through Jamie.

972
01:23:27,686 --> 01:23:31,389
[SPEAKER_12]: So perhaps additionally, the corner visibility triggers.

973
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:35,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I think two things would be triggered almost certainly by an eight foot fence.

974
01:23:36,172 --> 01:23:38,053
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the corner visibility and the

975
01:23:39,135 --> 01:23:45,438
[SPEAKER_12]: the requirement that the fence be no higher than four feet if it's within 15 feet of the front yard.

976
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:53,022
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I think the two separate bits of relief are needed.

977
01:23:58,429 --> 01:24:08,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I've got the file just so we can take a look at that plot plan Commissioner we just I was talking with Dennis he explained that this was sent directly to us because it was a clear violation.

978
01:24:09,785 --> 01:24:11,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why you hadn't seen anything yet.

979
01:24:13,269 --> 01:24:14,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Just going to get sharing privileges.

980
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:52,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so everybody should be able to see that now.

981
01:24:55,003 --> 01:24:57,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are with the lot just for reference.

982
01:25:02,177 --> 01:25:10,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in agreement with the other board members comments at the moment with regards to six foot around.

983
01:25:11,402 --> 01:25:21,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the four foot having, you know, with regards to privacy, having the pool on this lot abutting the two streets, you know, you can absolutely see the request for a six foot for privacy.

984
01:25:24,129 --> 01:25:26,410
[SPEAKER_03]: The corner is my concern.

985
01:25:29,031 --> 01:25:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess for discussion for a path forward to the commissioner's point, the traffic department hasn't had a chance to take a look at this.

986
01:25:42,402 --> 01:25:53,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have seen in the past scenarios where that corner, I mean, obviously you can see the distance, the 15 feet to the pool, 17 feet from that corner.

987
01:25:54,172 --> 01:25:56,955
[SPEAKER_03]: If you push the fence back to that, you're pushing the fence back to the pool.

988
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:04,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously from that design, that's not a functional for the lot itself.

989
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:15,552
[SPEAKER_03]: We have seen situations where with evaluation, we've done a shorter distance back into the lot.

990
01:26:16,352 --> 01:26:22,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we had a situation where we did eight feet back and did across from post to post at that distance.

991
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:33,278
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we would need to have, at least at a minimum, have traffic take a look at it.

992
01:26:42,481 --> 01:26:43,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts from the board?

993
01:26:50,545 --> 01:26:55,707
[SPEAKER_12]: So perhaps before we get too deep into analysis, we should check in with the

994
01:26:56,861 --> 01:27:11,235
[SPEAKER_12]: applicant, whether they would be amenable to or whether if the options were between a six foot fence, uh, or no variance at all, whether they would still be interested in relief.

995
01:27:13,597 --> 01:27:14,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Mr Shaver.

996
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:16,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.

997
01:27:16,459 --> 01:27:23,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I would welcome, you know, the option of six feet if the board is not willing to grant the eight feet.

998
01:27:24,843 --> 01:27:32,165
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would really prefer to not have it the setback because it does limit the space in there.

999
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:41,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And the sidewalk is fairly significant there on the corner and it being a dead end street, I would hope that would be allowed.

1000
01:27:48,082 --> 01:27:48,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

1001
01:27:48,423 --> 01:27:48,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Schaffer.

1002
01:27:48,703 --> 01:27:49,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1003
01:27:51,828 --> 01:27:56,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as we've discussed, I mean, the lot is flat from a hardship perspective for the need for a taller fence.

1004
01:27:57,656 --> 01:28:02,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not see that hardship existing and I would be comfortable with the six foot fence.

1005
01:28:06,202 --> 01:28:11,766
[SPEAKER_12]: So point information though, Jamie, my understanding is that a variance is still required at six foot.

1006
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:26,135
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think because it's not because it's within the 15 because it's due to this being a triple or like a double corner lot, it has three front yards and it's within 15 foot.

1007
01:28:27,504 --> 01:28:30,125
[SPEAKER_12]: of the front yard on most sides.

1008
01:28:30,245 --> 01:28:40,971
[SPEAKER_12]: So I believe we know with certainty that a variance for fence height would be required for anything over four.

1009
01:28:41,971 --> 01:28:48,795
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, um, it sounds like since the building commissioner hasn't had a chance to review the case,

1010
01:28:49,497 --> 01:28:58,942
[SPEAKER_12]: we don't know the amount of relief that would be required, if any, at six foot or at four foot for the corner visibility.

1011
01:28:59,662 --> 01:29:09,928
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't know the amount of relief that would be required for that, but we could, if the board was comfortable, just, I think, waive that entirely.

1012
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:14,267
[SPEAKER_12]: the corner visibility in light of it being a dead end street.

1013
01:29:14,387 --> 01:29:20,333
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, two pieces of relief are required, even at six foot is my understanding.

1014
01:29:24,138 --> 01:29:25,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, building commissioner.

1015
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:38,395
[SPEAKER_15]: If I recall, the section of the ordinance does state that it's backed off from an intersection of the two curb lines where they meet, which is actually a point somewhere out in the street.

1016
01:29:39,616 --> 01:29:42,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask that the engineer, Medford Engineering Survey,

1017
01:29:43,891 --> 01:29:51,855
[SPEAKER_15]: calculate that number and show it on the drawing as to how much relief is specifically needed so we have a line to measure in the field.

1018
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:58,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Because right now, if you give her the relief, it is what it is.

1019
01:29:58,138 --> 01:30:02,900
[SPEAKER_15]: If you choose not to, then we don't have any point to take a demarcation back from the fence.

1020
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:10,884
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that's all clear, that we come up with a number on a drawing, or we just waive the whole thing and we don't have anything to check when we get out in the field.

1021
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:31,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay so for discussion point that sounds like we're considering continuing to have the building department go out and take a look at what we're looking at for relief or granting relief without having a specific.

1022
01:30:33,734 --> 01:30:40,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Distance yeah Mister chair this is Andre I'm not I'd be inclined to kind of wave wave it.

1023
01:30:42,976 --> 01:30:43,756
[SPEAKER_14]: But the corner.

1024
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:48,399
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, requirement there and go with the 6 foot.

1025
01:30:48,439 --> 01:30:50,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's where we're going to end up anyways.

1026
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:50,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And.

1027
01:30:51,581 --> 01:30:54,542
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's reasonable for what's being asked for.

1028
01:30:55,042 --> 01:31:01,246
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the location where it is, it's just my perspective.

1029
01:31:01,266 --> 01:31:06,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

1030
01:31:06,949 --> 01:31:07,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike.

1031
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:10,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree with Andre.

1032
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,411
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to leverage just some.

1033
01:31:12,356 --> 01:31:16,799
[SPEAKER_12]: information as a resident who happens to live near there and drives by it all the time.

1034
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:38,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's with it being a dead end street and a fairly wide sidewalk and pretty close to this traffic light, I think it's I know enough about the area that I'd be comfortable waving the corner visibility requirement.

1035
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:39,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Um,

1036
01:31:40,365 --> 01:31:46,388
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do think that has the upside of getting the applicant to a decision sooner.

1037
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:49,830
[SPEAKER_12]: The two residents that spoke are also okay with six foot.

1038
01:31:53,412 --> 01:31:53,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.

1039
01:31:55,853 --> 01:31:59,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other discussion from members of the board?

1040
01:32:00,196 --> 01:32:05,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree with Mike on that too, as a resident in that area as well.

1041
01:32:09,381 --> 01:32:09,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jim.

1042
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:14,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Mike.

1043
01:32:14,499 --> 01:32:36,148
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so I will motion to approve a variance for fence height on the condition that the fence is no taller than six foot and also to approve a

1044
01:32:39,184 --> 01:32:50,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a special permit to waive the corner visibility requirement for this fence project.

1045
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:52,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second that.

1046
01:33:03,176 --> 01:33:03,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, not on mute.

1047
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:04,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jim.

1048
01:33:05,077 --> 01:33:06,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote for Andre.

1049
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:10,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1050
01:33:11,796 --> 01:33:12,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

1051
01:33:13,057 --> 01:33:13,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1052
01:33:14,618 --> 01:33:14,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim?

1053
01:33:15,858 --> 01:33:15,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1054
01:33:17,499 --> 01:33:17,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary?

1055
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:18,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1056
01:33:20,421 --> 01:33:21,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie?

1057
01:33:21,301 --> 01:33:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Nay.

1058
01:33:21,461 --> 01:33:25,863
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we have four affirmative.

1059
01:33:26,444 --> 01:33:34,108
[SPEAKER_03]: We have approval for a variance for six foot fence height and special permit for the corner visibility.

1060
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:37,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1061
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:38,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis?

1062
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:48,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a mission for I will be working on the decision and I'll get that to you as soon as I can and then once it's filed in the clerk's office is a 20 days kills period.

1063
01:33:49,155 --> 01:33:53,476
[SPEAKER_06]: After that kills period is passed then you can get the building permit.

1064
01:33:53,616 --> 01:33:55,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I didn't realize the 20 days.

1065
01:33:55,117 --> 01:33:55,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

1066
01:33:55,917 --> 01:33:58,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate all of your assistance.

1067
01:33:58,959 --> 01:34:00,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much to the board.

1068
01:34:00,139 --> 01:34:02,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1069
01:34:06,527 --> 01:34:07,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

1070
01:34:07,168 --> 01:34:09,610
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all the cases that we had on the list for today.

1071
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:12,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis, do we have any administrative updates?

1072
01:34:13,973 --> 01:34:14,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still on.

1073
01:34:15,294 --> 01:34:18,977
[SPEAKER_06]: No, nothing on my end.

1074
01:34:21,179 --> 01:34:32,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to confirm for our next meeting, the next scheduled one would be July 25th, but maybe we should check on member availability while we have folks on the line.

1075
01:34:35,923 --> 01:34:44,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so for everybody that's on the call, do we have any conflicts for the July 25th meeting at 6.30?

1076
01:34:46,469 --> 01:34:48,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it via Zoom or in person?

1077
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:54,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be at least on Zoom, possibly hybrid.

1078
01:34:54,173 --> 01:34:59,175
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still working on the logistics of that, but you have the option to do it over Zoom, absolutely.

1079
01:34:59,475 --> 01:35:01,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, no problems, thank you.

1080
01:35:02,137 --> 01:35:03,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and this is Andre.

1081
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I can only do it remotely.

1082
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:15,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so for me, I, I'm flying back that day.

1083
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:17,382
[SPEAKER_12]: I should be able to make it.

1084
01:35:18,082 --> 01:35:24,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but yeah, there's a chance something will get messed up and I, I won't be present.

1085
01:35:26,243 --> 01:35:26,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1086
01:35:27,043 --> 01:35:30,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Jim, I'm good.

1087
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:31,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good for the joint.

1088
01:35:34,245 --> 01:35:34,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jim.

1089
01:35:34,805 --> 01:35:34,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris.

1090
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:43,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I will probably have to be remote as well, but it should be good.

1091
01:35:50,881 --> 01:35:52,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Chair, this is Andre again, sorry.

1092
01:35:53,302 --> 01:35:55,884
[SPEAKER_14]: One question maybe for Dennis.

1093
01:35:57,145 --> 01:36:03,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Dennis, is it possible to just send out a recurring monthly calendar invite for the last Thursday of the month?

1094
01:36:04,469 --> 01:36:07,471
[SPEAKER_14]: That way we just have them going forward and we can see all the dates.

1095
01:36:09,543 --> 01:36:10,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can do something like that.

1096
01:36:10,524 --> 01:36:13,885
[SPEAKER_06]: The only, yeah, there's just a few instances in which it'll conflict.

1097
01:36:13,925 --> 01:36:18,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just gotta be aware when we get to like Thanksgiving and Christmas and things like that, but I can do that.

1098
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:20,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

1099
01:36:20,569 --> 01:36:22,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so you have it, so it's popping up.

1100
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:23,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

1101
01:36:29,413 --> 01:36:30,074
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1102
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:34,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else from the city with administrative update?

1103
01:36:36,237 --> 01:36:36,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're good.

1104
01:36:38,018 --> 01:36:38,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

1105
01:36:41,373 --> 01:36:41,713
[SPEAKER_03]: not yet.

1106
01:36:41,733 --> 01:36:45,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have them for you, but it's on the agenda.

1107
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:50,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So the meeting minutes will be forthcoming, and they'll be approved by the next one.

1108
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:57,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And just sort of as a point of order, since she is actually on the call, I believe this will probably be Rachel's last zoning meeting.

1109
01:36:58,189 --> 01:36:59,830
[SPEAKER_06]: sitting in and taking minutes and things like that.

1110
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:09,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just would like to say publicly thank her for everything that she has done for the last few months, six months plus helping us with meeting minutes and other sort of things.

1111
01:37:09,715 --> 01:37:10,696
[SPEAKER_06]: So much appreciated.

1112
01:37:12,837 --> 01:37:13,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Rachel.

1113
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:16,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1114
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:18,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1115
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:23,142
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1116
01:37:24,543 --> 01:37:25,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everything on the agenda.

1117
01:37:25,784 --> 01:37:26,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a motion?

1118
01:37:29,384 --> 01:37:30,485
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll motion to adjourn.

1119
01:37:31,206 --> 01:37:32,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second.

1120
01:37:35,911 --> 01:37:37,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre?

1121
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:38,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1122
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim?

1123
01:37:40,115 --> 01:37:40,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1124
01:37:42,077 --> 01:37:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?

1125
01:37:43,378 --> 01:37:43,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1126
01:37:43,819 --> 01:37:44,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary?

1127
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:45,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1128
01:37:46,001 --> 01:37:46,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

1129
01:37:46,542 --> 01:37:46,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1130
01:37:47,342 --> 01:37:47,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

1131
01:37:48,163 --> 01:37:51,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night, everyone.

1132
01:37:52,107 --> 01:37:52,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.
