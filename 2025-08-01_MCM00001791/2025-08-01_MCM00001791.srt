15
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:57,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant and owner, Panagiotis Mamounas, to replace an existing single-family building with a two-family building in the general residence zoning district allowed use with insufficient lot size, width, and coverage, and front yard setbacks per the City of Manfred's Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

16
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:00,823
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

17
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:02,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, good evening.

18
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:03,005
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

19
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:06,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Mute your speaker, please.

20
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:08,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Not your microphone, but your speaker.

21
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:19,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, we have multiple computers in our office here.

22
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:23,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just asking them to mute so we won't have a reverb.

23
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:27,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

24
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:27,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

25
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:28,809
[SPEAKER_01]: My first time.

26
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:30,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Chair, tell me what to do.

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.

28
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

29
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point one thing out.

30
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:42,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did continue this matter from our prior meeting, but since we didn't hear any testimony, it's effectively a fresh case for us.

31
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:47,582
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have four members present, which is a quorum for the relief you're seeking.

32
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:51,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, welcome and please go ahead.

33
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:51,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

34
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:54,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are seeking to

35
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:58,763
[SPEAKER_01]: RAISE is a structure that was built in and around 1920.

36
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:03,946
[SPEAKER_01]: The plot of land was created in 1919.

37
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,227
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure itself is 1920.

38
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:12,750
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits on a corner lot of Second Street and Henley Streets.

39
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are looking to take down the structure and build a two-family.

40
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,396
[SPEAKER_01]: My client is also proposing four parking places as well, so it is parking compliant.

41
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:29,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I always start with that because I know that's one of the most important things to people is the parking.

42
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:48,669
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, one of the things that we wanted to, I did put together a new zoning chart, because we, the building commissioner wanted both front side of second Avenue, second street, and Henley Street so I did give that to the city as well as our new architectural drawings.

43
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:54,678
[SPEAKER_01]: per feedback as well from the commissioner.

44
00:02:54,758 --> 00:03:00,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you have before you today, and I think our architect is here as well, Mr. Frangos.

45
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:03,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill, are you around?

46
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:13,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see a Bill on the call, so that might be the architect.

47
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:17,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

48
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:17,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

49
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:18,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can hear you.

50
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:18,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

51
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:19,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Bill.

52
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you, DeeDee?

53
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:22,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

54
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:23,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

55
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:28,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to make sure he's on point to walk through the project.

56
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,813
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just kind of want to describe the neighborhood a bit.

57
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It is right off the Fellsway, about a block off the Fellsway.

58
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:47,604
[SPEAKER_01]: It is surrounded by single-family homes, but the majority of homes that it surrounds are two-family homes, including right next door and right across the street.

59
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:58,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually has 4,350 square feet of space on that lot, whereas it would make it one of the larger lots for a two family.

60
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:03,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the two families are in the 36 to 3,900 range on the block.

61
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,522
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be very consistent with the neighborhood itself.

62
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:12,002
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the odd side of Second Street.

63
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:19,073
[SPEAKER_01]: went to the GIS map to look at both the whole neighborhood as a whole.

64
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:31,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And just on the odd side of second, there is 15 houses, seven of which are already two families, and the entirety of the backside of that lot on First Street, both sides.

65
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:38,413
[SPEAKER_01]: of First Street also have all two families, including all across the street from our property on Henley.

66
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:45,579
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just want to make sure that we're not proposing anything that's out of the ordinary for the block.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:55,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, we're proposing a duplex style that has four bedrooms, two baths, and two half baths.

68
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:02,209
[SPEAKER_01]: parking compliant with two tandem spaces, four spaces altogether.

69
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,611
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'm going to turn it over to my expert, Mr. Fringos.

70
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:10,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

71
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:14,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

72
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:22,117
[SPEAKER_04]: As David mentioned, it's a two-family and

73
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:31,544
[SPEAKER_04]: We are, yeah, she mentioned the park and I don't know if there's any questions other than which she had described.

74
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,711
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'd love it if you could show us the plans and walk us through what's proposed.

75
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:41,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

76
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:44,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, unfortunately, I didn't last minute.

77
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:47,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we're gonna have a meeting.

78
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize it was gonna be zoom tool.

79
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I am I allowed to drive the bus here?

80
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be more than happy to.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you you're Yeah, absolutely.

82
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:59,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought Mr. Chair, do I have to be able to share my screen?

83
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:00,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

84
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:04,030
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, Dennis will grant you that permission.

85
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Attorney Edmondson, you're all set.

86
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:06,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

87
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:06,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.

88
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I didn't know if you wanted to drive the bus, Dennis or me.

89
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:11,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I have both.

90
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:18,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'm just gonna share my screen here.

91
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:19,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

92
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:21,486
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

93
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:25,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

94
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:45,408
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

95
00:06:58,911 --> 00:06:59,272
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

96
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:07,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bill, I'll be glad to control it if you want to walk through.

97
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,114
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first floor in the basement.

98
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:25,825
[SPEAKER_04]: The plan on the right of this sheet, on the left-hand side of that right side plan, there's an indented area.

99
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:28,826
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the main entry on Henley Street.

100
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,708
[SPEAKER_04]: The common wall intersects that indented area.

101
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the first unit, let's say on the top portion of the plan and the second unit on the lower portion, they're identical, you know, they're mirror images.

102
00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:03,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so basically you walk in, um, if you walk in, you know, the front stair, it's, it is elevated.

103
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:07,493
[SPEAKER_04]: You come up to a landing and you enter, um,

104
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:17,253
[SPEAKER_04]: the doors within that covered, indented entry area, the portico, let's call it.

105
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:30,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you see the stair going upstairs, and then you have the living room and the dining area, and then the kitchen in the back.

106
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:37,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, half bath and storage area, that sort of thing.

107
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:50,916
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the deck opposite Henley Street is like a small deck to exit with a stair.

108
00:08:54,078 --> 00:09:03,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Adjacent to that is a wealth to enter to the basement portion of that unit.

109
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,885
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the basement?

110
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:26,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so if you take the stair down, you enter the living area, bedroom, bath and closet storage.

111
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:34,561
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to summarize, first floor, we have the living area with the kitchen and the dining room.

112
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:44,982
[SPEAKER_01]: in the basement area, there will be two bathrooms with a half bath and a full bath or just a half bath, Bill?

113
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a full bath in the basement.

114
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:49,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

115
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:50,945
[SPEAKER_01]: The half bath is on the first floor.

116
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:51,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

117
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,446
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to go to the second.

118
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

119
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:56,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

120
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were referring to the basement.

121
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:06,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the second and third floors?

122
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:15,808
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm looking at, yeah, these are the second and third floors.

123
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the master bedroom is on the second floor and with another bedroom?

124
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:22,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct, yeah.

125
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:26,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two full baths?

126
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,279
[SPEAKER_01]: One full bath and a half bath.

127
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:30,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

128
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:36,065
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and then on the top floor, you have another bath and a suite up here.

129
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:41,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I apologize, because I'm looking at my phone.

130
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:44,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't zoom in.

131
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:45,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.

132
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:45,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just.

133
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, there are two full baths.

134
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,079
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no half bath on that second floor.

135
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:56,900
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

136
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:57,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

137
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, there are two bedrooms.

138
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:15,458
[SPEAKER_04]: On the attic level, yeah, on the third floor level, there's, yeah, another bedroom, like a living area.

139
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:17,199
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's all one area.

140
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a studio.

141
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a loft area.

142
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:20,261

145
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:35,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_01]: This is the roof plan and area plans.

149
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:57,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Runoff and drainage.

151
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a prettier picture of what it's supposed to look like.

152
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:04,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the front view?

153
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,161
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the front view off Henley.

154
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, off Henley, correct, with that entry over there.

155
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:10,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Or to go correct.

156
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:10,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

157
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:15,373
[SPEAKER_01]: You got those two side view from looking at it from second street.

158
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:16,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

159
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:17,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

160
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:22,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one other thing I'd like to show this is I know the parking.

161
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just make this a little bit larger for everybody.

162
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:31,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, this is the tandem spots.

163
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there is a big garage here.

164
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:40,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can hold basically one car, maybe two if it's a really small second car.

165
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:49,249
[SPEAKER_01]: But this will take this off the, be parking compliant for the space.

166
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:05,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And does anybody would like, I can also pull up the plot plan as well, if you would like to see the plot plan.

167
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we do that, I'll just check in with the board.

168
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:13,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have questions so far from members of the board?

169
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre, go ahead.

170
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you just point out where the utilities are?

171
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they in the basement?

172
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:40,834
[SPEAKER_04]: third floor and possibly in the basement as well, the storage area, but that's, there's the potential to have it.

173
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:43,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have it currently in the third floor.

174
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:52,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to enlarge the third floor so the gentlemen can see the mechanical room here.

175
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:54,316
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to share your screen again.

176
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:55,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess I should.

177
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:56,777
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.

178
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:16,203
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.

179
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:17,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a larger version.

180
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:23,506
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to enlarge it just a tad here so we can see the mechanical room and storage on the third floor.

181
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:28,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I can move to the basement as well when you tell me to.

182
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:36,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and currently, as intended, it's on the third floor.

183
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:42,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it can possibly be on the basement level.

184
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:44,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the basement level.

185
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:50,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we could recreate these two rooms to be a mechanical as well.

186
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,623
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

187
00:14:58,284 --> 00:15:00,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board so far?

188
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chair, if I may.

189
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please go ahead.

190
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:11,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we throw up a site plan of the whole property?

191
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:13,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

192
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on just one second, let me pull that up.

193
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:32,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to make sure, is everybody seeing plot plans right now?

194
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:34,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

195
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:35,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

196
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:35,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

197
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when technology works.

198
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,081
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the current plot plan as it stands on, as the current structure is located.

199
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:47,924
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the current one and a half story dwelling.

200
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:49,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the garage.

201
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:53,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go down to here.

202
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:58,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is our proposed prop plan with the current proposed building and the proposed driveway.

203
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:16,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris, do you have specific questions about that, or did you just want to see it?

204
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:22,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mr. Chair.

205
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:36,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to ask later, but perhaps the applicant can explain the relief required along the setbacks and the reasoning for it.

206
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:40,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

207
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just pull up my, my zoning chart.

208
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:55,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I always want to lead with that because that is, I don't know if you have it, I've just submitted it recently but I'm just going to pull this up.

209
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:02,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps me to answer your question more fully, sir.

210
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,118
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our zoning chart.

211
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:12,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that is needed as far as a variance is concerned is denoted with a V next to it.

212
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:26,524
[SPEAKER_01]: The three issues that really can't be changed about the property, because it was created in 1919, are the lot area, the lot width, and the lot depth, depending on the front.

213
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:41,848
[SPEAKER_01]: you will, you know, if this one right here, it depends on if you want to do the front on Henley or the front on, on, you know, is the lot depth that, but these are the three kind of unchangeable parts of the, of the thing itself.

214
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:47,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, as it stands, it is a non-conforming structure as to front yard.

215
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:54,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Our proposal is if it is fronted on second, it's, it needs a variance.

216
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,280
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's fronted on Henley, it does not need a variance.

217
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is one there will be as needed.

218
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:08,003
[SPEAKER_01]: The side yard, right and left, the requirement is 7.5.

219
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:08,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 7.7 and 7.8, 0.2 and 0.3.

220
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,404
[SPEAKER_01]: We are good on the left-hand side.

221
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:13,285
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rear yard, it's already nonconforming at 3.5 feet.

222
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:15,866
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, depending on where you're

223
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:38,813
[SPEAKER_01]: fronting it, we're actually making it, we're trying to bring it more into compliance for bringing it 19 if you're fronting on second and 7.7 feet if you're going to front it on Henley, it's definitely better than 3.5.

224
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:43,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the major, those are the variances that we're going to need.

225
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:48,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, of course, I didn't put a V down here as well, the lot coverage.

226
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,080
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right

227
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:55,608
[SPEAKER_01]: We were right at almost the max, and we're just going a little over the max limit.

228
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,031
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but everything is changeable if need be.

229
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:04,794
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just talking about if we need to have less massing, we can.

230
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:09,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we're, those are the,

231
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,466
[SPEAKER_01]: variances that we are seeking.

232
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:22,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a memo that explains everything more fully, but we're seeking relief to build a two family because it is part of the neighborhood.

233
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:28,775
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is just with a few variances, just a few things off.

234
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:39,802
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do anything about the lot area, lot depth, but that is very similar to everything in the neighborhood as far as lot size, it's even bigger.

235
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:45,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping that, you know, two family housing is needed.

236
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:51,332
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's smart density to build this way on a lot, and it's a better use of the lot.

237
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:56,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we are hampered by what was created in 1919, essentially.

238
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:04,121
[SPEAKER_01]: We can increase a lot, but, you know, we feel like it's a better use, higher use for both

239
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,664
[SPEAKER_01]: the neighborhood and the city as well.

240
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:10,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we come to you today.

241
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:18,730
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

242
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

243
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:30,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I could go next.

244
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:41,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you mentioned at the outset of the presentation that there are a lot of two families in that area.

245
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:49,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So can we maybe look through the neighborhood and just get an understanding of where the two families are?

246
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:49,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly.

247
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:51,265
[SPEAKER_01]: May I just pull up the GIS map?

248
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:57,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stop sharing this and I'm just going to pull up the GIS map for the city.

249
00:20:57,451 --> 00:21:06,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that ready for you and I'll be glad to, you know, take that around if you need to go more than just right on the block.

250
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I'm trying to share here.

251
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,124
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

252
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:13,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

253
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:14,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our...

254
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, what's up?

255
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:20,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.

256
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:23,493
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this is kind of like the 10,000 foot view.

257
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,194
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our subject property right here.

258
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:28,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to zoom in just a bit so everybody gets their bearings.

259
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:31,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is the Fells Way, second street, first street.

260
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:40,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're right here.

261
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:44,202
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the closest to family right here.

262
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:45,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, let me get that out of the way.

263
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:53,939
[SPEAKER_01]: abutting the property every and just going to move this just a little bit.

264
00:21:54,359 --> 00:22:00,321
[SPEAKER_01]: All these properties along First Street are all two families.

265
00:22:02,962 --> 00:22:08,124
[SPEAKER_01]: All the properties along Henley Street are also two families.

266
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:10,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're here.

267
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,906
[SPEAKER_01]: And of the 15 properties on the odd side of

268
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:43,158
[SPEAKER_01]: second street um we have there's seven that are currently two families all of these right here um and so we're just seeking to be um the two family right here to be the eighth um we if you do i know that you received a letter from an abutter um this is the property in question that they're talking about they also um

269
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:47,856
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a one family, but it also has an in-law in the back.

270
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:51,519
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are also abutted by two families.

271
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,181
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a three family over here, going towards the fellows way.

272
00:22:56,042 --> 00:23:01,826
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I counted around 45 in the neighborhood.

273
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:03,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on these two blocks alone, there's 30.

274
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:07,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over here, there's eight.

275
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:09,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the seven up here.

276
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:13,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

277
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I see the building commissioner has his hand raised.

278
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:16,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Commissioner Vanderbilt.

279
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I do have a question.

280
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:28,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at these drawings a little bit more carefully here, and I see the third floor looks like a full story in a zone, which is 2.5 stories.

281
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:31,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Can someone explain that difference to me?

282
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, I'll think.

283
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Let my architect take that one.

284
00:23:38,479 --> 00:24:00,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what was explained to me to determine not to be a half story, if I'm understanding correctly, is that you can't exceed 50% of the area below the second floor, let's call it.

285
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:03,574
[SPEAKER_04]: The third floor has to be like 50% and at seven feet above the

286
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:16,220
[SPEAKER_04]: third floor, you know, the roof cut would determine the area, but you could exclude storage, the area stairs, that sort of thing.

287
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,485
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the living area that would be designated as habitable.

288
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:32,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to disagree with that because we don't look at as habitably look as occupiable and typically storage areas will be included in those formulas.

289
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:38,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Without a cross cut section it's hard to tell the porches would be a part of that as well.

290
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I was.

291
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:55,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was told, and maybe I misunderstood, but it was mentioned to me that storage can be excluded, so we're open air.

292
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's covered, I don't know if that has any impact on it.

293
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:03,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a part of the floor plan.

294
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Misunderstand on my part possibly, but.

295
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:13,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, again, without a cross section, I can't really tell because you certainly got beds and other things way over in that space.

296
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's just steep pitch on that roof.

297
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:18,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'm questioning if you have an appropriate half story there.

298
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:26,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't need additional relief in terms of variance to allow that.

299
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I was just speaking with my client who's here with me.

300
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:47,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Commissioner, we will redraw to make it the half story or just take off the bedroom altogether and make it just mechanical on the third.

301
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:51,259
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

302
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,422
[SPEAKER_08]: The only question I would have is if the board would approve this tonight, these become the drawings of record.

303
00:25:56,482 --> 00:26:02,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't want anybody misperceived that you would get an approval for a full three-story if they come back later.

304
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:08,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that needs to be clarified before the board makes any final decision.

305
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,491
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my recommendation.

306
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:11,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

307
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:17,076
[SPEAKER_09]: In general, if there's going to be material changes to a plan, I don't intend to vote on it.

308
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:18,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we would have to continue in that case.

309
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrea, I saw you raised your hand.

310
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:22,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

311
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:32,347
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question in that vein was, I think, the rear setback, which it looks like it is from the back of the house, not from the back of the porch.

312
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:35,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So just questioning that.

313
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, porches under a certain size are excluded from that math.

314
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:48,419
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if it's a covered porch?

315
00:26:51,832 --> 00:26:59,675
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a definition of what's a rear yard and what's a side yard, and it excludes porches, decks of certain dimensions, not to exceed certain dimensions.

316
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:06,698
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, not to exceed more than one third of the face of the thing, and some of those types of conditions.

317
00:27:07,478 --> 00:27:16,362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of an awkwardly written paragraph in the zoning, but I did look at that, and I felt that they fell within the criteria allowed.

318
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:16,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

319
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:22,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.

320
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:25,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thank you.

321
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:28,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, just back to my earlier question.

322
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, um, want to pair it back what I think I heard.

323
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:37,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So essentially, in the district on First Street,

324
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,204
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the properties are two family.

325
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:43,126
[SPEAKER_09]: On Henley, that's the case.

326
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:44,787
[SPEAKER_09]: On Fellsway, that's the case.

327
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:53,873
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other side, or on the odd side, but other half of 2nd Street, that's the case.

328
00:27:54,913 --> 00:28:04,179
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like the even side of 2nd Street is the primary street in the area where it's one family.

329
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's this little pocket of

330
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,093
[SPEAKER_09]: one family in a district that's mostly two family.

331
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I understand that correctly?

332
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:27,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a point of clarification about the it's from the backyard setback as far as the one for if you're fronting on second street or the left

333
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,702
[SPEAKER_01]: The right yard is 7.7.

334
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:39,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from the corner of the dwelling, proposed dwelling, not from the porch.

335
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I can pull up the plot plan just to clarify that for you.

336
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:44,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

337
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:45,134
[SPEAKER_09]: 7.7 from the corner.

338
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:10,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and so then because it's fronting Henley in this proposal, the requirement would be 15, correct?

339
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:13,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.

340
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:14,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

341
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:20,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Commissioner Vanderbilt, did you have another comment or is your hand just still up?

342
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a comment.

343
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:28,114
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna view frontage as the street on which the front door predominantly faces.

344
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:31,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be Henley, I believe.

345
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:33,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Henley.

346
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:34,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's how it'll be viewed.

347
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:35,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

348
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:52,460
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, Attorney Edmondson, so the building commissioner's point about the

349
00:29:53,543 --> 00:30:01,646
[SPEAKER_09]: third floor, whether it's a half story or a full story, that does change the relief being sought.

350
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:18,772
[SPEAKER_09]: If the intention is to update the plans, my recommendation would be to continue and we could resume the case once we see those updates, if you're not seeking a variance for a third story.

351
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:21,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We are definitely not seeking a variance for a third story.

352
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:24,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your graciousness.

353
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:28,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I will confer with my client and Mr. Architect.

354
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:37,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ask, I might give you a call, Mr. Commissioner, just to make sure we're on the same page.

355
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,940
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going by what your indications.

356
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:43,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's fine.

357
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:48,783
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the office and we've been sort of going through some training to understand how we define that.

358
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's been the common standard that if it's occupiable,

359
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,710
[SPEAKER_08]: which includes all kinds of stuff.

360
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:00,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Habitable, technically, in the codes and stuff is defined as not including bathroom and storage.

361
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So we look at it as occupiable.

362
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:09,540
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can walk into it to do something, it's generally considered needing to have its proper ceiling heights, and it's counted in the footages.

363
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:20,588
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I would like to, you know, if this is, if there are other things from your board, you know, comments,

364
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:23,797
[SPEAKER_01]: How did they feel about the project?

365
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:29,199
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's anything else that we need to change while we go back to the drawing board, please let us know.

366
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:38,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I just want to make sure that my client and also my architect hears everybody's feedback before we adjourn our case.

367
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:40,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that makes sense.

368
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:45,363
[SPEAKER_09]: To that point, I would be inclined to open

369
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:52,706
[SPEAKER_09]: public comment before we continue so you can get that feedback as well.

370
00:31:53,266 --> 00:32:00,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll reopen it, assuming we do continue, I'll reopen it in the next session of the hearing.

371
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:10,876
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I just want to make sure we don't inadvertently, to your point, hold back feedback that's helpful for you to have.

372
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:12,497
[SPEAKER_09]: So does that sound reasonable?

373
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:13,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.

374
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

375
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:30,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay great well so then before I open it for public comment any directional like asks or suggestions from the board we're not deliberating but maybe you know yeah go ahead Andre.

376
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:32,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

377
00:32:33,258 --> 00:32:40,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we're not a design review board, but you might want to just consider trying to.

378
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:48,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Make the property a little bit more contextual with the rest of the properties, the 2 families in the neighborhood.

379
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:53,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's a significantly different kind of a building you're proposing here.

380
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:53,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

381
00:32:56,463 --> 00:33:06,350
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not to tell you one way or the other, but it would make it, I think, a lot more acceptable to the neighborhood if it fit in a little better.

382
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, understood.

383
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:11,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Andre.

384
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:13,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts from the board?

385
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:15,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Chris.

386
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:19,138
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, Mr. Chair, just asking about the

387
00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:36,263
[SPEAKER_10]: that the zoning requires, I can't recall what the percentage is.

388
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:39,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the building commissioner know off the top of his head?

389
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:41,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this going to?

390
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:54,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the percentage is, but I know if you increase the impervious area with a project by more than 200 square feet, engineering will push you into stormwater plan.

391
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:02,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So clearly, what was there versus what's going to be there clearly appears to exceed 200 square feet.

392
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:03,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

393
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:10,321
[SPEAKER_10]: And so a lot of these, I think, well, we're just dealing with this case.

394
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:16,066
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that that may be an area you want to explore.

395
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:21,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how much of that the building department

396
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:28,337
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get some guidance on that.

397
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:41,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, so to that point, it's unclear to me if the proposed driveway here is pervious or impervious.

398
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:45,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there a material indicated on the plan?

399
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't really tell.

400
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,051
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not, Mr. Chair.

401
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:54,111
[SPEAKER_01]: If the board so chooses to want it to be permeable, it will be permeable.

402
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,332
[SPEAKER_09]: It's required.

403
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:56,333
[SPEAKER_01]: It's required in zoning.

404
00:34:56,353 --> 00:34:57,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

405
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:58,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It's required in zoning.

406
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:08,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so just because it's required, and since we're updating the plans anyway, I think just making it clear.

407
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, all the other surfaces, too, if need be.

408
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:21,841
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is something that is very interesting, interested for the board, we will make sure to bring that forward in the next plan as well.

409
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:25,425
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a small stormwater management plan as well.

410
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:34,478
[SPEAKER_08]: If I might interject again, the engineering department in the review of this application did note that a stormwater permit will be required.

411
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:41,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So you will be preparing a stormwater plan engineered version for that department to review and approve.

412
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:42,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.

413
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:46,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, we, you know, no time like the present to get started.

414
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:50,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can also get that to you if the board would like to see that.

415
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:51,864
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, that's great.

416
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:53,245
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought I would offer it up.

417
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:57,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Josh Triplett, City of Boulder, Clerk & City of Santa Cruz, Applicant Overview, City of Boulder

418
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,313
[SPEAKER_09]: for our approval, you're required to do it anyway.

419
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:27,090
[SPEAKER_09]: My thought is just, since you know today that you will need one, if any plan updates you make, if you could just reflect

420
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,121
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the choices that will be required to comply.

421
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:41,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So that likely means some decision in terms of, you know, pervious surfaces.

422
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:45,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it could be an asphalt driveway without some other strategy.

423
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:54,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you could just, since you're updating the plans anyway, reflect that on the plan, it would just make things a bit more tangible for the board.

424
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:55,225
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

425
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:56,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.

426
00:36:58,993 --> 00:37:01,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Other feedback from the board?

427
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:27,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll just say for planning purposes, the thing that I'm going to be considering in deliberations, so in a GR district, there's a higher lot area requirement for

428
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:39,646
[SPEAKER_09]: two-unit versus a one-unit residence, and so this lot is smaller than the requirement for a one-unit.

429
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:51,009
[SPEAKER_09]: It is in a district where there's lots of similarly sized lots that are two-family, so it wouldn't be unique in that respect.

430
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:56,970
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, it's maybe unique in that it's one of the few lots that single-family

431
00:37:58,655 --> 00:37:59,276
[SPEAKER_09]: in the area.

432
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:03,620
[SPEAKER_09]: But then there's also this relationship to the even side of 2nd Street.

433
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:13,450
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is this pocket of single families, and you're proposing to change which street the property is fronting.

434
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:20,937
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're basically turning the side of the property to 2nd Street and across from this single-family row.

435
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:47,683
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm not speaking to how that's going to affect my deliberation, but just I think to the earlier point, if you can do things in the design to ensure that, you know, architecturally it fits within that second street pocket, I think, you know, that would be an easier path for the board

436
00:38:48,822 --> 00:39:10,332
[SPEAKER_09]: um you know to to find no substantial detriment and that might also alleviate some of the butter across the streets concerns thank you for that feedback mr chair all right well i'm not seeing anyone else from the board um who wants to speak at this time so like we discussed i will

437
00:39:11,337 --> 00:39:14,060
[SPEAKER_09]: open it up to public comment.

438
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:26,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Just members of the public, a reminder, the intention here is to continue this case because the applicant wants to update their plans, but we do want to get your feedback.

439
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:31,907
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you're a member of the public who would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

440
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:33,968
[SPEAKER_09]: You can raise your hand on Zoom.

441
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,850
[SPEAKER_09]: You can turn on your camera and raise your hand.

442
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:41,354
[SPEAKER_09]: You can type in the chat or you can email Dennis, dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

443
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,430
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

444
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

445
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:08,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did get the letter from the abutter, which the applicant has.

446
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:18,729
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, with that being said, any other topics we should discuss before the board votes to continue this matter?

447
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:35,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Attorney Edmondson-Crum, so is it all right if we continue to our next regular meeting?

448
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:37,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Mr. Chair.

449
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:37,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

450
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:42,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to the next regular meeting of the board.

451
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:46,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Which for the record will be August 28th.

452
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:52,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to continue this matter to August 28th.

453
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:53,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second?

454
00:40:57,031 --> 00:40:58,752
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

455
00:40:59,352 --> 00:40:59,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

456
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:00,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

457
00:41:01,373 --> 00:41:01,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

458
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:03,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

459
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:04,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

460
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:05,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

461
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:06,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, aye.

462
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:09,838
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, this matter is continued to next month.

463
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:10,819
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you then.

464
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:11,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, folks.

465
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:16,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you, Mr. Chair, and through you to your members for your feedback and everything.

466
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:17,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

467
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:24,367
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Dennis, what's up next?

468
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:40,776
[SPEAKER_06]: 125 Monument Street, applicant and owner is Dana Kovacs and Alyssa Marshall to add a third floor at 125 Monument Street, which is an existing non-conforming structure in John Religions Zoning District, which is not allowed for the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance.

469
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:46,617
[SPEAKER_06]: This will also extend the existing non-conforming side yard setback requiring a special permit for the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance.

470
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:48,677
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, great.

471
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:51,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I see we have the applicant present.

472
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:52,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello and welcome.

473
00:41:52,898 --> 00:41:53,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, hi.

474
00:41:54,118 --> 00:41:55,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Oliver Klein.

475
00:41:55,198 --> 00:41:58,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening to the board.

476
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for this opportunity to present to you this evening.

477
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:07,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I share slides?

478
00:42:08,387 --> 00:42:09,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on one second.

479
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:10,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm giving you access now.

480
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

481
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:21,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is that share button?

482
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:22,337
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

483
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone seeing that OK?

484
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

485
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:37,061
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

486
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:40,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks again.

487
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:44,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, grateful for this opportunity to present this case to you this evening.

488
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:46,603
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Oliver Klein.

489
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:53,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a registered architect with New England Design and Construction, also known as NEDC.

490
00:42:55,926 --> 00:43:00,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're representing Dana Kovacs and Elisa Marshall at 125 Monuments Street.

491
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and Elisa, I believe, are still on this call.

492
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:15,702
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been residents of this community for almost 15 years, and I think they intend to stay here for a very long time if they can.

493
00:43:16,982 --> 00:43:30,745
[SPEAKER_03]: With their two young boys outgrowing their shared bedroom, they came to NEDC for help, adding a third bedroom and a second bathroom to their house.

494
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:32,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, the house only has one bathroom.

495
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:34,109
[SPEAKER_03]: that all of them share.

496
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:45,494
[SPEAKER_03]: After much consideration, they've decided to build upward to add living space with roof dormers to the existing finished attic.

497
00:43:47,215 --> 00:44:00,701
[SPEAKER_03]: They feel that maintaining the current footprint will be the best outcome for their family and have the least detrimental impact on the property and on their finances.

498
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:23,107
[SPEAKER_03]: To that end, on behalf of the Kovacs Marshall family, I'm here again to seek zoning relief in the form of a variance to add that third story, as well as the special permit to extend the existing nonconformity at the side setback.

499
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:40,994
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeking the variance because it's a relatively small added area, but that small area really transforms the third story interior spaces for the clients.

500
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:55,166
[SPEAKER_03]: The second floor is, you can see on the right here, actually that's not the proposed second floor, it is the existing second floor, or the same footprint as the existing second floor.

501
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's only 524 square feet.

502
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the half story limit for the story above, which is the third story, comes to only 262 square feet.

503
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:18,730
[SPEAKER_03]: A modest 72 square foot increase to 334 square feet, as is shown here by this boundary, gives the bedroom and bathroom areas a significant value add.

504
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:23,912
[SPEAKER_03]: The variance proposal exceeds the half story limit by only about 25%.

505
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:34,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, this allows for a real transformation of the space from very tight quarters to a more comfortable, livable space.

506
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:41,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the space that Dana and Alisa want for their quality of life.

507
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:54,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Note that portions of the third-floor space at the gable ends that are not under the new dormers, and though they have head height,

508
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:59,581
[SPEAKER_03]: that is less than seven feet per the Medford building department.

509
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:01,822
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still counting these areas as part of the total.

510
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:17,755
[SPEAKER_03]: About half of that 70 square foot increase that we're proposing is taken up by circulation, 35 square feet of that for the stair and the landing.

511
00:46:18,595 --> 00:46:24,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

512
00:46:25,523 --> 00:46:30,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and this, of course, is a new code compliance stair.

513
00:46:31,286 --> 00:46:37,030
[SPEAKER_03]: The existing stair was actually, as you can see, crammed into a very narrow place here.

514
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very steep, very dangerous.

515
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:47,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And trying to expand the stair in that location would have been too disruptive to the bedrooms.

516
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:54,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only place to put that stair was on the outside, stacked above the existing stair from the first to the second floor.

517
00:46:57,686 --> 00:47:03,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The stairs therefore shape the low pitch shed dormer on the north side of the structure.

518
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:11,075
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see here what we're proposing in terms of the elevations you see here.

519
00:47:11,115 --> 00:47:24,465
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the stair-side dormer with the shallow roof pitch, but it's offset from the gable ends.

520
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:27,428
[SPEAKER_03]: both the front and the back.

521
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:38,557
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other side, on the bedroom side, opposite the stairs, we have included a proposal for a Nantucket dormer.

522
00:47:39,678 --> 00:47:53,169
[SPEAKER_03]: This combination of gable and shed dormers really adds visual interest while aiming to satisfy the unwritten intent of the zoning code to avoid boxiness at the roof line.

523
00:47:55,692 --> 00:48:04,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So while the dormers have some impact on the roof line from certain angles, the design preserves the street views.

524
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:08,516
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

525
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:18,018
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as possible, given the interior stair conditions and the roof ridge height is unchanged.

526
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see here some renderings from various vantage points along

527
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:36,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Arlington Street and Monument Street that shows the really minimal impact on the street views from most locations along the street.

528
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:53,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Dana and Lisa reached out to their neighbors and put together a webpage that they then shared with all their butters and neighbors within

529
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:54,753
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, 300 feet.

530
00:48:54,773 --> 00:49:08,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and they got overwhelming support for this proposal and for the aesthetics and the, uh, the dormers, uh, including from the direct butters.

531
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:22,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so again, sampling of some of the messages that they received and summary, uh, we're, we're seeking this zoning relief to allow the Kovacs Marshall family to make a reasonable expansion

532
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:32,018
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, we feel it'd be a reasonable expansion of their home on the third floor, uh, while preserving the character of the neighborhood.

533
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:40,883
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that this addition, uh, that we're proposing aligns with the spirit of the zoning ordinance and, and compliments the existing structure.

534
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:49,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one clarifying question.

535
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:56,201
[SPEAKER_09]: So the abutter in support, that's the abutter on the side with the larger of the two dormers?

536
00:49:56,521 --> 00:50:04,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, so we have support from both abutters, both neighbors on either side of us, as well as two neighbors across the street.

537
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:10,670
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two houses down from our house on both sides also have sent emails of support.

538
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

539
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:14,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can forward all of those.

540
00:50:14,506 --> 00:50:20,668
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them forward them to me at first because I didn't know where they should go, but we can forward all of those emails to you as well.

541
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:22,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

542
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:22,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

543
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:24,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you very much.

544
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:25,570
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Elisa.

545
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:25,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

546
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for receiving us here today.

547
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:29,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Dana.

548
00:50:30,552 --> 00:50:32,412
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

549
00:50:32,492 --> 00:50:34,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have questions from the board so far?

550
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:47,643
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, this Mary, so the photo that we saw before is the proposed extension after the extension, right?

551
00:50:48,603 --> 00:50:49,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's correct.

552
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:50,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

553
00:50:50,604 --> 00:50:50,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

554
00:50:53,944 --> 00:51:08,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, these, these are, uh, computer renderings of, of the proposal and you can see here in this photo, uh, the, uh, Nantucket dormer on the South side and, uh, here, the,

555
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:22,297
[SPEAKER_03]: The stair dormer needs to be all the way to the wall and also shallow to maintain the seven foot required ceiling height all the way to the stair landing.

556
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:26,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will be on both sides.

557
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:30,109
[SPEAKER_03]: There'd be a dormer on both sides.

558
00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:31,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

559
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:52,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're seeing, uh, on this again, uh, I could go back to, uh, this, uh, the elevations, which don't sell a full story, but they do show that yes, there's dormers on both sides, uh, in order to, uh, provide enough, uh, enough space, uh, for, for the,

560
00:51:53,575 --> 00:51:58,459
[SPEAKER_03]: a new bedroom and new bathroom up there, as well as the stair going out on the side there.

561
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:08,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

562
00:52:08,107 --> 00:52:11,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

563
00:52:17,865 --> 00:52:22,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw it in your application, but I don't think you presented on it yet.

564
00:52:22,468 --> 00:52:26,890
[SPEAKER_09]: So the lot itself is somewhat unusual.

565
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,951
[SPEAKER_09]: So can we maybe talk through that together?

566
00:52:30,052 --> 00:52:30,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

567
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:46,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a... I can also bring up the ZVA plan set, but I think this might show enough detail what we're talking about.

568
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:47,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

569
00:52:49,569 --> 00:53:02,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see here quite an elongated lot, quite narrow to begin with, and it narrows to just a few feet at the southern end there.

570
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:12,134
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the back of the house, between the side setbacks, it narrows to just about 22 feet.

571
00:53:17,712 --> 00:53:19,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

572
00:53:20,254 --> 00:53:31,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the rooms adjoining that the back end of the house there are the kitchen, which has a slider opening up to the backyard where there's currently a deck.

573
00:53:31,964 --> 00:53:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also a window from the dining room opening up to that backyard.

574
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:45,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, these windows are taking advantage of the south facing exposure.

575
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:49,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

576
00:53:49,332 --> 00:53:52,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

577
00:53:55,977 --> 00:54:00,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Not seeing any, so we can go ahead and open it up to public comment.

578
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:05,403
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a member of the public who'd like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

579
00:54:05,423 --> 00:54:09,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

580
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,107
[SPEAKER_09]: You can type in the chat or you can email Dennis.

581
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:29,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

582
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:33,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

583
00:54:33,428 --> 00:54:42,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of the abutters already responded, so it would be great to get that sent to Dennis so he can put it in the folder.

584
00:54:42,253 --> 00:54:52,320
[SPEAKER_09]: But seeing no additional comments from members of the public, chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberations.

585
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion?

586
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:57,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded.

587
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:00,604
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll take a roll call.

588
00:55:00,784 --> 00:55:01,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

589
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:02,044
Aye.

590
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:03,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

591
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:04,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

592
00:55:04,946 --> 00:55:05,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Gary?

593
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:06,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

594
00:55:06,987 --> 00:55:07,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

595
00:55:07,968 --> 00:55:08,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

596
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:11,070
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so the board is now deliberating.

597
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,611
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, folks?

598
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:15,312
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, Mr. Chair,

599
00:55:21,037 --> 00:55:27,579
[SPEAKER_10]: The deck in the back is new, or is that existing?

600
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an existing deck.

601
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:30,720
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

602
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:34,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the age of it.

603
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:38,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought the house 15 years ago, and the house came with the deck.

604
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:39,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is at least 15 years old.

605
00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:44,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was built in 1984, if I remember correctly, from the previous owner.

606
00:55:46,446 --> 00:55:46,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

607
00:55:46,866 --> 00:55:48,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to know if it was part of the project.

608
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:48,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

609
00:55:51,949 --> 00:56:00,599
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so what do you think, folks?

610
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:05,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you jump, get off the shirts room so everyone can sort of see each other?

611
00:56:06,306 --> 00:56:06,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

612
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:06,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

613
00:56:08,568 --> 00:56:09,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre, go ahead.

614
00:56:10,965 --> 00:56:12,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mike.

615
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:17,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that this is a very sensitively done plan.

616
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:19,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate the design.

617
00:56:19,955 --> 00:56:26,924
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not expanding the footprint of an existing building anyway, so it's really minimizing the impact on their neighbors.

618
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:28,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's

619
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:35,475
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a very well designed and proposed project.

620
00:56:35,615 --> 00:56:43,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think this is this is exactly in keeping with the kind of zoning changes that, uh, and projects that the city is trying to encourage.

621
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think incremental.

622
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,631
[SPEAKER_02]: growth like this is very helpful.

623
00:56:49,891 --> 00:57:02,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in terms of the variance, it makes much more sense to do this on the third floor because of the shape of the lot than in any other location, which would have much more impact on the abutters.

624
00:57:04,617 --> 00:57:05,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Andre.

625
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:06,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts from the board?

626
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:14,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would like to agree with that sentiment, although I do have a question for the building commissioner.

627
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:23,103
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a GR district, is it?

628
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:24,004
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.

629
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:40,918
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the same questions that we just were discussing for the prior application on the third floor, this is considered a third floor now because it's beyond the 50%

630
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:45,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's more than 50% of the areas above seven feet.

631
00:57:46,241 --> 00:58:00,853
[SPEAKER_08]: We went round and round with this particular project and ultimately said, you know, if you're going to go before the board for a special permit for the other stuff, you might as well ask for what you want and call it what it is, a third floor and ask for permission for it.

632
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:02,754
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, similar arguments.

633
00:58:04,055 --> 00:58:04,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

634
00:58:04,656 --> 00:58:04,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

635
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:05,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to clarify.

636
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:07,518
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have an objection to that.

637
00:58:07,578 --> 00:58:12,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just wondering vis-a-vis our prior discussion.

638
00:58:16,183 --> 00:58:16,583
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

639
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:24,226
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I would just say about that that for me makes it a little bit different is that the other project is not using the original footprint of the house.

640
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:26,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So and it's using dormers.

641
00:58:26,187 --> 00:58:27,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not going up.

642
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:29,909
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like building a full third story.

643
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:35,351
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just putting some dormers on to, you know, what's already there.

644
00:58:41,714 --> 00:58:41,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

645
00:58:42,454 --> 00:58:44,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts.

646
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary, anything you'd like to add?

647
00:58:52,516 --> 00:58:56,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I tend to agree with all the sentiments expressed.

648
00:58:56,918 --> 00:58:59,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's a nice proposal.

649
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,381
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, yeah, I'll share my thoughts.

650
00:59:02,701 --> 00:59:08,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a little worried about this stair dormer, but the butter seems fine with it.

651
00:59:09,105 --> 00:59:15,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly the shape and position of the existing structure and the

652
00:59:16,176 --> 00:59:19,197
[SPEAKER_09]: shape of the lot impose a lot of constraints.

653
00:59:19,317 --> 00:59:29,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think if you change the height of the roof, it wouldn't blend in as well with the neighboring properties.

654
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So that limits what's possible.

655
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I do agree.

656
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:39,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this case, the narrow shape of the lot led to a narrow shape of the structure.

657
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:45,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's pretty limiting in terms of what you could do with a half story.

658
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I tend to agree.

659
00:59:48,960 --> 01:00:01,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing any substantial detriment from allowing that space to go beyond the 50%, especially with the neighbors supporting.

660
01:00:02,705 --> 01:00:05,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, overall, I think this

661
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:14,512
[SPEAKER_09]: meets the no substantial detriment standard for the special permit to extend the existing nonconformity.

662
01:00:14,592 --> 01:00:23,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think it meets the unusual shape standard for the variance.

663
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:26,521
[SPEAKER_09]: So no concerns on my side.

664
01:00:30,304 --> 01:00:31,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts from the board?

665
01:00:35,624 --> 01:00:38,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Chair awaits a motion on this matter.

666
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:46,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve the special permit and variance for 125 Monument Street.

667
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:48,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second?

668
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:50,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

669
01:00:50,456 --> 01:00:53,978
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll take a roll call.

670
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:54,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

671
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:56,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

672
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:57,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

673
01:00:58,702 --> 01:00:58,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

674
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:00,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

675
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:00,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

676
01:01:01,844 --> 01:01:02,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

677
01:01:02,465 --> 01:01:02,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

678
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:06,388
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so the special permit and the variance are approved.

679
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:08,630
[SPEAKER_09]: You have your third story.

680
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:11,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you ever so much.

681
01:01:11,354 --> 01:01:11,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

682
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:13,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

683
01:01:13,595 --> 01:01:14,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to the board.

684
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to the board, yes.

685
01:01:16,656 --> 01:01:19,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to give you a sort of heads up on what's the next step.

686
01:01:19,978 --> 01:01:22,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happens is that I'll be writing up the decision.

687
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:27,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily for you, we've had a number of similar type projects.

688
01:01:27,242 --> 01:01:30,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have kind of a boilerplate sort of thing to work off of.

689
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:35,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to write that up, and then it'll still get checked by legal counsel.

690
01:01:35,187 --> 01:01:39,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Once they come back and say everything's Jake, then I send it up for signatures to the board.

691
01:01:39,849 --> 01:01:43,430
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point, once we get the signatures, I file it in the clerk's office.

692
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that point, starts the 20 days appeals period from there.

693
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:54,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be a little while before the decision is done and then filed.

694
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:56,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once it's filed, I'll let you all know that it's done.

695
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:57,354
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get a copy.

696
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,635
[SPEAKER_06]: That 20 days, if there's no appeals,

697
01:02:01,978 --> 01:02:07,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you can basically then, then you have to come into city hall and get a letter from the clerk's office saying there were no appeals.

698
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that letter and the decision to the registry, file it, and then you come back and you get your permit.

699
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:19,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I'll walk you through all that beforehand and Scott, you can jump in if I misrepresented anything.

700
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:27,923
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I do want to suggest that you go ahead and file the building permit meanwhile, so it can begin to go through its review.

701
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:32,525
[SPEAKER_08]: All I, I'm not, this doesn't forbid me from looking at it.

702
01:02:33,066 --> 01:02:36,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It only prevents me from issuing an actual permit.

703
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:47,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we're going through these two processes concurrently, when you get to the end of your appeal period, you should be in a position to get a building permit very immediately, but do both at the same time.

704
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:50,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the advice.

705
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:50,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

706
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:51,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

707
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:52,355
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

708
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:52,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

709
01:02:52,995 --> 01:02:53,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.

710
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:54,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night.

711
01:02:55,217 --> 01:02:56,879
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

712
01:02:57,499 --> 01:02:59,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, what's next?

713
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:00,642
[SPEAKER_06]: 268 Gaston Street.

714
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:13,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Applicant in order, Stephen Skyer, to install an addition at 268 Gaston Street within the side yard setback, extending the existing side yard setback nonconformity, which is not allowed per the City of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 table of initial requirements.

715
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:15,353
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

716
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:16,855
[SPEAKER_09]: I see we have Stephen Skyer here.

717
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:17,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

718
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:20,531
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

719
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:21,591
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Steve Sherry.

720
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:26,335
[SPEAKER_11]: What was that?

721
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:28,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I mispronounced your name.

722
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies.

723
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:30,879
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's okay.

724
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:33,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it a lot.

725
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:42,568
[SPEAKER_11]: The existing house, it's a one-story, it's a cave style with two bedrooms upstairs and eaves as storage spaces for now.

726
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:44,169
[SPEAKER_11]: The house was built in 1953.

727
01:03:46,983 --> 01:03:49,404
[SPEAKER_11]: My grandfather is the one that actually built the house.

728
01:03:50,165 --> 01:03:58,409
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in 2018, I had purchased it, uh, purchased the house and now me and my wife live here, um, for the past two years.

729
01:03:58,429 --> 01:04:10,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we are looking to hear off the roof, um, the two bedrooms and go straight up and make three bedrooms, um, and a bathroom, um, and a dropdown attic.

730
01:04:10,796 --> 01:04:12,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can share the screen.

731
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:15,429
[SPEAKER_11]: and show you guys the plans.

732
01:04:15,529 --> 01:04:18,612
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going with SL House Architect.

733
01:04:19,893 --> 01:04:24,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you guys might, I know they did a lot of jobs in Medford before.

734
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:30,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you able to see the screen?

735
01:04:30,904 --> 01:04:31,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

736
01:04:31,364 --> 01:04:31,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

737
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:32,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

738
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:38,592
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just a overall look at what the house looks from the outside now.

739
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:44,195
[SPEAKER_11]: This upper right-hand side, you go scroll down.

740
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:47,296
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the existing first floor.

741
01:04:47,977 --> 01:04:56,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Walk in, you have your living room, a bedroom that's labeled office, but then you have your kitchen, dining room, all combined in one bathroom.

742
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:06,063
[SPEAKER_11]: existing right now and then upstairs you have the two bedrooms and then your eaves and a small little like a linen closet.

743
01:05:06,984 --> 01:05:17,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we're trying to do or trying to build is the three bedrooms, an additional bathroom upstairs with a walk-in closet.

744
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:24,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Closets obviously for all three bedrooms and it'll be a drop-down attic.

745
01:05:25,009 --> 01:05:26,670
[SPEAKER_11]: We aren't building out left or right.

746
01:05:27,862 --> 01:05:30,903
[SPEAKER_11]: or towards the street or back, we're just going straight up.

747
01:05:32,144 --> 01:05:38,306
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really most of the project.

748
01:05:38,826 --> 01:05:40,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not too detailed.

749
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:44,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a plot plan if you guys want me to pull that up.

750
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:47,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

751
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:51,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would just help us understand on conformity.

752
01:05:56,418 --> 01:06:00,059
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the non-conformity was that seven feet on my left-hand side.

753
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:00,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

754
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:10,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you going to pull up the plot plan?

755
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:11,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

756
01:06:11,602 --> 01:06:12,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you see it?

757
01:06:15,444 --> 01:06:18,604
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it hasn't switched over from the other, from the architecture.

758
01:06:18,685 --> 01:06:18,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

759
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:37,710
[SPEAKER_11]: That work?

760
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, now we see it.

761
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,991
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that left-hand side, that's seven feet.

762
01:06:44,511 --> 01:06:48,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a walkway on my left-hand side that just goes to the backyard.

763
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:53,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys had mentioned like the deck in that last proposal.

764
01:06:54,033 --> 01:07:00,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing's being changed for the deck and like a bulkhead that we have in the backyard.

765
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:03,895
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the existing foundation that we're going over.

766
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, got it.

767
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:18,908
[SPEAKER_09]: So the requirements seven and a half foot, and then the building is a little bit rotated.

768
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And so at the shortest point, it's seven foot.

769
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:22,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

770
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it goes from seven nine down to seven feet.

771
01:07:24,994 --> 01:07:27,896
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that the conformity is seven and a half.

772
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:29,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

773
01:07:30,919 --> 01:07:32,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Questions from the board?

774
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:47,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a special permit situation to extend the existing non-conformities, is that right?

775
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:48,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's right.

776
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:48,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

777
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:49,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

778
01:07:50,106 --> 01:07:52,327
[SPEAKER_09]: The standard's no substantial detriment.

779
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

780
01:07:53,788 --> 01:07:54,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

781
01:07:57,329 --> 01:07:58,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

782
01:07:58,469 --> 01:08:05,692
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, seeing none.

783
01:08:05,812 --> 01:08:07,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I had one, Mr. Chair.

784
01:08:07,312 --> 01:08:08,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, go ahead.

785
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:08,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

786
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:16,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Just what is the proposed height to the top of the gable?

787
01:08:18,454 --> 01:08:19,574
[SPEAKER_10]: I can bring that up.

788
01:08:30,381 --> 01:08:31,082
[SPEAKER_10]: You see that there?

789
01:08:31,362 --> 01:08:32,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it switched screens there.

790
01:08:33,263 --> 01:08:33,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

791
01:08:33,884 --> 01:08:34,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I see it.

792
01:08:34,324 --> 01:08:35,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's not that tall.

793
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:35,225
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

794
01:08:40,834 --> 01:08:41,775
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

795
01:08:41,835 --> 01:08:47,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's eight, just under nine foot ceilings that we're adding on the second floor.

796
01:08:52,103 --> 01:08:52,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

797
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:54,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

798
01:08:54,485 --> 01:08:59,749
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

799
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not see any, so I'm going to open it up to public comment.

800
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:06,575
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

801
01:09:07,135 --> 01:09:10,038
[SPEAKER_09]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

802
01:09:11,027 --> 01:09:12,789
[SPEAKER_09]: type in the chat or you can email Dennis.

803
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:27,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

804
01:09:29,223 --> 01:09:34,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberations.

805
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So moved.

806
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:38,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion.

807
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:40,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second?

808
01:09:42,142 --> 01:09:42,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

809
01:09:43,523 --> 01:09:44,743
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

810
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:45,984
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take a roll call.

811
01:09:46,484 --> 01:09:46,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

812
01:09:47,805 --> 01:09:47,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

813
01:09:48,645 --> 01:09:49,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

814
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:49,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

815
01:09:50,446 --> 01:09:50,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Gary?

816
01:09:51,486 --> 01:09:51,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

817
01:09:52,327 --> 01:09:52,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

818
01:09:53,047 --> 01:09:53,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

819
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:54,708
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're deliberating.

820
01:09:54,728 --> 01:09:55,468
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, folks?

821
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:01,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Andre.

822
01:10:02,655 --> 01:10:03,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mike.

823
01:10:03,315 --> 01:10:15,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is, uh, I think another situation where, uh, we're using it's the existing footprint, you know, or accommodating, uh, growing young family able to stay in the city.

824
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:25,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's, I think not out of context with other properties in the area, it's, uh, not higher than what is required.

825
01:10:25,743 --> 01:10:31,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I don't see any detriment at all to the project.

826
01:10:34,251 --> 01:10:35,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, other thoughts from the board?

827
01:10:38,172 --> 01:10:40,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I like this design as well.

828
01:10:41,192 --> 01:10:50,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not so much the design as the fact that the owner and architect have worked within the parameters.

829
01:10:50,994 --> 01:11:01,276
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're just raising the gable to a point where it's not even actually close to what the limit, I guess, is in that area.

830
01:11:05,893 --> 01:11:07,114
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good project to me.

831
01:11:09,616 --> 01:11:09,896
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

832
01:11:10,356 --> 01:11:10,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Other thoughts?

833
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:19,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would tend to agree with what everyone else already said on this project.

834
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:21,145
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

835
01:11:21,165 --> 01:11:22,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree.

836
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:25,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So the existing nonconformity itself is de minimis.

837
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:29,472
[SPEAKER_09]: It's six inches from this being a bi-rate project.

838
01:11:29,592 --> 01:11:31,354
[SPEAKER_09]: The project itself looks nice.

839
01:11:31,514 --> 01:11:33,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It fits with the neighborhood.

840
01:11:34,587 --> 01:11:38,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not seeing any substantial detriment here.

841
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:41,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this makes sense to me as well.

842
01:11:43,774 --> 01:11:44,074
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

843
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:47,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair awaits a motion on the special permit.

844
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:53,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve the special permit for 268 Gaston Street.

845
01:11:53,882 --> 01:11:54,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

846
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:54,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

847
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,621
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

848
01:12:04,121 --> 01:12:04,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

849
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:08,204
Aye.

850
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:09,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

851
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:10,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

852
01:12:10,825 --> 01:12:11,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

853
01:12:12,846 --> 01:12:12,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

854
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:14,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

855
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:14,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

856
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:16,909
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, the special permit is approved.

857
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:19,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

858
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:21,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a quick question.

859
01:12:23,983 --> 01:12:24,964
[SPEAKER_11]: for the building department.

860
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:39,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that I had submitted and applied for a special permit already along with original or just a building permit as well.

861
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:52,389
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I already I know I had reached out to some other officials through city hall that had made me apply for like a dumpster and sanitation unit and all that stuff.

862
01:12:52,729 --> 01:13:00,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm kind of moving along quickly here just because as I'm trying to, we're trying to.

863
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:09,919
[SPEAKER_11]: we're trying to get going or just try to do it as quickly as possible before winter, but I know it does take some time and there's a process that needs to be followed.

864
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:28,048
[SPEAKER_11]: As a homeowner, is there a way that I could get a demo permit and start as soon as I can while I wait for this to be all approved and actually have a permit in hand, or I'm just trying to

865
01:13:29,728 --> 01:13:31,250
[SPEAKER_11]: get ideas from you guys.

866
01:13:33,672 --> 01:13:37,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a conversation we have to have with the inspector who's reviewing it.

867
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:42,260
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest challenge to that might be the historical commission.

868
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,583
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if they've reached out to you on your building permit application.

869
01:13:46,544 --> 01:13:52,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they, I'll confirm, but I think I got an email like two days ago saying that was approved.

870
01:13:53,215 --> 01:13:53,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

871
01:13:53,956 --> 01:14:01,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, come in and have a conversation with the inspector who's reviewing your application and work something out with him.

872
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:02,784
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a possibility.

873
01:14:02,804 --> 01:14:05,867
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as we're on the same page about how we're doing it.

874
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:07,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

875
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:10,351
[SPEAKER_11]: And how do I find out what, who that inspector is?

876
01:14:11,332 --> 01:14:14,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Just come into the office and we'll pull it up on a machine.

877
01:14:14,174 --> 01:14:14,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It should tell you.

878
01:14:15,596 --> 01:14:15,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

879
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:21,776
[SPEAKER_11]: That's yeah, it's the only question I got.

880
01:14:21,796 --> 01:14:28,761
[SPEAKER_09]: So you still want to just walk through the steps that are that have to happen.

881
01:14:28,861 --> 01:14:29,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.

882
01:14:29,982 --> 01:14:34,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So Steven, so sort of just to reiterate what I just sort of said before, I'm going to write the decision.

883
01:14:34,986 --> 01:14:44,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily for you, we had a basically the exact same case come up on another property that literally involved the side yard setback with the construction.

884
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:45,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um,

885
01:14:47,103 --> 01:14:50,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically existing and not performing so I can I can do that pretty quickly.

886
01:14:50,847 --> 01:14:59,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the turnaround from the legal counsel is for special permits are usually a much quicker because the threshold for granting them is much simpler, basically.

887
01:15:00,015 --> 01:15:02,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So they usually turn those on pretty quick.

888
01:15:02,137 --> 01:15:02,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

889
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:11,323
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm in tomorrow, I'm going to try to hopefully get yours done and out to them tomorrow or in the next, by Monday.

890
01:15:11,343 --> 01:15:13,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the turnaround from that, hopefully I can get it back.

891
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:21,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as I sort of said before, I get it in, it goes out for signatures, board's good about signing it off on pretty quickly.

892
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:25,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the minute that's done, I file it in the clerk's office and that starts the 20 days.

893
01:15:25,653 --> 01:15:27,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when that 20 days is over,

894
01:15:29,134 --> 01:15:36,577
[SPEAKER_06]: come in and get the letter of no appeal and then bring that back to the building department and you can get your permit.

895
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:43,360
[SPEAKER_06]: But as the building commissioner said earlier, I think you've actually already applied for your building permit, so it's already in the system.

896
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:50,623
[SPEAKER_06]: People can start reviewing it and basically once you get that letter in hand, if that's the last thing to go, you can get the building permit right then and there.

897
01:15:51,483 --> 01:15:53,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've been getting a bunch of emails.

898
01:15:55,356 --> 01:15:59,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Budget emails that it's going through the different departments for the firm itself.

899
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:08,865
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I just jumped on and realized that I also staff this conservation commission and given that this is nowhere near.

900
01:16:08,885 --> 01:16:12,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I can approve it right now.

901
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's another 1 done.

902
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:16,870
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, great.

903
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:17,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

904
01:16:18,211 --> 01:16:18,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

905
01:16:19,251 --> 01:16:19,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

906
01:16:19,892 --> 01:16:20,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.

907
01:16:21,586 --> 01:16:22,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

908
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Dennis.

909
01:16:23,269 --> 01:16:25,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So does that bring us to administrative updates?

910
01:16:25,954 --> 01:16:26,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It does indeed.

911
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:29,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did send out some meeting minutes for you all.

912
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:31,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, from the last meeting.

913
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:36,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so before we do the administrative updates first, right?

914
01:16:36,688 --> 01:16:38,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, sorry, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.

915
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:45,552
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I said before is that the mayor is finalizing the new members, so hopefully, not hopefully, we will.

916
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:50,213
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way I'm gonna basically go down there and make sure that we get that settled.

917
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:55,615
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the end of August, we will finally have the full complement of members.

918
01:16:56,235 --> 01:17:00,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And to sort of what I mentioned earlier about

919
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:03,996
[SPEAKER_06]: What I didn't want to say anything because I thought it would jinx us.

920
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:13,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I basically my thought was if everything went through tonight, we would not have a meeting in August because right now I think this is the only the continuation is the only case in the agenda for August.

921
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:16,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so right.

922
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess we do have an August meeting.

923
01:17:18,361 --> 01:17:19,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we do.

924
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:20,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't want to be.

925
01:17:20,382 --> 01:17:20,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

926
01:17:21,557 --> 01:17:22,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just continue batter.

927
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:30,683
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, um, but unless something comes in like tomorrow that I can, that's relatively straightforward that I could, you know, like a special permit or something like that.

928
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:37,968
[SPEAKER_06]: If something comes in that doesn't involve much looking into, you know, cause I have basically until basically right about now.

929
01:17:38,772 --> 01:17:40,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically another week.

930
01:17:40,134 --> 01:17:43,859
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically I have to, you know, for like legal ads would have to be in by the seventh.

931
01:17:43,879 --> 01:17:45,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically I have a week.

932
01:17:45,181 --> 01:17:49,767
[SPEAKER_06]: If nothing comes in, that's relatively straightforward that we can, that I can put on the agenda.

933
01:17:50,328 --> 01:17:51,009
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just be that.

934
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:51,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

935
01:17:53,745 --> 01:17:54,285
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

936
01:17:55,026 --> 01:17:57,788
[SPEAKER_09]: So meeting minutes, I did get a chance to review.

937
01:17:58,328 --> 01:18:00,069
[SPEAKER_09]: They looked good to me.

938
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:02,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make one minor amendment.

939
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris's last name is spelled wrong.

940
01:18:05,253 --> 01:18:05,553
[SPEAKER_09]: And one.

941
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, heck on toast.

942
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:09,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I guess I guess I should have looked at the minutes.

943
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:11,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sorry.

944
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:14,419
[SPEAKER_09]: How did how did others find the minutes?

945
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:17,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had one minor correction as well.

946
01:18:17,621 --> 01:18:25,506
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first matter for 121 2nd Street, it said the continuance was approved until July 21st, but that should be July 31st.

947
01:18:25,546 --> 01:18:29,328
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two typos there.

948
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:37,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Andre, otherwise, did you find it to be in order?

949
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:38,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

950
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see anything else.

951
01:18:40,631 --> 01:18:40,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

952
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:45,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've done two minor amendments.

953
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:51,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Would a member like to motion to approve the minutes for June?

954
01:18:56,417 --> 01:19:02,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, motion to approve the June ZBA meeting minutes.

955
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second?

956
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:05,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

957
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,085
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll take a roll call.

958
01:19:08,486 --> 01:19:08,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

959
01:19:09,646 --> 01:19:09,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

960
01:19:10,386 --> 01:19:10,786

961
01:19:11,986 --> 01:19:12,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

962
01:19:13,227 --> 01:19:13,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

963
01:19:13,627 --> 01:19:14,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

964
01:19:15,807 --> 01:19:16,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, aye.

965
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:18,828
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, meeting minutes are approved as amended.

966
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:23,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, and I think that brings us to the end of the meeting, right, Dennis?

967
01:19:24,549 --> 01:19:25,309
[SPEAKER_09]: It does indeed, yeah.

968
01:19:25,869 --> 01:19:29,470
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

969
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:31,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion.

970
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:33,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second?

971
01:19:33,711 --> 01:19:34,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded.

972
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:35,912
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll take a roll call.

973
01:19:36,032 --> 01:19:36,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

974
01:19:36,453 --> 01:19:36,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

975
01:19:38,354 --> 01:19:38,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

976
01:19:39,335 --> 01:19:39,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

977
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:40,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

978
01:19:40,857 --> 01:19:40,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

979
01:19:41,738 --> 01:19:41,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

980
01:19:42,418 --> 01:19:42,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

981
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:43,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We are adjourned.

982
01:19:44,861 --> 01:19:45,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, folks.

983
01:19:45,701 --> 01:19:46,622
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thanks, everybody.

984
01:19:46,642 --> 01:19:46,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
